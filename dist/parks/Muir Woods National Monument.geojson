It was formed by newspapermen, artists, actors and musicians in San Francisco in 1872. They were a group of guys with a different perspective than most, who liked flaunting it in each other's company. In September 1892, the club held their annual midsummer encampment in this part of the woods, perhaps a spiritual, forest frolic precursor to Burning Man.</p> <h3>The Selfie Tree</h3> <p>The fire scar in one of these trees is big enough to stand in, and is a favorite spot for selfies.</p>",

Consider quiet contemplation as you make your way through this part of the woods.</p> <h3>Dude, That's a Big Tree</h3> <p>Everyone knows redwood trees are awesome, but have you ever asked yourself what accounts for their quantifiable awesome-ness? Consider if you will, the following...<br /> <br /> For openers, coast redwoods (<em>Sequoia sempervirens</em>) can have a base width of 22 feet and grow to a height of 380 feet. They are the tallest living things on Earth! When they start out, they are just little guys. Redwood cones are less than an inch across, with seeds no bigger than a tomato's. Exactly why the redwoods grow so tall is a mystery. Theories continue to develop, but proof remains elusive.</p> <h3>I've Got All My Sisters with Me: Redwood Roots</h3> <p>Aside from logging, the most frequent cause of death for mature redwoods is windfall, because redwood roots only grow 10 to 13 feet below the ground. The roots spread outward 60 to 80 feet and interlace with those of their nearby tree friends. Individually, they are unable to support themselves, but together, they are strong enough to hold each other up.</p>",

        "notes": "Civilian Conservation Corp at Muir Woods\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/civilian-conservation-corp-at-muir-woods.htm\n\n<p>In the 1930s, the Great Depression loomed over America. In 1933, recently elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt created several new agencies, including the most successful, the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC). Across the country, this program employed tens of thousands of unemployed and unskilled young men from various backgrounds, including: the Junior Enrollees, (young men ages 18 - 26), Reservation Native Americans, local men with forestry experience, and over 25,000 older war veterans. By 1942, over 2.5 million men had served in the CCC. They planted millions of trees, fought forest fires, constructed trails and campground facilities, among many other things. Much of the CCC's work can still be seen throughout the US National Park system, including at Muir Woods National Monument.</p> <h3>How the CCC Reshaped Muir Woods</h3> <p>Muir Woods was designated a national monument in 1908. The public's interest in nature, and the growing availability of private automobiles, increased visitation to Muir Woods National Monument and Mount Tamalpais State Park. San Franciscans came in droves to hike, picnic, and to ride the Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railway. The railway was aptly nicknamed the \"Crookedest Railroad in the World\" because of its 281 curves in 8 miles of track. The rapid increase in visitors required better facilities, and quickly.<br /> <br /> In 1933, over 200 CCC men arrived at Mount Tamalpais State Park to work on improvements in the state park, at Muir Woods, and on the land belonging to the estate of William Kent. Through 1937, the CCC worked on many types of projects, such as fire protection and flood control, trail improvements, bridges, comfort stations, picnic facilities, and improved administration buildings.</p> <h3>Armoring Redwood Creek</h3> <p>The largest project that the CCC undertook at Muir Woods was providing erosion control on Redwood Creek. Redwood Creek meanders through Muir Woods' majestic redwood forest for 1.4 miles (2.3 km) and is prone to flooding, which damages and erodes the surrounding trees and trails. After extensive damage in 1925, William Kent advocated for use of creek \"revetments\" to armor the banks and prevent future flood damage.<br /> <br /> Revetments are structures made of rocks, stones or concrete, called \"riprap,\" that are installed along the stream banks to control the flow of the water and reduce erosion. They were constructed in places susceptible to erosion during storms. More recently, we've learned that using riprap to turn a stream into a straight channel makes the water flow faster, which makes erosion worse at some places. Streams need space to move and change over time. Fish need bends, pools, rocky areas, tree roots, and logs where they can shelter and feed.<br /> <br /> When you visit Muir Woods today, you can still see some of the CCC's riprap along the banks of Redwood Creek. However, the park is removing some sections of riprap and letting the creek return to its natural flow at places where the local endangered population of Coho salmon need it most.</p>",

This area, like much of Muir Woods, is home to many animal friends. Despite living in all areas of the woods, from the forest floor to high up in the canopy, most inhabitants are hard to spot, so keep your peepers peeled!</p> <h3>Looking High and Low</h3> <p>A lot of animals in Muir Woods are just little guys whom you might see along the ground or lower in the canopy. Some common woodland friends include banana slugs, Steller's jay, Echo blue butterflies, thrushes, rough-skinned newts, hummingbirds and the Sonoma chipmunk.<br /> <br /> <br /> But keep your eyes open for larger animal friends, too--Muir Woods is also home to black-tailed deer, bobcats, otters, skunks and raccoons.</p> <h3>Northern Spotted Owl at Muir Woods</h3> <p>Muir Woods lies within the southern portion of the northern spotted owl's range, a subspecies of the spotted owl. These owls reside in old-growth coniferous forests from Northern California to British Columbia and prey on small mammals. In Muir Woods, spotted owls primarily diet on dusky-footed woodrats, with other common prey such as brush rabbits, voles, pocket gophers and mice.<br /> <br /> They don't make their own nests, preferring instead to reside within tree cavities, including broken-topped trees and platforms. Because of their specific nesting preferences, the health of northern spotted owl populations is indicative of the health of old-growth forests, making them one of the most-studied owl species. They're classified as federally threatened, with the primary threat due to logging activity resulting in the fragmentation and elimination of their forest habitat. If you're visiting in the twilight hour, keep your ears open. You may hear the northern spotted owl's distinctive \"barking\" call.<br /> Â </p> <h3>Fish Friends</h3> <p>When you're going about your daily fish identifications, it's important to remember that a trout is a salmon, but a salmon does not always a trout make. Consider the coho and the steelhead, both are anadromous, meaning, they migrate to the ocean after birth in freshwater rivers and streams. Both fish friends are threatened by a number of human-induced environmental factors such as habitat degradation, water diversions and improper harvesting. In Muir Woods, we're doing our part to care for our fish friends by restoring native habitat up and down their spawning grounds, Redwood Creek.<br /> <br /> Remember, look but don't take! Fishing is not allowed!</p>",

The health of the towering redwoods depends on the complex soils of the forest floor, a product of fungal decay and recycling of low greenery, understory trees and the redwoods themselves.</p> <h3>A Life and Death Situation</h3> <p>The impressive size of coast redwoods may suggest dominance over other species in their habitat, but in fact it's just the opposite. Redwoods are only able to grow as a result of their unique biotic community. A healthy redwood forest usually includes massive Douglas firs, tanoaks, madrones and other trees. On the forest floor, among ferns and leafy redwood sorrel, mosses and mushrooms help to regenerate the soil. And of course, the redwoods themselves eventually fall to the forest floor where they decompose and return nutrients to the soil.<br /> <br /> Many different shrubs populate the understory of old-growth redwood forests, including numerous berry bushes. Some examples include: huckleberry, blackberry and thimbleberry, which act as seasonal food sources for raccoons and other forest inhabitants.<br /> <br /> When left to their own devices, redwood forests are natural recyclers. The 35 inch average yearly rainfall provides the soil with some nutrients, but trees must rely on each other, living and dead, to receive all they need to be healthy. To complete this process, redwoods must decay naturally along the forest floor. These decaying trees are what's known as \"nurse logs.\" When logging occurs and the trees are removed, this cycle is disrupted. Since trees have never been logged at Muir Woods, the natural ecological process continues as nature intended.</p>",

To use the app with partial functionality onsite, download the data to your phone ahead of time.<br /> <br /> Muir Woods offers an experience available in only a handful of places on Earth. The peaceful groves of old-growth coast redwoods found here are examples of the species <em>Sequoia sempervirens</em>, whose only habitat left on the entire planet is in pockets along the northern half of the California Pacific Coast.<br /> <br /> Muir Woods offers a space for quiet reflection in a filtered light forest environment. The immense height of the redwoods is sure to impress, but perhaps more amazing is the lifespan of these trees. The average age of the trees in Muir Woods is between 500-600 years, though some as old as 700-1,000 have been documented. In the right conditions, redwoods are capable of living up to 2,000 years. They're among the oldest living things on the planet, making Muir Woods a world-class destination that's not to be missed. Boasting accessible boardwalk trails and trailheads that lead through the forest to the coast, Muir Woods has adventures for all nature lovers, but dog friends must stay home.</p> <h3>Getting to Muir Woods</h3> <p>Muir Woods is a popular place in a hard to reach area. Planning ahead for how you'll get to and from the woods is essential. Reservations are required for all vehicles and shuttle riders. For parking and shuttle information and reservations go to <a href=\"https://gomuirwoods.com/\">GoMuirWoods.com</a> or call 1-800-410-2419.<br /> <br /> For a more peaceful experience, consider coming to the woods on a rainy day. Fewer people tend to venture to the woods when it's wet. The redwoods provide a fair amount of cover and can be quite beautiful in the rain. Another option is to come early or late in the day. From April to October, Muir Woods is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Twilight visitors will find the trails quiet and uncongested. Mid-week is always less busy. For the more adventurous, you can plan a hike into the woods from one of the trailheads around Muir Woods.</p> <h3>Keeping California Wild: Establishing Muir Woods</h3> <p>Before the 1800s, California's northern coast was covered in approximately 2 million acres of redwood forests. Development and logging resulted in the loss of 97 % of these trees. The area along Redwood Creek, in what is now known as Muir Woods, may well have been logged too, had it not been so difficult to access. By the early 20th century, Redwood Creek contained one of the last uncut old-growth redwood stands in the Bay Area. Now, it's one of the only old-growth coast redwood forest left in the area, and one of the last on the entire planet.<br /> <br /> The preservation of Muir Woods is due to the efforts of Congressman and business mogul William Kent. Encouraged by his wife, environmentalist and women's rights activist Elizabeth Thacher Kent, the couple purchased 611 acres in the region in 1905. They promptly donated half the acreage to the Federal government to ensure its protection. Three years later, President Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt declared the site a National Monument, and suggested naming the woods after Kent. Kent declined the honor, giving instructions for the woods to be named after legendary environmentalist, philosopher and all around cool historical dude, John Muir. Muir was very grateful for the recognition saying, \"This is the best tree-lovers monument that could possibly be found in all the forests of the world.\"</p> <h3>Get Your Nature On: Trails in Muir Woods</h3> <p>Muir Woods has 6 miles of trails, including half hour, 1 hour and 1Â½ hour loops. There are additional trails that lead from Muir Woods into Mount Tamalpais State Park. Most of the trails in Muir Woods are asphalt or boardwalk, but some that lead far up the canyon are steep, rutted and often muddy.</p> <h3>Can't See the Forest for the Fog</h3> <p>Some know him as \"Karl,\" a thick gray fog who haunts the city and North Coast, especially during the summer. Karl is sometimes seen as a nuisance, but without him, we wouldn't have the redwoods. When inland temperatures are high, we get a visit from Karl, who comes in from over the ocean, providing a beneficial source of cooling moisture that collects in the forest greenery, and drips down to the forest floor. Karl plays a key role in supporting the forest. The moisture he brings during summer dry periods accounts for about 40 percent of the redwoods' moisture intake. Redwoods can move hundreds of gallons of water daily along their trunks from roots to crown. This water transpires through the trees' foliage, returning to the atmosphere.</p> <h3>ONE Tam at a Time</h3> <p><a href=\"http://www.onetam.org/\">ONE Tam</a> is a community-based initiative to ensure the preservation of Mount Tamalpais for the next century. ONE Tam raises awareness for the need to maintain the long-term health of the mountain, engage more volunteers in caring for its treasured resources and renew the spirit of philanthropy that was fundamental to keeping Mount Tam unspoiled over the last one hundred years. ONE Tam is a partnership between the following awesome organizations, dedicated to preserving wild areas in an increasingly digital age: California State Parks, Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, Marin County Parks, Marin Municipal Water District and the National Park Service.</p>",

The concentric rings of the tree reveal that it lived 1,021 years. Some redwoods live more than 2,000 years.</p> <h3>The Old Ones</h3> <p>Fossil records indicate that relatives of today's coast redwoods were living large during the Jurassic Period 160 million years ago. The dinosaurs may have bit the dust, but the redwoods continue to thrive in this location, one they have inhabited for some 20 million years thanks to environmental conditions that remain largely unchanged.<br /> <br /> A combination of latitude, elevation and microclimates in the California Coast Ranges makes it possible for redwoods to grow.<br /> <br /> These factors are also what limits the redwoods' range to a few hundred coastal miles. The cool, moist air created by the Pacific Ocean keeps the trees continually damp, even during summer droughts. California's North Coast provides the only such environment in the world. The trees can live to be 2,000 years old, and regularly reach 600 years.<br /> <br /> Redwoods are tough customers. They possess built-in resistance to insects and fire. Diseases are virtually unknown. Their unusual ability to regenerate also aids in their survival as a species. Sprouts may come directly from a snag or downed tree's root system. Basal burls, which are hard, knotty growths that form from dormant seedlings on a living tree, can sprout a new tree when the main trunk is damaged by fire, cutting or toppling.</p> <h3>Hotter Planet, Bigger Trees?</h3> <p>Since the 1970s, researchers have noted some coast redwood and giant sequoia trunks are growing at a rate faster than others previously documented. Could this be the result of climate change? Experts aren't sure, but think it's possible. One theory suggests that increased sunlight due to less summer fog, but a still-adequate amount of winter precipitation, is spurring the growth. Another theory is that wildfire suppression reduces the amount of fire stress, allowing redwoods to expend more energy on trunk growth. Whatever the reason, the available evidence suggests that, at least for now, redwoods are growing faster in the changing environment.</p>",

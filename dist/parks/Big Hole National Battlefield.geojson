In 1882 Secretary of War Robert T. Lincoln authorized the building and erection of the monument and the stone was cut in Concord, New Hampshire. On three sides there are inscriptions carved into the stone including the names of the fallen.<br /> <br /> The monument was transported by train to Dillon, Montana and brought the rest of the way to the battlefield in a wagon pulled by oxen. A detachment of soldiers under the supervision of First Lieutenant J.P. Thompson of the Third US Infantry Regiment out of Missoula, Montana would put the monument in place.<br /> <br /> In the ensuing years the monument would see vandalism from souvenir and relic seekers and in 1909 a wrought iron steel fence was placed around it to protect it. In 1967 the fence was taken down and the monument still stands in the Siege Area.",

        "notes": "Bear Paw Battlefield\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/bear-paw-battlefield.htm\n\n<p>The Bear Paw Battlefield is the location of the final battle of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nepe/learn/historyculture/1877.htm\">Nez Perce Flight of 1877.</a> Following the breakout of war in Idaho, approximately 800 Nimiipuu<em> </em>(Nez Perce) spent a long and arduous summer fleeing U.S. Army troops first toward Crow allies and then toward refuge in Canada. After the skirmishes at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nepe/learn/historyculture/canyon-creek-history.htm\">Canyon Creek</a>, the Nimiipuu arrived at <em>C’aynnim Alikinwaaspa</em> (Place of the Manure Fire, now known as the Bear Paw Battlefield), a mere forty miles short of the Canadian border. Following a five-day battle and siege, the Nimiipuu ceased fighting at Bear Paw on October 5th, 1877, in which Chief Joseph gave his immortal speech: \"From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.\"</p> <h2>The Battle at Bear Paw</h2> <h3>September 29, 1877</h3> <p>Abundant game and fresh water offered by Snake Creek made <em>C’aynnim Alikinwaaspa </em>a good place to camp and gather supplies<em>. </em>With <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/general-oliver-otis-howard-house.htm\">General Oliver Otis Howard</a> far behind them the Nimiipuu thought they had time to rest their weary hearts, bodies, and horses, and to hunt and butcher some bison before the final push to Canada.</p> <p>Their tipis destroyed at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/biho/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Big Hole</a> left little else for protection. The people spent the night huddled in crude lodges and lean-tos, warmed only by blankets and fire pits burning bison dung.</p> <h3>September 30, 1877</h3> <p>The morning found the non-treaty Nimiipuu preparing to break camp and head north. A rider pulled his horse to a halt on the south bluff waving a blanket to warn everyone that soldiers would be upon them in moments. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nelson-miles.htm\">Colonel Nelson Miles</a> commanding 450 men had traveled approximately 260 miles in 9 days in an attempt to intercept the Nimiipuu.</p> <p>Some Nimiipuu attempted to escape. Warriors rushed to the bluffs above the camp to defend it. Others ran into camp to aid with the defense. The families trapped in camp sought shelter. Some, knowing the horses were critical to their escape, rushed to protect the herd. Black Eagle recalled: \"I left going for the horses. I saw our horses not far away. The horses were wise to the shooting and all began to stampede.\"</p> <p>The attack came in two sweeping wings. The 2nd Cavalry hit the horse herd to the west of camp and in a five mile running battle captured most of the Nimiipuu horses. The 7th Cavalry charged directly towards the bluffs above the camp; warriors rose up from just below the edge of the bluff and stopped the charge cold. The fighting was intense with soldiers and warriors locked in close combat. With the aid of the 5th Infantry the soldiers secured the southern bluff but the warriors kept the soldiers from the camp and their families. Though the army was stopped, the Nimiipuu<em> </em>suffered serious losses as 26 died the first day including Chiefs <em>Ollikut </em>(Joseph's younger brother<em>) </em>and Lean Elk.</p> <p>As a cold night fell, both forces found themselves in a stalemate. The Nimiipuu could not escape without their horses and the soldiers could not dislodge the Nimiipuu from the camp. Both sides dug rifle pits and the lines were drawn for a prolonged siege. The Nimiipuu families used <em>tu’kes </em>(digging sticks used to harvest camas roots), knives, and trowel bayonets they had captured from the army during earlier engagements to dig shelter pits.</p> <h3>October 1, 1877</h3> <p>Dawn brought fresh snow on the ground and ice in water buckets. That day under a white flag of truce, Chief Joseph met with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/nelson-miles.htm\">Colonel Nelson Miles</a> and both sides ventured forth to gather dead and wounded. At the end of the meeting, Joseph turned to leave. He was called back by Miles and was placed in chains to use as leverage. Seeing this occur the Nimiipuu made Lieutenant Jerome, who was very close to their camp on reconnaissance, a guest of theirs. By his account, he was given food, blanket, shelter, and allowed to move freely about the Nez Perce camp while retaining his pistol.</p> <h3>October 2, 1877</h3> <p>The prisoners were exchanged and both returned to their home camps. The military supply train arrived with the 12-Pound Napoleon Cannon.</p> <p>Yellow Wolf remembered October 2 as the day Chief Looking Glass was killed. \"Some warriors in [this] pit with him saw at a distance a horseback Indian. One pointed and called to Looking Glass, 'Look! A Sioux!\" Looking Glass stepped quickly from the pit. Stood on the bluff unprotected. A bullet struck his left forehead and he fell back dead.\" Looking Glass was hopeful help had come from the camp of Sitting Bull in Canada.</p> <h3>October 3, 1877</h3> <p>The fighting continued. The army targeted the area where the families were sheltered with cannon fire.</p> <h3>October 4, 1877</h3> <p>General Howard arrived with a small retinue; as the remainder of his army had already been sent home. This information was not conveyed to the Nimiipuu still in camp. As far as they knew, a second army was on its way.</p> <h3>October 5, 1877</h3> <p>That morning the two remaining hereditary leaders, White Bird and Joseph, met two Nez Perce<em> </em>men from the bands honoring <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nepe/learn/historyculture/the-treaty-era.htm\">the 1863 treaty</a>, who were following General Howard at that time. They had entered camp to convince the remaining non-treaty Nimiipuu to quit fighting. Joseph and Whitebird were told that they would be returned to Idaho, the leaders will not be killed, and, most importantly, that the army wanted to quit fighting.</p> <p>White Bird mistrusted the army's promises and refused to surrender. However, Joseph returned to camp to tell the people that they could be saved by ending the fighting. This important decision was up to each individual. Choices were few and none were favorable. Could the Nimiipuu continue the fight? The supply of soldiers was endless. Should the Nimiipuu try to escape on foot under cover of darkness through the lands of traditional enemies? Not everyone could make this trip. Many were too weak. Who would care for the elders, children, and wounded? Would they be able to bury their dead? Would they be allowed to go home?</p> <p>At 2pm Joseph met with Miles and Howard, handed over his rifle, and made his now famous speech:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Looking Glass is dead. <em>Tulhuulhulsuit</em> is dead. The old men are all dead. It is the young men who say “Yes” or “No”. He who led the young men is dead. It is cold, and we have no blankets. The little children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they are, perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children, and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs. I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Afterwards, other Nimiipuu handed their weapons over to Miles in an understood mutual decision to lay down arms and negotiate peace. As to their destination, Miles told Joseph: \"Which is the place that you love to stay in? I want you to tell me, as I have the power to remove these white people, and let you live there.\" Miles also promised: \"I will give half of them [weapons] back to you after awhile.\"</p> <h2>Aftermath</h2> <p>All told, over 400 Nimiipuu agreed to quit fighting and turn themselves over the military care. Another group of 30 to 50 Nimiipuu left with White Bird that night; the last of between 200 and 300 people<i> </i>who did make it to Canada. The 126 day flight was over, but the plight of those capture and those who escaped to Canada was not even halfway over in terms of time and distance.<br /> <strong>Driving to Bear Paw Battlefield</strong><br /> From Big Hole National Battlefield, turn left onto MT-43 East for 61 miles.

By the time the smoke cleared on August 10, almost 90 Nez Perce were dead along with 31 soldiers and volunteers. Big Hole National Battlefield was created to honor all who were there.</span></p> <p>Big Hole National Battlefield is part of Nez Perce National Historical Park that has thirty-eight sites spread over four states (Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington) that touch on many of the threads that make up the Nez Perce story.

        "notes": "Howitzer Capture Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/howitzer.htm\n\nColonel John Gibbon the post commander of Fort Shaw in 1877 was ordered to pursue the non-treaty Nez Perce during the Flight of 1877. He chose to bring a “mountain howitzer” along on this campaign, but because the 7th U.S. Infantry assigned to him was not an artillery unit, a raw crew of six enlisted men was assembled to travel with the howitzer. This crew was composed of Sergeant Fredrick, Sergeant Daly, Corporal Sale, Privates McGregor, Goale, and Bennett. Traveling with the crew were two civilians, William Woodcock, a black manservant leading a pack mule and Joseph Blodgett, a guide.<br /> <br /> <br /> Colonel Gibbon’s report of the campaign states; “…The howitzer could not accompany the column in consequence of the quantity of fallen timber obstructing the trail and the noise which would have been made in removing it. Orders were therefore given that at early daylight it should start out after us with a pack mule loaded with 2,000 rounds of extra [rifle] ammunition.”<br /> <br /> <br /> The howitzer and crew arrived on the steep hillside south of the Nez Perce camp late morning of August 9, 1877 and fired two ineffective rounds at the encampment 1,200 yards away. Taking advantage of the inexperienced crew, a group of warriors, among them pıyopıyó·t̉alıkt and hotó·to, overran them. In the ensuing struggle, Private Bennett was trapped beneath the mule he was holding, both sergeants were wounded, and Corporal Sale was killed. At the first sign of trouble, Privates Goale and McGregor ran. All surviving members of the party were able to escape.<br /> <br /> <br /> Mountain Howitzer No. 111 was captured by the Nez Perce along with the rifle ammunition and mules. The warriors disassembled the carriage, rolling the wheels down the hillside, “burying” the bronze tube and scattering the contents of the limber. To this day the Nez Perce sing of the bravery of their men in a song called “The Duck and Dive”.<br />   <br /> <br /> After the arrival of General Oliver O. Howard on August 11, soldiers recovered the howitzer and took it with the wounded soldiers and civilians to Deer Lodge, Montana, 80 miles away where the territorial prison is located. The prison infirmary, staffed by a doctor and nurses, tended to the wounded. When the command departed Deer Lodge, they left the howitzer behind and in an unsigned letter from prison files it states the howitzer was a gift to the penitentiary. The howitzer sat in the courtyard of the prison for 31 more years before it was returned to Big Hole Battlefield<br />  ",

The fighting was intense and made worse by low clouds and drizzle. The Army was stopped, but the Nez Perce suffered serious losses as 26 died the first day. On the west edge of the bluff, a marker identifies where Ollikut, Joseph’s brother, was killed. Across the coulee to the northeast Lean Elk was mistaken for an enemy in the severe weather and killed by other Nez Perce. His warning to Looking Glass had come true that neither would leave this place. Nez Perce warriors prepared fortifications in the form of shallow rifle pits on the bluffs overlooking the camp and in the coulees leading into it. Yellow Wolf remembers October 2 : It came morning, third sun of battle. The rifle shooting went on just like play. But soon Chief Looking Glass was killed. Some warriors in [this] pit with him saw at a distance a horseback Indian. One pointed and called to Looking Glass “Look! A Sioux!” Looking Glass stepped quickly from the pit. Stood on the bluff unprotected. A bullet struck his left forehead and he fell back dead. Looking Glass was hopeful help had come from the camp of Sitting Bull in Canada.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

The remains of the soldiers were removed to Fort Assiniboine in 1903. Then, in 1912, they were relocated to Custer National Cemetery at Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.

Romeyn recounts: At the south end of the campground there was a perpendicular bluff that afforded excellent cover. This was instantly occupied by the Nez Perces who, withholding fire until the 7th [Company A & D] were within two hundred yards, then delivered it with murderous effect. Wherever the Indians heard a voice raised in command there they at once directed their fire. After retreating, Miles ordered the cavalry to dismount and reinforce Company K. Fire was directed toward the bluff on the west side of the coulee. The Nez Perce held their position of advantage. The 5th Infantry came up and was halted at the crest. Here it was met by a hot fire from the coulee and men and horses began to drop before they could dismount. The Hotchkiss gun was brought up [near this location] and was soon driven from the position with severe loss to its gunners. Only hand to hand combat with units of the U.S. 5th Infantry forced the Nez Perce to yield the high ground. Romeyn continued: By three o’clock it was evident that the attack must become a siege.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

Before you, in the gully draining to Snake Creek, soldiers lay dead or wounded as the evening fell. Romeyn remembers: Those who fell into the hands of the hostiles were not molested otherwise than to be stripped of arms and ammunition. They [Nez Perce] even gave some of the wounded water after nightfall when it could be done safely.

Soldiers guarding, sitting down, two and two. Soldiers all around the camp so that none could escape. It was snowing. The wind was cold. About 450 men, women and children retreated to the north end of the camp. On the flats and the sides of the coulees the ground became frozen as rain turned to snow and temperatures dropped. A Nez Perce woman recalls: We digged trenches with camas hooks and butcher knives. With pans we threw out the dirt. We could not do much cooking. Dried meat and some other grub would be handed around. It would be given to the children first. I was three days without food. Children cried with hunger and cold. In the small creek there was water, but we could get to it only at night. Four more terrifying days remained. On October 4, according to Yellow Wolf: It was towards noon that a bursting shell struck and broke in a shelter pit, burying four women, a little boy, and a girl of about twelve snows. This girl and her grandmother were both killed. The other three women and the boy were rescued",

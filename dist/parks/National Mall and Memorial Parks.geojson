It is the sharing together of the scanty covering, the insufficient shelter, drinking from the same cup, eating from the same plate, the dividing by a hungry soldier with a hungrier comrade the last morsel of meat or the remnant of a cracker; the binding up of each other's wounds, the lending of courage from one heart to another: these are what create the strongest bonds between human beings.<br /> Horace H.

Originally built to display and house material from the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, the Arts and Industries Building was designed by Washington architects Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze in 1879. It stands today as one of the premier examples of exhibition architecture in the United States. Unlike other exposition buildings from this period, the Arts and Industries Building was designed to be a permanent museum institution and housed the nation’s most important historical and natural artifacts continuing a long tradition of cultural stewardship in Washington D.C. that continues to this day. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dbe48b7d-1a77-477a-8e7f-e29ddb77b8ac}{255}\" paraid=\"1838041137\">Beginning in the 1850’s, European cities began hosting international expositions aimed at displaying the cultural and technological innovations of the industrial age. World’s Fairs, as these events came to be known, were months-long events where new technological, cultural, and artistic ideas and innovations were highlighted. Paris’ Eiffel Tower and London’s Crystal Palace were new technological wonders showcased at these events. In 1876, the United States hosted one of the first major World’s Fairs. Known as the Centennial Exposition, the fair was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the nation’s founding. At the conclusion of the Exposition, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. acquired many of the items exhibited in Philadelphia and attempted to permanently house and display them.</p> <p paraeid=\"{e31b001f-96d9-4c6a-956a-5de0d79bee5a}{100}\" paraid=\"108294904\">The Smithsonian’s Board of Regents determined that their main building, the <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/smithsonian-institution-building-castle\">Smithsonian Institution Building</a> (now known as the Smithsonian Castle) was not large enough to house the Centennial’s materials and the board made plans for the construction of the U.S. National Museum. In 1879, the Board adopted the design plans of famed Washington architectural firm Cluss and Schulze and hired former Civil War General and engineer Montgomery C. Meigs to oversee construction of the facility. Situated directly adjacent to the Smithsonian Institution Building, the National Museum was officially opened in 1881 and immediately became a prominent Washington landmark hosting important social events including the inaugural ball of President James Garfield. In addition to housing the Centennial Exposition materials, the museum contained many of the nation’s most important historical artifacts including Betsy Ross’ <i>Star-Spangled Banner</i> and the dresses of several First Ladies.</p> <p paraeid=\"{e31b001f-96d9-4c6a-956a-5de0d79bee5a}{236}\" paraid=\"1013665437\">As with most exposition architecture, the National Museum was designed to enclose a large open museum space with a visually compelling and dramatic exterior meant to draw interest from the passing public. Cluss and Schulze’s design included a wide, one-story Greek cross plan with a large central rotunda and iron truss roof system that accommodated the wide and uninterrupted interior exhibit spaces. The building includes nearly 1,000 windows allowing for the interior to be naturally lit. The entrance to the museum is flanked by two large Romanesque Revival towers and a Neoclassical sculpture of a female figure by Caspar Brubel entitled <em>Columbia Protecting Science and Industry</em>. <br /> <br /> In 1910, the Smithsonian built the National Museum of Natural History to house the institution’s growing natural history collection after it was determined that the National Museum's increasingly limited exhibit space made it unsuitable for collection maintenance. The Arts and Industries Building, as it was renamed in 1910, continued to display artifacts of American aviation and national history, including the <em>Spirit of St. Louis</em> and the Wright Brothers’ <em>Flyer</em> aircraft that were exhibited in a neighboring building that eventually became the National Air and Space Museum in 1946. </p> <p paraeid=\"{33f56d34-7364-43a7-8715-fa3ef5f1b0f1}{87}\" paraid=\"2075373965\"> In 1974, the Arts and Industries Building was designated a National Historic Landmark and underwent two years of renovations before reopening for the United States’ Bicentennial in 1976. As part of the nationwide celebrations, the Arts and Industries Building hosted an exhibit on the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition which included many of the original artifacts and attractions from the fair. From the late 1970s to the early 2000s, the Arts and Industries Building hosted a number of experimental exhibits and art installations. By 2009, the deteriorating condition of the building forced the Smithsonian to renovate the structure’s roofing and interior.

As the war ended Clara Barton, the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" who had achieved fame as a nurse during the war, took it upon herself to fill this void. She began to receive letters from family members trying to find out the fate of their loved ones who had not returned home. Each of these letters led to a painstaking process of researching the whereabouts of these missing soldiers and to respond to the family members' inquiries. </p> <p>In June of 1865 a young clerk named Dorence Atwater contacted Barton and requested copies of her lists of missing soldiers. Atwater had been a prisoner at Andersonville and had been paroled to work in the hospital, where he diligently maintained a copy of the death records. Ecstatic, Barton contacted Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and asked to accompany the US Army's expedition to Andersonville to identify the graves there.</p> <p>At Andersonville in July and August of 1865, Atwater and Barton poured through the letters she had received, and began to search for these missing soldiers in the Andersonville Death Register and captured hospital records. While laborers worked to erect headboards in the cemetery, Barton wrote dozens of letters informing families that their loved ones had died at Andersonville. At the end of the expedition, Barton was given the honor of raising the American flag for the first time over the recently established Andersonville National Cemetery.</p> <p>After returning from Andersonville, Barton set up the Missing Soldier's Office in Washington in 1865. She hired numerous clerks, including Dorence Atwater, to respond to the more than 60,000 letters that she received. By the time the Missing Soldiers Office closed in 1867, Barton and her staff had identified more than 20,000 missing soldiers, including nearly 13,000 who had died at Andersonville Prison.<br /> <br />  </p> <p>Because of her fame as a nurse, she received much of the credit for the work of the Missing Soldiers Office and the Andersonville expedition. In a post war speaking series she was hailed as the \"Heroine of Andersonville\" and toured the nation displaying artifacts that she had collected at the prison site and lectured on the sufferings of the prisoners. She was even inducted as an honorary member of the Andersonville Survivor's Association, and the army's expedition to Andersonville to identify the graves quickly became known as Barton's expedition, even though she had only accompanied the previously planned endeavor and had worked primarily writing letters - not identifying graves as has often been claimed.</p> <p>Barton's greatest contribution to the Andersonville story is through her work in the Missing Soldiers Office and her support of Dorence Atwater. Atwater was court-martialed and jailed in the fall of 1865 related to a dispute over the ownership of the Andersonville Death Register. It was through Barton's efforts that he was finally released and she then supported his publication of the Death Register. Barton is often mistakenly given credit for identifying the graves at Andersonville. However, she deserves a great deal of credit for her efforts to account for the missing soldiers, both at Andersonville and across countless battlefields.</p>",

Washington, D.C., is surrounded by over a dozen tribal nations that thrive along the Anacostia and Potomac River watersheds, Chesapeake Bay area, and the states of Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. Washington, D.C. sits on the ancestral lands of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/native-peoples-of-washington-dc.htm\">Anacostans (also documented as Nacotchtank</a>), and the neighboring Piscataway and Pamunkey peoples. </p> <h3 aria-level=\"2\" lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9da398d5-fdea-46a8-b60a-4af3dd67f2dc}{121}\" paraid=\"1978538993\" role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Pacific Circle </h3> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9da398d5-fdea-46a8-b60a-4af3dd67f2dc}{139}\" paraid=\"1673660750\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">When Pierre Charles L'Enfant drew up plans for the City of Washington in 1791, he envisioned a city of grand vistas and diagonal avenues meeting in circles of green space. The location that became Dupont Circle has a direct connection to the White House along Connecticut Avenue. Nevertheless, until the late nineteenth century, the neighborhood was sparsely populated and undeveloped. <br />  <br /> In 1872, the city paved Connecticut Avenue, improving landscaping and public works in the neighborhood, which was then called Pacific Circle. William Stewart, a U.S. Senator from Nevada, built what became known as Stewart Castle on the north section of the circle in 1873. The five-story mansion with center turret was impressive, although some wondered why Stewart built his house so far away from the prestigious areas of the city. A year later, the British Legation Building was completed at 1300 Connecticut Avenue, which began the transformation of the area into desirable real estate. </p> <h3 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9da398d5-fdea-46a8-b60a-4af3dd67f2dc}{145}\" paraid=\"1097814283\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Dupont</h3> <p paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{181}\" paraid=\"1116014623\">Samuel F. Dupont had a long and varied career in the U.S. Navy. Born at Berge Point, New Jersey, in 1803, he joined the Navy at the age of 12. Year by year, he worked his way up the promotional ladder and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1856. Dupont was serving as commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard when the American Civil War began in 1861. To protect Washington, D.C., which was surrounded by states of unclear loyalty, Dupont sent the forces under his command to occupy Annapolis, Maryland. This move allowed U.S. troops to reach the beleaguered capital. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{185}\" paraid=\"31554947\">Later, Dupont was put in command of the South Atlantic Blockade Squadron. On November 7, 1861, he helped to capture Fort Royal, South Carolina. The following year, he was promoted to rear admiral. But after an unsuccessful attack on Fort Sumter at Charleston, South Carolina, Dupont was relieved of command. He retired to the family home in Wilmington, Delaware, and died in 1865. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{189}\" paraid=\"294747892\">Despite the inauspicious end to his naval career, Dupont never lost his popularity with the people of Wilmington. In 1882, at their behest, Congress decided to raise a statue to Dupont's memory in downtown Washington, D.C. The bronze statue of Samuel Dupont, standing and holding a pair of binoculars, by the sculptor Launt Thompson was dedicated on December 20, 1884. Pacific Circle was renamed in Dupont's honor.</p> <h3 paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{189}\" paraid=\"294747892\">Dupont Circle </h3> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9da398d5-fdea-46a8-b60a-4af3dd67f2dc}{145}\" paraid=\"1097814283\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Between 1880 and 1940, the neighborhood transformed, eventually including many Victorian and Beaux Arts residences. It became a sought-after address in the 1920s, home to notable Washingtonians like newspaper editor Cissy Patterson (organizer of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-cherry-tree-rebellion.htm\">Cherry Tree Rebellion</a>.)<br /> <br /> But the Dupont family was unhappy with the statue, and in February 1917, Congress passed legislation to remove it and commission a new memorial to Dupont, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nama/planyourvisit/dupont.htm\">a white stone fountain</a> designed by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/linc/learn/historyculture/lincoln-memorial-design-individuals.htm\">Henry Bacon and Daniel Chester French, </a>the team who also designed the Lincoln Memorial. In the sculpture, which was dedicated in 1921, the bowl of the fountain is held aloft by three figures representing “The Sea,” “The Wind,” and “The Stars.” The fountain has become a gathering place for numerous celebrations and events throughout the year, including the annual Pride Festival and Parade. The National Park Service began caring for the fountain and the surrounding park in 1933. </p> <h3 paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{189}\" paraid=\"294747892\">LGBTQ History </h3> <p>In the 1970s, Dupont Circle became a welcoming place for the city's LGBTQ community. Activist Deacon Maccubbin opened Earthworks, a craft store and \"headshop\" that was the city's first openly gay business that wasn't a bar. Earthworks became a center for the gay community. Maccubbin expanded the business to open Lambda Rising, which he advertised as  \"The Largest Lesbian and Gay Liberation Bookstore in the U.S.A.\"  Lambda Rising moved several times throughout the years to different locations around Dupont Circle, eventually settling at 1625 Connecticut Avenue, NW, where it operated until 2010. The neighborhood was also home to <em>The Gay Blade </em>newspaper (now called <em>Washington Blade,) </em>and <em>off our backs, </em>a lesbian feminist publication. <br /> <br /> Maccubbin organized Gay Pride Day in June 1975, a small community gathering that grew every year. The event is now called Capital Pride and draws tens of thousands of people to Dupont Circle for the annual parade. Since 1986, the Tuesday before Halloween in Dupont Circle means the High Heel Race. Thousands of people gather to watch drag queens race for three blocks down 17th Street in high heels. Although it began as an impromptu competition, the event is now hosted by the D.C. Mayor's Office and includes a parade and other festivities. </p> <h3>The Circle Today</h3> <p>Today, the park continues to serve the community as a popular gathering point for games of chess, drum circles, demonstrations, concerts, and snowball fights. The only surviving structure from the Pacific Circle era is the 1882 Blaine Mansion, located at the corner of 20th and P Streets. The neighborhood still includes elegant examples of historic Queen Anne, Beaux Arts, and Georgian Revival architecture along with more modern buildings. </p>",

Eisenhower was the 34th president of the United States and the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/worldwarii/index.htm\">World War II</a> . During his presidency, \"Ike\" worked to contain the spread of Communism around the globe, developed the interstate highway system, and famously used the military to enforce the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chsc/index.htm\">integration of schools</a> in Little Rock, Arkansas.<br /> <br /> The memorial reflects Eisenhower's leadership roles as general and as president. On the right side of the memorial, Eisenhower is depicted as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II. The sculpture is based on a photograph of Eisenhower speaking to paratroopers in the 101st Airborne Division before their jump into France as part of Operation Overlord, the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Behind the sculptures is a bas relief depicting the Normandy landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944. On the left side of the memorial, the bronze heroic-sized statue of Eisenhower as 34th President of the United States places him at the center of the White House Oval Office flanked by sculptures of civilian and military advisors, symbolizing the balance Eisenhower struck between conflicting demands of national security and peaceful progress. The bas relief global background depicts a map of the world symbolizing Eisenhower's role as a world statesman and preeminent internationalist pursuing universal peace. A pedestal on the northwest plaza entrance depicts Eisenhower as a boy, symbolizing his roots in Abilene, Kansas, and perhaps serving as a hopeful inspiration to children who visit the memorial.<br /> <br /> Designer: Frank Gehry<br /> Sculptor: Sergey Eylanbekov<br /> Artist (tapestry): Tomas Osinski<br /> <br /> <b>Inscriptions:</b><br /> \"Because no man is really a man who has lost out of himself all of the boy, I want to speak first of the dreams of a barefoot boy. Frequently, they are to be of a street car conductor or he sees himself as the town policeman, above all he may reach to a position of locomotive engineer, but always in his dreams is that day when he finally comes home. Comes home to a welcome from his own home town. Because today that dream of mine of 45 years or more ago has been realized beyond the wildest stretches of my own imagination, I come here, first, to thank you, to say the proudest thing I can claim is that I am from Abilene. - Homecoming speech, Abilene, Kansas - June 22, 1945\"<br /> <br /> \"The high sense of distinction I feel in receiving this great honor from the city of London is inescapably mingled with feelings of profound sadness. All of us must always regret that your great country and mine were ever faced with the tragic situation that compelled the appointment of an Allied Commander in Chief, the capacity in which I have just been so extravagantly commended. Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives acclaim earned in the blood of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends. Conceivably a commander may have been professionally superior. He may have given everything of his heart and mind to meet the spiritual and physical needs of his comrades. He may have written a chapter that will glow forever in the pages of military history. Still, even such a man--if he existed--would sadly face the facts that his honors cannot hide in his memories the crosses marking the resting places of the dead. They cannot soothe the anguish of the widow, or the orphan, whose husband or father will not return. The only attitude in which a commander may with satisfaction receive the tributes of his friends is in the humble acknowledgment that no matter how unworthy he may be, his position is the symbol of great human forces that have labored arduously and successfully for a righteous cause. Unless he feels this symbolism and this rightness in what he has tried to do, then he is disregardful of the courage, fortitude and devotion of the vast multitudes he has been honored to command. If all Allied men and women that have served with me in this war can only know that it is they whom this august body is really honoring today, then indeed I will be content.~ No petty differences in the world of trade, traditions, or national pride should ever blind us to our identities in priceless values. If we keep our eyes on this guidepost, then no difficulties along our path of mutual co-operation can ever be insurmountable. Moreover, when this truth has permeated to the remotest hamlet and heart of all peoples, then indeed may we beat our swords into plowshares, and all nations can enjoy the fruitfulness of the earth. Second Inaugural Address - January 21, 1957\"<br /> <br /> \"We must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid. We must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose. We must be willing, individually and as a nation, to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us. A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both. Patriotism means equipped forces and a prepared citizenry. Moral stamina means more energy and more productivity, on the farm and in the factory. Love of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible - from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientists. And so each citizen plays an indispensable role. The productivity of our heads, our hands and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command, for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the Peace. This is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial. This is the work that awaits us all, to be done with bravery, with charity and with prayer to almighty God. First Inaugural Address - January 20, 1953\"<br /> <br /> \"Throughout America's adventure in free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among people and among nations. A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.~ This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience.~ We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.~ In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.~ Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.~ It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system-ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.~ We pray that , all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.

Behind the sculptures is a bas relief depicting the Normandy landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944.<br /> <br /> During the Second World War, General Eisenhower spoke with soldiers, sailors and pilots from a wide variety of backgrounds and forged them into an effective team. From November 1942 through December 1943, Ike’s diplomacy and determination created a multinational headquarters that controlled British and American units. His forces liberated North Africa, Sicily and Southern Italy which weakened Nazi Germany’s strategic position.<br /> <br /> The culmination of Eisenhower’s success in building an allied force was the amphibious assault from the southern coast of England to Normandy, France. [second sentence removed] On the night of 5\\6 June 1944, British and American airborne personnel landed behind enemy lines and they secured the flanks of the beaches from German attack. After an air and sea bombardment that morning, British, Canadian, and American troops stormed ashore from small landing craft to defeat Germans in fortified positions. American commandos, known as Rangers climbed up the one hundred foot tall cliff at Pointe du Hoc where they destroyed a dangerous German artillery position.<br /> <br /> Eisenhower’s forces then made great sacrifices along a broad front that moved across Western Europe into Germany. Many of them were buried in a series of military cemeteries on the continent. For the rest of his very active life, Eisenhower remembered the high price that his personnel paid to preserve humanity’s right to choose their own governments. On the twentieth anniversary of D-Day, he visited one of the Normandy cemeteries and said, “These people gave us a chance… so that we can do better than we have before.”",

The bas-relief global background depicts a map of the world symbolizing Eisenhower's role as a world statesman and preeminent internationalist pursuing universal peace.<br /> <br /> The 1950s was a time of sweeping change as nations adjusted to a new world order. Above it all hung the cloud of the Cold War and its threat of mutual destruction. As president, Eisenhower worked to ease that threat and bring about peace.<br /> <br /> He began his presidency in 1952 by seeking an end to the Korean War. In 1955, with Cold War tension at a breaking point, he made a breakthrough with the Soviet Union with his Open Skies proposal. In his time in office, Eisenhower de-escalated crises worldwide with great diplomacy and tact.<br /> <br /> On the domestic front, Eisenhower oversaw great expansion. A moderate Republican, he continued many of the New Deal programs of his predecessors. He raised the minimum wage, expanded Social Security, established the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and improved the nation's infrastructure with the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956.<br /> <br /> The 1954 Brown v Board ruling by the Supreme Court declared public schools were to be desegregated. Eisenhower made sure the law was carried out, even if it meant using a measure of force. He further broke the yoke of Jim Crow when he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This protected African Americans at the voting booth and was the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction.<br /> <br /> In 1957, the Soviet Union became the first nation to reach space with its satellite Sputnik. In response, Eisenhower signed off on legislation to create what is now known as NASA. The space race had begun, and, building from this foundation, would be won by Eisenhower's successors.<br /> <br /> Eisenhower’s public approval numbers remained high during his two terms. People believed in his integrity, sincerity, and sense of duty. For his part, Eisenhower believed in the people and what they could do for the country, the world, and each other. As he said in his first inaugural address, “Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America.”",

        "notes": "Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial: Tapestry\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/ddem-tapestry.htm\n\nUnder the design direction of architect Frank Gehry, artist Tomas Osinski has created a stainless-steel tapestry for the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial. The tapestry depicts the Pointe du Hoc promontory of France’s Normandy coastline during peacetime and serves as a symbol of the peace Eisenhower sought and won as Supreme Allied Commander during World War II and then maintained and nurtured as 34<sup>th</sup> president. Although the artistic feature draws inspiration from historic tapestries, the process and materials implemented in the Eisenhower Memorial introduce a new innovative perspective on the conventional practice of tapestry weaving.<br /> <br /> Juggling many factors and possibilities, the artistic team of the Eisenhower Memorial chose to use stainless steel for its durability. Stainless steel possesses a metal with natural qualities that ensure its longevity. The metal has a natural oxidation process that protects the steel from corrosion. The element of chromium in the steel makes the material resistant to corrosion when exposed to oxygen. Because the tapestry will reside outdoors, many physical and metallurgical tests were conducted to decide which type of steel would be used in the project. The tapestry proved widely successful in these tests including withstanding the vacuum pressure of an airplane propeller and losing only six of the six-thousand welds that were subject to simulated hurricane wind for one month.<br /> <br /> At 447 feet long and 60 feet tall, a stainless steel tapestry of this size has never been attempted before. Made of 600 panels, each measuring 3 feet by 15 feet, the steel tapestry is supported by a cable net system suspended from a stone-clad concrete colonnade spanning the southern perimeter of the memorial. Architect Frank Gehry chose an expansive element to add gravitas to the memorial park, to serve as a commemorative element providing context for the memorial, and as an urban planning element defining the space in its urban surroundings.<br /> <br /> The initial memorial narrative featured a depiction of the Kansas landscape, commemoratingEisenhower's ties to his home state. As the design process continued, the design team proposed an image of Normandy's coastline to symbolize Eisenhower's role as a preeminent world leader.<br /> <br /> The initial artwork was a photographic representation of the Normandy cliffs and French landscape compiled from images captured by drone. As the team collaborated and received artistic feedback from the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the tapestry artwork evolved from a photographic montage to an artful abstract line drawing of the Pointe du Hoc promontory in peacetime.",

As a result, he became a good student, worker, athlete, and general.

The first request for a separate FBI building occurred in 1939. Although the Public Buildings Agency initiated plans for an FBI building in 1941, America’s entry into World War II required postponing all government building projects. The next serious request to Congress for a separate building was not made until 1961...</p>   <p>On October 7, 1964, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the major design concept with its security modifications. The approved plan consisted of 2,800,876 square feet of space for 7,090 employees. Height limits of 107 feet (seven stories) along Pennsylvania Avenue and 160 feet (eleven stories) along E Street conformed to the Pennsylvania Avenue Advisory Council and District of Columbia requirements.</p> <p>For reasons of economy, the approving agencies insisted upon poured concrete as the major outside building material. The concrete used for the FBI building contained an aggregate of crushed dolomite limestone, a unique composition. While contrasting with the traditional marble, granite, or limestone government buildings, it echoed a major architectural style of the 1960s. The concrete was poured into reusable steel forms separated by metal ties. The ties remained in the concrete when the molds were removed. This technique produced an architectural feature of evenly spaced holes throughout the exterior....</p> <p>The first FBI employees moved into the new building June 28, 1974. At that time, FBI Headquarters offices were housed in nine separate locations. By May 30, 1975, the Director, the associate director, and several divisions had moved in. Thirty-eight years after the first proposal for a separate FBI building and 15 years after Congress approved construction on the Pennsylvania Avenue site, the last employees moved into the building in June 1977.</p> <p>The building received its official name, the J. Edgar Hoover F.B.I. Building, through Public Law, 92-520, which President Richard Nixon signed May 4, 1972, two days after Director Hoover’s death. President Gerald Ford dedicated the building on September 30, 1975.\"<br /> For information on visiting the FBI Headquarters, visit \"<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/fbi-headquarters/the-fbi-experience\">The FBI Experience</a>\"</p>",

Visitors will discover that Room Two is divided into two halves by a wall. There are two sculptures straight ahead on the wall in the first half. “Appalachian Couple” and “The Breadline”, both created by sculptor George Segal, clearly depict the troubling times faced by both urban and rural communities during the Depression and the Dust Bowl. To the right of both those works is a third sculpture, also by George Segal. “Fireside Chat”, set in an alcove, shows how FDR often communicated to the American people. It’s a reminder that his radio broadcasts were intended to inform Americans that his administration was working for them to solve the problems facing the nation.</span></p> <h3>Combating Economic Depression</h3> <p><span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Continuing to combat the Great Depression, President Roosevelt's New Deal created federal programs to stabilize the economy, provide relief, and create jobs for millions of Americans. Most Americans had never heard a president's voice before FDR began his radio broadcasts. His confident and plain-spoken \"fireside chats\" reassured Americans even as many New Deal programs failed, and the Great Depression dragged on. FDR easily won reelection to a second term in 1936. <br /> <br /> Roosevelt's administrations created over 75 new programs to fight the Great Depression.

With 93 beds - each with a different variety of bright blooms - the library features a variety of lovely flowers that are planted over months.<br /> <br /> The flower beds are prepared by National Park Service gardeners in the fall, so they can be planted in the spring with tulip bulbs from Holland. Once the tulips have bloomed, the season progresses and the bulbs are removed, so our team can start preparing for the annuals. The display of annuals changes each summer. The final group is the planting of chrysanthemums in the fall before the tulip buds are prepared for the following spring.<br /> <br /> The Floral Library was established in 1969, as a part of First Lady \"Lady Bird\" Johnson’s Capital Beautification Project. The garden concept was based on putting “masses of flowers where masses pass.” The goal was to make the National Mall more appealing and engaging. So now, when you see locals and tourists near the Floral Library with their picnics and photo shoots, you'll know the reasons why and all the work that goes into it. It is a location to be enjoyed, but please don't pick the flowers.</p>",

The memorial is designed as a timeline best experienced by starting at the northernmost end of the memorial. Bronze sculptures by several artists depict the longest-serving president and the major issues he dealt with during his presidency including the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II.<br /> <br /> This entry is an overview of the entire memorial with specific attention to the \"Prologue\" room. For more specific information about each \"room\" in the memorial, see the following records:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-1st-term.htm\">FDR 1st Term</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-2nd-term.htm\">FDR 2nd Term</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-3rd-term.htm\">FDR 3rd Term</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-4th-term.htm\">FDR 4th Term</a></li> </ul> <h4>About the memorial</h4> <p>The national memorial dedicated to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States, lies about half way between the Lincoln Memorial and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington, DC. Its four open-air rooms represent each of the four terms of office to which he was elected. A meandering pathway leads past waterfalls, bronze sculptures, and FDR’s own powerful words carved on the granite walls. The memorial honors the memory of one of America’s great leaders and the optimism and courage that he shared with his fellow citizens through the ordeals of the Great Depression and World War II. A statue of Roosevelt sitting in a wheelchair greets visitors and reminds them of the man who refused to let disability stop him. <br /> <br /> When Congress established the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission in 1955, there was already a modest memorial to Roosevelt in Washington, DC. Roosevelt told his friend Felix Frankfurter what he wanted: “a block about the size of [this desk] . . . in the center of that green plot in front of the Archives Building.” The new, larger memorial took over 40 years of planning before its dedication on May 2, 1997.<br />  <br /> The FDR Memorial Commission selected landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to design the memorial in 1974. The result, with its shade trees, waterfalls, and quiet alcoves, feels more like a secluded garden than a traditional memorial. Walls of red South Dakota granite define the memorial’s outdoor rooms and the passageways connecting them. Waterfalls, quiet pools of water, and Roosevelt’s own words, beautifully incised into the granite walls by master carver John Benson, create a mood of quiet reflection.<br />  <br /> Each room conveys in its own way the spirit of the man. In Room One, a bronze bas-relief of the first inauguration, one of the early public sculptures created by Robert Graham, introduces the first years of Roosevelt’s presidency, when he launched the New Deal in response to the worst economic crisis the nation had ever known. George Segal created the powerful sculptures in Room Two. The Breadline represents the despair of the Great Depression. The Fireside Chat depicts the hope that Roosevelt’s inspiring words gave to ordinary people.<br />  <br /> In Room Three of the memorial, a waterfall crashes over scattered boulders, suggesting the destruction and violence of World War II, which dominated Roosevelt’s third term in office. Neil Estern created the statues of Roosevelt and his beloved dog, Fala, calmly presiding over the chaos surrounding them. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s hopes for the future are engraved on the wall next to his statue:<br />  <br /> <em>\"We have faith that future generations will know that here, in the middle of the twentieth century, there came a time when men of good will found a way to unite, and produce, and fight to destroy the forces of ignorance, and intolerance, and slavery, and war.\"</em><br />  <br /> The centerpiece of Room Four is a monumental bas-relief created by sculptor Leonard Baskin. The Funeral Cortege represents the nation in mourning after the death of the only president many of them could remember. Neil Estern’s statue of Eleanor Roosevelt honors her contributions as first lady and as one of the early delegates representing the United States at the newly formed United Nations.<br />  <br /> One of the things visitors to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial see is a simple, but powerful, statue of FDR sitting in the kind of wheelchair he used after the polio attack that paralyzed his legs in 1921. Halprin carefully designed the FDR Memorial to be accessible for people with all kinds of disabilities, but the original plans did not include this sculpture. Spokespersons for the disabled protested, arguing that showing the truth of FDR’s paralysis, something that he himself rarely allowed, would increase awareness and set an inspiring example for others who struggled with disability. Congress agreed. Robert Graham created the present statue, dedicated in January 2001.<br /> <br /> <strong>Landscape Architect: </strong>Lawrence Halprin</p> <h4>Inscriptions - \"Prologue\" section of memorial</h4> <p>Outer wall, front<br /> Franklin Delano Roosevelt<br /> President of the United States<br /> 1933 - 1945<br /> Outer wall, back<br /> Men and Nature Must Work Hand in Hand.

The stone pavers of Freedom Plaza depict a map of Washington, DC, according to planner Pierre Charles L'Enfant's plan for the city.<br /> <br /> Inscriptions<br /> WESTERN PLAZA PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE<br /> Western plaza consists of a large raised terrace in which part of L'Enfant's original 1791 plan for Washington, DC is rendered in black and white stone. At one end of the raised terrace is a pool. At the other is a shaded sitting area around a statue of General Pulaski.<br /> Inscribed on the upper terrace are historic quotations about Washington. Low walls separate the plaza from the surrounding traffic. Eleven large urns rest on top of these walls and contain seasonal plantings. The upper map terrace has a grass lawn where the Mall occurs and inlaid bronze plans of the White House and the Capitol located at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The inlays illustrate L'Enfant's intention to have these two buildings balance each other and symbolize two main branches of government. The siting of the Treasury in the 19th century blocked the view of the White House and obscured this relationship.<br /> L'Enfant's plan of Washington combines two orders of scale. The giant order is the diagonal avenues that sometimes terminate in a building or a monument. This order is the rectangular grid pattern of the local structure of the city.<br /> Western Plaza acknowledges both orders since it is shaped by the rectangular grid of the local scale and is an element within the giant order of Pennsylvania Avenue.<br /> 1 Pool 3 Mall 5 Capitol<br /> 2 White House 4 L'Enfant's Plan 6 Pulaski Statue<br /> Plaque, north side<br /> THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES<br /> 1782 1782 1885<br /> OBVERSE REVERSE OBVERSE<br /> IN 1776 THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS ADOPTED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE CREATION OF A SEAL FOR THE NEW NATION.

THE U.S. NAVY, ACTING SWIFTLY TO COMBAT THE GERMAN SUBMARINE MENACE, DISPATCHED FIGHTING SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT TO EUROPEAN WATERS, SIMULTANEOUSLY IT BEGAN THE ORGANIZATION OF CONVOYS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS. TO UNDERTAKE THE TREMENDOUS WORK OF ORGANIZING THE AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES, GENERAL PERSHING LANDED IN FRANCE ON 13 JUNE 1917.<br /> BEGINNING ON 21 MARCH 1918, THE GERMAN ARMIES LAUNCHED A SERIES OF POWERFUL ATTACKS ON THE WESTERN FRONT. ON THAT DATE THERE WERE ONLY 300,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN FRANCE MOST OF THEM BUT PARIALLY TRAINED. THE FIRST OFFENSIVE ACTION BY A U.S. DIVISION CAME ON 28 MAY WHEN CANTIGNY WAS ATTACKED AND HELD DESPITE VIOLENT ENEMY REACTION.<br /> SIMULTANEOUSLY THE GERMANS SURGED ACROSS THE AISNE RIVER AND ADVANCED RAPIDLY TOWARD THE MARNE. U.S. REINFORCEMENTS HURRIEDLY BROUGHT INTO POSITIONS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE GERMAN PATH OF ADVANCE TOWARD PARIS, STOPPED THE ATTACK, THEN, ON 6 JUNE, U.S. TROOPS, INCLUDING A BRIGADE OF MARINES, STRUCK BACK AND IN FIERCE COMBAT LASTING A MONTH, RECAPTURED BELLEAU WOOD AND THE TOWN OF VAUX. THE LAST GREAT GERMAN OFFENSIVE OF THE WAR CAME ON 15 JULY ALONG THE MARNE EAST OF CHATEAU-THIERR. IT WAS PROMPTLY REPULSED IN A SEVER STRUGGLE IN WHICH AMERICAN TROOPS PLAYED A LEADING PART. THE IMMEDIATE U.S.-FRENCH COUNTERATTACK ON 18 JULY AT SOISSONS MARKED THE TURNING POINT OF THE WAR.<br /> THEREUPON THE U.S. FIRST ARMY WAS ORGANIZED AS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT AMERICAN ARMY WITH ITS OWN ASSIGNED SECTOR. AS GENERAL PERSHING HAD INSISTED FROM THE BEGINNING, UNDER HIS COMMAND. ON 12 SEPTEMBER, IT ASSAULTED THE ST. MIHIEL SALIENT WHICH HAD WITHSTOOD ALL ATTACKS FOR 4 YEARS. BY 16 SEPTEMBER, THE SALIENT WAS ELIMINATED. TEN DAYS LATER, THE FIRST ARMY LAUNCHED THE MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE SUDDENLY CONCEIVED, HURRIED IN PLAN AND PREPARATION, AND BRILLIANTLY EXECUTED, THIS BATTLE, IN WHICH OVER 1,000,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS FOUGHT, STANDS OUT AS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ARMS.<br /> DURING OCTOBER ALSO, U.S. TROOPS HAD SEIZED BLANC MONT RIDGE AND GENERAL PERSHING HAD ORGANIZED THE U.S. SECOND ARMY, WHICH ENTERED THE LINE ON THE RIGHT OF THE FIRST, ON OTHER BATTLEFIELDS, AMERICANS SERVING WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES HAD ATTACKED IN AUGUST NEAR YPRES, BELGIUM AND HAD TAKEN PART IN THE SOMME OFFENSIVE. IN SEPTEMBER, NEAR ST. QUENTIN, THEY HAD BROKEN THROUGH THE HINDENBURG LINE. DURING OCTOBER, THEIR ADVANCE CONTINUED, AND NOVEMBER SAW U.S. UNITS ADVANCING FURTHER INTO BELGIUM. ELSEWHERE, AMERICANS SERVED WITH DISTINCTION IN ITALY, NORTHERN RUSSIA, AND SIBERIA.<br /> DURING THE WAR, THE AIR SERVICE WAS EXPANDED INTO A STRIKING FORCE WHICH SUPPORTED THE GROUND TROOPS AND GAVE PROMISE OF THE VITAL ROLE THAT OUR AIR FORCES WOULD PLAY IN THE FUTURE. AT THE SIGNING OF THE ARMISTICE ON 11 NOVEMBER 1918, MORE THAN 2,000,000 AMERICANS WERE SERVING IN EUROPE, EITHER WITH THE COMBAT FORCES OR IN THE SERVICES OF SUPPLY, WHOSE UNHERALDED WORK MADE POSSIBLE THE BRILLIANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ARMIES IN THE FIELD.<br /> DURING SEPTEMBER 1918 THE ALLIED FORCES LAUNCHED A GENERAL OFFENSIVE ON THE WESTERN FRONT. IN THIS OPERATION THE U.S. FIRST ARMY WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF BREAKING THROUGH THE EXTREMELY STRONG AND VITAL DEFENSIVE SYSTEM BETWEEN THE MEUSE RIVER AND THE ARGONNE FOREST. THE ATTACK STARTED ON 26 SEPTEMBER AND AFTER TWO DAYS OF INTENSE FIGHTING THE DOMINATING HILL OF MONTFAUCON WAS CAPTURED. THE GERMAN TROOPS STUBBORNLY DEFENDED EACH POSITION, BUT BY 30 SEPTEMBER HAD BEEN DRIVEN BACK SIX MILES.<br /> ON 4 OCTOBER, THE ASSAULT WAS RENEWED. THE RESISTANCE ENCOUNTERED WAS DESPERATE WITH THE ENEMY RAPIDLY POURING IN MORE DIVISIONS FROM OTHER BATTLE FRONTS. THOUGH DUBJECTED TO FURIOUS COUNTERATTACKS, THE ADVANCE CONTINUED RELENTLESSLY ON THE LEFT FLANK. A BRILLIANT ATTACK IN THE AIRE VALLEY MADE POSSIBLE THE CAPTURE OF THE ARGONNE FOREST. ON THE RIGHT U.S. AND FRENCH TROOPS CROSSED THE MEUSE WHERE SEVERE FIGHTING ENSUED FOR POSSESSION OF THE HEIGHTS BEYOND. ANOTHER ASSAULT ON 14 OCTOBER DEVELOPED INTO A PROLONGED STRUGGLE AGAINST VIOLENT RESISTANCE BUT THESE ATTACKS, NEAR CUNEL AND ROMAGNE, BROKE THROUGH THE GERMAN MAIN LINE OF DEFENSE AND PENETRATED THAT LINE BEYOND THE VILLAGES OF ST. JUVIN AND GRANDPRE.<br /> THE LAST GREAT OFFENSIVE BEGAN ON 1 NOVEMBER WITH THE CAPTURE OF THE FORMIDABLE POSITION ON BARRICOURT HEIGHTS. THREE DAYS LATER THE ENEMY WAS IN FULL RETREAT WEST OF THE MEUSE CONTINUOUSLY PURSUED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER.

The soldier also represents, on a second level, the American experience of World War I. This illustration shows the artistic process from initial sketch, to clay sculpture, to finished bronze.<br /> <br /> The sculpture is the work of Sabin Howard, who together with architect Joseph Weishaar won the competition to redesign Pershing Park as a national World War I memorial. Howard began by viewing thousands of photographs of the war. He then brought actors and models into his studio, where he posed them in scenes inspired by his research. Rather than putting them into static, artificial poses, he gave them stage directions to move through a scene, and then captured the motion in more than 12,000 photos. <br /> <br /> Howard then selected and assembled images into a series of tableaus similar to what is before you. As Howard took new photos and revised the images, the story evolved. The process culminated in a six-foot-long scale model or \"maquette\" of the proposed sculpture.<br /> <br /> Once the maquette was approved, Howard re-shot every figure in a rig holding 160 high-speed digital cameras. Working with Pangolin Editions foundry and Steve Russell Studios, Howard generated 3-D computer images from the terabytes of digital data. Pangolin then created full-scale polyurethane versions of the images, which formed the armatures for the sculpture. This process, which took about 15 months to complete, would have taken six years using traditional methods.<br /> <br /> Howard then applied clay to the armatures and began sculpting the figures. As each of four sections is completed, it is cast in bronze. When all four sections have been cast, they will be re-assembled and shipped here for installation. <h2>Photo captions</h2> Sculptor Sabin Howard sculpts a maquette of \"A Soldier's Journey.\"<br /> Howard works on the clay sculpture that will ultimately be cast in bronze.",

Pershing died in 1948. The troops he led to victory 30 years before in World War I wanted a memorial. of the potential locations, the block that you are standing on was the most appealing. It was available and it was next to the most famous street in the nation's capital.<br /> <br /> Pennsylvania Avenue is the symbolic and physical connection between the Capitol and the White House. Early on, the street attracted stores, hotels, and theaters. But after 120 years, the federal government needed more space. Workers demolished many blocks of old buildings, including this one. Offices were built on the other side of Pennsylvania Ave. but this block sat empty.<br /> <br /> By 1959, approvals and a design for a Pershing memorial were complete. The project only needed money. Then, John F. Kennedy rode up Pennsylvania Avenue during his 1961 Inauguration Day paratde. He noticed that this area was r un-down and reportedly told an aide to \"fix it.\" Kennedy's request became a priority and the Pershing Memorial went on hold while a larger plan was developed.<br /> <br /> The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation dedicated Pershing Park in 1981. In the intervening years, planners had changed the purpose of the block from a memorial to a place for many activities. A tribute to the general, designed by Wallace Harrison, was included.<br /> <br /> The rest of the site was a modernist landscape designed by M. Paul Friedberg. Grassy hills secluded the park from the city. A sunken area became a pool in warm weather and a skating rink in cold. A kiosk rented skates and sold food. Seating at the park's edges gave people a place to eat their lunches or watch skaters.<br /> <br /> As the 2014-2018 centennial of World War I approached, Pershings last living soldier, Frank Buckles, wanted a national memorial to the war. Authorities again proposed and considered locations and selected this site. Congress passed a law in 2014 converting Pershing Park into the World War I Memorial.<br /> <br /> Photo captions:<br /> 1846 - Today this place is the World War I Memorial but its first name was simply \"Block 226.\"<br /> 1875 - The earliest structures on this block were theaters and row houses.<br /> 1939 - This block existed as an immense traffic island for many years.<br /> 1981 - Friedberg's Pershing Park in front of the Willard Hotel, undergoing expansion.<br />  ",

The shoreline roughly paralleled 15th Street, skirted around the Washington Monument which stood almost at the river's edge, and then followed what is now the current route of Constitution Avenue. In the 1880s, planners developed a strategy for reclaiming this area, which at low tide was nothing but mud flats. Dredging operations and seawall construction created the Tidal Basin and East and West Potomac Parks. In 1897, the United States Congress designated this new section of the city as parkland \"for the recreation and scenic pleasure of the people.\"<br /> <br /> Caption 1: This Currier and Ives print shows the original Potomac shoreline. Note how close the Washington Monument is to the river.<br /> <br /> Caption 2: This photograph, taken in 1892, shows the newly created Hains Point area.

St NW, this memorial reflects on the legacy of Japanese incarceration camps in the United States during World War II. Many Japanese Americans were treated with suspicion and as potential spies, and were sent to incarceration camps, in many cases for several years, to sit out the war because of their race, not because of any actual espionage. As a result, many were displaced and were never able to return home when the war ended.<br /> <br /> The memorial incorporates symbolism such as a zen garden motif, but the most striking feature may be the bronze sculpture of Japanese cranes entangled in barbed wire.</p> <h2>Inscriptions</h2> <h4>Pool edge</h4> <p>\"Here we admit a wrong. Here we affirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.\"<br /> President Ronald W Reagan Upon Singing the Civil Liberties Act 1988</p> <h4>Left wall</h4> <p>\"May this memorial be a tribute to the indomitable spirit of a citizenry in World War II who remained steadfast in their faith in our democratic system.\"<br /> Norman Y. Mineta, internee at Heart Mountain, Wyoming.<br /> <br /> \"I am proud that I am an American<br /> of Japanese ancestry.<br /> I believe in this nation's<br /> institutions, ideals and traditions.<br /> I glory in her heritage.<br /> I boast of her history.<br /> I trust in her future.\"<br /> Mike M. Masaoka, civil rights advocate, staff sergeant at 442nd Regimental Combat Team.<br /> <br /> \"Our actions in passing the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 are essential for giving credibility to our constitutional system and reinforcing our tradition of justice.\"<br /> Robert T Matsui, internee at Tule Lake.</p> <h4>Right wall</h4> <p>On February 19, 1942, 73 days after the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 which resulted in the removal of 120,000 Japanese American men, women and children from their homes in the western states and Hawaii.<br /> <br /> Allowed only what they could carry, families were forced to abandon homes, friends, farms and businesses to live in ten remote relocation centers guarded by armed troops and surrounded by barbed wire fences. Some remained in the relocation centers until March 1946.<br /> <br /> In addition 4,500 were arrested by the Justice Department and held in incarceration camps, such as Santa Fe, New Mexico. 2,500 were also held at the family camp in Crystal City, Texas.<br /> <br /> Answering the call of duty, young Japanese Americans entered into military service, joining many pre-war draftees. The 100th infantry battalion and 442nd regimental combat team, fighting in Europe, became the most highly decorated army unit for its size and length of service in American Military History. Japanese Americans in the Military Intelligence Service used their bilingual skills to help shorten the war in the Pacific and thus saved countless American lives. The 1399th Engineer Construction Battalion helped fortify the infrastructure essential for victory.<br /> <br /> In 1983, almost forty years after the war ended, the federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians found that there had been no military necessity for the mass imprisonment of Japanese Americans and that a grave injustice had been done.<br /> <br /> In 1988 President Ronald W. Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act which made an apology for the injustice, provided minimal compensation and reaffirmed the nation's commitment to equal justice under the law for all Americans.</p> <h4>Rear wall</h4> <p>POSTON<br /> 17,814<br /> ARIZONA<br /> HEART MOUNTAIN<br /> 10,767<br /> WYOMING<br /> TOPAZ<br /> 8,130<br /> UTAH<br /> JEROME<br /> 8,497<br /> ARKANSAS<br /> MANZANAR<br /> 10,046<br /> CALIFORNIA<br /> ROHWER<br /> 8,475<br /> ARKANSAS<br /> TULE LAKE<br /> 18,789<br /> CALIFORNIA<br /> MINIDOKA<br /> 9,397<br /> IDAHO<br /> GILA RIVER<br /> 13,348<br /> ARIZONA<br /> AMACHE<br /> 7,318<br /> COLORADO</p> <h4>Rear wall</h4> <p>\"Japanese by Blood<br /> Hearts and Minds American<br /> With Honor Unbowed<br /> Bore the String of Injustice<br /> For Future Generations\"<br /> Tanka poem, a classical form of Japanese poetry, written by Akemi Dawn Matsumoto Ehrlich<br /> <br /> \"We believed a threat to this nation's democracy was a threat to the American dream and to al free peoples of the world.\"<br /> Spark M.

It came to be a universal sign that American soldiers had come through an area and left their mark. Eventually, during the war, Kilroy became so popular that this graffiti could be found everywhere. On ship holds, bathrooms, bridges and painted on the shells of Air Force missiles. Its origins most likely come from a British cartoon and the name of an American shipyard inspector. The myths surrounding it are numerous and often center on a German belief that Kilroy was some kind of superspy who could go anywhere he pleased.

Presiding through the Civil War, Lincoln not only saved the Union, preserving its government, boundaries, and ideals, he reinvigorated the nation's founding principle - that all men are created equal. The memorial opened in 1922, and is not only a national landmark, it is a source of contemplation and inspiration for millions of visitors each year. <br /> <br /> The memorial is built in the style of the Greek Parthenon, a rectangular structure with tall, white columns towering above those walking among them. The columns represent the states in the United States during Lincoln's presidency, and correspond to state names listed above. Symbolizing the strength of the union of the states, the motif of a bundle of rods appears throughout the building: below Lincoln's arms, in the mural above the Gettysburg Address, in the margins of the Second Inaugural Address, on the walls flanking the stairs, and in the columns of the building itself. The memorial makes little doubt of Lincoln's importance as the \"Savior of the Union.\"<br /> <br /> Until the late 1800s, the current land under the Lincoln Memorial did not exist; it was in the Potomac River. When the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deepened the river, they deposited the dredged silt along the banks, expanding the land to its current configuration. Almost immediately, the memorial's backers proposed the reclaimed land as the site for a memorial to Lincoln, but this nearly mile-wide swath of dredged, stinking mud formed an unappealing aesthetic. Its attractiveness improved after landscaping and engineering transformed the land's appearance by the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> The decision to place the memorial at its current location came in 1913, and construction started the following year. Henry Bacon designed the building, Daniel French sculpted the statue, and Jules Guerin painted the two murals. Working together, they created an iconic symbol of our nation and our ideals.</p>",

We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work, which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us.

        "notes": "Lincoln Memorial: Unity & 2nd Inaugural Address\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/lincoln-memorial-unity-2nd-inaugural-address.htm\n\n<p>Inscribed into the north side of the Lincoln Memorial chamber is President Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, delivered in 1865. In the speech, Lincoln explores the causes and meanings of the American Civil War, which was nearing its end. Above the insciption is a mural by painter Jules Guerin depicting the concept of unity. In the mural, the Angel of Truth joins the hands of two figures representing the north and south. Her protective wings cradle figures representing the arts of Painting, Philosophy, Music, Architecture, Chemistry, Literature, and Sculpture.<br /> <br /> Fellow-Countrymen, at this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.<br /> On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.<br /> One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh. If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\"<br /> With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.</p>",

King was a Baptist preacher and evangelist of nonviolent resistance. King rose to prominence through the effort to desegregate buses in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955-6 and the demonstrations in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963 where he wrote is famous \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" At the height of the Civil Rights movement, King delivered his renowned \"I Have a Dream\" speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963 during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The demonstration in particular, and the larger movement in general, helped spur lawmakers to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ending segregation and discriminatory voting laws and practices.<br /> <br /> King was particularly notable for his insistence on \"nonviolent resistance,\" a strategy he developed after studying and applying the work of Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Gandhi, and Reinhold Niebuhr, among others. King realized that non-violent resistance could only succeed \"if the groups against whom the resistance was taking place had some degree of moral conscience.\" If all Americans could see the injustice inherent in Jim Crow laws, King believed morality would compel the nation to side with the activists.<br /> <br /> The strategy of non-violence allowed the demonstrators to retain a clear position as victims of amoral oppression and violence. Television, photographs, and print media would allow the world to witness the drama of oppression in the South. Men, women, and children joined in the protests knowing that they could and would be jailed, injured, or even killed. The people's courage to put themselves in harm's way in the historic moment of the Civil Rights Movement was fueled by generations of blacks that King said had been \"seared in the flames of withering injustice,\" and bolstered by faith in Dr. King's method of non-violence.<br /> <br /> This memorial to King depicts a 30-foot carving of King on a feature called the \"Stone of Hope\" that is being moved out of a feature called the \"Mountain of Despair,\" a reference to a line in the \"I Have a Dream speech\" called back in the inscription on the side of the statue. King is represented standing firm, resolute, and thoughtful, holding a rolled stack of papers. Quotations from speeches and writings are engraved on the arced \"Inscription Wall\" on the flanks of the memorial.<br /> <br /> Books and memorabilia are available in the adjacent bookstore; head through the mountain sculpture and the building will be across the street to the left. Restrooms are also located at the bookstore, accessed from outdoors on the left side of the building. <br /> <br /> The memorial opened in August 2011. The formal dedication was scheduled for the anniversary of the March on Washington on August 28, 2011 but was postponed to October due to a hurricane. The participants included President Barack Obama. </p> <h4>Inscriptions</h4> <p>\"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" District of Columbia, 1968<br /> <br /> \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that.

That skylight looks into the floor below where the photos of many prominent and lesser-known Americans were taken. On the top three floors of this building was Brady’s Gallery where he and his assistants famously took and developed photos for over thirty years. By the time he moved into this studio in 1849, Brady had already established himself as a famous photographer in New York City. Here, Brady and his assistants photographed prominent Americans such as politicians Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln and his cabinet, Civil War generals such as U.S Grant, William Sherman, and Robert E. Lee, Native American tribal representatives, others including Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, Mary Todd Lincoln, and Clara Barton. His fame, though, came from photographs taken on the battlefield.When the war first began, Brady rushed to the Manassas battlefield and took photos of the grisly results of war. Brady himself, though, actually took very few of these photos, as his eyesight was failing by that time. Instead, he left the photography to his assistants including Alexander Gardner. Gardner traveled to Antietam and took photos that became part of Brady’s exhibition, \"The Dead at Antietam.\" Much to the anger of Gardner, Brady gave him no credit for the photos, and failed to note who took any of them. Gardner later decided to open his own studio two blocks north of here on 7<sup>th</sup> Street. While we might see Brady’s tactics as unethical today, it was quite common at the time in the world of photography. Once his assistants returned from the battlefields, Brady had the photos developed, and displayed here. During and after the war, he had several exhibitions here and in his studio in New York City. However, after four years of war, people grew tired and even uneasy of seeing photos of the dead, and Brady’s gallery struggled. He continued to operate his studio here until he went bankrupt in the 1880s. ",

Gandhi renounced all worldly possessions, devoting his life to work for the dignity and uplift of the downtrodden. To his people, he was a mahatma (Sanskrit for great soul) as proclaimed by the great Indian poet Tagore. He kept purity of means and peaceful resistance (satyagraha) at the heart of a campaign against racial discrimination in South Africa from 1893-1914. He led a famous march to the sea against the increase of salt tax in India in 1930. A charismatic leader of millions, Gandhi was the central figure in India's struggle for freedom from British rule. Gandhi was inspired by the world's great religions, and influenced by the writings of Ruskin, Thoreau and Tolstoy. His life and message inspired great leaders internationally, notably Jawaharlal Nehru, Martin Luther King, Jr., Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Nelson Mandela, The Dalai Lama, Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel and Aung San Suu Kyl.

        "notes": "Murder Bay, Washington, DC\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/murder-bay-washington-dc.htm\n\nBetween 15th and 12th Street on the south side of Pennsylvania Avenue, once stood a neighborhood in Washington DC which by the 1850s had a very poor reputation. It’s not hard to imagine why - the smell would have been horrendous. Only three blocks south, on what is now Constitution Avenue, was the Washington City canal. Originally built for commerce, by the Civil War the canal had been abandoned and was informally used as a city sewer. Everything was thrown in, from dead animals to waste. In 1863, the Secretary of the Interior called it \"a shallow, open sewer, of about one hundred and fifty feet in width, (sometimes called a canal,) which stretches its filthy surface through the heart of the city.” With so many in DC temporarily here for the war effort, this undesirable area became home to saloons, gambling establishments, and brothels for those seeking diversions. Was this why the neighborhood was nicknamed Murder Bay by some? We may never know. But while the area was unsanitary, overcrowded, and unpleasant, many people did live here, by desperation or necessity. The Civil War more than doubled the number of those living in the city and notably included formerly enslaved African Americans seeking freedom, who were legally referred to as contraband. The military argued that since the Confederacy called them property, the Union Army had the right to seize and hire them. Many so-called contrabands moved into DC in the time leading up to the Emancipation Proclamation, and were paid to build many of the fortifications around the city. Looking for places to live, in a city undergoing a housing crisis, they established contraband camps north of the White House and here along the canal. They were joined in this area by others who found themselves in difficult circumstances.  Life was difficult for these men, women, and children who lived here, and they suffered from impoverished conditions, disease, and crime. For those living here, why did they seek refuge in such horrible conditions? We will never know. They had the greater goal, though, of seeking freedom which they achieved on April 16, 1862, when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act that freed those enslaved in the District of Columbia. While they gained this freedom, they suffered from hardships that others in the city did not face.",

Or the canceled check that paid for your first home. </p> <p>Now imagine the task of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)—<em>the nation’s record keeper</em>.</p> <p>Many people know the National Archives as the keeper of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration\">Declaration of Independence</a></strong>, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution\">Constitution</a></strong>, and the <strong><a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights\">Bill of Rights</a></strong>. But we also hold in trust for the public the records of ordinary citizens—for example, military records of the brave men and women who have fought for our country, naturalization records of the immigrants whose dreams have shaped our nation, and even the canceled check from the purchase of Alaska.</p> <p>In a democracy, records belong to the people, and for more than eight decades, NARA has preserved and provided access to the records of the United States of America. Records help us claim our rights and entitlements, hold our elected officials accountable for their actions, and document our history as a nation. In short, NARA ensures continuing access to the essential documentation of the rights of American citizens and the actions of their Government.</p>",

        "notes": "National Mall\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/national-mall.htm\n\n<p>The National Mall is America's Front Yard and its national significance cannot be overstated.<br /> <br /> Today the term National Mall includes:</p> <ul> <li>the area historically referred to as 'the Mall' (which extends from the grounds of the U.S. Capitol to the Washington Monument), </li> <li>the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wamo/index.htm\">Washington Monument</a>, and</li> <li>West Potomac Park (including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/linc/index.htm\">Lincoln</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thje/index.htm\">Jefferson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/vive/index.htm\">Vietnam Veterans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kowa/index.htm\">Korean War Veterans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wwii/index.htm\">World War II</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frde/index.htm\">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> memorials)</li> </ul> <h2>The Mall</h2> <p>The National Mall is a landscaped grass lawn that stretches from the US Capitol Building to the Washington Monument Grounds, a mile to the west. The Mall is bordered by Constitution Avenue on its north side and Independence Avenue to the south. At its center is are eight four-hundred-fifty-foot long, one hundred seventy-foot wide stretches of grass lawn that run end-to-end between the Washington Monument and US Capitol building. The lawns are separated by cross streets and a thirty-five-foot wide gravel path that also spans the outer perimeter. One hundred thirty-foot wide groves of trees sit beyond the lawn on its north and south sides.</p> <h2>Significance and Symbolism</h2> <p>The central landscape itself is the clarifying the vista - and thus the symbolic relation - between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, representing the legislative and executive branches of government (since the Washington Monument stands on axis with the White House) – the primary design intent of both the L’Enfant and the McMillan Plans, which significantly contributed to the designs of the Mall. The Mall is therefore a symbol of American democracy.</p> <p>Conceived in 1791, modified in 1902, and constructed, for the most part, in 1932-36, the Mall lies at the very center of the plan of the federal city. The Period of Significance for the Mall includes two separate periods:</p> <ul> <li>1791- 1792, encompassing the year the L’Enfant Plan was created, and the subsequent year, when changes were made to the plan by L’Enfant’s successor, Andrew Ellicott; and</li> <li>1902-1975, extending from the publication of the McMillan Plan, encompassing the years 1932-1936 when the plan was revised and largely implemented, to the year when the final tree panel was planted with elm trees following the removal of the last temporary war building a few years earlier.</li> </ul> <p>The Mall gains its significance not only from being part of the L’Enfant Plan, but also from its inclusion in the central area of the McMillan Plan, and the adaptation of this plan by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., and other planners in the 1930s. Olmsted, one of the leading twentieth century American landscape architects, for many decades played a major role in the design of Washington and helped oversee the Mall’s construction in 1932-36. This construction was authorized by an Act of Congress passed in March 1929, and funded by the Public Works Administration in the early years of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration.<br /> <br /> The Mall evolved over the course of time with the nation. From a grazing ground for animals to the protests of soldiers seeking their World War I pensions and citizens seeking their civil rights, it has been the stage for our national conversation. Today the Mall provides the setting for hundreds of public events each year, from political demonstrations to cultural celebrations, all of them expressions of American citizens’ First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly. Together with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wamo/index.htm\">Washington Monument</a> and West Potomac Park (including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/linc/index.htm\">Lincoln</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thje/index.htm\">Jefferson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/vive/index.htm\">Vietnam Veterans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kowa/index.htm\">Korean War Veterans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wwii/index.htm\">World War II</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frde/index.htm\">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> memorials) the National Mall is one of the most symbolic and significant places in America. <br /> <br /> Everyday the employees of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nama/index.htm\">National Mall and Memorial Parks</a> care for the National Mall through ongoing maintenance, careful planning and management. </p>",

Today, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery continues to narrate the multi-faceted and ever-changing story of America through the individuals who have shaped its culture. Through the visual arts, performing arts, and new media, the Portrait Gallery presents poets and presidents, visionaries and villains, actors and activists whose lives form our national identity.</p> <p>As the nation's only complete collection of presidential portraits outside the White House, the \"America's Presidents\" exhibition lies at the heart of the Portrait Gallery's mission to tell the country's history through the individuals who have shaped it. Gilbert Stuart's \"Lansdowne\" painting of George Washington is the grand introductory image to this exhibition. In 2000, the Portrait Gallery was in danger of losing this painting—which had been on loan since the museum's opening in 1968—when its owner decided to sell it. A generous gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation allowed the \"Lansdowne\" painting to be purchased as a gift to the nation. \"America's Presidents\" continues to acquire portraits—including paintings, sculpture, photographs, caricatures, video, and time-based media—of each succeeding president. </p> <p>Over the years the collections, which were initially restricted to paintings, prints, drawings, and engravings, have grown to over 23,000 items in all media, from daguerreotypes to digital. In the late 1990s, the Portrait Gallery began commissioning portraits of presidents, beginning with George H. W. Bush. In 2006, the Portrait Gallery hosted the first Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, now a prestigious triennial event, which also brings commissioned works into the collection. The 2013 winner was Bo Gehring, whose close-up video and sound portrait of jazz musician Esperanza Spalding draws delight and praise from visitors.</p>",

The first National Theatre was built here in 1835, but less than 10 years later it burned down. Theaters were notorious firetraps at the time, and many burned. It was rebuilt only to burn down again in the late 1850s, after which it remained vacant for over five years.At the start of the Civil War, as the National was being rebuilt, there were only two theatres in the capital, the Washington Theatre and Canterbury Hall. Canterbury Hall was a variety theater, which would later become vaudeville. Opening its doors in 1804, the Washington Theatre was the oldest theatre in DC, situated on the corner of 11<sup>th</sup> Street and Pennsylvania Avenue where the IRS building is today. During the first two years of the war, the Washington Theatre filled the entertainment void, as it was the only respectable theatre in town. On January 23, 1862, the Washington Theatre hosted President Abraham Lincoln and his wife Mary, where they saw an Italian opera. President Lincoln returned the following year in April to see a comedy with his son, Tad. Ironically, two weeks later, the actor John Wilkes Booth started leasing and managing the theatre. He continued to manage it for the next six months, before giving up his lease to the actress Laura Keene whose path he crossed again at Ford’s Theatre on April 14, 1865.By 1863, the Washington Theatre now had competition. On tenth street, John T. Ford had opened a new theater, Ford’s Theatre. Additionally, the National was finally finished, now called Grover’s Theatre for its manager, Leonard Grover. During the Civil War, this theatre became a place where the city residents escaped from the horrors of war. The three-story theater could hold over two thousand people. On the first floor and lower balcony, were the most expensive seats. The upper balcony were the cheap seats, set aside for the working class. Conveniently, Grovers provided them with a saloon. This third level, which was segregated, was likely the only option for African Americans seeking entertainment. Grover’s was also a favorite spot for the Lincoln family who attended numerous plays at the theater. On April 14, 1865, Tad Lincoln was here watching Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp when he learned the horrible news that his father had been shot at Ford’s Theatre.",

Grief holds her covered face against the shoulder of History and weeps in mourning. History holds a stylus and a tablet that was inscribed \"They died that their country might live.\" Below Grief and History, another life-size classical female figure represents Victory, holding high a laurel wreath and carrying an oak branch, signifying strength. Below her are the infant Mars, the god of war, and the infant Neptune, god of the sea. The shaft of the monument is decorated with wreaths, ribbons and scallop shells.</p> <p>Facing the U.S. Capitol is Peace, a classical figure draped from the waist down and holding an olive sprig. Below her are symbols of peace and industry. A dove, now missing and not documented in any known photographs, once nested upon a sheaf of wheat in a grouping of a cornucopia, turned earth, and a sickle resting across a sword. Opposite, the symbols of science, literature and art (including an angle, a gear, a book, and a pair of dividers) signify the progress of civilization that peace makes possible.</p> <p>At the corners of the monument, four marble globes are visually supported by massive brackets. The fountain below, with a jet on each side, empties into a quatrefoil-shaped basin. Inscribed \"In memory of the officers, seamen and marines of the United States Navy who fell in defense of the Union and liberty of their country, 1861-1865,\" this sculptural group has also been called the Naval Monument.</p> <p>The sculptor of the monument was Franklin Simmons (1839-1913), who was born in Maine, where he became known for his portrait busts. He worked in Rome after 1867, when he received the commission for a statue of <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/roger-williams\">Roger Williams</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/about-national-statuary-hall-collection\">National Statuary Hall collection</a>. In all, he created four statues and three busts for the United States Capitol. The Peace Monument is an example of his idealized <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/architecture-styles/neoclassical-architecture-capitol-hill\">neoclassical</a> sculpture.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>Peace Monument, first intended for Annapolis, was conceived by Admiral David D. Porter, who had commanded fleets of gunboats and troop transports during the war. Porter first sketched a simple design depicting Grief and History; beginning in 1865, he raised funds from private contributors, and the monument was commissioned from Simmons in 1871. The sculptor carved the Carrara marble in Rome and worked directly with Admiral Porter on many changes in the designs, including the addition of other figures. The architectural part of the monument was made by the Bonanni Brothers of Carrara, Italy, under Simmons's direction. The marble pieces were shipped to Washington in 1876; in 1877 the monument was erected on the base of Maine blue granite (designed by Architect of the Capitol <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/architect-of-the-capitol/edward-clark\">Edward Clark</a>); and the final figure, Peace, was set into place in January 1878.\"</p>",

Disability rights advocates, including the National Organization on Disability, successfully lobbied President Bill Clinton and Congress to add this explicit portrayal in 2001. The new statue depicted FDR as his family and close associates saw him. Why do you think the original designers left out a statue like this one? </p> <h3>A Carefully Crafted Image</h3> <p>The original 1997 memorial barely hinted at Franklin Roosevelt's paralyzed legs- much as FDR had during his Presidency. Roosevelt's battle with polio was not a secret. The president worried that if people knew he was unable to walk, his opponents could portray him as too weak for office. Years before live video, the press agreed not to report on FDR using a wheelchair or aides carrying the president. <br /> <br /> \"Franklin's illness... gave him strength and courage he had not had before. He had to think out the fundamentals of living and learn the greatest of all lessons- infinite patience and never ending persistence.\" - Eleanor Roosevelt (Below the quote is the quote in braille symbols, but at a size too large to be read by those who can read braille.)<br /> <br /> These hand sketches (right) appear on the back of the FDR statue in the Prologue. FDR believed a standard 1920s wheelchair was too bulky, so he designed his own. He oversaw the construction of his wheelchair, created by adding wheels to a kitchen chair. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inscriptions:</strong></p> <p>Arriving at the west end of the Franklin Delano Memorial from West Basin Drive, one enters the paved entrance plaza. Zelcova trees shade the plaza. Straight ahead is a wall of large stone blocks stacked four rows high. Three lines of inscription on the wall reads:</p> <p><em>Franklin Delano Roosevelt<br /> President Of The United States<br /> 1933 – 1945</em><br /> <br /> There is an inscription, <em>Prolouge</em>, on the pavement in front of FDR. </p>",

Under Roosevelt's urging, representatives from 26 countries signed a \"Declaration by United Nations\" in 1942. After FDR died, Eleanor Roosevelt served as a delegate to the UN. She chaired the commission that adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. <br /> <br /> FDR (seated, second from the left) signed the \"Declaration by United Nations\" in Washington on January 1, 1942. The countries agreed to \"defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands.\"  <h3>Room Four Fountain</h3> The United States created a diplomatic framework to prevent another world war. The fear of nuclear war between former allies and nuclear powers the United States and the Soviet Union maintained a Cold War peace. The unorderly blocks in this fountain represent this uneasy stability.

There sits a larger than life statue of FDR wearing a cloak, portrayed in one of his favorite chairs at Hyde Park, New York. Hidden from view are the wheels on the chair located on the back. The wheels are there, if one looks. Just as FDR hid his disability due to polio, Halprin wanted to make sure the disability was hidden from visitors to the memorial. Accessibility advocates had lobbied during the design process for the statue of FDR statue to be shown in a wheelchair. Halprin, however, was a big fan of FDR and thus wanted to hold true to what FDR did during his presidency, hiding his disability. Accessibility groups continued to lobby even after the memorial was dedicated and won approval for a second statue of FDR, which is located in the Prologue Room. Next to the statue of FDR in Room Three is a statue of his dog, Fala, a Scottish terrier. Both bronze statues were sculpted by Neil Estern.</p> <h3>Wartime President</h3> <p>FDR said the US must be a \"great aresal for democracy.\" His administration sent military supplies to allies like Great Britain. After entering World War II, FDR and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill formed a close alliance. America, Great Britain, Canada, France, Australiam and other democracies often fought side by side. Join by the Soviet Union during the war, the Allies defeated the Axis powers.<br /> <br /> FDR joined British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (left) and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin (right) at the second \"Big Three\" conference in Yalta.

With victory in sight, FDR made a final trip to Eastern Europe and the Middle East. At Yalta, he negotiated post-war agreements with the Soviet Union and Great Britain. On his return, Roosevelt addressed Congress seated, saying, \"it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs.\" He died months before the end of World War II. <br /> <br /> This bas relief (right) by sculptor Leonard Baskin represents a grieving nation. Baskin placed a riderless, blanket-draped horse honoring the fallen commander at the head of the procession. Mourners with heads bowed walk behind the casket. <br /> <br /> FDR died on April 12, 1945. New President Harry truman told reporters he felt as though \"the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.\" A horse-drawn caisson transported Roosevelt's body through Washington, D.C., from Union Station to the White House.  <h3>Memorial Quotes in Room Four</h3> <em>\"More than an end to war, we want an end to the beginnings of all wars.\"</em> Undelivered Address, Prepared for April 13, 1945<br /> <br /> <em>\"Unless the peace that follows recognizes that the whole world is one neighborhood and does justice to the whole human race, the germs of another world war will remain as a constant threat to mankind.\"</em> Radio Address, February 12, 1943",

Starting as a member of the Senate Park (McMillan) Commission in 1901, Jr. founded and served on the Commission of Fine Arts from 1910 to 1918, and was a member of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission from 1926 to 1932.<br /> <br /> The National Capital Park and Planning Commission was tasked with restoring the National Mall to its original design as Pierre Charles L’Enfant had envisioned it. Olmsted Jr.’s redesign of the National Mall, beginning in the mid-1930s, helped to transform a densely planted Victorian park into formally arranged lawn panels lined with trees. This design would emphasize the importance of the view between the U.S. Capitol Building and the Washington Monument.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. made radical planting changes during his work on the National Mall, removing nearly every tree and replacing them with rows of American elms, following what was described in the 1901 McMillan Plan. Olmsted’s work of many decades, not just on the National Mall but Washington D.C., helped create a city threaded by parks, creating a unified special composition.",

FDR campaigned on keeping the US out of the war while secretly providing weapons and ships to democratic Great Britain without Congress knowing. These resources helped Great Britain fight authoritarian German and Japanese forces. With conflict raging off both coasts, voters reelected President Roosevelt to an unprecedented third term. Within a year, a Japanese attack on a Hawaiian naval base compelled the US to enter the war. <br /> <br /> FDR realized the US military was too small and outdated to fight a modern war. He authorized the first peacetime draft and the construction of new ships, aircraft, and other material. After the Japanese bombed the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war in December 1941. <h3>Memorial Quotes in Room Three</h3> \"We must be the great arsenal of democracy.\" Radio Address, December 29, 1940.<br /> <br /> \"I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded... I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed... I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war.\" Address at Chautauqua, New York, August 14, 1936.  <h3>Tumbled Blocks</h3> By 1940 military conflict raged from China and Australia to Africa and Europe. Projecting his desire to stay out of the war, FDR declared, \"I have seen war.... I hate war.\" These tumbled blocks represent the breakdown of international order. FDR's words did not prevent the US joining the fighting. <br />  ",

In addition to being a functioning meeting hall, it also houses important American art, and stands as an architectural symbol in its own right.</span></p> <p><span>Construction of the Capitol building began in 1793. Using ancient architectural models, the young American republic sought to connect its radical experiment in democracy with familiar, stoic building forms that projected strength and stability. The building would continue to evolve, change, and be added to in order to meet the needs of a growing Congress and an evolving American public over the course of the next two hundred years under the care of dozens of architects.</span></p> <p>Congress convened in the Capitol for the first time in 1800, despite the building not being completed. The first iteration was completed in 1811 but did not last long. On August 22, 1814, about 4,500 British troops arrived in southern Maryland, 16 miles from Washington, D.C., to avenge an attack on the Canadian capital the year prior. The troops arrived in the city on August 24<sup>th</sup>, and began following their orders to destroy public buildings. The Capitol was <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc29/pdf/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc29-6-3.pdf\">burned</a> at approximately 9:00 in the evening, but a light rain minimized the permanent damage.

As Hart described the sculpture, \"The contrast between the innocence of their youth and the weapons of war underscores the poignancy of their sacrifice. There is about them the physical contact and sense of unity that bespeaks the bonds of love and sacrifice that is the nature of men at war...Their strength and their vulnerability are both evident.\"<br /> <br /> The base of the 60-foot flagpole contains emblems of the five services of the military.

In 1816 John Tayloe built a row of six two-story-and-attic houses as an investment. By 1818 the corner was being used as a hotel. In 1847 Benjamin Ogle Tayloe leased the establishment to Henry A. Willard and his brother, Edwin. Edwin withdrew from the management, to be replaced by his brother Joseph C.Willard in 1849. In 1853 the brothers purchased the entire row of houses from Tayloe's heirs, uniting the buildings architecturally in a major remodeling. In 1858 the Willards expanded again, purchasing the property of Col. James Kearney on the southwest corner of 14th and F Streets. They demolished the Kearney Mansion and built a six-story addition to the hotel. Next an adjoining Presbyterian Church on F Street was acquired and converted to an auditorium known as Willard Hall. In succeeding years, as business increased, the roofs of the conglomerate hotel were raised to allow for vertical expansion. Finally, at the turn of the century, the Willard underwent a massive transformation.<br /> <br /> The new Willard, designed by New York architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh and erected by the George A. Fuller Company, was hailed at its opening as Washington's first skyscraper. Completed in 1904, the new building saw an addition of 100 rooms in 1925, broadening the F Street facade by about 49 feet. The property remained in the Willard family until 1946, closed in 1968, and underwent extensive renovation, again opening its doors in 1986.<br /> <br /> Presidents <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/zachary-taylor.htm\">Taylor</a>, Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Lincoln</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ulysses-s-grant.htm\">Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wiho/index.htm\">Taft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woodrow-wilson-prophet-of-peace-teaching-with-historic-places.htm\">Wilson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/moru/learn/historyculture/calvin-coolidge.htm\">Coolidge</a>, and Harding stayed at the Willard. Other notable guests have included Charles Dickens, Buffalo Bill, David Lloyd George, P.T. Barnum, Lord and Lady Napper and countless others. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/walt-whitman.htm\">Walt Whitman</a> included the Willard in his verses and Mark Twain wrote two books there in the early 1900s. It was Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, irritated at the Willard's high prices, who coined the phrase \"What this country needs is a good 5-cent cigar.\"<br /> <br /> The Willard Hotel is located at 1401-09 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 15, 1974 and is part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/paav/index.htm\">Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site</a>.</p>",

The memorial also includes the Peace Fountain, a cascade of water behind an excerpt from the poem “The Young Dead Soldiers Do Not Speak” by Archibald MacLeish; engraved quotes and references to theaters, campaigns and battles in which American forces participated; and exhibits about the role of the United States in World War I.<br /> <br /> The memorial’s central feature, a sculpture titled <em>A Soldier’s Journey</em>, is scheduled for installation in September 2024. The 58-foot-long bas-relief sculpture by Sabin Howard will feature 38 figures depicting the journey of a recurring American soldier and representing the larger American experience of World War I. <br /> <br /> The memorial is located at the former Pershing Park, 1.76-acres along Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 14th Street NW and 15th Street NW, across from the White House Visitor Center. The World War I Memorial builds on the original design of Pershing Park, dedicated at the site in 1981 as the American Expeditionary Forces Memorial. </p> <h4><strong>Sculpture - <em>A Soldier's Journey</em></strong></h4> <p>Memorial architect Joe Weishaar calls Sabin Howard’s <em>A Soldier’s Journey</em> sculpture “The Everyman.” Thirty-eight separate figures, spread over approximately 58 feet of wall towards the western end of the Memorial Core, portray the experience of one American soldier. Starting from the left, the soldier takes leave from his wife and daughter, charges into combat, sees men around him killed, wounded, and gassed, and recovers from the shock to come home to his family. The figures are mounted on the wall.<br /> <br /> In the <em>departure</em>, the soldier’s daughter hand him his helmet, while his wife touches him with a restraining arm, as if to hold him back as he answers the call to battle – representing the debate over American involvement in the war. In the <em>initiation</em>, the soldier joins the parade to war, as the United States joins the epic battle in Europe.<br /> <br /> The parade, and the work as a whole, includes African Americans and other ethnic groups who answered their country’s call.<br /> <br /> In the middle scene, the <em>ordeal</em>, the parade devolves into the tension before the charge and then the tumult of desperate and violent combat. At the center our hero calls his comrades into battle, illustrating the famous American battle cry from Belleau Wood: “Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?”<br /> <br /> The <em>aftermath</em> depicts the physical and mental wounds of the fighters. Here are represented American women who served at home and on the fighting front. And here the turbulent, left-to-right narrative pauses, as the hero stops and looks directly at the viewer. The soldier’s look of shock and loss – the thousand-year stare – along with the empty helmets piled at his feet, invite the viewer to stop and contemplate with him the costs of war.<br /> <br /> In the <em>return</em>, the soldier rejoins the homecoming parade. One figure look back with pride, while a flag bearer leads the country forward into “the American century.” Our soldier returns home and hands his helmet back to his daughter. She looks into the helmet and sees World War II, the war that will bring America back to Europe little more than 20 years later.<br /> <br /> Due to the size and complexity of the casting process, the sculpture will not be installed September 2024. Until then, artwork showing what the final product will look like will be in its place. The wall is surrounded by water and is viewed from a platform several feet in front of it.</p> <h4>The Belvedere</h4> <p>A belvedere is an architectural feature providing a particularly scenic view. At the World War I Memorial, the Belvedere is the conceptual center of the memorial, as it provides a commanding view of the elements and features of the memorial – the American Expeditionary Forces memorial and General John J. Pershing statue is located to the viewer’s left, the <em>A Soldier’s Journey </em>sculpture is to the front, and flagstaff are and quotes from President Woodrow Wilson and others are to the right.<br /> <br /> At the center of the Belvedere is a large rendering of the front of the World War I Victory Medal centered upon the memorial floor. The medal depicts a winged Victory holding a shield and sword on the front, heralding the dawn of a new era of peace.<br /> <br /> Exhibit panels along the Belvedere wall describe the American accomplishments of the war, roles played by Americans of all forces and the legacy of the war.</p> <p><br /> Encircling the exterior of the Belvedere are listed the names of the campaigns in which U.S. forces participated during the war.</p> <ul> <li>Cambrai</li> <li>Somme Defensive</li> <li>Lys</li> <li>Aisne</li> <li>Montdidier-Noyon</li> <li>Champagne-Marne</li> <li>Aisne-Marne</li> <li>Somme Offensive</li> <li>Oise-Aisne</li> <li>Ypres-Lys</li> <li>Saint Mihiel</li> <li>Meuse-Argonne</li> <li>Vittorio Veneto</li> <li>North Russia</li> <li>Siberia</li> <li>Atlantic Convoys</li> <li>Western Atlantic</li> <li>North Sea</li> <li>Mediterranean</li> </ul>",

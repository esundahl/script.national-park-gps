        "notes": "15-inch Rodman Cannon\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/15-inch-rodman-cannon.htm\n\n<p>The sheer immensity of the two Rodman guns at Fort Foote made them objects of curiosity wehn they were first brought to the Fort. Visitors frequently came to see them. The 15-inch Rodmans weigh about 49,000 pounds, and required 300 to 400 soldiers to move them up the bluff from river to fort. The balls fired by the smooth-bore Rodmans weigh 500 to 600 pounds and took about fifty pounds of black powder, a type of gunpowder.</p> <p>It was a special occasion each time the big guns were fired. On February 27, 1864, three shots were fired from the 15-inch Rodman. Crowds of visitors beheld the occasion. Again, on April 1, 1864, a large party from Washington came to witness the workings of the big guns. The Rodman was fired at a 25-degree elevation at a range of three miles. Because the guns put off an intense concussive force, it was noted that observers would raise their toes and open their mouths to lessen the effects.<br /> The cannon closest to the river is of particular importance. Engraved on its 15-inch muzzle is 'No. 1' and the initials 'TJR'. The 'No 1' is in reference to the fact that this cannon was the first produced by Cyrus Alger and Company. The initials are of the individual who inspected the gun, in this case Brigadier General Thomas J. Rodman who also designed the weapon. </p>",

It is free and is open year-round during daylight hours. The trail is excellent for biking, jogging and walking. Pets are welcome along the trail as long as they are on a 6 foot or shorter leash. The trail is 3.5 miles long in Anacostia Park, but you have many options to extend your journey. You can do a 7.8 mile loop by crossing the Anacostia River and riding along the west bank or the river. You can also continue along the trail north to Bladensburg Park in Maryland, or south by going across one of the bridges into downtown DC to the Capitol Hill and Navy Yard neighborhoods.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{cbf3787d-d303-45ec-a1fa-ee27859c2d6f}{97}\" paraid=\"947513966\">Local attractions along the trail in Anacostia Park include the Anacostia Park Pavillion, where you can rent roller-skates from Memorial Day until Labor Day. The Anacostia Pool, tennis courts, basketball courts and many athletic fields provide the opportunity for sports and recreation. The trail connects other nearby areas to explore including the Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens, River Terrace Park, the Maine Avenue Fish Market and Wharf, Nationals Park, Historic Anacostia, and the Bladensburg Marina Park.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{cbf3787d-d303-45ec-a1fa-ee27859c2d6f}{103}\" paraid=\"44808534\">The newest portion of the riverwalk trail that extended Benning Road NE to the Bladensburg Trail was completed in 2016. Mileage markers were completed in 2022 to assist in navigation and directions for trail users. </p>",

A campaign among freed slaves raised $18,000 for the memorial. Frederick Douglass delivered the keynote speech at the monument's dedication on April 14, 1876, which was attended by President Ulysses S. Grant and other political figures. The Emancipation Monument served as the primary national memorial to Lincoln until 1922, when the Lincoln Memorial was dedicated in West Potomac Park. Sculptor Thomas Ball depicted a life-size figure of Abraham Lincoln, extending one hand over a kneeling African American man while holding a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation in the other hand. The former slave is depicted as rising, with broken shackles on his wrists.

Folger Park for years was referred to as The Square North of Providence Hospital.<br /> <br /> The park contains much of the city's rich architectural history. A cast iron fence was added in 1881 in the form of fasces, and three years later the planting of 1000 ornamental trees gave the site beautiful scenery.

Constructiobn commenced between Ocotober and December of 1861, and \"completed\" in the spring of 1862. The fort was built to protect a critical Ridge<br /> Road (Alabama Avenue) intersection and was supported by Forts Meigs and Chaplin to the north and Fort Davis to the south.<br /> <br /> Fort DuPont was a regular hexagonal redoubt, designed for 14 guns, 12<br /> firing through embrasures. Fort Dupont had six sides, each 100 feet long, protected by a deep moat and trees felled side-by-side with branches pointing outward. It was named for Flag Officer Samuel F. Dupont, who commanded the naval victory at Port Royal, South Carolina, in November 1861.<br /> <br /> It was never a strong work and in 1862, a commission studying the Defenses of Washington noted that a deep ravine to the west of the fort should be covered by a blockhouse. At other times, traverses to cover the sally port, magazine and rifle pits to the cover approaches were recommended.</p> <p>In April 1864, Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer, advised the abandonment of Fort Dupont. The army officially abandoned the fort in 1865. The grounds reverted to its original landowner, Michael Caton. </p> <p>Although its garrison and guns never saw battle, Fort Dupont served as a lifeline of freedom. Runaway slaves found safety here before moving on to join the growing community of \"contrabands\" in Washington. The barracks and guns are gone, but the fort's earthworks can still be traced near the picnic area on Alabama Avenue.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the National Capital Planning Commission acquired the old fort and surrounding land for recreation. A golf course was constructed and as the city grew, golf gave way in 1970 to the sports complex along Ely Place that now includes tennis and basketball courts, athletic fields, a softball diamond, and an indoor ice rink.  Once where soldiers viewed farmlands, park visitors now grow fruits and vegetables in the community garden.</p>",

Stanton appointed a commission to examine the efficiency of the Defenses of Washington. The commision evaluated each of the forts, and made recommendations for improvement. Toward the end of the account, one gap was noted in the defensive arrangement:</span></p> <p>\"The commission furthers their opinion that the Defense of Washington cannot be considered complete without the defense of the river against an enemy's armed vessels. Foreign intervention would bring against us always in superior naval force on the Potomac, and we are, even now, threatened with Confederate iron-clads fitted in English Ports. The Commission believe on Jones' Point near Alexandria, a battery of six guns of the heaviest caliber, say four 200-pounders and two 15-inch guns in casements, and by constructing a battery of ten guns and a covering work on the opposite shore of the Potomac, at the near Roziers Bluff. An examination had been made, revealing a most favorable and strong position on that side, easily communicated with by water. Surveys are in progress.\"</p> <p>The suggestion of the committee was accepted, and the work on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fofo/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Fort Foote</a> began at Rozier's Bluff in 1863. </p> <p>The grand earthwork was first constructed in 1863 by the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, commanded by Colonel William Seward, Jr. The site, together with Battery Rodgers in Alexandria, Virginia, was designed for river defense. Their massive 15-inch Rodman guns (Columbiads) and 200-pounder Parrott rifles possessed the firepower to penetrate enemy ironclad ships. The Federal engineers had perfected earthwork construction around Washington D.C. by this point in the war. Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer Defenses of Washington, described the two sites as \"model works.\"Fort Foote was named in honor of Rear Admiral Andrew H. Foote, who distinguished himself in the actions against the confederate forts on the Mississippi Rivers and died of wounds on June 26,1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote's guns became a tourist attraction for government officials, military officers, and well-connect civilians, who traveled on river transports from the city to the Maryland shoreline to see the 49,000 lbs Rodmans test fired. General Barnard invited President Abraham Lincoln to visit the fort in late 1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote remained an active military installation until 1874. The U.S. Army performed a number of tests and experiments with cannons, carriages, and stone magazines at the site. <br /> <br />  </p> <p><span> </span></p>",

To fix this problem 400 yards of rifle pits were constructed to cover its approaches. Structures were built that would provide a full range on which to attack oncoming troops (bastionets). These structures were projected from three angles of the exterior slope of the ditch (counterscarp) to provide reverse and covering fire for the exterior slopes. After Early's raid in 1864, the engineers laid abatis and constructed rifle trenches toward Anacostia River in order to prevent a flanking movement from that side.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was one of the later forts to be abandoned. At the end of the Civil War, Fort Mahan was named among the 11 works that occupied commanding positions and should be retained for a skeleton defense of the city. However, it was abandoned and reverted back to the Manning family. Mary Manning claimed damages in 1864, and in 1865 bought the abatis around the fort for $31 at public auction.</p> <p>Structures that were built at Fort Mahan included a guard house, at least two barracks, officers' quarters, a mess house, stables and some sheds.</p> <p><span>Fort Mahan was named after Dennis Hart Mahan. who was an American soldier and educator. In 1824, he graduated from West Point. He taught taught civil and military engineering at the Military Academy, and became an authority on military engineering. His works include: Complete Treatise on Field Fortifications (1836), Summary on the Cause of Permanent Fortifications and of the Attack and Defense of Permanent Works (1850), and An Elementary Course of Military Engineering (2 vol., 1866–67). </span></p>",

Since this area belonged to the War, Jefferson Davis. Davis agreed to allow a light to be placed with conditions that \" the light shall be placed upon the wharf and not within any of the fortifications; and the light keeper shall be subordinate to the military command of the post and public ground in all that relate to police and discipline. If the care of the light can be placed with the Ordnance Sergeant, it will prevent interference with his present charge of other public property.\" With this permission the Lighthouse Board appropriated $500 for a light. This first light was an 18.5-foot iron post, which was placed November 7,1857. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{215}\" paraid=\"1587903521\">The 1857 light pole remained until the 1870's when growth of the wharf caused obstruction to the light pole. A small 16-foot tower was built closer to the water's edge to replace to light pole. This was considered the first \"real\" lighthouse and a sixth order illuminant lens was placed in the tower. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{221}\" paraid=\"1996703945\">The current tower was built in 1889 as the Fog Bell Tower.  In 1901 the light was moved to the tower, due to the surrounding area overshadowing the “real” lighthouse.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{229}\" paraid=\"1672031331\">In 1954, the light was changed to unmanned automatic flashing red light. During the years that followed the wharf and all buildings associated with the lighthouse were removed. The light/fog bell tower is all that remains of a once active light station. Sometime during the late 1970's the fog bell mechanism broke, ending the bell ringing at Fort Washington. In 2020, the United States Coast Guard, removed the triangle red marker and light to the river, ending a more than a century of active duty. The tower remains standing in its original place.  </p>",

Joining the National Park Service in 1946, the park continues to protect the Potomac River.</p> <hr /> <p>Fort Washington was the only fort protecting the approach to Washington, D.C. at the time of the War of 1812.</p> <p>When a British invasion fleet entered the Cheseapeake Bay in the Summer of 1814, the American Secretary of War did not believe Washington D.C. a valuable enough target to warrant a British attack, and so he declined to make adequate preparations for the defense of the nation's capital. </p> <p>Fort Washington was left understaffed and ill-equipped while British troops landed and engaged American defenders at Bladensburg, Maryland. After routing the Americans, British forces entered Washington and burned its public buildings. Fort Washington (sometimes referred to at the time as Fort Warburton), was soon abandoned and destroyed in order to prevent its capture by the enemy. </p> <p>After the conclusion of the War of 1812, the United States recognized the need for a more thorough and modern coastal defense system, and many new masonry forts were constructed.

Douglass was born in February 1818 on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, the son of an enslaved mother and a white father. As a child, he worked in the fields, was moved from one family to another and was hired out to shipbuilders in Baltimore. Through these years he learned to read and write, met free blacks – learning that it was possible to be African American and be free – joined the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Baltimore, and began to engage in debates. After several failed attempts to escape to the North, he succeeded in 1838, settling in New Bedford, Massachusetts, with his new wife Anna. Within the next few years, Douglass championed the right of African Americans to fight in the Union Army and in May 1863, saw two of his sons leave with the Massachusetts 54</span><sup>th</sup><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> Regiments for South Carolina. After the Civil War, he worked unceasingly for full civil rights for African Americans.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Douglass purchased his estate, Cedar Hill, in 1877. He was appointed US Minister and Counsel General to Haiti by President Benjamin Harrison, resigned the post in 1893, and returned to Cedar Hill where he died February 20, 1895.The site has a visitor center with exhibits.

Led by Walter W. Walters, the veterans set up camps and occupied buildings in various locations in Washington, DC. The largest camp was a shantytown here on the Anacostia Flats, across the river from Washington's Navy Yard. By summer, at least 20,000 people had joined the camps. When a bill to give the veterans their payment early failed in Congress, many of the protesters moved on, but many also stayed, so President Hoover sent in the army - led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur - to push them out on July 28. The camp was still inhabited by about 10,000 people, who were driven off by the cavalry with tanks and tear gas while infantry set fire to the shanties. DC's hospitals were overwhelmed with the wounded. Deemed an operational success for the army, the political fallout was a disaster for President Hoover, who lost his re-election bid later that year.</p>",

A British squadron slowly making its way up the Potomac expected resistance from the well-positioned fort. Alexandrians, fearing they were next after Washington's fall three days before, expected protection from the fort.<br /> <br /> Samuel Dyson, U.S. Army captain in command decided his 45-man garrison would be no match for the British. He ordered the fort destroyed and was later court martialed for his decision.<br /> <br /> Defenseless Alexandria negotiated surrender, and the British confiscated tobacco and other property. As the enemy withdrew down the Potomac with their prizes, angry Americans shot from shore and dispatched fire-ships with little effect.<br /> <br /> Welcome to Fort Washington's Waterside Trail<br /> <br /> Living where the land meets the water gives us everything we need: shelter in the woods, food to eat, and clean water to drink. Our climate promises a good life for the 15 million people and the more than 3,000 types of plants and animals that live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Certain soils and plant roots soak up much of the 30-40 inches of rain we receive each year. Leaves also absorb water, and forests slow a hard rain’s fall to earth. Woodlands shade the streams, and their roots hold stream banks in place. Pine trees and hardwoods layered over flowering shrubs, berry bushes, and wildflowers provide food and shelter for birds, mammals, insects, and turtles- just to name a few. In the clean, cool water nearby, fishes and shellfish feast on aquatic plants, and become food for larger fish, birds- like the Bald Eagle -and people.<br /> <br /> When rivers flood, or when rain hits land without woodlands, fast running water takes everything in its path to the bay. Pollutants from our homes, yards, cars, and work also flow into the bay. To protect the water, plants, and animals that live here, ribbons of waterside (or riparian) buffers of forests line the rivers and streams. These waterside woodlands slow the erosion of soil and absorb extra nutrients, while also providing shelter and food for wildlife. Preserving even small sections of riparian habitat helps protect our largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay. <br /> <br /> As a river meets the ocean, a dynamic world of daily and seasonal changes in saltiness and temperature becomes the home to unique plants and animals. The rhythmic tidal changes work like an engine producing food, and decomposing matter. Winter storms tear wetland plants into food for fishes and all microscopic life. These tiny aquatic plants and single-cell animals grow in abundance when nutrients churn up from the bay floor and flow off the land. In the spring, many different types of ocean fishes swim up rivers to eat and lay eggs, and then return again to the salty ocean. In the warm waters of summer, crayfish and shellfish find food, and become food. Throughout the fall, millions of migratory birds come to the Atlantic Flyway to feed on the plants, nutrients, fishes, and shellfish. Throughout the year, each part of the ecosystem depends on another in a powerful dance of life. Walking on this trail, you will see some of the plants and Animals that make their home in waterside woodlands.",

In 1861, the Union capital city was an easy target if Confederate ships sailed up the Potomac River. In just two years, a protective ring of over 60 forts sprouted around the city. Fort Foote, perched here on Rozier’s Bluff, was built with haste in eight months. The fort’s claim to fame was its high-tech coastal artillery—but its cutting-edge cannons were never tested in battle.<br /> <br /> “We are putting up an extensive water battery…which may be an object of interest to you: the excursion on the water is pleasant & the locality a beautiful one.”<br /> - John G.

During the Civil War, a temporary hospital, known as \"Lincoln Hospital\" was constructed on the site for wounded Union soldiers. Following the war, the army removed the hospital and Congress appropriated funds to improve the park with flowers, trees and pathways. Then as now, it remains one of the most popular city parks on Capitol Hill.</p> <p><br /> Lincoln Park is the largest of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cahi/index.htm\">Capitol Hill Parks</a> in Washington, D.C., and features monuments to two leaders: <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">President Abraham Lincoln</a> and educator and civil rights leader <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/mamc/index.htm\">Mary McLeod Bethune</a>. The square was part of Pierre L’Enfant’s original 1791 plan for the city and was intended for public use.<br /> <br /> During the Civil War, the square was used as a hospital for wounded troops, whom poet Walt Whitman visited on occasion. When Congress officially named the park Lincoln Square in 1867, it was the first site to bear the name of the assassinated president.<br /> <br /> To honor Lincoln's memory, Charlotte Scott, a formerly enslaved woman living in Virginia, used the first $5 she earned as a freedperson to start a fundraising campaign to build a statue in Lincoln Park. Donations were only accepted from formerly enslaved persons, primarily <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/afam/index.htm\">African American veterans</a>, though a white-run war relief organization called the Western Sanitary Commission coordinated the effort Ms. Scott started. </p> <p>Designed by Thomas Ball, the statue features President Lincoln in his characteristic frock coat, holding the Emancipation Proclamation before a kneeling black man. Modeled after Archer Alexander, the last person captured under the Fugitive Slave Act, the black man’s arm is extended to show his shackles have been broken.<br /> <br /> The memorial statue, known as the Emancipation Memorial, was placed in the park in 1876 and dedicated on April 14<sup>th</sup>, the 11<sup>th</sup> anniversary of President Lincoln’s death, with over 25,000 people in attendance. <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a> delivered the keynote address before <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/people/ulysses-s-grant.htm\">President Ulysses S. Grant</a>, his cabinet, and members of Congress.<br /> <br /> While Lincoln Park became a major tourist attraction through the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, the statue of Lincoln has not been met with universal acclaim. For many people, including Frederick Douglass, the monument perpetuated negative stereotypes about African Americans.<br /> <br /> In 1959, Congress authorized the National Council of Negro Women, Inc. (NCNW) to build a memorial the organization's founder and first president, Mary McLeod Bethune. Originally conceived to be dedicated in 1963, on the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, the urgency of the Civil Rights Movement sidelined the statue project. When it was unveiled in 1974 on the 99th anniversary of Bethune's birth, the Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial was the first statue of a woman and the first statue of an African American, on public park land in Washington, D.C. The Emancipation Memorial originally faced west toward the U.S. Capitol until it was rotated east in 1974 to face Bethune's Memorial.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Content used with permission from Eastern National’s <a href=\"http://generalstore.eparks.com/store/product/92424/Guidebook-to-African-American-History-in-the-National-Parks/\">Guidebook to African American History in National Parks.</a></strong></p>",

With its interesting walkways and beautiful vegetation, it's the perfect place to take the kids for a stroll to the playground, or enjoy a snack in the grass under any of many ornamental trees.<br /> <br /> Marion Park was first established as open ground, dating back to the original plans for the city created by Pierre L'Enfant in 1791. Also included in updated plans from Andrew Ellicott, this reservation has served continuously as a park since its first improvements in 1885. One of the larger parks in the Capitol Hill area, dating back to 1764 the tract of land was known as Houp's Addition, was originally owned by Jonathan Slater. In 1791, Mr. Slater sold the tract to William Prout, who then had to turn over the land to the federal government soon after. Improvements that were made by 1886 gave the park an ornamental elegance in the vastly developing neighborhood. In the center of the park used to stand a large vase that was filled with tropical flowers every summer. The \"Large Hilton Iron Vase\" was used to direct the flow of traffic through the park due to the carriage paths that created beautiful patterns from a bird's eye view. In 1963, the vase was removed, and the traffic patterns were redirected outside of the boundaries of Marion Park. Today, the site provides hours of serenity with the variety of trees and other vegetation. There is a play area available in one quadrant of the park that is easily accessible for toddlers.</p>",

Deeper than wide, room behind room, and exterior chimneys at one end the house was typical of an architectural style popular in lower Southern Maryland from the second half of the 18th century well into the first half of the 19th century. Homes of this style and construction were often owned by tradespeople or small landowners of modest means. As typical as this house is it is also in many ways atypical.</p> <p><br /> What makes this home more interesting is the way it was constructed. Much of it is far less “sophisticated” than one might think. Its sills and joists were laid without any support and riven clapboard of less than ideal dimensions were used in the construction of the roof and attic partitions. There is evidence that the ceiling rafters and joists were made from improperly dried wood and warped shortly after construction. No doubt other homes were built using these shortcuts, and no wonder only one, Laurel Branch, survived.<br /> If there is one aspect of the house that is the most interesting and helps us date it more precisely it is the two small, cater-cornered fireplaces. Laurel Branch is the only example of this room behind room plan with such fireplaces recorded in Charles County or as far as is known, in all of Southern Maryland. This design of corner fireplaces was common in the area between 1740 and 1770 and given all the other data the house is generally agreed to have been built circa 1770.</p>",

This tobacco barn was originally the property of William Hall of southern Anne Arundel County. He had two such barns, and they were the largest and most important structures on his property. Built well, these barns survived all manner of weather, but one of the barns, at last, was endangered by development plans. Efforts by the National Park Service and the Accokeek Foundation secured the relocation of this tobacco barn to the National Colonial Farm. The barn features fascinating construction techniques and was carefully reconstructed to preserve early agricultural messages. The original designers had made use of pieces from earlier barns. The basic construction technique is known as “Tidewater framing” and consists of plates, rafters and corner braces connected by pinned mortise and tenon joints. Hand adzed oak, walnut and chestnut timbers predominate. The roof is steeply pitched at about 54 degrees, and the eves rest on a false plate (where the soffit would normally fit) allowing for increased ventilation.</p> <p> </p> <p>The frame was covered with clapboard siding in approximately 4-foot lengths. The open spaces, where clapboards have been left off, serve to increase ventilation as well.  All siding and roofing were secured with completely hand-forged nails made in the 18th century. The tobacco barn is capable of housing 12,000-18,000 lbs of tobacco. At a time when most people have lost connection to land and agricultural roots, visitors are invited to enter the tobacco house, stand under the curing leaf and weathered beams and experience the rhythms of our agricultural past that continue to inform the present day.  </p>",

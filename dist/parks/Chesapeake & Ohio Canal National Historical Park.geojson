Designated a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/heritageareas/index.htm\">National Heritage Area</a> in 2019, AFNHA covers sixteen counties in West Virginia (Barbour, Braxton, Grant, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, Morgan, Nicholas, Pendleton, Preston, Pocahontas, Randolph, Tucker, Upshur, Webster) and two counties in western Maryland (Garrett, Allegany). <br /> <br /> Forest heritage is the ongoing story how the forest shapes history and culture, and how both nature and humans shape the forest. The mountains and forests have played a central role in central Appalachian life since the first indigenous inhabitants, and the landscape continues to cultivate local traditions, folkways, language, crafts, dance, music, festivals, and fairs. Logging after the Civil War fueled the industrial revolution and provided an important livelihood for workers, but the demand for timber decimated the forests. Today, scientific forestry and public land holdings have allowed the forests to regrow, providing sustainable forest products while offering an abundance of outdoor recreational opportunities, including hiking, biking, fishing, hunting, camping, climbing, and skiing. The history of the region is represented by its plentiful historical societies, museums, and historic preservation efforts. Forest communities and main streets offer a variety of small town experiences, with arts, shopping, local foods, and a hearty welcome for visitors. <br /> <br /> AFNHA is managed by the grassroots nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.appalachianforest.us/about.htm\">Appalachian Forest Heritage Area, Inc.</a> (<strong>AFHA</strong>). AFHA partners with organizations with shared goals and is developing a management plan to coordinate partnership efforts to conserve the area’s forests and strengthen rural communities through conservation, historic preservation, education, heritage tourism, and sustainable economic development.<br /> <br /> Notable points of interest in the region include:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.appalachianforest.us/DiscoveryCenter/index.htm\">Appalachian Forest Discovery Center</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Canaan_Valley/visit/plan_your_visit.html\">Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/choh/index.htm\">Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park</a> </li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/mnf/\">Monongahela National Forest</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pohe/index.htm\">Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail</a></li> <li><strong>Excursion trains, such as the <a href=\"https://wvstateparks.com/park/cass-scenic-railroad-state-park/\">Cass Scenic Railroad</a></strong></li> <li><strong>Historical societies and small museums</strong></li> <li><strong>State parks and state forests </strong></li> <li><strong>Welcoming rural communities</strong></li> </ul>",

Ferry Hill is best known as the home of Henry Kyd Douglas, Confederate Officer and author of his Civil War personal account, \"I Rode With Stonewall.\"<br /> <br /> In the 18th and early 19th century German settlers migrated from Pennsylvania south into Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, where they then farmed the rich soil. These settlers crossed the Potomac using Packhorse Ford and later Blackford's Ferry below Ferry Hill. Come the 1830s the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal crossed this north/south route, tapping the river waters to provide a controlled water transportation route into western Maryland.<br /> <br /> John Blackford who built and resided at Ferry Hill benefited from this crossroads of commerce. Unlike southern plantations, Ferry Hill profited from not just one cash crop, such as tobacco or cotton, but from a variety of crops, including grains, wheat, corn, an orchard, and even lumbering.<br /> <br /> \"I was with the company that set fire to [the bridge], and when . . . I saw the glowing windows in my home on the hill beyond the river . . . I realized that the war had begun.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, 1861<br /> <br /> By 1860, Ferry Hill shifted through marriage into the Douglas family as Reverend Robert Douglas. As the Civil War began in 1861, Reverend Douglas' son Henry Kyd enlisted in the Confederate army where he served under Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson. Both young Douglas and Ferry Hill became fully engaged in the war. Douglas and his unit burned the bridge crossing the Potomac to limit Union forces from entering into Virginia, and Union forces burned the Ferry Hill barn.<br /> <br /> Throughout the war, Boteler's Ford, also known as Packhorse Ford, a mile downstream from Ferry Hill, provided a frequently used crossing for soldiers from both North and South. Due to its strategic location on the border, Ferry Hill was occupied at various times by both armies. During the 1862 Antietam campaign Ferry Hill served as a headquarters, hospital and artillery base for Confederate forces. During the Battle of Antietam residents of Sharpsburg, fled west along the C&O Canal towpath and sought shelter at Killiansburg Cave, waiting for the fighting to pass. One resident noted that the cave \"... was crowded with a variety of people of all classes.\" Following Antietam, the Battle of Shepherdstown played out along the river below the Ferry Hill. As troops moved on to fight elsewhere, Ferry Hill was scarred with it fences burned, livestock gone, and fields trampled.<br /> <br /> \"We encamped near Shepherdstown and I visited my home across the Potomac and saw the desolation of war. My beautiful home was a barren waste and a common, and the blackened walls of the burnt barn stood up against the sky as a monument of useless and barbarous destruction. I felt that it would be hard for me, going into Pennsylvania, to set aside all ideas of retaliation.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, \"I Rode With Stonewall\"<br /> <br /> Then during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, and the Monocacy Campaign in 1864, Boteler's Ford provided a crossing for both Union and Confederate troops. And, Ferry Hill again suffered the impact of the war.<br /> <br /> At the end of the Civil War, Ferry Hill lost its previous grandeur. Henry Kyd Douglas moved to Hagerstown to pursue his career as a lawyer as the site then went into the hands of Henry Kyd's sister, Nancy. In the 20th century, Ferry Hill operated as a pig farm, and by mid-century, as a restaurant. In 1979, the C&O Canal National Historical Park headquarters moved into Ferry Hill and operated here until 2002. For the past ten years, Ferry Hill shifted into a slower period as the house was opened for tours during summer weekends.</p>",

Floods damaged the lock in the 19th century, and the upper red sandstone stones were added, probably to avert even more flood damage. The lower, grey-colored stone is original and came from Aquia creek and from a quarry less than 1 mile form this site. Level 4, between Lift Lock 5 and Lift Lock 4 (between Thomas Jefferson St and 31st Street in Georgetown, Washington DC) is four miles long.</p>",

At usual time, 6 am, the powerhouse blew out the boilers and the steam burst and forced super hot steam into the cabin of the boat where the children were sleeping.

Built in 1832, the Catoctin Aqueduct is the fourth of eleven such “works of art” on the canal.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Catoctin Creek Aqueduct was known as the \"Crooked Aqueduct\" because canal boats had to make a sharp turn to cross it. From its original creation, the Catoctin Creek Aqueduct's structural integrity was questionable. The elliptical arch in the center was not as structurally sound as the semicircle arches on either side. The aqueduct began sagging in the early 1900s. It leaked and was prone to flooding. In 1973, two years after Congress established the C&O Canal National Historical Park, it collapsed, leaving only a small piece standing.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Park Service gathered up the aqueduct’s stones and buried them with the hopes that someday the aqueduct would be restored. Nearly 35 years later, a restoration project gained enough funding to rebuild. The four hundred and fifty-nine stones where uncovered and the engineering crew began to fit the blocks together like a giant 3-demensional puzzle. Each stone was measured, and the crew used those measurements to create foam stones. Historic photos were then used to identify where individual stones were positioned. Missing stones or those in poor condition were replaced. In a little over a year, construction was complete. Today, new viewing areas and waysides allow visitors to learn about the structure and the efforts to rebuild it.",

It consists of three equal 60' arch spans extending 196' between abutments.</p> <p>In August 1863, Confederate soldiers damaged the Conococheague Aqueduct in an effort to stop the canal's transportation of coal to Georgetown where it was used by the Union. Repairs took four days and the canal returned to operation. In April 1920, a canal boat broke through the upstream wall of the aqueduct, falling into the creek below. This shut down the canal for over four months. Repaired with a timber wall, this version of the aqueduct functioned until two 1924 floods closed the canal for good.</p> <p>In 2019, the NPS completed restoration of the Conococheague Aqueduct, reopening this exciting feature on the C&O Canal. The restored Conococheague Aqueduct provides a watered section of the canal to allow for canal boat operations and other public uses between Lock 44 and approximately 450 feet upstream of the existing aqueduct (approx. 0.70 miles).

The project also restores a significant historic resource and provides unique opportunities for visitors. <br /> <br /> <strong>How can I access the towpath at the Williamsport Visitor Center?</strong><br /> Pedestrians and cyclists are able to cross the canal at the historic railroad lift bridge (adjacent to Rt. 11). Parking is still available by the Cushwa Warehouse. <br /> <br /> <strong>What is the railroad lift bridge? </strong><br /> Originally used to allow trains to cross the canal, visitors are now able to cross the bridge on a newly constructed stairway, which includes a low bike rail. (This is a great spot to get a view of the canal and aqueduct!). <br /> <br /> <strong>Where can I find accessible parking near the towpath?</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Parking is also available close to the towpath at Lockhouse 44 parking lot and from the Bollman Bridge at River Bottom Park. These are the best access points for visitors with bike trailers, strollers, or wheelchairs. Dam 5 is the next closest location along the towpath that also has parking. <br /> <br /> <strong>Who can I contact if I have further questions regarding the restoration? </strong><br /> For more information, please contact the C&O Canal Williamsport Visitor Center by calling 301-582-0813.</p> <br />  ",

Located on the Potomac River, it was a logical choice for the canal's terminus. Canal activity further spurred Georgetown's economic growth. By the late 1800s, it was a bustling industrial port, with loads of cargo transferring between ocean-going ships, smaller boats, and wagons. On the canal, mule-drawn coal boats sidled up alongside Georgetown's warehouses to unload their freight. After their week-long journey down the 184.5 mile canal, canal families looked forward to the sights and sounds of Georgetown.<br /> <br /> Construction of the canal began in 1828. Thousands of men, primarily immigrants, performed the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging and blasting through soil and rock. The skilled laborers, including stonemasons, carpenters, and blacksmiths created the dams, locks, culverts, aqueducts, and the Paw Paw Tunnel. Though each section of the canal started operating as it was completed, the entire route between Cumberland and Georgetown officially opened on October 10, 1850. After years of decreasing profits and devastating floods, operation of the canal ceased in 1924.</p> <br />  ",

This mountain offers both hikes and scenic overlooks which will not disappoint. If history is your thing, Maryland Heights has remnants of extensive Civil War campsites and fortifications and its elevation made it hugely important during the war. To access this area, walk from Lower Town across the footbridge over the Potomac River to the C&O Canal towpath then take a left and walk along the path until there is signage for the Maryland Heights trail.<br /> <br /> Maryland Heights is the highest mountain overlooking Harpers Ferry. Its southern face is a 300-foot vertical cliff that towers over the Potomac River, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The mountain is steep, rugged, and primitive, with a thick veneer of Civil War history.<br /> <br /> Maryland Heights hosted the first battle between Union and Confederate troops in Maryland. The first combat on Northern soil between the two armies occurred on Maryland Heights. Maryland Heights was the most important strategic target of the Confederate army in the Battle of Harpers Ferry, which took place from September 12-15, 1862. Without the seizure of Maryland Heights, Robert E. Lee's Confederates could not entrap the Union garrison and complete Lee's assignment outlined in Special Orders 191.<br /> <br /> Lee selected Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws to lead the advance upon Maryland Heights, expecting McLaws to snare the Union garrison from the north. McLaws arrived at the eastern base of the mountain on September 12 with 8,000 men. Discovering nearly 4,000 Union soldiers stationed atop the mountain, McLaws directed William Barksdale's Mississippi brigade and Joseph Kershaw's South Carolina brigade to ascend Elk Ridge north of Maryland Heights and to take the Union position. Battling at Maryland Heights lasted from 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on September 13, and eventually, the Union troops under Colonel Thomas H. Ford's command abandoned their position. The loss of Maryland Heights cut off the Union forces escape routes and helped lead to the surrender of the Union garrison on September 15.<br /> <br /> The significance of Maryland Heights is further attested by the Union occupation of the mountain two days following the Battle of Antietam. By securing the heights on September 19, the Union, once again, occupied Harpers Ferry and to ensure the protection of the position, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan ordered that extensive fortifications be constructed on Maryland Heights. Union engineers quickly surveyed the terrain, and during the fall of 1862, work commenced on the Stone Fort and the 30-pounder Battery, along with improvements at the Naval Battery. Ten months later, as General Lee threatened Harpers Ferry with his second invasion during the Gettysburg Campaign; construction hastened which resulted in the Interior Fort, the Exterior Fort, and the 100-pounder Battery. This latter battery boasted a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle that could hurl a 100-pound shell more than two miles and the tube of this cannon weighed nearly 10 tons.<br /> <br /> The fortifications of Maryland Heights played a major role in the Confederacy's third and final invasion of the North. Confederate Maj. Gen. Jubal Early spent four days attempting to maneuver the Union out of the forts, but he failed. During the time Early spent worrying about Maryland Heights, the Union was able to send reinforcements to Washington, ultimately helping to save the United States capital. The Union army would occupy the forts of Maryland Heights until June 30, 1865. The final time the big cannon boomed was in memory of President Lincoln following his assassination.<br /> <br /> Though Maryland Heights was occupied by Union forces the most, Maryland Heights occupation was by Confederates. Col. Thomas Jonathan Jackson seized the mountain in May 1861. Recognizing the strategic value of the high ground, Jackson was sure he could not defend Harpers Ferry without holding Maryland Heights. Jackson's aggressiveness created major turmoil when he positioned his troops in neutral Maryland, a state that the Confederacy was trying to get to join their cause. Despite the political firestorm set off by Jackson, he refused to abandon the position. The Confederates left on their own volition on June 14, 1861, when the Confederates abandoned Harpers Ferry five weeks before the First Battle of Manassas (Bull Run).</p>",

Although it is preserved for its architecture today, it was originally preserved through a case of mistaken identity and a desire to remember George Washington.</p> <p>In 1791, George Washington and city planner Pierre L'Enfant were surveying the newly established District of Columbia. L'Enfant's ambitious plan for the city's layout depended on negotiating with local landowners for right of way. During one of these meetings, Washington and L'Enfant stayed in Georgetown's Fountain Inn at 31st and K Streets. The inn was better known to locals as Suter's Tavern, after its owner John Suter. </p> <p>Over on Bridge Street (now M Street), John Suter's son, John, Jr., ran a clock shop in today's Old Stone House. As the years passed, local memory conflated the two buildings associated with the two John Suters. Thus, the desire to honor and remember George Washington's 1791 visit combined with a fuzzy memory led to the Old Stone House's preservation while so much changed around it.</p> <p>The house was the site of a car dealership when the federal government purchased the property in 1953. The National Park Service opened the house to the public in 1960. Today, the house is a rare example of pre-Revolutionary architecture. Among the House's furnishings, you may find a clock built by one-time owner John Suter, Jr.</p> <h4>Hours:</h4> Open daily (ground floor only), with holiday hours from 11:00 a.m.-7:00 p.m.",

To save building six miles of canal along the river, the C&O Canal Company decided to construct a tunnel through a steep topographic ridge now called Tunnel Hill. When work began on the tunnel in 1836, the builders estimated the project would be completed within two years. The tunnel ultimately required 14 years to complete due to labor issues and violence, funding shortfalls, work stoppages, and the challenges of digging a 3,118-foot tunnel through the hard, loose shale. The tunnel opened in October 1850 with rockslides continuing to be a challenge throughout the tunnel’s history. <br /> <br /> Today, when you plan your visit to the Paw Paw Tunnel, bring a flashlight and discover the weep holes, rope burns, rub rails, as well as brass plates marking every 100-feet that bring the tunnel’s history to life.

Built by the Army Corps of Engineers from 1853 to 1863, it was a monumental engineering achievement. Its designer, Army Engineer Montgomery C. Meigs, supervised the project until 1861, when he was appointed Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army. The construction and successful operation of the Washington Aqueduct symbolizes the Army Corps of Engineers importance in the field of public works and reflects the military influence on life in antebellum America. The Washington Aqueduct, constructed over 150 years ago, still supplies the nation's capital with public water today.<br /> <br /> In the 1850s, the growing population of Washington and the memory of two devastating fires forced Congress to acknowledge that the nation's capital required more than wells and springs to provide its water. In 1853, Congress commissioned a public water system. One year later, construction of the Washington Aqueduct began in Great Falls, Maryland. Meig's plan was to divert the water from the Potomac River into a large, underground conduit. Gravity, and later pumping stations, directed water through the conduit to reservoirs where it could then be pumped into the city's pipelines.<br /> <br /> To accomplish this feat, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a masonry dam across the Potomac, a control gatehouse at Great Falls, a twelve-mile conduit, eleven tunnels, six bridges, several pipelines, and two reservoirs. By 1863, the Corps had completed three resevoirs. Wagons and boats on the C&O Canal brought supplies like cast iron, sand, concrete, brick, and Seneca sandstone to the construction sites. The initial dam reached halfway across the river. In 1890, in order to meet the District's increasing demand for water, it was extended to the Virginia side. Meigs designed the dam to be anchored to the river bottom, not to block its flow but to divert it.<br /> <br /> Although no longer in service, the first gatehouse still stands next to the historic Great Falls Tavern along the C&O Canal in Maryland. Inside was a system of 20 small cast iron slide gates that filtered the largest debris from the water.<br /> <br /> The conduit stretches almost twelve miles downriver from the intake at Great Falls to the Georgetown Reservoir. The underground, circular tube, built of brick, stone, and mortar, is 9 feet in diameter. A road ran parallel to the conduit to facilitate cleaning, repairs and inspections. The road was originally named Conduit Road; today it is MacArthur Boulevard.<br /> <br /> As part of the original Washington Aqueduct water system, workers constructed six bridges to carry the conduit over streams and creeks. Only three, Bridge #3, Cabin John Bridge (also called Union Arch Bridge) and Rock Creek Bridge, remain today. Cabin John Bridge, built of granite and sandstone, held the record as the world's longest masonry arch structure (220 feet) for 40 years. Today, Rock Creek Bridge’s 200-foot arch is still one of the longest unsupported metal pipe arches in the world. <br /> <br /> Aqueduct water spilled into two reservoirs, Dalecarlia Reservoir at the District line and the Georgetown Reservoir two miles downriver. By allowing the murky river water to stand in these reservoirs, debris settles to the bottom before distribution throughout the city. However, the process never successfully removed all of the sediment and thus, Washington City's public water had a muddy-yellowish color until the installation of a rapid-sand filtration system in 1928. Today both reservoirs have been completely modernized.<br /> <br /> Several inscriptions at various places honor the engineers who designed and built the Aqueduct. Meigs had his own name and his assistant’s name, Alfred L. Rives, engraved on the Cabin John Bridge. When Rives quit the US Army to join the Confederate Army in 1861, Meigs replaced his name with the Latin phrase <i>Esto Perpetua</i>, or “Let It Stand Forever.\" After former US Secretary of War Jefferson Davis became the president of the Confederacy, his name was removed from the bridge as well. In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt ordered it be re-engraved.<br /> <br /> While building the Washington Aqueduct, Meigs was also Chief Engineer for the extensions and new dome of the U.S. Capitol, and the enlargement of the General Post Office Building. Both of these buildings are now National Historic Landmarks. After his work with the new aqueduct, Meigs served as Quartermaster General of the United States Army, both during and after the Civil War. During this tenure, he designed the Pension Bureau building, now the National Building Museum (also a National Historic Landmark). During the Civil War, Meigs helped establish Arlington National Cemetery, where he is buried.<br /> <br /> In the twentieth century, the aqueduct’s capacity was expanded many times. As of 2017, it produces 300 million gallons of filtered water per day, has a storage capacity of 44 million gallons, and serves 1.1 million customers. The aqueduct provides public water for all of Washington, DC, Arlington County, and Falls Church City in Virginia. The continual effectiveness of the historic water system is a testament to Meig’s design and the professional work of the Army Corps of Engineers who continue to operate it today. A portion of the aqueduct runs through the Cheasapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, where you can see the originial engineer's house and gatehouse. </span></span></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"> </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Sources:<br /> <span style=\"color:null;\">\"The Washington Aqueduct System.\"</span> National Park Service.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Ways, Harry C. <em>Washinton Aqueduct: 1852-1992.</em> US Army Corps of Engineers.</span></span></span></p>   <p> </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"http://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=6d960253-5f0c-4d15-a2a2-84735ea482f2\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmark Nomination</span></a> of the Washington Aqueduct.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</span></a> are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

As one of only five naturally occurring sinkhole lakes in South Florida, it is truly a rare gem. The hike to this tranquil spot not only offers a one-mile round-trip stroll through sub-tropical beauty and diversified habitats, but also history. This area was some of the first property Barron Gift Collier purchased within the vicinity of the county that would soon bear his name. This high, dry parcel of the Preserve rewards any visitor equipped with an old pair of tennis shoes and a walking stick with an exceptional experience.",

The trail travels 1,300 miles throughout the state, offering recreational opportunities year-round as the nation's only subtorpical National Scenic Trail. The Florida Trail is divided to two sections within the Preserve:<br /> <br /> <strong>Big Cypress Southern Section - </strong><em><strong>Length: 24.6 miles (linear)</strong></em><br /> This section of the Florida Trail passes through the great swamp of dwarf pond cypress and crosses pine islands, hammocks, giant ferns, and prairies with cabbage palm and saw palmetto. Bromeliads (air plants) are everywhere. Seven Mile Camp is a particularly interesting location, where the night sounds of the chuck-will’s-widows mingle with the occasional screams of a bobcat or the sound of wild turkeys. Bluebirds, quail, kites, wood storks, short-tailed hawks, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker may also be seen.<br /> <br /> <strong>Big Cypress Northern Section - </strong><em><strong>Length: 8 miles (linear)</strong></em><br /> Traveling north from the I-75 trailhead, enter Big Cypress north. This far dryer section of the trail in the Preserve follows Nobles Grade road while allowing beautiful swamp views. The Carpenter Camp Loop, blazed in blue, provides access to a campsites (Carpenter Camp, Panther Camp and CCC Camp). Backcountry permits are required and are available at the entrance off of the rest stop. <br /> <br /> Large sections of the trail will be inundated with water throughout the duration of the year. If planning on going on full to multi-day hikes, hikers must be prepared to deal with water an backcountry camping while practicing Leave No Trace principles.<br /> <br />  ",

        "notes": "Gator Hook Trail\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/gator-hook-trail.htm\n\nLength: 5 Miles Round-trip<br /> Difficulty: Moderate-Difficult<br /> <br /> Exploring the swamp requires getting your feet wet. The five-mile roundtrip Gator Hook Trail offers such an opportunity. The trail begins along an elevated logging tram, but soon enters ankle to knee-deep water. For some, the water may rise to hip height. This scenic, moderately strenous hike, is unlike any other in Big Cypress National Preserve. You will become immersed in the resource (literally and figuratively), and experience something that very few visitors do - a wet hike through the cypress swamp.<br /> <br /> The trailhead for Gator Hook Trail is located along the Loop Road roughly 2 miles from Monroe Station. If traveling south on the Loop Road from Monroe Station, the trailhead will be located on the left. You will see an informational kiosk. The trail begins to the right of it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Accessibility Information</strong>: This trail is a moderately strenuous hike which involves hiking through several inches to 4 feet of water. Individuals who attempt this trail should be in good health and highly mobile. Footing can be uneven in spots where the water has dissolved the limestone. Visitors should use care when walking across the exposed limestone as it can be uneven and slippery. Hiking poles or walking sticks are suggested and sturdy footwear. ",

J. Abbott. Even by 1925 when George and Evelyn Frey acquired the lease to run the lodge, the only way for visitors to access the canyon bottom and the lodge was on foot.<br /> <br /> In 1932, when Bandelier was transferred from the United States Forest Service to the National Park Service, Frank “Boss” Pinkley was the Superintendent of the Southwestern National Monuments. He knew that to make it possible for more people to visit Bandelier, improved facilities and better access into the canyon were necessary. When the Emergency Conservation Work Act in 1933 created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), funding and workers became available to do this work.<br /> <br /> The CCC was a Depression-era program designed to produce public works while providing much-needed jobs and work experience for men between the ages of 17 and 26. With the desperate nationwide lack of employment, young men welcomed the opportunity to get room, board, and training. As soon as a CCC camp was approved for Bandelier, “Boss” Pinkley began putting together plans for the road into the canyon and facilities for visitors. It was considered very important for park structures to harmonize with the environment and local culture, so a regionally popular style often called Pueblo Revival was chosen. The Park Service architect, Lyle Bennett, had worked on several other Park Service and CCC buildings in the Southwest and was well schooled in this style.<br /> <br /> The first project, the road, was opened as a truck trail in 1933. Over the next 8 years the enrollees built 31 stone buildings for visitor facilities, Park Service residences, offices, the fire tower and entrance station, along with the hand-carved wood furniture and pierced-tin light fixtures to furnish them. Their work also included building trails, helping archeologists stabilize the Ancestral Pueblo sites, and widening and completing the road.",

The road is particularly significant because it was the CCC’s first project here, and it was a real engineering and construction challenge. Until that time the only way to enter the canyon was a steep, switchback walking trail, now known as the Frey Trail, about a half mile up the canyon. To provide the opportunity for more visitors to use the park, a road was a real necessity. Within about a month after the CCC camp was established, the enrollees had built a 12-foot-wide truck trail, which they widened and completed later. It was carefully planned to provide the maximum view of the canyon upon entry, while providing the least possible visual intrusion from the canyon bottom, and the original route and roadbed are still in use. As you drive out of the park, you may notice the original stone gutters, which are carefully maintained. You may also notice several stone houses back from the left side of the road; the CCC built these as residences for park staff and the Superintendent. About a quarter of a mile up the road is a service road (open to employees only). It leads to the stables, which were originally built to house horses for the guests to rent.",

The patio itself is now filled with picnic tables, but when there were overnight guests staying at the Lodge, it was used for socializing. On some evenings, Pueblo people on the staff would present traditional dances for the guests. Surrounding the patio is another good example of a portal, just as welcome on a hot day now as it was in the 1940’s. On your right notice the wooden gates leading into the patio from the parking lot. The walls on either side of them were originally more than a foot taller, which must have made this space quiet and private, but probably also made it harder for visitors to find their way in.",

The original museum exhibits consisted of glass cases containing items related to the past and present Pueblo culture. As a part of the Works Progress Administration Arts Program (WPA), the late Helmuth Naumer Sr. used pastels to depict local scenes and pueblos. Young Pablita Velarde of Santa Clara Pueblo was hired to paint scenes of traditional Pueblo culture as illustrations for the museum cases. She went on to become one of the best-known Pueblo artists. As Pablita later said about her work, “This period of my life at Bandelier, I figure, I’ve learned more about my own people … than I would have … and I appreciate what the old ones have tried to pass on … I want the earth to remember me through my work.”",

Maar volcanos are low and wide. This one is approximately two miles across and 100 feet high.

This waterfall is approximately 80 feet tall. <br /> <br /> Upper Falls is the final stop on the trail. Frijoles Canyon formed when “el Rito de los Frijoles” (little river of beans) cut its way through layers of ash from immense volcanic eruptions. Today most changes are slow, as the soft rock walls of the canyon erode one minuscule particle of stone at a time, the grains giving way to the actions of wind, water, or freeze-thaw cycles. Plants also play a role in shaping the canyon. Their roots penetrate susceptible areas and pave the way for water or ice to break a rock’s grip on its neighbor.On occasion, this slow, plodding process is rapidly advanced by flash flooding. In these instances, rocks, trees, and water are carried ever further on their journey to the Rio Grande and ultimately the ocean. The cacophony of such events soon quiets again, leaving the sounds of gentle water babbling and murmuring over rocks, the strident call of a Steller’s jay, and the thump of an occasional rock as it loses its slow, ongoing fight with gravity.</p>",

Cottonwoods get their names from the cotton-like strands that catch the breeze and transport the seeds. Narrowleaf cottonwood can easily be confused with willows. In early spring, willows are distinguished from cottonwoods because they only have one bud scale, which forms a little cap over the developing flower. Before the flood events in 2011 and 2013, willows were rare in this part of the canyon due to the dominance of ponderosa pine. The pines created a thick overstory that blocked light from the willows. The floods downed many tall pines and deposited fresh soils. The new environment seems to benefit the willows. </p>",

In the canyons, oaks grow into small trees up to 60 feet tall, but usually remain short and shrubby on the drier mesas. The acorns of these trees are an important food for wildlife such as black bears, jays, and rock squirrels. The Ancestral Pueblo people ate these acorns too. Acorns are usually boiled before eating to remove acid that makes them taste very bitter. In autumn, oaks turn yellow or red.

During those times, knowledge of native plants was essential. Look around. This area is known as the Piñon-Juniper Woodland for the two trees that are indicative of this life zone, the Piñon Pine and the One-seed Juniper. Both provided important sustenance to the Ancestral Pueblo people, one in the form of pine nuts and the other a tart but healthy berry. Three-leaf Sumac, an indigenous bush that has tangy berries, could be made into drink with a sharp taste similar to lemonade.

Frijoles and the surrounding areas of Bandelier were not abandoned. There was no mysterious migration or sudden disappearance of its people. Old systems gave way to new traditions and ways of life. Although the pueblo people have not lived in the canyon since the late 1500’s, a deep spiritual connection still exists. Pueblo residents often come to visit, remember, and teach the next generation about life in the canyon when their ancestors lived here. We can do the same and take care of it for future generations.<br /> <br /> This is the end of the Pueblo Loop Trail.

One-seed junipers are short bushy trees that rarely exceed 25 feet.  Their leaves are scale-like and they produce bluish fruit with only a single seed.  The shreddy gray bark of the tree was pounded to become more absorbent and then used as diapers.  The wood makes excellent firewood and thicker branches are often used as the rungs in ladders. Juniper berries are not very tasty but are nutritious and edible. ",

Some are very large and housed many people year-round like the village of Tyuonyi on the Pueblo Loop Trail near the visitor center. Many others, like the small site in front of you, were mostly seasonal homes or field houses occupied primarily during summer as crops were tended. It is difficult to imagine bringing these dry mesas into bountiful fruition, but the Ancestral Pueblo people took advantage of available moisture from scattered late summer storms, and dampness stored deep in the pumice-rich soil to grow corn, beans, and squash.",

Those are the San Miguel Mountains which are far older than the Jemez Mountains, which produced the rock on which you stand. All of these peaks are volcanic and over a million years old.

These holes are created by wind and water erosion of the volcanic tuff we talked about earlier. Water freezes and thaws in the permeable rock breaking off big and small pieces (most are microscopic). Wind picks up these small bits of stone swirling them in the slowly growing depressions and whittling away just the tiniest bits of mineral. Over more than a million years some of these natural openings have grown much bigger. Did you know that the rocks that fall from the cliff naturally are called talus?",

For many years park staff believed the reconstruction was inaccurate due to what appears to be doorways in the front of each room block. However, in recent years, when Talus House received some much-needed TLC to its eroding roof, we discovered that the original rebuilds did indeed include doorways in the roofs that at some point were covered over during past maintenance. Having an opening or doorway in the roof undoubtedly added to the difficulty of keeping the structure intact and reminds us of the constant maintenance that would have been done regularly when these building were inhabited. What appeared to be doorways in the front were actually included to allow visitors a view inside the structures.",

Some of the same people who lived in that village may have lived here on the mesa during planting season. Movement to and from the canyon to the mesa, and even to distant places, was common. To your left you can see the Frey Trail that carries visitors from the canyon to Juniper Campground. Although today it is a wide dirt trail it was probably a much simpler path in Ancestral Pueblo times. Would you have wanted to hike up from the canyon carrying the farming implements you would need to plant your fields? Imagine how different this view would have been with the many standing structures and farm fields across this mesa during the time the Ancestral Pueblo people called it home.<br /> <br /> If you haven’t done so already, it is highly recommended that you walk the Pueblo Loop Trail you see below. Best times are early or late in the day. You will get a closeup view of many of the canyon’s archeological sites.",

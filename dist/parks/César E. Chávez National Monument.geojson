Most of these men, respectfully known as Manongs, migrated to the United States in their teens and 20s. Racist laws in California at that time forbade them from marrying outside their race, so most remained single. Evicted from farm labor camps after joining the Delano Grape Strike in 1965, by the end of the strike in 1970 many Filipino men were without families, pensions, and places to live.<br /> <br /> In 1973 and 1974, the farm worker movement built the Paulo Agbayani Retirement Village. It provided some of Manongs with safe and comfortable housing, human dignity and respect in their final years. Hundreds of volunteer laborers constructed this complex. The village was named after a Filipino Manong who died of a heart attack on the picket line. The village provided residents with individual rooms, a community kitchen serving Filipino cuisine, a dining hall, living and recreation room, and garden.<br /> <br /> As the first affordable housing community built by what is now the Cesar Chavez Foundation, Agbayani Village served as a model for dozens of properties built across four states that continue providing affordable housing. The Chavez Foundation manages the property today, which still houses people.<br /> <br /> Tours of this building and the Forty Acres are sometimes available upon appointment. Check at the village office facing Mettler Avenue or call 661-725-4347.<br /> <br /> These buildings are still in operation providing lodging. Please respect the privacy of the residents.</p> <h3>Cesar's Last Fast</h3> <p>Inside a small room at the southeast corner of Agbayani Village, Cesar Chavez held his last and longest public fast of 36 days in July and August of 1988 over the pesticide poisoning of farm workers and their children.

She was brought to this place as a child in the 1930s. She was separated from her family and forced to live in a facility on the property for children who were believed to be malnourished. Returning here was difficult for her, but she ultimately agreed, in support of Cesar and his beliefs.<br /> <br /> Today, the house is kept exactly as she left it when she passed away in 2016. In the kitchen, small mementos decorate the walls and a child's drawing of a fish is held to the refrigerator with a magnet.

Kennedy famously responded to the sheriff's defense of his arrests of peaceful pickets by suggesting that \"the sheriff and the district attorney read the Constitution of the United States.\"<br /> <br /> Kennedy was the first national political figure to fully embrace Cesar and the grape strikers.

She became a schoolteacher but couldn't stand seeing students come to class hungry. When she was 25 years old, famed community organizer Fred Ross recognized her talent and she became an organizer with the new chapter in Stockton of a Latino civil rights group called the Community Service Organization (CSO). Another CSO organizer was Cesar Chavez.<br /> <br /> Cesar and Dolores decided to create a farm workers union. Dolores resigned from the CSO in 1962 to help create the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) along with Cesar, Gilbert Padilla, Manual Chavez, Julio Hernandez and other early organizers. Dolores, Cesar and Gilbert drew on the community organizing principles they learned in CSO, convinced that it would take more than a union to help farm workers overcome the crippling dilemmas they faced at both the work site and in their communities; it would take a movement.<br /> <br /> In its early years, NFWA organized workers by providing them with services. By 1965, the NFWA had 1,200 member families.<br /> <br /> When Filipino union leader <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/larry-itliong.htm\">Larry Itliong</a> reached out to Cesar, encouraging the NFWA to join the Filipinos' strike. Dolores strongly encouraged NFWA members to join the strike. She spent decades leading strikes, helping to organize boycotts, negotiating union contracts and lobbying at the state and national capitals. She was arrested more than two dozen times.<br /> <br /> When Cesar conducted his second public fast in Phoenix in 1972, after Arizona passed a law banning farm worker strikes and boycotts, some union supporters said the growers and their allies were too powerful to overcome-\"No se puede\" (\"No, it can't be done),\" they argued. Dolores replied \"¡Si se puede!\" (\"Yes, it can be done!\"). She popularized the slogan during the UFW campaign in Arizona, and it has been adopted by people fighting for justice around the world.<br /> <br /> Today, Dolores Huerta continues fighting for the rights of farm workers and equal treatment of women and other underrepresented groups.</p>",

Over the years, wings were added to the building to expand its capacity. Eventually, improved medical treatments reduced the need for most sanatoriums. The development of more modern treatments for tuberculosis ultimately led to the closure of Stony Brook in 1967. Shortly thereafter, Hollywood producer Ed Lewis purchased the property, and in 1970, turned it over to Cesar Chavez and the farmworker movement for their use.</p>",

Those attempts all failed, partly because employers historically used one race of farm workers to break the strikes of other races. Led by prominent labor leader Larry Itliong, the mostly Filipino farm workers of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee gathered in the Filipino Community Hall and voted on the night of September 7, 1965, to strike against Delano-area grape growers. The next day, on September 8, 1965, the Filipino farmworkers began the Delano Grape Strike. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/larry-itliong.htm\">Larry Itliong</a> quickly asked the mostly Latino National Farm Workers Association to join the Filipinos' picket lines, which happened on September 16, 1965, Mexican Independence Day.

Cesar convinced his brother, Richard, to mortgage his home to fund a credit union for farmworkers.<br /> <br /> By establishing a credit union, the United Farm Workers organization was able to provide small loans to farmworkers to allow them to stay on the picket lines. The credit union also became an important tool to recruit new members who had bad experiences with previous attempts to unionize and strike.

The movement purchased a 40-acre parcel of bare land just west of Delano to supply room for the union to grow. The land came to be known as Forty Acres. It was the site of Cesar’s first public fast in 1968, his final public fast in 1988, and his funeral services in 1993. It was also the target of violence, vandalism and one bombing by movement opponents during the 1970s. Forty Acres was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2008.<br /> <br /> Cesar’s brother Richard organized volunteers to clear and level the land. Buildings were constructed, which provided basic infrastructure to meet the needs of the union and farm workers: a co-op service station, Reuther Hall that housed movement headquarters, a rambling health clinic, and Agbayani village for elderly Filipino farm workers. Over the years, many of the farmworker movement’s most historic events took place here. The property is still owned and managed by the National Chavez Center, part of the Cesar Chavez Foundation.</p> <h3>The Rodrigo Terronez Memorial Medical Clinic</h3> <p>Backbreaking labor, pesticide exposure in the fields, and low incomes meant many farm workers went without basic medical attention. A health clinic for farm workers was established in a trailer at Forty Acres in 1968. Volunteer doctors and nurses provided health services.<br /> <br /> The movement purchased two buildings scheduled for demolition and moved them to Forty Acres. They connected the buildings, and in 1972, built a modern, well-equipped clinic in adobe-brick, Mission-style achitecture. It was here that one of the most vulnerable populations could finally receive badly-needed medical care. Patients included residents of the nearby Agbayani Retirement Village.<br /> <br /> It was named the Rodrigo Terronez Memorial Clinic to honor a dedicated union member who died during the grape strike. The building later became the regional office for the United Farm Workers.</p> <h3>Reuther Hall</h3> <p>The original office of the United Farm Workers (UFW) was at the corner of First Avenue and Albany Street in Delano. They moved here, to Reuther Hall, in 1969. This large, one-story structure on the Forty Acres property was named after Roy Reuther, a United Auto Workers leader and brother of United Auto Workers International President <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/walter-reuther.htm\">Walter P. Reuther</a>. The building included a large union hall and served as headquarters for the UFW until 1971, when it moved to Keene.<br /> <br /> On July 29, 1970, hundreds of grape strikers and boycotters watched as Delano-area growers signed their first UFW contracts in Reuther Hall. John Giumarra Sr., owner of the nation's largest table grape company, held his hands up in mock surrender for the news cameras as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cech/index.htm\">Cesar Chavez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/larry-itliong.htm\">Larry Itliong</a> looked on.</p>",

In 1965, wage disputes in Southern California emerged between growers and Filipino farm workers. Filipino farm workers were offered lowered wages than Mexican farm workers, even after struggling for years to receive the same pay. As the leader of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), Larry Itliong called a meeting to propose a strike. On the evening of September 7, 1965, AWOC members voted to strike. On the following day, over 2,000 Filipino farm workers and members of the AWOC marched off the vineyards in what would become the beginning of the Delano Grape Strike.<br /> <br /> Both Larry Itliong and Cesar Chavez knew growers historically pitted the races against each other to break strikes and defeat unions. So Larry approached Cesar, asking the Latino members of his National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) to join the grape walkouts. Cesar was not yet ready to join a major farm strike. As Cesar, Dolores Huerta, and other leaders of the Latino union debated the issue, Cesar's wife Helen settled the matter by asking, \"Are we a union or not?\" On September 16, 1965, Mexican Independence Day, NFWA members cast a unanimous vote to join the Filipinos' picket lines during a meeting at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church Hall. The AWOC and NFWA merged in 1966 to become what is today the United Farm Workers. By the 1970s this multi-ethnic effort won increased wages, benefits and pesticide protections for farm workers. Larry's fight for justice for farm workers in America continues to benefit today's field laborers who feed our country and has inspired generations of activists.<br /> <br /> At the urging of Larry Itliong and other Filipino union leaders, the Agbayani Village, a retirement home for elderly and displaced Filipino farm workers, was built by the farmworker movement on the Forty Acres. Agbayani Village is another location in this mobile app.<br /> <br /> Larry Itliong's grave is located on the southeast side of the cemetery, five rows to the east of Carnation Road and 52 plots south of the main office.</p> <h3>Richard Chavez</h3> <p>Richard Chavez was responsible for development of the Forty Acres property and led construction on three of its four primary structures. In addition to his skilled oversight of Forty Acres, he made numerous important contributions during his 30+ years with the farmworkers movement. He organized successful boycotts of grapes and other products in New York and Detroit. He oversaw United Farmworkers (UFW) contracts and union bargaining, and was also an elected UFW leader. Richard passed away in 2011.<br /> <br /> To find Richard's grave at the North Kern County Cemetery in Delano, check at the office for a map. The office is located on the east side of the cemetery near Austin street and 7th avenue. If the office is closed, a small version of the map is included in this app.<br /> <br /> The grave is located near the Austin street and 7th Avenue side of the cemetery, on a road named Lily of the Valley Drive. You will find Richard's grave on the row second from the right of Austin Street and north 12 plots from Lily of the Valley. Look for the <em>Huelga</em> eagle engraved on his grave.<br /> <br /> In 1962, Cesar asked Richard to design a symbol for the union to be unveiled at its founding convention in a downtown Fresno movie theater. Richard's design featured a stylized Aztec black eagle with squared off wings that would be easy for people to reproduce. It became an iconic symbol that inspired union members and millions of others around the world.</p>",

Over the years she also became a surrogate mother to countless young single volunteers who journeyed to Delano, and later to La Paz, to work for social justice. She often made seats at her table for those who couldn't make it home for the holidays. Helen frequently cooked for their weddings and baptisms as well as big union events and celebrations. And she became a friend and confidant to many. What she did for her family she did for the movement.<br /> <br /> Saturday evenings and Sundays often found Helen gathered with volunteers and visitors at the small park and fieldstone grill pit next to the Chavez home, barbecuing and relaxing after a full day or week of hard work. Cesar sometimes lent a hand helping to grill chicken and meat for the group, a significant concession for the strict vegetarian.</p>",

The Pink House was later home to the <em>Huelga</em> School, established by the movement to teach the children of grape strikers and union staff.<br /> <br /> This building is a private residence.

During the movement, Cesar and Richard Chavez built this service station after buying this property in Delano, known as Forty Acres. The first permanent structure built on Forty Acres, the service station included gas pumps, an automotive repair shop, and a steel-framed multipurpose hall. The Chavez brothers' vision reflected their belief in self-empowerment, the defining theme of the farm worker movement.</p> <h3>Cesar's First Fast</h3> <p>Cesar's first public fast took place in 1968 inside a small room in the service station. His goal was to rededicate the farmworkers movement to nonviolence. After 25 days without food, he lost 35 pounds. His \"Fast for Nonviolence\" brought national media attention to the farm labor movement and triggered an improvement of conditions for Mexican-Americans and other minorities in the United States. During the fast, supporters came each day to celebrate mass. The fast ended in Delano during a mass where he broke bread with Senator Robert F. Kennedy, with thousands of supporters in attendance.</p>",

Cesar used this building as an educational center where activists learned techniques that promoted the goals of the farmworker movement. Here, thousands of people learned the principles of nonviolence and the skills to administer a growing organization. However, the building's early history brought unhappy memories to Helen Chavez. It was originally built as a children's hospital and Helen was brought here as a child, separated from her family for nearly a year. This unpleasant experience made her initially reluctant to move back here when Cesar acquired the property. Operated by the National Chavez Center, today Villa la Paz is a conference and education center that hosts a variety of gatherings.</p>",

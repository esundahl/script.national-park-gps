        "notes": "Algernourne Oak\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/algernourne-oak.htm\n\n<p>Opposite the “Lincoln Gun” on the eastern part of Fort Monroe’s Parade Ground, stands the Algernourne Oak. This impressive live oak is firmly rooted in the history of Virginia, and the United States as a whole. Named after Fort Algernourne (the first English fort in Virginia) this oak is estimated to be approximately 500 years old. This tree has born witness to the history of Old Point Comfort since the days when only the American Indian walked these grounds and everything since. American Indian presence; Militarization; Conflict; Technological advancement; Enslavement; Freedom; the Algernourne Oak has seen it all and continue to offer us reminders of who we were and who we strive to be.<br /> <br /> In 1619, a Dutch ship forcibly brought the first enslaved Africans to English North America, beginning the long history of race based slavery in Virginia. The Algernourne Oak bore witness. Devastating weather systems and storms that ravaged and changed the physical landscape of the area many times. The Algernourne Oak bore witness. The attack and siege of a foreign power against the young United States that would capture and extinguish the Old Point Comfort Lighthouse, threatening the sovereignty of the country itself. The Algernourne Oak bore witness. The construction of the largest masonry fortification every constructed in the United States and the shining example of the power of the Third System of fortifications. The Algernourne Oak bore witness. In 1861, 242 years later, three gentlemen – Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory, and James Townsend – escaped their enslavement and risked everything to find refuge within United States lines at Fort Monroe. Crossing from the Main Gate to Quarters No. 1, these three men passed the Algernourne Oak in route to an interview with Major General Benjamin Butler, commander of Fort Monroe. The Algernourne Oak bore witness. In 2020, the Algernourne Oak remains firmly rooted in the past of the US while continuing to witness the developments of progress, technology, racial, society, and social equality. The live oak symbolizes the representative republic values crafted in the eighteenth century and defined and redefined with every new passing generation. With each coming season the continued life and regrowth of this storied resident of Fortress Monroe serves as a beacon and symbol of the advancement of the United States and the establishing society that continues to evolve.</p>",

The British Navy sailed unopposed all the way up the Chesapeake Bay to Fort McHenry in Baltimore, burning Washington DC along the way. After the war, President James Madison hired a French engineer- Brevet Brigadier General Simon Bernard- to design a network of coastal defenses to protect the nation from future attacks. The construction of Fort Monroe began in 1819. During the early 1820’s construction required the delivery of 800,000 bricks a month. Most were produced within a mile of the fort. Large quantities of granite were brought in from quarries along the Susquehanna River in Maryland. The main fortification was completed by 1834.<br /> <br /> <strong>A Frenchman Comes to Help:</strong> Brevet Brigadier General Simon Bernard designed Fort Monroe. He was a member of the French Army’s Engineer Corps and former aide-de-camp to Napoleon. Bernard arrived in the United States in 1816 after being recommended to President James Madison by the Marquis de Lafayette. Madison placed Bernard at the head of the Board of Engineers, which was charged with constructing coastal defenses, forts, roads, and canals. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image description:</strong> 1831 color design drawing of Fort Monroe with caption reading: By 1831, construction of the fort was well underway, including some of the interior structures like those shown here.

Built in 1819, this “large three-story, central block, double pile residence with flanking, two-story winged residence,” predates the fort itself. Prevalent of Quarters No. 1 is the federal-style architecture – symmetrical sides and exterior columns – but within the structure, the home is presented with southern grandeur. The entrance hall is 10-foot by 20-foot with a grand spiral staircase that leads up to the second floor. Painted on the entrance ceiling is a blue oval pinned with 27 gold stars. Off either ends of the main entrance are two symmetrical multi-purposed rooms.<br /> <br /> Originally Quarters No. 1 housed the chief engineer of Fort Monroe, Charles Gratiot until 1831 when the Quartermaster General divided the space into a multiple dwelling residence. However, Quarters No. 1 was reserved for the highest-ranking officer on post or the commander of Fort Monroe and served as the fort headquarters.<br /> <br /> In 1861, Quarters No. 1 Major General Benjamin Butler was assigned to the Department of Virginia by President Abraham Lincoln. Butler arriving at Fort Monroe on May 22. The next day the Commonwealth of Virginia ratified their vote to secede from the United States. That night three enslaved men, known today as Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory, and James Townsend, bravely fled from their labors constructing gun positions for the Confederate forces at Sewell’s Point across the waters of Hampton Roads and sought freedom at Fort Monroe. On the 24th Butler interviewed Baker, Mallory, and Townsend in his office here located to the left of the front door on the second floor. Hearing their testimony and request for freedom Butler made a landmark decision. Instead of returning them to enslavement he exploited the facts of their forced labor to support the ongoing rebellion to consider and declare Baker, Mallory, and Townsend “Contraband of War” granting these men a protection and a sense of freedom. As a result of Butler’s actions, Congress passed the Confiscation Act in August 1861 legalizing Butler’s policy. Further, Butler’s decision allowed untold thousands of enslaved Africans to shed their chains of bondage and grasp their freedom; not only here in Hampton Roads, but everywhere the Union forces were found.<br /> <br /> Other notable figures who visited or lived in Quarters No. 1 include Marquis de Lafayette who visited Fort Monroe on October 24-25, 1824, touring the nation he helped form; George B. McClellan as he began his Peninsula Campaign in 1862; John Wool who took over command of Fort Monroe in 1862; Abraham Lincoln who visited the post May 6-11, 1862, and helped plan attacks on Norfolk; Ulysses S. Grant who met with Butler in April 1864 at Fort Monroe to plan his Overland Campaign and Butler’s role in the larger military movement and Nelson Miles who supervised the imprisonment of Jefferson Davis; King Kalākaua of the Kingdom of Hawai'i on his world tour in 1881.<br /> <br /> The building is currently closed to the public as it undergoes exterior stabilization with the intention of supporting public access in the future.  ",

Besides all being made of brick, you will notice similar symmetry, similar porches, similar columns, and a sense of standardization. In 1823, this  structure and the building to the left was built to mirror one another. Further, two French engineers – Simon Bernard and Charles Gratiot – intended to connect these homes with a grand central building that was never constructed. Due to an American interjection of architectural style, these sresulting buildings display a federal architectural feature.<br /> <br /> Building # 17 was constructed to be bachelor officers’ quarters housing eight single officers, but eventually families joined fathers and husbands which promoted the conversion of Building # 17 into the four unit structure seen today. One well known resident was United States Army 2nd Lieutenant Robert E. Lee and his wife, Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee from 1831-1834. Lee served as the second in command of the engineers constructing the fort and was often left in charge of these efforts. Lee would primarily oversee construction of Fort Monroe’s moat and nearby Fort Calhoun (now Fort Wool). In 1832, Mary Custis Lee would give birth to the couple’s first son, George Washington Custis Lee. In 1834, Lee would be reassigned to duty in Washington, DC. Ongoing research continues to explore and to uncover the lives of all that once occupied this structure.<br /> <br /> Building #17 is now the Headquarters of Fort Monroe National Monument and is not regularly open to the public. <p> </p> <p> </p>",

From Fort Algernourne, the first militarized structure at Point Comfort, to Fort Monroe National Monument, the museum shares over 400 years of history. The roles and uses of casemates varied over time. Casemates were constructed as gun positions but also used to house soldiers, store weapons and ammunition, and hold prisoners – including <i>Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak, </i>also known as Chief Black Hawk, in 1833. Jefferson Davis was also imprisoned at Fort Monroe held in Casemate No. 2 after his May 1865 capture in Georgia. In June 1951, the Casemate Museum opened as a one room museum, but has since expanded.

        "notes": "First Africans in Virginia\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/first-africans-in-virginia.htm\n\nThe English held a presence in Virginia since 1607 when the Virginia Company colonists led by Captain John Smith established the first permanent English settlement in North America. They landed at Point Comfort, giving it this name before moving on to make their settlement at Jamestown along the James River. For twelve years colonists struggled to survive as a result of environmental strains and self-inflicted conflict with American Indians. At times the only line of survival was incoming trade and supplies.<br /> <br /> In August 1619, English privateer ships  attacked a Spanish slave ship the São João Bautista  they likely expected to carry gold and riches near the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico. One of the privateer ships, the White Lion, continued on steering for port at Point Comfort with “20. and odd” Africans they had captured in this battle. These men and women were the first enslaved Africans forcibly taken and traded for provisions in English North America. They were among the 350 souls taken from Ndango, Congo, and Kabosa in the Angola region of Africa bound for a live of slavery and servitude in the Spanish held Mexico. Forcibly taken, these human beings implanted African food production and crop cultivation practices into English North America which helped English colonists survive and thrive in the New World. They also carved out an existence with the New World by continuing cultural practices – music and dance – along with speaking their native dialect and practicing African beliefs.We know the name of two Africans landed at Point Comfort; Isabella and Antoney. From a Virginia census, we know that Isabella, Antoney, and their son William lived in Hampton in the home of Captain William Tucker, the commander of Fort Algernourne (William is the first documented child born of African descent in English North America). Over the next four hundred years, descendants of these first Africans faced enslavement, domestic terrorism, civil unrest, physical attacks, and executions while forcibly building Hampton, Virginia, and the greater United States.<br /> <br /> Today, we remember the first “20. and odd” Africans each August with commemorative programs recognizing the generations of enslaved Africans, and their descendants, and how their efforts and presence shaped the course of a nation while fighting for “unalienable Rights…Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”",

        "notes": "Old Point Comfort Lighthouse\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/old-point-comfort-lighthouse.htm\n\nOrigins of the Point Comfort Lighthouse may date back to sixteenth-century American Indians. Some historians have suggested that American Indians burned wood along the coast to aid Spanish shops entering the harbor. There may be some validity to these theories as the Spanish did set up a Mission along the York River in 1570. The Mission was short lived as Spanish Jesuits were killed by Indians the following year. This set off a small conflict between American Indians and the Spanish in the New World. A more viable origin of Point Comfort’s Lighthouse occurred in 1774 when Virginia employed John Dames as caretaker of the ruins of Fort George (destroyed by a Hurricane previously). Tradition holds that Dames passed his boredom by operating a light and guiding ships into Hampton Roads. By 1775, Dames was granted a salary of 20 pounds annually. The 54 foot white octagonal structure was built in 1802 and is the oldest structure at Point Comfort. A spiral staircase leads to the top where ten oil lanterns burned 486 gallons of oil per year (today the oil lanterns are replaced by modern bulbs). In the nineteenth century, the oil lanterns could be seen for up to fourteen miles out to sea. In 1813, the British captured this lighthouse and burned Hampton in June 25, 1813 as a result of their defeat at the hands of Virginia militia at Norfolk. The Point Comfort Lighthouse was a beacon of freedom to enslaved people seeking refuge at Fort Monroe. Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory, James Townsend and other enslaved people may have followed the light from Sewell’s Point to Point Comfort. William Roscoe Davis arrived at Fort Monroe in 1861 seeking freedom. Born around Norfolk, Virginia in 1814 to an enslaved mother of mixed African and American Indian descent and a Caucasian father, Davis found an opportunity to escape as a boat operator pre-Civil War. While at Fort Monroe, Davis spoke to enslaved people and United States soldiers with a preacher’s aura. In 1870, Davis returned to Hampton from his time in New York and operated the lighthouse in 1870 for eight years. Following Davis’ tenure was another formerly enslaved individual, John Jones who kept his post for 30 years. Today, the lighthouse is operated by the Coast Guard and closed to the public. <br />  ",

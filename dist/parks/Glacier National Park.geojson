In the summer, grizzlies are often seen churning up meadows, looking for food like glacier lily bulbs and ground squirrels. Bears are omnivores, which means they eat both plans and meat. You might be surprised to learn that in Glacier National Park, most of a grizzly bear’s diet is plants, especially berries. During the winter months, when food is nearly nonexistent, bears will hibernate, living off fat reserves.<br /> <br /> Grizzly bears depend on high energy foods to get them through their long hibernation in winter. The meadows the grizzly bears depend on to find their yummy plants and roots are being filled in with trees. It seems that the warmer the climate gets, the more trees that can move into the meadows. Also, foods like whitebark pine nuts help the bears to build up enough fat to hibernate through the winter. These pine nuts have all but disappeared in Glacier because of a disease called white pine blister rust that is killing the whitebark pine trees. Bears have to find other foods to replace the nutritious pine nuts they used to depend on. Protected places like Glacier National Park provide a diversity of food sources for these super excavators.</p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{142}\" paraid=\"1369756085\"><br /> <strong>Mountain Explorer (Wolverine) </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{160}\" paraid=\"784035435\"><em>Did You Know?</em> Wolverines are super explorers. They routinely travel hundreds of miles a week through some of the most remote regions of the park. As they explore their territory and look for food, even the high peaks like Mt. Cleveland are no obstacle. One male wolverine climbed 5,000 feet in 90 minutes on his way up and over the summer. <br /> <br /> Researchers in Glacier National Park have found that the deep snow covers up their burrows where they have their babies in the middle of winter. The air trapped in the snow makes it act like a blanket over the cold ground, keeping their burrows cozy for their young. Wolverines may suffer if they cannot find enough places with deep snow that they can burrow underground into to have shelter for their families. Right now, protected places like Glacier National Park provide important strongholds for these super explorers.</p>",

Before Glacier National Park was established in 1910, oil wells could be seen below active glaciers.  <br />  <br /> Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that warms the planet. High elevation areas like Logan Pass are warming much faster than the global average, causing glacier retreat here and around the globe.  <br />  <br /> Charted below in red, you can see that since early drillers moved into this area the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen sharply.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{186}\" paraid=\"2005846129\">If the old stories are true, early prospectors were lured to natural oil seeps in Glacier by bears that had wallowed in the “black gold.” In 1892, a local paper presumed that this was “the only case where bears have been the guides of men to valuable deposits beneath the surface of the earth.”  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{192}\" paraid=\"303837474\">By the end of 1901, the Butte Oil Company had started drilling Montana’s first oil well at the head of Kintla Lake in what is now the northwest corner of the park. Others thought they would find fortune by drilling in the Many Glacier Valley, pictured here.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{206}\" paraid=\"1931252613\">But the dream of riches did not pan out. One prospector was able to pipe just enough gas to burn for warmth in the winter. No one else did much better. The eager team at Kintla only ever found enough to get their hopes up. Then, sometime in the winter of 1902-1903, the accidental ignition of leaking gas sparked a fire that destroyed their whole operation. What little oil they had found, along with their buildings and equipment, went up in a cloud of black smoke.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{212}\" paraid=\"1547221170\"> <br /> The oil boom ended by the time the park was established, but carbon dioxide molecules released in that fire are still in the atmosphere, adding to the 421 parts per million (ppm) recorded in 2022, warming the Earth and melting the glaciers. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{218}\" paraid=\"1921080659\"> <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{222}\" paraid=\"151974625\"><strong>A Century of Concerns </strong><br /> <br /> “An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature,” wrote Eunice Foote in 1856. Her research is the first known to have demonstrated the existence of greenhouse gases. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels were consistently around 280 ppm for about 6,000 years. <br />  <br /> “The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas,” is releasing carbon dioxide and warming the climate, announced a 1965 report from the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. These changes “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings,” the Johnson report cautioned. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{234}\" paraid=\"1020188572\">“It is becoming increasingly clear that we should anticipate substantial climate change during the next several decades as a result of man’s impact on the composition of the atmosphere.” That was the warning from NASA scientist, Dr. James Hansen to Congress in March, 1982. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{250}\" paraid=\"971038253\">The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 421 parts per million (ppm) in 2022, the highest concentration in human history. “We have known about this for half a century, and have failed to do anything meaningful about it,” said senior NOAA scientist, Pieter Tans.<br />  </p> <hr /> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{250}\" paraid=\"971038253\"><br /> <br /> <strong>Solutions & Benefits</strong><br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{184}\" paraid=\"2118420953\">How did you get here? It’s likely that burning fossil fuels was your only choice for traveling to Logan Pass. That is how it’s been for most visitors since Going-to-the-Sun Road first opened in 1933. For over a century, fossil fuels have taken us anywhere we wanted to go.</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{190}\" paraid=\"231760022\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{194}\" paraid=\"1123800208\">Though unintended, burning these fuels releases greenhouse gases that warm the climate. Limiting this warming requires shifting away from fossil fuels. Besides mitigating climate change, there are many other benefits to this transition.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{200}\" paraid=\"1440137662\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{204}\" paraid=\"1875596129\">Electric vehicles and appliances powered by renewable energy are more efficient, quieter, and safer. Fossil fuels may have been your only choice today, but alternatives—and their side benefits—are quickly becoming widespread.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{210}\" paraid=\"124154471\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{214}\" paraid=\"1817486045\">For these reasons and more, Glacier National Park has already begun an effort to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, lowering its greenhouse gas emissions. From remote areas like Polebridge and Goat Haunt to busy hubs like the Apgar Visitor Center and park headquarters, Glacier is transitioning to renewable sources of energy.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{220}\" paraid=\"117018904\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{224}\" paraid=\"772085794\">The Logan Pass Visitor Center showcases these efforts. Open during the sunny summer months, this area obtains all of its electricity from solar panels—a model of sustainability. </p>",

At the end of August, they go into a special type of sleep called hibernation. From September through May, they snooze underground. Would you like to sleep through the whole school year? To survive that long without eating, they need lots of fat, so they spend the summer gorging themselves on plants. </p> <p paraeid=\"{eeb8c21c-2cd3-4561-8f22-35e9279467a8}{119}\" paraid=\"1574642640\">Marmots spend their whole lives in the alpine. They live in boulder fields, called talus, or in rocky meadows. They are skilled burrowers that spend most of their lives (80%) underground. During the summer, marmots use their burrows to raise their young, and to escape from predators. In winter, the deep snow that piles up over their burrows is important because it’s like a white blanket, keeping the ground warmer when the air temperatures above the snow get super cold. A low snow year means a “thinner blanket” for keeping the marmot’s burrow from freezing. Every super power has a weakness, and for the marmot it is being able to put on enough fat during the short summers to survive their long hibernation. Young marmots can lose half of their body weight during hibernation! Not to mention that while they are sound asleep underground in winter, they can become easy prey to a hungry, super-exploring wolverine. The adventures of this super sleeper will continue to be played out here in Glacier National Park.<br /> <br /> <strong>Super Reaper (Pika) </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{eeb8c21c-2cd3-4561-8f22-35e9279467a8}{141}\" paraid=\"308543899\"><em>Did You Know?</em> Pikas cut and gather grass and wildflowers all summer. These small-but-mighty super reapers store grass and flowers in large piles, to eat during the long winter. One 5-ounce pika can reap 30 pounds of food each summer. That’s 100 times its body weight! If you had a super-reaping power, which food would you store up? <br /> <br /> These super reapers require a cold climate. Pikas have difficulty keeping their bodies from over-heating if it gets too warm outside. Temperatures can reach higher than 90 degrees where they live in their alpine habitats. As their climate gets warmer each year, it may become too warm for them, and they may disappear. Glacier National Park researchers and citizen scientists monitor these super reapers to help understand more about how they survive as climate changes the way they live.</p>",

It’s almost like they can be invisible. They get two sets of feathers every year: a brown set for summer and a white set for winter. That way, they can be camouflaged year-round. The super hiding power of their feathers helps to keep them from being eaten by predators. <br /> <br /> With their super hiding powers, you may hear ptarmigan before you see them. One of this super power’s weaknesses is that it can be very talkative when it’s with ptarmigan friends. They blow their own cover! Ptarmigan change color when they sense the shorter days and colder temperatures of winter coming. The ptarmigan’s invisibility cloak of white feathers won’t help it if it rains in winter instead of snows. The ground will be brown and the ptarmigan will have turned white. That makes it easy for one of their arch enemy predators to find them! Like the super reaper pika, ptarmigan have lived so long in the cold that their bodies can’t get rid of heat when it gets too hot. Ptarmigan need snow banks to keep cool by and little trickles of water nearby throughout the summer. Protected places like Glacier National Park are providing clues to the ability of animals like the super hider ptarmigan to change with a changing climate.</p> <p paraeid=\"{738141d4-1d24-4689-b043-567a9136fd96}{102}\" paraid=\"445886715\"><br /> <strong>Super Seekers (Weasel) </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{738141d4-1d24-4689-b043-567a9136fd96}{118}\" paraid=\"1888662686\"><em>Did You Know? </em>Weasels are super seekers. Their fur changes from brown in the summer to white in the winter, so they blend in with the background all year long. Their long, sleek bodies are low to the ground, allowing them to sneak up on prey long before being seen. Small mammals and birds need to be on the alert to avoid these super seekers.  <br /> <br /> This super power’s weakness, like the ptarmigan’s, may be to change color and be white when it hasn’t yet snowed. Then they would also be more visible to other predators looking to eat them. That would be a good thing for the other predator! For the weasel, their super seeking power wouldn’t work as well if they weren’t camouflaged. It would be a lot harder to sneak up on its prey. </p>",

Their huge, curved horns grow bigger each year and can weigh over 30 pounds. They also have extra-thick skulls. It’s like they wear super-protective helmets. They use their power each fall during contests for females. The strongest head-banger wins. <br /> <br /> Bighorn sheep need wide, open spaces, unobstructed by trees. They want to be able to see long distances so they have lots of time to get away from their predators. As the climate warms, and the alpine meadows in Glacier National Park are filled with trees, sheep will have less open space. Sheep populations can also be weakened by disease. They are social animals, so when a disease strikes one, it strikes them all. Protected places like Glacier National Park provide important year round habitat for these super head bangers.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{26}\" paraid=\"80042767\"><strong>Cliff Hangers (Mountain Goat) </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{44}\" paraid=\"1705219234\"><em>Did You Know?</em> Mountain goats have super climbing powers. They have split hooves with two toes that spread wide to help them balance. They also have a rough concave pad on the bottom of each tow that helps them grip steep cliffs. <br /> <br /> Although they are super climbers, the steep areas they live in are also places with lots of avalanches. When those huge slabs of snow slide down the mountainside, mountain goats can be caught in their destructive paths. Also, in order to live in these high peaks, goats have warm thick coats to survive the cold temperatures in the winter. They shed these coats in summer but still need snowfields and shaded places to stay cool in as summer temperatures heat up. Glacier National Park researchers and citizen scientists are keeping tabs on these super climbers to help understand more about them.</p>",

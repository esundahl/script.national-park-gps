After the Civil War, presidents and families visited this space to honor the fallen. Today, Arlington National Cemetery stands as a memorial to service and sacrifice.<br /> <br /> This 1869 Harpers Weekly illustration conveys the somber scene.

This was Freedmans Village, a temporary community of former slaves established in 1863. Most who lived here risked their lives to escape the chains of slavery. Their opportunity came as Union troops marched throughout Virginia and Maryland.<br /> <br /> Freedmans Village was home to more than 1,100 people including Sojourner Truth, who lived here for one year. Two families made a home under each roof, planting trees and vegetable gardens. A hospital cared for the sick, while churches and schools cultivated minds. Many worked in construction and some enlisted in the Union Army. Under segregation, villagers faced hardships and the threat of eviction. Nonetheless, a chance at a new life began.",

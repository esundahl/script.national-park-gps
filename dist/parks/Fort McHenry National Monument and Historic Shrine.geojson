Colonel George Armistead:<br /> <br /> Born on April 10, 1780, in Caroline County, Virginia, George was one of five brothers, all of whom later served in the War of 1812. On May 18, 1813, while serving as an artillery officer at Fort Niagara, New York, he took an active part in the American attack on Fort George across the Niagara River in upper Canada and was accorded the honor of delivering the captured British flags to President James Madison. On his taking command of Fort McHenry in June 1813, Armistead ordered a flag made \"so large that the British will have no difficulty in seeing it from a distance.\"<br /> <br /> He earned his enduring place in American history under that flag at Fort McHenry whose stalwart defense of Baltimore against British attack in 1814 inspired Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Armistead remained in command of the fort until his untimely death at age 38 on April 25, 1818. He is buried in Old St. Paul's Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland.</p>",

Bastion 5 also allows access to a brick path that runs along the ramparts leading visitors to bastions 4 and 3. <br /> <br /> From this point, several key markers of the Battle of Baltimore can be seen. When looking back towards the city of Baltimore take note of a large green space in the distance with a flag pole flying the American flag. Today this is Patterson Park, but in 1814 this was known as Hampstead Hill. It was there that American soldiers, militia, and citizens came together to dig large earthworks and a force of 15,000 troops stood in the way of 5,000 British soldiers on their way to burn Baltimore. It was the defenses of Hampstead Hill that forced the British Navy to attack Fort McHenry in order to attempt to get into the Baltimore harbor. <br /> <br /> In additon Francis Scott Key's position while observing the battle is out on the river about three miles from the location of this bastion. Additionally the British ships that bombarded the fort were two miles off shore. For reference the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the distance is roughly four miles away.</p>",

Improvements were quickly made, including expanding the existing powder storage. The bombproof casements in the sallyport were expanded to hold powder, but an officer was worried about having large amounts of powder stored in a frequently used area where smoking was common. Thus, a Powder Magazine outside of the fort was contracted in 1863 and completed in 1864. The brick-vaulted magazine could hold up to 1,500 barrels of powder. <br /> <br /> The Civil War powsder magazine is not open for the public to go inside, however visitors can access the outside of the structure by following the seawall trail toward the large Orpheus Statue.

Not knowing for sure when an attack would occur, they spent months preparing for it. Everything was made ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore.<br /> <br /> Major George Armistead, the Fort’s commanding officer, desired \"to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty in seeing it from a distance.\"<br /> <br /> In the summer of 1813, Armistead ordered a large garrison flag (30 feet by 42 feet) as well as with a smaller storm flag (17 feet by 25 feet) for the Fort. The job went out to a 37-year-old widow, Mary Pickersgill, a ship and signal flag maker. She labored for seven weeks with her 13-year-old daughter, Caroline, two nieces, 13-year-old Eliza Young and 15-year-old Margaret Young, a 13-year-old African-American indentured servant, Grace Wisher, and possibly her mother, Rebecca Young, who had taught her the trade. They pieced together strips of loosely woven English wool bunting then laid the whole flag out on the expansive floor of a brewery near Mrs. Pickersgill’s Pratt Street house, now the Star-Spangled Banner House museum. The flags were finished on August 19, 1813.<br /> <br /> The larger of the two flags had stripes two feet wide, and stars 24 inches from point to point. At that time, it was the practice to add one star and stripe for each new state joining the Union. In 1814, the United States flag had 15 stars and 15 stripes.<br /> <br /> The 30' x 42' flag was the one that Francis Scott Key saw on the morning of September 14, 1814. It inspired him to write the words to \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Today this flag is displayed in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C. The smaller storm flag, which many historians believe was the flag that flew during the rainy bombardment, has been lost to history.</p>",

Although it was a smaller building than the barracks, there were far fewer men living in this building allowing for more living space and a more lavish lifestyle that came with the priveledges of an officer's commission.<br /> <br /> At the time of the War of 1812 the building was only one story, however in the 1830s a second level was added. The first level of the building is partially opened to visitors. The middle door opens to an exhibnit that depicts the scene of how officers' quarters would have looked during the summer of 1814. The door on the right leads to a room that depicts an office that would have been used by officers in the same time period, but is only open when staffing is available. </p>",

It is virtually the same now as it was during the Civil War. The Main Gate was often the first and last thing a prisoner would see during their stay at Fort McHenry. Concerned citizens from the town would often leave fresh vegetables and other food items at the gate, in hopes of providing food to the prisoners held at Fort McHenry throughout the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The modern gate is the entry and exit point for all visitors to the park. The gate features a vehicle gate that is wide enough for one vehicle to go through at a time. Vehicles entering and exiting the park should alternate to keep traffic moving. On either side of the main gate are two pedestrian gates to allow pedestrians and bicyclists to enter the park. All three gates open at 9 am and close 5 pm in the fall, winter, and spring, or 6 pm in the summer (Memorial Day to Labor Day).</p>",

A national competition was held by the “Fine Arts Commission” on May 28, 1916. One of the 34 entries was a design by Charles H. Niehaus. His work, called Orpheus with the Awkward Foot was chosen.<br /> <br /> There was a delay erecting the statue due to World War I. Finally, the statue was completed and a dedication was held on Flag Day, June, 14, 1922. The ceremony was attended by President Warren G. Harding.<br /> <br /> The statue was originally placed in the middle of the entrance road with a circular drive around it. In 1962, Orpheus was relocated to the present site.<br /> <br /> The monument consists of a 15-foot high circular base made of white marble. Decorated with a frieze in low relief, the base is surmounted by a 24-foot high figure of Orpheus in bronze, shown playing a five-stringed tortoise-shell lyre. The frieze starts with a portrait shield of Key and the dedication, then continues around the drum of the base with a representation of the classic muses paying honor to the army and navy.<br /> <br /> The marble base bears a medallion honoring Francis Scott Key, flanked by a procession of allegorical figures. The pedestal contains a time capsule filled with documents of patriotic and historical interest. Although the time capsule was opened in 1962, there are no plans to open it in the future.<br /> <br /> The inscription on the base reads:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>To Francis Scott Key - Author of the Star Spangled Banner and to the soldiers and sailors who took part in the Battle of North Point and the defense of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812.</em></p> <p><br />  </p>",

The outer battery is one of the aspects that gives the fort more of an appearance for how it would have looked during the Civil War, rather than the War of 1812. Originally the battery was outfitted with large Columbiad guns meant for coastal defense. In 1866 the military began replacing these guns with the larger Rodman guns. Fort McHenry boasts the largest collection Rodman cannons with a collection of 8, 10, and 15 inch guns. The Rodmans are no longer active with their last firings occuring on June 30, 1903. <br /> <br /> In visiting the outer battery visitors can get quite a view, and a first hand visit into history. Brick paths allow visitors to walk in the outer defenses between the walls of the original fort and the earthen mounds, as well as on top of the outer battery walls. Some powder magazines are still open for visitors to enter and explore. Not to mention you can get up close and personal with original, massive, Rodman cannons that are over 150 years old!</p>",

The trail offers various angles to view the star fort structure as well small glimpses into nature with a wide variety of birds, memorial cherry blossoms, and river wildlife. Visitors will also pass by the large Orpheus statue that was dedicated to Francis Scott Key in the early 20th Century. There is no cost to walk the trail and there are various benches and signage along the way. ",

The fort was constructed to defend Baltimore's harbor that sits just about 2 miles to the north west. This structure, as well as water batteries that would have surrounded it, is what stood between the British Navy and being able to support their ground forces in the possible burning of Baltimore in 1814 during the War of 1812. The British Navy Bombarded this fort for 25 hours but was unable to remove the defenders from its wall, forcing their invading forces to withdraw and saving the City of Baltimore from destruction. This event inspired Francis Scott Key to write the Star-Spangled Banner, today's National Anthem.<br /> <br /> The fort remained active beyond its War of 1812 fame. Today the fort most resembles its Civil War era appearance with the inner buildings being built up to two stories, and an outer battery area featuring Rodman cannons dating to the 1860's. The Civil War period found the fort acting as prison for both prisoners of war, and political prisoners who threatened Maryland's possible secession. The fort's busiest time period was during the First World War where it was the centerpiece of a 3,000 bed hospital that was built up on the grounds surrounding it. Shortly after the First World War the fort was removed from active military use, although it was recalled into action during the Second World War as a Coast Guard training facility.<br /> <br /> As you enter the fort explore the various rooms in the buildings that tell the many stories of the fort's long history. Follow paths on top of the ramparts and outer battery that provide scenic and historic view sheds. And take a step back in time with interpretive programs that occur regularly. ",

This large one room building has a dome shaped roof to help prevent enemy shells and shrapnel from directly hitting the roof. The magazine had not been made bombproof yet by 1814, however, and disaster almost struck when a British bomb hit the structure during the bombardment of Fort McHenry. Luckly the bomb did not explode and thus the fort's gunpowder supply did not explode with it.<br /> <br /> Shortly after the battle the structure was made bombproof, thickening its walls with a layer of dirt and then and additional layer of bricks. Additionally after the battle, Major Armistead ordered other powder magazines to be built to spread out the fort's powder supply and prevent the possibility of a disaster occuring. Today visitors can enter the powder magazine to see a repleca of how the inside would have looked while the fort was active.</p>",

Under the direction of Captain Samuel Babcock, U.S. Army Engineers, civilian laborers, along with members of the First Marine Artillery of the Union, worked throughout the summer of 1813 on improving the Upper and Lower Water Batteries and mounting 18- and 36-pounder naval guns. <br />  </p> <p>Both the Upper and Lower Water Batteries were originially built as part of the Revolutionary War fort, Fort Whetstone. In 1813 the works were again improved under the direction of Captain Samuel Babcock, U.S. Army Engineers. The battery initially mounted guns of 18- and 36-pounder size, with at least three more added prior to the battle in 1814. The batteries also featured a brick hot shot furnaces.</p>   <p>These water batteries were charged with keeping the British ships at bay, and had a range of a mile and a half. When the British ships reached what Armistead believed to be \"good striking distance,\" he ordered \"fire to be opened, which was obeyed with alacrity\" with \"a roar that shook the whole harbor...\" and within half-an-hour the \"intruders again sheltered themselves by withdrawing beyond our reach.\" The garrison \"gave three cheers and again ceased firing.\" The British ships \"continued throwing shells,\" at the forts and batteries.</p>",

The schools were highly segregated at the time, and the groves reflect this segregation. The trees planted by the African American students were planted on the east side of the Fort while these trees were planted by white students. The cherry blossoms have been replanted over the years, and still bloom annually.<br /> <br /> Originally plans to establish these groves at Fort McHenry were proposed to attract visitors to Baltimore in the same vein as the popular cherry trees that were planted around the Potomac Park Tidal Basin in Washington D.C. in 1912.

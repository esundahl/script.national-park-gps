This tour will wind you through our 1,800-acre park highlighting significant pieces of art and architecture that mark this storied landscape. With more than 1,400 pieces of commemorative art, Vicksburg National Military Park was considered by at least one veteran to be “the art park of the world.” <br /> <br /> Throughout your tour today, you will encounter many different styles of monument, all a hallmark to the era in which they were created. From the classicism of the American Renaissance which dominated American art and architecture from 1876 – 1917, to the visual language expressed within the abstract, each artwork is heavily laden with symbols representative of the themes that define this park’s story: honor, sacrifice, memory, and reconciliation.<br /> <br /> If we may direct your attention to your park map, you will notice red triangles with a state’s name next to it. These red triangles represent our larger state monuments and their locations within our park. Our park has monuments for all states that were active in the Vicksburg Campaign – the only exception is the State of Ohio which opted for many smaller, unique monuments for each of their regiments.<br /> <br /> As you travel through the park you will also notice several smaller state markers, each with a design unique to their own state. These were used to mark where specific regiments were stationed on a siege line.<br /> <br /> This audio tour will highlight some of the significant pieces of art within the park. If you wish to learn more, please select “Explore this Location,” at the conclusion of each tour stop. Many of our larger monuments have areas where you can pull over, park your vehicle, and get a more detailed look. We encourage you to do this at each location so that you may fully experience each artwork in the manner that the artist intended.<br /> <br /> Once you are ready, make your way towards the Memorial Arch at the entrance of the park. This will be the starting point for your tour today.",

        "name": "Illinois Memorial",
        "notes": "Illinois Memorial\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/illinois-memorial.htm\n\nStanding as the largest and most recognized monument on the battlefield, the Illinois Memorial is visible from many points in the park.<br /> <br /> An exemplary illustration of the American Renaissance, this grand domed temple is modeled after the Roman Pantheon. The Pantheon was built as a temple to the gods of Ancient Rome, and by the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the generic term pantheon was used to describe a building that honored the illustrious dead. In a similar way, the Illinois Memorial was built to honor and remember all Illinoisans who served throughout the Vicksburg Campaign. The architect, Major William LeBaron Jenney commented on this design choice, stating, “<i>In designing the memorial, the decision was made to construct not only a grand and imposing commemorative structure worthy of the State of Illinois, but a<b> temple of fame</b> as well, within the walls of which will be preserved in enduring bronze and stone the name of every soldier from Illinois who participated in that memorable and decisive campaign and siege</i>.\" Further, with the idea of the Renaissance being a rebirth, the obvious use of renaissance design concepts could lend itself to the interpretation of the rebirth of a nation after a bloody civil war.<br /> <br /> While the facade contains many artistic and architectural details, including the faces of President Abraham Lincoln, Illinois Governor Richard Yates, and Union General Ulysses S. Grant as well as a golden eagle adorning the top, there are no devices indicative of war. This requirement was set by the Illinois Commission that authorized the memorial’s placement in the park.<br /> <br /> Within the tympanum are seen three female figures carved in marble. These monumental maidens are, from left to right, Pax the Roman goddess of peace, Clio the Roman goddess of history, and Flora, the Roman goddess of flowering plants. Pax and Flora symbolize the North and the South, respectively. They each lean in towards Clio as they recall the heroism of their soldiers while Clio records their deed for the ages.<br /> <br /> There are 47 steps leading up to the temple floor, symbolizing the 47 days of the Siege of Vicksburg. The inscription on the exterior of the dome references President Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural address, in which he stated, “With Malice Toward None, With Charity for All.” Followed by that are words from Grant’s 1868 speech at the Republican National Convention, “Let Us Have Peace.” Around the temple’s interior, 60 bronze tablets bear the names of the 36,325 soldiers from the State of Illinois who served in the Vicksburg Campaign.<br /> <br /> This memorial was completed in 1906 and formally dedicated on October 26, 1906.",

        "notes": "Iowa Memorial\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/iowa-memorial.htm\n\nThe final state monument seen in our park commemorates the service of 38 infantry units, 3 artillery units, and three cavalry units from the State of Iowa who served in the Vicksburg Campaign. The Greek-Doric, peristyle monument was dedicated in 1906 and consists of a semi-ellipse curve with six bronze, high-relief sculptures depicting engagements of the Vicksburg Campaign. The artist, Henry Hudson Kitson, created several artworks you have seen on your tour today.<br /> <br /> The memorial features six bronze relief plaques, each denoting a specific battle in the Vicksburg Campaign. The plaques are as follows: Iowa at Grand Gulf, Iowa at Port Gibson, Iowa at Jackson, Iowa at Champion Hill, Iowa at Big Black River Bridge, and Iowa Assault on Vicksburg, May 22, 1863. To get a better understanding of the emotion and romanticism present within the works, take a moment to observe the artwork up close and in greater detail. Pay special attention to the flag and the eagle that sits atop its staff as it journeys with the Iowans through the campaign.<br /> <br /> Perhaps the most striking component of the Iowa Memorial is its stand-alone color-bearer. Sculpted by Kitson and his wife Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson, the color bearer was completed and installed in 1912. Designed after Theo’s 1907 work, “The Standard Bearer,” dedicated to the 124<sup>th</sup> New York Infantry, this color bearer sits mounted atop his stallion. Holding high the United States flag, his chest lifted, he gives an air of confidence, bravery, and poise as he leads his fellow Iowans into battle. The eagle atop the flagstaff reflects his posture and attitude as it symbolizes strength, courage, power, and freedom. See if you can spot the eagle within the six relief plaques.<br /> <br /> Do you notice anything symbolic in its positioning?   ",

        "notes": "Massachusetts Memorial\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/massachusetts-memorial.htm\n\nTo your left stands the park’s first state monument, the Massachusetts Memorial. Dedicated on November 14, 1903, in front of a crowd filled with former Union and Confederate soldiers, city and park officials, civilians, and children, the monument honors the 29<sup>th</sup>, 35<sup>th</sup>, and 36<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts Infantry Regiments. Standing atop the 15-ton granite boulder from Massachusetts, is “The Volunteer.” This volunteer is identified as a Massachusetts soldier only by the Massachusetts Coat of Arms present upon the boulder. If such notation were to be taken away, it would be impossible to know if the soldier was Union or Confederate. Such was the artist’s intent – ambiguity in the identity of the soldier so that all soldiers viewing the artwork could see themselves within.<br /> <br /> The volunteer’s expression is frank, open, and fearless as he seemingly marches along carrying all the accoutrements of a typical Civil War soldier. But it is not just the items he carries or the clothing he wears that help us know more about this volunteer, but the manner in which he carries such items and the way he wears his uniform that distinguish him as an experienced soldier. For instance, his haversack is positioned behind his left hip so as to counterbalance the weight of the rifle over his right shoulder and his pant legs are tucked into his socks to ward off pesky ticks and redbugs. Through such symbolism, this sculpture captures the spirit of the American Volunteer – an ordinary man one day, an experienced hero the next. What other uniform items and accoutrements can you identify?<br /> <br /> The memorial was sculpted by famed female artist Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson – the most represented artist in our park -- and is a copy of her 1902 work, “Volunteer” which can be seen in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The reception of the sculpture was so successful that several other copies were requested and stand throughout the Northeastern United States.",

Built with funds leftover from the park’s 1917 Peace Jubilee – a reunion of both Union and Confederate veterans – granite monument is a symbol of reconciliation and reunification of the country and its people in the decades following the Civil War. Expressed within its design are architectural elements synonymous with the American Renaissance, providing an excellent orientation to many of the artworks we will discuss today. Exemplifying simplicity are the two Doric order columns. The simplest of the three orders, Doric columns are the only style column you will see within the park. Carved in the granite are structural details such as triglyphs and guttae. These carvings offer no actual structural support but are meant to be indicative of actual architectural elements, rather than just for design purposes.<br /> <br /> Designed by Charles L. Lawhon, the Memorial Arch used to stand over Clay Street, the main thoroughfare at your right, until 1967 when expansion of that roadway required its relocation to its current site.",

The monument honors the 1st and 3rd Mississippi Infantry Regiments, African Descent, and all Mississippians of African descent who participated in the Vicksburg Campaign. These United States Colored Troops played a key role in the Union victory at Milliken’s Bend on June 7, 1863.<br /> <br /> The monument features three men: centrally, a wounded black soldier who is being aided by a black soldier in uniform and a civilian laborer in farm attire. The civilian laborer looks back symbolically at the life of enslavement they are leaving behind, the wounded soldier’s face depicts the pain and sacrifices of the present war, while the uniformed soldier looks forward into a hopeful future.<br /> <br /> While the American Renaissance movement of art that influenced many of the monuments in the park ended in 1917, the sculptor of this monument-- Dr. J. Kim Sessums, a Mississippi native -- still utilized some of the key features of the movement, like his focus on anatomical proportions. The three male figures of the sculpture maintain anatomical, proportional, and historical accuracy.<br /> <br /> This monument was dedicated on February 14, 2004 and stands as one of the largest tributes to African American soldiers on any Civil War battlefield within the National Park Service.",

Dedicated on November 13, 1909, this granite Roman Composite memorial stands 76-feet high and was designed by architect R.H. Hunt of Chattanooga, Tennessee with the bronze work sculpted by artist Frederick C. Triebel of Peoria, Illinois. In a discussion of his bronze relief sculptures, Triebel is noted as saying, “My idea of a monument to the heroes of the siege of the City of Vicksburg is to represent the glorification of the defenders as conceived by the classics.”<br /> Triebel certainly embodies such sentiments within his work through his moving compositions that seem to almost come alive and emerge from the bronze itself to continue the defense.<br /> <br /> Seen on the left of the base of the obelisk is a Mississippi Color Guard unit and at right is sculpted an artillery crew. In between the two, carved in low relief, is a vivid scene of battle. Atop this scene sits Clio, the Greek and Roman goddess of history. She is seen in a cloak decorated with a pattern of eyes, symbolizing her all-seeing abilities. Upon her lap rests her traditional open scroll on which she records the deeds of history.",

        "notes": "Missouri Memorial\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/missouri-memorial.htm\n\nThe familiar phrase “brother vs. brother” as is so often spoken in discussion of the Civil War rings true here at the Missouri Monument. This red granite, Roman Composite design stands atop Green’s Redan, a site where soldiers from Missouri serving in both armies truly personified this fratricidal Civil War. This moment in history is forever immortalized within the two bronze relief plaques seen on the monument’s façade. Sculpted by artist Victor S. Holm, the scene at left titled “The Attack,” depicts Union soldiers in a ferocious charge, and at right is the aptly named, “The Defense,” which depicts Confederate soldiers defending against the attack.<br /> <br /> Seen at center, perched atop the bow of a ship, representative of the ship of state as it successfully plies its way through the troubled waters of the Civil War, is “The Spirit of the Republic.” This figure is based on Nike, the Hellenistic Greek goddess of victory who was closely associated with the Grecian goddess Athena. This version of Nike was heavily inspired by the famous 190 B.C. work “Nike of Samothrace” now on display at the Louvre in Paris. The monument features many other artistic motifs synonymous with the American Renaissance. As you get out a take a closer look, see if you can spot the ram’s head and dolphins.<br /> <br /> The Missouri Monument was dedicated during the 1917 Peace Jubilee which was held here at Vicksburg National Military Park, making it a true artistic representation of reconciliation. At its dedication, Colonel Leo Raisseur noted the monument’s purpose, “to commemorate and perpetuate the heroic services, the unselfish devotion to duty, and the exalted patriotism of the Missouri Soldiers, Union and Confederate, who were engaged in the campaign, siege, and defense of Vicksburg.”",

Pemberton met to discuss the terms of Confederate surrender. Here, midway between Union and Confederate lines, a shady oak tree stood witness to the discussions of these two men and their teams. While the oak tree was not a traditional piece of “art” like many of the monuments that stand in the park, it became a valuable artifact. It quickly vanished, providing souvenirs for soldiers and onlookers of this historic event. <br /> <br /> In its place, a more traditional monument— a marble obelisk— was erected in 1864 to commemorate the historic moment. The original marble obelisk was the first monument to stand in what would become Vicksburg National Military Park. This monument, much like the original oak tree, became a target for relic hunters and vandals. So, in 1867 the marble obelisk was replaced by the up-turned cannon that you see today. You can view the original marble obelisk on display in the park’s Visitor Center.",

The Greek Doric, peristyle design was composed by the architectural firm of Lundgren and Maurer out of Austin, Texas. Dedicated in 1961, the Texas Memorial is the perfect spot in our park to better understand the viewshed of the Confederate defense toward the Union siege lines. The monument is constructed of red granite and features 11 steps, one step for each state of the Confederacy, which lead up to the stylobate, or temple floor. On the monument’s center wall is seen the Lone Star of Texas around which is a wreath – the left side of the wreath being a live oak branch, representing the strength of this native Texan tree, and the right side being an olive branch representing peace. The text emblazoned in gold gilding seen on the three walls of the monument include a description of the historic events which occurred at this site, an homage to a Texas soldier written by Marine Corps officer John W. Thomason, Jr. of Huntsville, Texas, and a list of the Texas units that served in the Vicksburg Campaign.<br /> <br /> At center is the monument’s primary feature – a bronze work sculpted by artist Herring Coe of Beaumont, Texas. This striking Texas Soldier titled, “Sealing the Breech,” represents all Texas soldiers present during the May 22<sup>nd</sup> assaults.

It was constructed by James Eads and Company of Mound City, Illinois and initially assigned to the Union Army's Western Gunboat Flotilla.<br /> <br /> The Cairo took part in the occupations of Clarksville and Nashville Tennessee in February 1862, and in the reduction of Fort Pillow from April to June. On the 6th of June, the Cairo, along with eight other Union warships, engaged a similar-size flotilla of Confederate gunboats that were defending the city of Memphis, Tennessee. Five of the opposing gunboats were sunk or run ashore in this action and two seriously damaged. Union forces occupied Memphis that night.<br /> <br /> The Cairo spent the summer and fall of 1862 patrolling the Mississippi River but then, on November 21st, the vessel was assigned to an expedition ascending the Yazoo River. On December 12, 1862, while clearing mines from the river near Haines Bluff, Mississippi, the Cairo struck an underwater mine detonated from shore. It sank in only twelve minutes but with no loss of life. In this way, the Cairo became the first armored warship in history sunk by an electrically-detonated mine.<br /> <br /> The wreck of the Cairo was rediscovered in the late 1950s by a team of local Civil War enthusiasts led by Vicksburg National Military Park Historian Edwin C. Bearss. Salvage operations, funded by local and state governmental agencies, commenced in 1960 and by 1965, the remains of the Cairo were resting in Pascagoula, Mississippi.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service accepted title to the Cairo in 1972 and oversaw its transport to Vicksburg National Military Park in 1977. The site, located next to Vicksburg National Cemetery, includes the inddor museum and the outdoor exhibit area including the ironclad. </p>",

As part of the larger post-war Federal Reburial Program, the first large scale attempt at locating, indentifying, and commemorating the losses of the Union war dead, Vicksburg National Cemetery would bring together 17,000 Union soldiers who lost their lives.<br /> <br /> While reinterment burials began in early 1867, the soldiers now buried here were scattered throughout Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, predominently in locations along the Mississippi River. Other burials were those soldiers who died during the Federal occupation of Vicksburg and buried at various points in the Vicksburg area before the national cemetery was established. Record keeping was haphazard under wartime conditions and grave locations were often lost.<br /> <br /> Nationwide, 54% of the soldiers re-interred in national cemeteries were classified as \"Unknown\". Here at Vicksburg National Cemetery, 75% of the Civil War dead are listed as unidentified. This is due to the lack of standardized identification discs, now commonly referred to as \"dog-tags\" which list the basic information of a soldier on them.<br /> <br /> Upright standard military headstones with rounded tops generally mark the graves of known soldiers. Small, square blocks, incised with a grave number only, designate the unknown veterans, and a few graves are marked by other than government-issued headstones.<br /> <br /> Approximately 1,300 veterans of conflicts subsequent to the Civil War are also interred in Vicksburg National Cemetery. A scattering of other burials include wives and children of veterans, cemetery superintendents, and government workers of the past two centuries.<br /> <br /> Vicksburg National Cemetery has been closed to burials since 1961, with the exception of those individuals whose reservations for interment had been validated prior to that time.</p>",

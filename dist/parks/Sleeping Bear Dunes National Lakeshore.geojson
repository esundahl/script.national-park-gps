        "notes": "1877 U.S. Life Boat Station and Capstan\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/1877-u-s-life-boat-station-and-capstan.htm\n\n<p>This structure was constructed by the North Manitou Island crew in 1877. The structure is an open, one-story boat house with a clipped gable roof featuring decorative brackets and barge boards. The building was later renovated by the Manitou Island Association, which removed the boat door and added a new door and new windows, including a large picture window in place of the former boat door. The MIA also removed a lookout tower, which originally had surmounted the roof of the building.</p> <h3>Life-Saving Equipment</h3> <p>Surfmen had a variety of life-saving equipment at their disposal. According to regulation, if one method of rescue failed surfmen were required to attempt all other available forms of rescue. Weekly drills ensured that all surfmen became proficient at using life-saving equipment. Their hard work paid off-the USLSS had an overall 99% success rate.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boats</strong><br /> Generally, the USLSS used two types of rescue boats-the lifeboat and the surfboat. The lifeboat was an English invention adopted by the USLSS. Lifeboats were self-bailing and self-righting. They could be sailed or rowed. Lifeboats were long and heavy; some measured as long as 40 feet and weighed up to 4,000 pounds! Other advantages of this boat included its stability, sturdiness, and ability to handle heavy seas. However, the weight also made the boat almost impossible to haul down the beach; instead, it had to be launched from the boathouse directly into a sheltered harbor. Later models of lifeboats were lighter and even motorized. With the addition of a motor, surfmen could travel to wrecks farther away and get there faster and with much less energy than rowing required.<br /> Surfmen also used surfboats, an American invention. Surfboats were smaller, lighter, and faster than their English counterparts. These boats sat on a carriage that surfman could haul down beaches and over dunes in order to get as close to a wreck as possible before launching directly into rough surf. The Keeper steered and the surfmen rowed. Surfboats could also carry more shipwreck victims than lifeboats, anywhere from 10-15 victims. One disadvantage was that the first surfboats were not self-righting, only self-bailing. Like the lifeboat, later models were also motorized.<br /> <br /> Eventually, most USLSS stations had both a lifeboat and a surfboat. Surprisingly, in many instances boats were not the surfmen's preferred method of rescue. Instead, surfmen and station Keepers often preferred to use breeches buoys and lifecars to rescue shipwreck victims. These methods of rescue both relied on one of the only guns designed to save lives-the Lyle gun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lyle Gun</strong><br /> The USLSS recruited Lt. David Lyle, an Army Ordnance officer, to design a gun that would aid in shipwreck rescues. Lyle invented small, bronze cannon that sat on a wooden carriage. Depending on size, the cannon and carriage together weighed about 160 pounds. The Lyle gun and other rescue equipment were stored on a cart that the surfmen could pull down the beach, close to the wreck. Surfmen tied a line to an eye bolt screwed onto the end of a cast iron projectile and then loaded it into the cannon. A charge of black powder, up to 8 ounces, shot the projectile and line 250 to almost 700 yards. The goal was to shoot the line over a wreck so that it could be used to haul a series of other lines from the beach. Shipwreck victims attached the heaviest of these lines, the hawser, to the mast (or the sturdiest part of the wreck) while surfmen back on the beach propped up the line with a crotch. Next, surfmen could attach a breeches buoy or a lifecar to the line and haul it out to the wreck.<br /> <br /> <strong>Breeches Buoy</strong><br /> Once the surfmen set up the hawser line, they could attach a breeches buoy and send it out to the wreck. This was also referred to as the beach apparatus. The breeches buoy itself was a life preserver with a pair of canvas breeches, or shorts, sewn onto the bottom. One by one, shipwreck victims would climb into the breeches buoy and the surfmen on the shore would haul on the line, pulling them over the waves and back to shore. This was the preferred method of rescue because the surfmen stayed on the beach and because the breeches buoy was lighter and easier to haul over the beach than the heavier lifecar.<br /> <br /> <strong>Life car</strong><br /> Several designs of lifecars existed as early as the 1840s. The United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) commonly used Joseph Francis' 1847 lifecar. This iron-covered lifeboat included a deck hatch in the top used by shipwreck victims to climb inside to safety. There was room for four passengers inside this iron life-saving device. Early models were so small that passengers had to lie on top of each other in order to fit; later models were taller so that passengers could sit upright. Once the hatch was closed, the lifecar was water-tight. Two rings on top of the car allowed the heavy hawser line to pass through and surfmen could haul the lifecar to and from the shore. Small holes at the top of the lifecar let air inside. However, it would have been a dark, bumpy, uncomfortable ride.<br /> <br /> Like the breeches buoy, the lifecar had some advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage was that instead of only being able to save one victim at a time, the lifecar had room for 4 or 5 passengers. Passengers were also protected from weather, debris, and waves. However, the weight of the lifecar was a major issue. This 550 pound vessel had to be loaded into the already heavy beach cart and hauled through the sand. Surfmen were totally exhausted by the time they reached the site of the wreck, and they still had to fire the Lyle gun, ready the lifecar, and then haul on the line that pulled it out to the wreck and back.</p>",

These concrete structures are charcoal kilns, and they were installed by lumberman Pierce Stocking who purchased the land in 1948 after the demise of Day Forest Estates.<br /> <br /> He used these kilns to convert the waste from his sawmill into charcoal. The loose, dusty, random-sized material was packed in bags for shipment to stores in much of Michigan for sale to campers and picnickers.<br /> <br /> The kilns are concrete ovens in which limbs, slabs, and other sawmill waste were stacked as tightly as possible. The open front was closed with concrete blocks and the wood set on fire just before the last blocks went in. Controlling the air intake was tricky: too much air and the wood was consumed, too little air and the fire went out. If successful, the fire burned slowly for several days. Once it was out, the charcoal was removed and spread to cool. Then it was moved to the bagging shack.<br /> <br /> Day Forest Hill was one of the first managed forests in this part of Michigan. The owner, D. H. Day, protected the smaller trees to promote a future lumber harvest. When Pierce Stocking purchased the land in 1948, there was enough fairly mature growth to warrant a selective harvest. The sawdust pile from his mill can still be seen on the other side of Stocking Road. After the mature trees had been harvested, the mill was closed and the kilns abandoned.</p>",

At the same time, their dynamic nature makes them a prime feeding area for birds and fish. Shorebirds, some with long legs and bills, feed on insects along the water's edge. Gulls swoop up and down the beach on the lookout for fish and other edible morsels that wash ashore. Offshore, ducks, loons, and cormorants swim and dive in their search for preferred fish to eat.  Behind the beach lies the higher, grassy foredune. Windy and dry, the temperatures here can be extreme during the summer and winter. Certain plants and animals are specially adapted to this environment and find exactly what they need to survive. A variety of dune grasses delve deep into the sand with their tangled root systems to find water. Insects and spiders creep among the grasses finding protection and food.  Stop, watch, listen, and feel. How do the wind, water, and sand challenge you?<br /> <br /> <strong>Watch your step! Endangered species underfoot</strong>: Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus); Stand quietly, listen, and scan the cobbled beach. Do you hear high-pitched peeps? Can you see the tiny sand-colored birds with a single black band around their neck running along the beach and stopping and pecking for food? From April until August each year, Great Lakes piping plovers nest and raise their young among the sparse grass, sand, and pebbles of the National Lakeshore. Watch your step! These rare little birds nest within the cobble along the shoreline and blend very well into the sandscape. Shoreline development, invasive plants, and human disturbance have contributed to the decline of the piping plover and led to its listing as a federally endangered species. Unleashed dogs often chase plovers and may cause them to neglect their nests or even kill them. Plover nesting areas within the National Lakeshore are roped off and carefully monitored during the season. Please respect the closed area signs and help the National Park Service protect these rare birds.</p>",

A steam-powered sawmill, located just upstream from the mouth of Otter Creek, was the hub of activity. Sailing ships and steam barges moored at the dock in Lake Michigan. They were loaded with lumber for shipment to the growing cities around the Great Lakes and across the prairies. Aral was abandoned when the forest that once surrounded it was cut down. Today the forest reclaims the land, and only a few traces of the town remain.</p> <h3>Aral- murder in the back woods</h3> <p>The beach is a wonderful place to enjoy the sun, wind, and waves and get away from it all, but once this area was a busy lumber town with mills, stores, homes, and even a murder!<br /> <br /> Dr. Arthur O'Leary first noticed the area's potential for lumbering white pines and bought land from Robert Bancroft (the first to move his family to the area). The mill, operating by 1882, consisted of the mill building, living quarters, and a horse barn. A 90-foot long dock stretching out into Lake Michigan was piled high with lumber waiting to be loaded on steamships. Having no real experience in running a mill, O'Leary hired Charles T. Wright from Wisconsin to run the mill.<br /> <br /> Charles Wright was well known in the area. Described as 6'2\", 200 pounds and handsome, he was 31 years old when he started the mill. Wright grew up in the west and believed that the gun was the law, so he always carried one. According to local lore, \"He could put five bullets through your hat before you know what was going on.\" Wright was friendly, a good manager, and respected in town, but he would also become quick-tempered and a two-fisted fighter. These last two qualities would prove to get him in trouble.<br /> <br /> Involved in a tax dispute in 1889, Wright protested and did not pay his taxes, leading to a confrontation with Sheriff Deputy Neil Marshall and local physician Dr. Frank Thurber. Marshall and Wright struggled over a rifle. Marshall let go and backed up; Wright shot and killed him with one shot. Dr. Thurber fought over the rifle; Wright let go and pulled out a revolver, placed it at Thurber's head and fired, and then quickly shot him again in the chest. Wright spent 17 years in prison on a life charge.</p>",

Along with the Hutzlers and Haases, they contributed toward making the island a thriving agricultural community. August Beck came to the island as a teenager with his family. At age 19, he married the Haas' 16-year-old daughter. This farm became their home. He, his brothers, and his father worked several farms on the island, but August, the youngest of the Beck brothers, ultimately became one of the island's most professional and progressive farmers.<br /> <br /> Beck brought pedigreed breeding stock to the island to improve the quality of the island's pig production. As a result of his experiences at the Union Stock Yards in Chicago, August Beck was reputed to have been the islands de facto expert when it came to buying and selling livestock. Beck was the first to get a grain cutter and binder and was instrumental in cooperative efforts with other island farmers, such as the acquisition of a jointly-owned and shared threshing machine.<br /> <br /> An energetic man, Beck did take time to socialize with neighbors, playing checkers and talking during winter evenings about politics and about how the farmers could feed the world.<br /> <br /> <b>Threshing</b><br /> Most of the island's farmers grew grains that required threshing to separate the grain from the stalk and husk; the corn, rye and oats was mostly animal feed. Threshing activities required cooperation; a threshing machine was expensive but necessary. Between 1910 and 1940, one large threshing machine was share by the island farmers. During the winter months, at threshing time, the machine would be hauled from one farm to another - it took eight men to operate it. Seventy-five bushels of rye and 150 bushels of oats could be threshed in a day. The machine was then moved to the next farm until all the threshing was done.<br /> <br /> Threshing time was also a social occasion. The women would prepare the meal while the men worked in the fields. The men would come in and wash up for dinner and then sit down a big meal of bread, meat, potatoes, pies, and other desserts before heading back to the fields to work until evening.</p> <h3>Threshing</h3> <p>Most of the island's farmers grew grains that required threshing to separate the grain from the stalk and husk; the corn, rye and oats mostly animal feed.

Surrounded by aspen, white pine, and cedar, the calm lake is protected from the winds off Lake Michigan and is a great starter lake for teaching kids about fishing, hiking, or boating. Kids love to fish and swim off of the sturdy dock; while others enjoy sitting on the dock's bench, watching the water and listening to bird song.<br /> <br /> The boat ramp is excellent and handicap accessible. You can easily carry your canoe or kayak to the ramp to get your paddle underway. Poke around the lake's perimeter to discover wildflowers and beaver-chewed tree stumps, or just float and soak in Bass Lake's quiet beauty.<br /> <br /> Bass lake offers a perfect recipe for relaxation and family fun.<br /> <br /> <b>No motorized boats are allowed. </b><br /> <br /> Hiking? Join the 3.5 mile Bass Lake Loop of the Platte Plains trail at the parking lot. You may also wish to add an optional, more strenuous .8-mile spur to Lake Michigan.</p> <h3>Paddle safe</h3> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.<br /> <br /> <strong>Clean Your Boats</strong><br /> Please clean, drain, and dry your boat after you leave any body of water, especially Lake Michigan, to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. This is especially important for our inland lakes.<br /> <br /> For more information on aquatic invasive species and their impacts to lakes, streams, and how we recreate please visit the following websites:<br /> <em>www.protectyourwaters.net<br /> www.nps.gov/slbe/naturescience/nonnativespecies.htm</em></p>",

Although it saved on fuel and time for ships traveling between Chicago and the Straits of Mackinac, the Manitou Passage could be a dangerous shortcut, as it contains shifting sandbars and rocky shoals.

By 1859, the Grand Traverse and Point Betsie lighthouses also beamed, one at each end of the Passage. In peak times, the Manitou Passage saw fifty to one hundred ships passing through its waters each day. In all, more than two hundred and fifty lighthouses were built on the U.S. shores of the Great Lakes. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a7f3f281-75b0-45f3-957d-393f47a52d3e}{94}\" paraid=\"588408669\">But the South Manitou Island Lighthouse signaled more than just a shortcut-the island had the only natural deep-water harbor north of Chicago where ships could take refuge during storms and high winds. When it was built in the mid-1830’s, the island’s wooding dock was also the first source of fuel for large wood burning steamships traveling north from southern Lake Michigan. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a7f3f281-75b0-45f3-957d-393f47a52d3e}{100}\" paraid=\"336866422\">On the right an outline of the blue waters of Lake Michigan with a tan land mass surrounding it.

Nearly everyone in town had some need for the blacksmith's services, which included crafting and repairing oxen yolks, tools, and carriages, shoeing horses, and constructing pre-built homes, dining halls, and horse barns.<br /> <br /> As the blacksmith and his striker worked, the melodious, ringing tap-tap-tap of the smith's hammer, alternating with the heavier clang of the sledge, set up a vibrating rhythm that could be felt in the trembling ground beneath the anvil and heard for half a mile down the road. Every now and then, the tempo was punctuated by the sound of hot iron plunging into the water tub, and at longer intervals the pitch changed as a new set of tools was put to work on a different task.<br /> <br /> With the slowing on the steamship and lumber industries, the Blacksmith Shop closed in the 1920s and became a storage shed.<br /> <br /> A wayside in front of the shop entitled, \"Forging and Fixing,\" describes the role of a blacksmith shop in a community.</p>",

They emigrated from Germany and arrived in New York state, where Mrs. Burfiend remained while her husband continued on to North Manitou Island. The family originally lived in a log cabin marked by a lilac clump remaining in a field next to Port Oneida Road.<br /> <br /> Magdalena grew up in Port Oneida, married a Port Oneida neighbor, and became the matriarch of many Port Oneidans to follow.<br /> <br /> The Carsten Burfiend farm is on both sides of the Port Oneida Road. The house, garage, and other out-buildings are on the west side of the road on the bluff overlooking Lake Michigan. The foundation of the barn, silo, and milkhouse as well as the corn crib, machine shed, and old machinery are on the east side of the road.<br /> <br /> The Burfiend's garden was located where an apple tree, lilacs, vinca, grapevines, hops, rhubarb, roses, and spirea still grow.<br /> <br /> The original Port Oneida Road ran along the bluff on the other side of the houses. That is why the houses face the Lake Michigan bluff and have their backs toward the road. The road was moved in 1923 after being washed out by storms and because picnickers often lunched in farmers' front lawns.<br /> <br /> Carsten, Elizabeth, and several of their children are buried on the farm.<br /> <br /> In 1891, the Peter Burfiends moved to the farm. Peter Burfiend was known within the community for his ax work: he could hew to a line. He could do it with both the broad ax and the adze, and he often did ax work in trade with neighbors.<br /> <br /> Burfiend was a hard worker. His grandson recalls, \"The only time my grandfather ever set down or took a rest was if it would rain-he would crawl in the hay mow and go to sleep. Other than that, if he couldn't do anything else, he'd grab a hoe & go out in the cornfield and start hoeing weeds.\"<br /> On Sundays, however, Peter shaved, put his suit on, got his cane, and walked to church. After church he smoked his weekly cigar, often sitting on a bench looking over the lake and passing ships, until evening chore time.</p>",

Stop and spend some time walking through the Heritage Center's exhibits to learn more about Port Oneida and life on the farm. The Olsen farm is also the headquarters for Preserve Historic Sleeping Bear, a nonprofit partner of the National Lakeshore that helps preserve the historic structures and offers heritage tours and programs. <a href=\"http://www.phsb.org\">www.phsb.org</a>.<br /> <br /> Charles and Hattie [Brammer] Olsen bought this land in 1915 from Frederick Dechow, who had first purchased it in 1857. The Olsen's farmhouse was built around 1918 by Paul Popa and is the newest in the Port Oneida Historical District and the most modern. The house had the first indoor plumbing; water was pumped by hand into a tank in the attic to provide the pressure for the system. A dairy farm, the Charles Olsen farm was the first to achieve Grade A dairy status in Port Oneida.<br /> <br /> The silo on the farm is a unique construction with steel rods that support the wood staves and a concrete foundation.<br /> <br /> Filling the silo, like buzzing wood and thrashing grain, was a job that required a crew. There were four silos in Port Oneida, and the silo-filling bee moved from farm to farm. Four or five men would be in the field cutting corn and loading two to three wagons. Any kids around would cut corn. They would cut a bundle all the corn they could hold in their hand with a corn hoe and then tie it and take it to the wagon. Later they got a corn binder, which cut the stalks and tied them into bundles. The women would be busy cooking. Doors would be set out on saw-horses to hold the feast the farm women provided for the workers.<br /> <br /> Windbreaks were very important for keeping the soil in the fields. The farmers never cut down trees in a windbreak. The Olsen Farm is protected from northwestern winds by a steep ridge that slopes up from behind the farmyard to the north. A Norway spruce windbreak defines the western boundary of the farmyard, and rows of sugar maples line both sides of the highway in front of the house.<br /> <br /> A black locust grove remains on the side of the ridge, northeast of the house. The hard wood of black locust was prized for fence posts.<br /> Hattie's mother once lived in the grandmother's house which was located behind the primary residence. Ornamental plantings mark its site.</p> <h3> </h3>",

The 1.5-mile Cottonwood Trail is a great place to get out of your car, loop through the perched dunes, and see the sublime scenery up close. The Cottonwood trail loops over unique dune landscapes and offers spectacular views over golden sand dunes of the azure sky, aquamarine Glen Lake, white D. H. Day barn, ultramarine blue Lake Michigan, and distant verdant green of the Manitou Islands.<br /> <br /> <b>Leashed pets allowed on trail.</b><br /> <br /> The trail winds through the Sleeping Bear Plateau, a 4 square-mile highland that raises more than 400 feet above Lake Michigan and is covered with a veneer of perched dunes. Much of trail, particularly the first half, is through loose sand and hilly. Both can be tiring, but overall it is an easy hike that is good for small children. It will give you a close look at the beauty and diversity of the these shifting hills of open sand: cottonwood trees shading the path; native vegetation such as bearbeary and buffaloberry tendrils hugging the sand and stabilizing the rolling dunes; blowouts-areas of wind erosion where it looks like the wind has scooped the sand away; partially buried living trees. Colorful wildflowers dot the trail, and tracks in the sand reveal the elusive wildlife of the dunes.<br /> <br /> <b>Protect your park</b><br /> Please stay on designated trails. This will help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Avoid disturbing plants and animals: threatened and endangered species occur in the park.</p> <h3>Cottonwood self-guiding hiking trail</h3> <p>Welcome to the Cottonwood Trail-an interpretive trail with nine posts that tell the story about life on the dunes, describes the plant life and geology of the area, and explains why the mounds of advancing sand in this ever-changing land are so special and so fragile.Â Allow about an hour to walk this 1.5-mile loop. Portions of the trail go through loose sand and are strenuous.<br /> At stop #7 you will find a bench where you can relax and enjoy the view of Glen Lake.<br /> <br /> The dunes are an ever-changing landscape. If we could view a time-lapse movie of the dunes, we would see them growing and advancing across the land; we would see plants taking root and holding the sand in place; and we would see wind eroding the dunes, leaving behind irregular, broken surfaces. As you walk along the Cottonwood Trail, you will have a chance to see all of this, captured for a moment in time. Enjoy!<br /> <br /> <strong>#1 Watch out for poison ivy along the beginning of the trail</strong><br /> You can develop a rash from touching the plant or even from touching your shoes, pants, or pets after walking through a patch of poison ivy. All parts of the plant contain an oil, urushiol, which causes the rash.<br /> <br /> <strong>#2 The blowout</strong><br /> Notice the bowl-shaped dune ahead and to the right of the trail. It is called a blowout. Prevailing southwesterly winds ate at the dune, eroding it after time, and forming the blowout.<br /> <br /> Originally this area was a sand hill, or dune. Gradually, grasses grew on the dune and held the sand in place. Winds blew on the dune from the same direction, blowing away sand on one side of the dune. Notice that the cover of grass remains on the part of the dune protected from the wind.<br /> <br /> <strong>#3 The old road</strong><br /> This section of the trail travels over part of an abandoned loop of the old Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive. You can see the gravel from the old road. As you walk along you will discover why the route was changed. Several feet of sand has buried the old road's surface in some places.<br /> <br /> The clay and gravel surface of the old road is quite different from the pure sand of the dunes and brought in roadside wildflowers. These wildflowers include white sweet clover, spotted knapweed, and Queen Anne's lace. These not native American plants originated in Europe. Alien plants frequently take over disturbed locations like roadsides and old farm fields. The different soil along the road helped give the alien plants an advantage over the natives.<br /> <br /> <strong>#4 Dune restoration study area</strong><br /> The dunes are a fragile environment. Hikers can quickly damage the plant life, leaving paths that take years to revegetate. This is why we ask you to remain on designated trails in the dunes.<br /> <br /> The Dune Restoration Study Area was set up in 1984 to study various methods of restoring native plants to damaged dunes. Among the methods tried were planting of beachgrass, adding fertilizer, and setting up a snow fence to trap sand.<br /> <br /> <strong>#5 Sand</strong><br /> Pick up a handful of sand and study it closely. Notice that all the grains are just about the same size. They are small enough to blow about in the wind, but heavy enough to come to rest quickly when the wind stops blowing.<br /> <br /> The grains of sand are not all the same color because several different minerals are present. Quartz is the most common and appears either clear or rusty from a coating of iron oxide. Quartz is very hard and resistant to breaking down chemically or physically. Other colors in the sand represent different minerals present in minor amounts. The grains of sand come from the breakdown of larger rocks.<br /> <br /> Dune sand is typically well-rounded and shows a frosted surface from contact with other sand grains.<br /> <br /> <strong>#6 Grasses and flowers of the dunes</strong><br /> Quite a variety of grasses and wildflowers live on the sand dunes.<br /> <br /> <em>Beach grass</em> (marram) is one of the first plants to grow on a newly-formed dune. Its roots form a dense network that helps to hold the sand in place. When sand piles around its stalks, beach grass can grow rapidly to avoid being buried.<br /> <br /> <em>Sand reed</em> is another important sand binder. The feathery seed heads are quite different from the tight clusters of seeds in beach grass.<br /> <br /> <em>Little bluestem</em> grows on stabilized dunes. It is a bunchgrass, forming distinct clumps rather than a continuous cover. It is not as well suited to preventing erosion as is beach grass.<br /> <br /> <em>Wormwood</em> belongs to the same group of plants as western sagebrush. The flowers, blooming from July through October, are pollinated by the wind. They are not showy because there is no need to attract insects for pollination. Perhaps you will see a small brownish plant growing at the base of the wormwood. This is broomrape, a Michigan protected wildflower. Lacking chlorophyll for manufacturing its food, the broomrape lives as a parasite on the wormwood.<br /> <br /> <em>Beach pea </em>blooms in July and August. The bright pink flowers resemble the garden sweet pea. Like other members of the legume family, the beach pea is a nitrogen fixer, improving the soil for other plants.<br /> <br /> <strong>#7 View from the benches</strong><br /> From here you can survey the dunes, Glen Lake, and the surrounding countryside. The Dune Climb below, where thousands of people climb each year, lies along the western edge of the dunes. The sand advances there at a rate of about 4 feet per year.<br /> <br /> If you stop at the Dune Climb later, look for the exhibit on sand movement. In 1985 a horizontal beam was placed at the edge of the dunes so you can see just how far the sand has advanced. It is located just north of the main climbing area at the start of the Duneside Trail and has had to be moved as the sand encroached on the beam.<br /> <br /> Actually, the rate of movement of these dunes in minor compared to some desert dunes. The wind off Lake Michigan loses strength over distance and cannot move sand further than a mile from the shore.<br /> <br /> <strong>#8 An active dune</strong><br /> The cottonwood trees on this dune tell a story of change. Some of the trees are being buried in sand, while others have had their roots exposed. You can follow some of the runners along the surface of the dune to places where new trees (clones) have sprouted.<br /> <br /> Feel a leaf of a cottonwood. Would you describe it as waxy or plastic-like? This type of leaf is common to many different plants in dry locations. The leaf surface helps prevent water loss. Actually, the dunes are not a desert. They receive around 30 inches of rainfall in a year. However, the dunes are somewhat drier than the neighboring forests because of strong sunlight, wind, and the lack of a moisture-holding humus (decayed plant matter) layer. Water drains away quickly though sand. Therefore, dune plants have some of the same adaptations as desert plants that receive little water.<br /> <br /> <strong>#9 Shrubs of the dunes</strong><br /> As you walk along this section of trail, look for some of the typical shrubs of stabilized dunes. Try to spot a paper birch, a small tree with white bark.<br /> <br /> Why is the plant community here so different from what you saw earlier? This location is more sheltered from the wind, and the underlying glacial deposits which provide more moisture and nutrients than pure sand are closer to the surface.<br /> <br /> <em>Common juniper </em>is an evergreen shrub that occurs in two forms: an upright form 3-5 feet tall, and a low form that covers the ground.<br /> <br /> <em>Bearberry</em> forms a low ground cover. It is a broad-leaved evergreen with tiny pink flowers in the spring and red berries in late summer and fall.<br /> <br /> <em>Buffaloberry</em> stands 3-5 feet high and has small clusters of orange berries. The shrub contributes nitrogen to the soil through bacteria that live on its roots.<br /> <br /> <em>Sand cherry</em> is a small shrub with white flowers in the spring and blackish cherries in late summer. A black fungus sometimes grows on the twigs.<br /> <br /> We hope you have enjoyed your walk on the Cottonwood Trail. There are several other trails in the National Lakeshore, and we hope you take time to explore them as well.</p> <h3>Hike safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.</p> <ul> <li>Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.</li> <li>Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.</li> <li>Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.</li> <li>Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.</li> </ul> <p>And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year?

The Crystal River winds from Glen Lake through sections of the Lakeshore into Lake Michigan just north of Glen Arbor. Shallow (water depth is rarely more than 1 foot) and with a sandy bottom, this river is ideal for families, beginning canoeists and kayakers.<br /> <br /> You can \"shoot the tube\" under a bridge through a large culvert. Point your bow toward the middle of the three tubes (make sure everyone has a life vest on, fastened tightly), pull in your paddle, hunch down low and let the current whisk you through. You'll shoot out into swirling water on the other end. You can portage around the culvert if you prefer.<br /> <br /> The river and surrounding wetlands provide interesting and valuable habitat to enjoy. The warm river waters are full of bass, sunfish, and pike, and the riverbanks are home to deer, rabbits, muskrat, heron, beaver, fox and coyote. There is a concerted effort underway by Federal, State, and Local organizations to restore its watershed to conditions that will sustain native plant and animal species.<br /> <br /> The river level fluctuates and can sometimes create a fragile environment for plant and wildlife. There is a wayside sign at this launch site that indicates water level and provides instructions for paddlers.</p> <h3>Paddle safe</h3> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.<br /> <br /> **Clean Your Boats**<br /> Please clean, drain, and dry your boat after you leave any body of water, especially Lake Michigan, to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. This is especially important for our inland lakes.<br /> <br /> For more information on aquatic invasive species and their impacts to lakes, streams, and how we recreate please visit the following websites:<br /> www.protectyourwaters.net<br /> www.nps.gov/slbe/naturescience/nonnativespecies.htm</p>",

Day built this simple two-story frame house in Glen Haven in 1890 as a birthday present for his wife Eva, but she preferred the convenience of living above the general store she ran while raising a family, so Day employees and other family members lived in the house. According to Day's granddaughter, Pat (Day) Bennet, her father Bill Day had a garden straight back from the house by the apple tree.<br /> <br /> The attached garage was originally the village paint shop, then the Glen Haven post office. It was moved here in 1941 when the house was remodeled.<br /> <br /> The blue spruce on the knoll between the store and Day House was planted there in 1989 by Day's daughter, Marion (Day) Warnes. She planted it to commemorate the one hundredth year anniversary of her parent's marriage. Before the spruce, a cut tree was placed on the knoll (same location) and decorated with Christmas lights each year for about forty years.</p> <h3>Local Native Americans</h3> <p>There were two Indian families who used to work for D.H.Day; the Westmans and the Jacksons. According to resident Newt Sheridan, John Westman was a well-liked man, a real hard worker.<br /> <br /> Elizabeth Westman. John's daughter talks about growing up in the area:<br /> \"I was born in Glen Haven, the youngest of seven children and a member of the Ottawa tribe. We lived in a long building built by Mr. Day. The building was a short way from Sleeping Bear Inn. There was a slaughter house nearby, and we got some meat from there. We used to cook in a three-legged iron kettle with no top on it. We put hog's heads in there and made head cheese. We caught fish and had many fish frys. We saved the grease and fried doughnuts in it. We did all our cooking outside. We were share-croppers too, so we had enough food. We were given brown stamps for shoes and green stamps for vegetables.<br /> Mother taught me how to make baskets. We used the black ash for weaving when we could get it. We sold our baskets down by the pier and at the Tanawatha Resort. When the noon dinner bell rang there, all the people came-some days, Mother made fifty dollars. She also took orders for more baskets. We were busy in the spring gathering maple syrup and making sugar candy. We sold that too.\"<br /> <br /> There were about thirty Indians living in our area. They were all related. The name of the other family was Jackson.</p>",

Day the first Chairman of the State Parks Commission. Day was an excellent choice for the job of State Park Commissioner due to his promotional activities and his widely acclaimed Day Forest conservation efforts.<br /> <br /> In November 1920, Day donated 32 acres of land on Glen Arbor Bay, Leelanau County, between Glen Haven and Glen Arbor to the state for use as a state park.<br /> <br /> Michigan had previously acquired at least two other properties for management as state parks (Mackinac State Park in 1895 and Interlochen State park in 1917). D. H. Day State Park, honoring the commission's chairman, was the first park that the Commission set up.<br /> <br /> A one room large log cabin was built by DH Day in 1923-24 on the park campgrounds as a space for events. It has a front and back porch. Today it is used for educational programs and other special events.<br /> <br /> The D. H. Day State Park became the core of the state's efforts to acquire and create Sleeping Bear Dunes State Park, one of the main predecessors to Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.<br /> <br /> An historical marker designates the Log Cabin as Michigan Historical Commission Registered Site No. 173 and states<br /> \"By the end of World War I, with the rapid growth of the recreation industry in Michigan, a need for a state-wide parks system had arisen. In 1919 the State Park Commission was established. D. H. Day State Park, honoring the commission's chairman, was the first park that it set up. When state parks were transferred to the Conservation Department in 1921 over twenty other sites had been acquired, most of them, like D. H.

Frederick and Fredericka Dechow purchased the farm and built a log cabin in 1857. Sons John and Charles built the barn around 1890.<br /> <br /> Grandson Fred built the new house around 1910: a showplace of modern style. A few years later, he was able to buy the neighboring farm just to the east of his original farm and add it to his land. The house and other buildings were removed, but the barn remains in the field to the east of the main Dechow buildings.<br /> <br /> The Dechows raised apples and maintained a small herd of dairy cows. They sold milk, cream, and eggs to local resorts. According to a local resident, they had extensive orchards located between the house and pasture barn.<br /> <br /> In a community where everybody's connected to somebody else, everybody takes care of everybody else. The Dechows often employed neighbor children. Laura Basch's first job was at the Dechow farm. She earned one dollar a week-big wages at the time-doing general housework, cooking, \"anything that Mrs. Dechow wanted me to.\"<br /> <br /> They also helped the neighborhood children by pulling teeth for the children. With no dentist nearby to fill cavities, folks would take their children down to Frank Dechow who would use his pair of forceps to pull unhappy teeth.<br /> <br /> A row of sugar maple trees leads to a sugar shack built about 1944. The Dechows made about 20 gallons of syrup a year. During the war, when sugar was rationed, maple syrup was used to sweeten almost everything.<br /> <br /> A hay loader in the field east of the farm reminds us of the worker bees during haying season. The hay loader gathered the loose hay from the field (before balers). Two men were up on the wagon to move the hay around and place it so that the load would stay balanced and packed in, and then it would go into the barn. A hay fork was used to put the hay away in the loft. They'd stick the fork a couple of feet into the hay, so that when the team of horses pulled the rope it would wind the hay up to the top of the barn. As the team continued pulling, the pulley would run down a track until it was over the hay mow. Another rope was then pulled to release the load. Workers then had to spread it in the mow, because it would only land in a big pile right down the middle of the mow, and it had to spread out to the edges.</p>",

This open dune forms the eastern edge of the Sleeping Bear Plateau, a 4 square-mile field of perched dunes that extends to Lake Michigan to the west and Sleeping Bear Point to the north.<br /> <br /> The Dune Climb is different than almost all other dunes along the Lake Michigan shore. Most dunes are created when the wind takes sand from Lake Michigan beaches and piles it up. But the sand at the Dune Climb has never been in Lake Michigan or on a Lake Michigan beach, and the wind has actually piled it DOWN. The sand at the Dune Climb came from dunes higher up on the Sleeping Bear Plateau.<br />  </p> <p>The Dune Climb is an active dune that moves. An exhibit at the base of the dune at the north end of the Dune Climb features a measuring stick that, with the help of a little arithmetic, will calculate how much the Dune Climb moves toward the parking area each year.

But, many get sucked in and want to hike to the lake. But be warned: Lake Michigan is not just over that next dune. The trail's hilly, sandy terrain can be very difficult to traverse, and a round trip may take several hours if the temperatures are unfriendly. This trail has worn out the most experienced hikers.

Often it turns out that there was simply a misunderstanding as to when the group would meet up. Agree on a plan before splitting up, and be realistic about the time it will take for a hike. Remember, it may take 2-4 hours depending on the weather and your physical condition.<br /> <br /> <strong>Which way do I go?</strong> Out on the dunes there are few clues as to which way you need to go. The best plan is to follow one of the marked hiking trails and carry a map. The hiking trails in the dunes are marked with posts with blue tops. That will also minimize the human impact on this fragile ecosystem. If you are determined to explore off-trail, be sure to bring a compass and keep track of your directions.<br /> <br /> Be aware that cell coverage here, as in many locations within the National Lakeshore is unreliable and that cell phone batteries drain much more quickly in poor coverage areas. You may or may not be able to contact others in your party or phone for help.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watch those slopes. </strong>Steep dune slopes occasionally collapse- a dangerous situation if you are there! This is especially hazardous during winter and early spring seasons. Another reason to avoid them is to help dune grass roots remain intact and do their job of holding the sand in place.<br /> <br /> <strong>Resist the ridges.</strong>We tend to be drawn to walking along the narrow ridge tops among the dunes. However, this is another part of the dunes which is highly vulnerable to erosion. It's best to hike on the broad open plains where possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Keep it under control.</strong> Often folks begin running down the dunes, and soon find their legs can't keep up with the rest of them! Resulting tumbles can cause injuries. While careful, controlled running at the Dune Climb is relatively safe, other slopes have hidden rocks and other hazards which can cause serious injuries.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't be shoeless.</strong> Even if you don't want to wear shoes at the start, throw a pair into a backpack. The sand can be very hot and abrasive and underground shoots of dune grass can stab into your feet.<br /> <br /> Go wet & wild. The dunes are a bit like a desert environment, and you will need to stay hydrated. Bring a bottle of water.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't be a ghost-buster.</strong> Everyone enjoys the \"ghost forests\" (trees that long-ago became buried by moving dunes, then reappeared after the dunes moved). Please leave them because they are the most photographed ghosts around.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watch the wind.</strong> The wind-blown sand can be irritating to eyes and skin. On the other hand, it can make for great kite flying.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year?

In 1862, the Eckherts purchased and settled on their farm in Port Oneida.<br /> <br /> The Eckhert farm has been described as an \"excellent example of an historical farm\" and was the site of many dances enjoyed by community residents. Neighbor Laura Basch remembers the dances that Mrs. Eckhert would have at the house. \"And that was where I learned to dance. And I can remember us all-we'd sit on the stairway. They had this big house and this stairway there. But we'd roll up the rug and we'd have square dances and fox trots and waltzes. And then she'd always have something for us to eat. And they'd either play the Victrola-that was where we got most of our music-but sometimes the Anderson brothers would come over there and play the organ, Henry would, and Ernie would play the fiddle. And that was the way we danced there.\"<br /> <br /> Catherine Eckerdt was one of the women in the community who served as midwives or community nurses. She nursed many people back from pneumonia using mustard plaster poultices. If someone was having a baby, they would come and get her. And then she would help with the birth. Mrs. Eckerdt would always have a room in the house for neighbors or passersby who needed care or feeding, but she never had any sort of formal medical training. According to a granddaughter, \"some people are more adept to doing things . . . That was more her calling, you know? . . . She had different herbs and stuff . . . and she would doctor them.\" And if they got really bad, she'd have them stay in the house and care for them.</p>",

The last landing before Platte Point, El Dorado offers picnic tables, a vault toilet, a launch site, and parking. Fish or watch the river from a deck overlook. Handicapped parking is available.</p> <h3>Paddle safe</h3> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.<br /> <br /> <strong>Clean Your Boats</strong><br /> Please clean, drain, and dry your boat after you leave any body of water, especially Lake Michigan, to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. This is especially important for our inland lakes.<br /> <br /> For more information on aquatic invasive species and their impacts to lakes, streams, and how we recreate please visit the following websites:<br /> www.protectyourwaters.net<br /> www.nps.gov/slbe/naturescience/nonnativespecies.htm</p> <h3>Paddle the Platte</h3> <p><strong>Paddle the Platte</strong><br /> Cooling off with a relaxing float on a tube or raft down the Platte River on a hot summer day is one of the most popular recreational activities in the Lakeshore to beat the heat of summer. The river is shallow and clear, and while it moves along at a good pace, there are no rapids to contend with. You will see a multitude of different wildflowers and birds on your trip, so pay careful attention to the shoreline.<br /> <br /> Your float may end where the Platte empties into the Lake Michigan and forms a delightful sandy spit full of frolicking children and beachgoers wading across the river. Outstanding views of Platte Bay and massive Empire Bluffs and Sleeping Bear Dunes in the distance reward those who drift all the way to Lake Michigan. It's a wonderful place to take a quick dip if it's a hot day.<br /> You can either bring your own tube, raft, air mattress, etc. or you can rent them from local outfitters. If you need to rent during the height of the summer season, you will want to plan ahead and get reservations.<br /> <br /> <strong>From the Platte River Picnic Area water access</strong>, you can float a <strong>one-hour loop </strong>to just above Loon Lake and then carry your tube for a 10-minute walk back to your car.<br /> <br /> If you want the full paddling experience, a <strong>2-and a half-hour plus float </strong>will take you all the way from the picnic area water access to Lake Michigan. Put in along the ramp and drift down the pristine river, through Loon Lake (you'll have to paddle across the lake), past the fish weir and El Dorado, through beautiful sand dunes, all the way to the mouth of the Platte River. You will need to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.<br /> <br /> You can also put in at the <strong>fish weir </strong>just below Loon Lake for a <strong>2-hour float</strong> to the mouth of the Platte. In this case, you will have to carry your tube about 1/4 mile from the road to the river along a gravel road to the fish weir and shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.<br /> <br /> Offering a nice, easy, <strong>1-mile float </strong>to Lake Michigan, a parking lot, and toilet, <strong>El Dorado</strong> is another popular put-in for tubers. You will have to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.<br /> <br /> During the height of summer, the river is busy. And from late June through August, it can be like 'bumper boats' with all the kayaks, canoes, and tubes going down the lazy river. Pick a warm day in early summer or September, and you'll have it pretty much to yourself. Fall floats on the river can be quite scenic and a great time to see a lot of fish!</p> <h3>Platte River Fishing Weir</h3> <p>Floating down the gentle flowing Platte you will pass through the State of Michigan's fish weir: an obstruction in the river with gates that can be raised and lowered to stop the migrating salmon from going up stream in the fall. The weir is in operation from the middle of August until October. When the salmon are running, the DNR uses the weir to harvest the fish, and their eggs are used at their hatcheries. During these months, you must portage around the weir. The best times to see returning adult salmon in the Platte River are from mid September to late October at the lower weir.<br />  </p>",

For your safety and to protect the environment: please do not descend the bluff. <strong>The trail ends at the wooden boardwalk. </strong><br /> <br /> Breathtaking . . . water so clear and blue . . . bucket-list worthy . . . best view anywhere on the shoreline . . . amazing . . . incomparable sunset . . .picture-postcard sight. . . jaw-dropping . . . not like anything else in the Midwest.<br /> Interested? Then don't miss the Empire Bluff Trail. The 1.5-mile round-trip trail climbs through a beech-maple forest rife with wildflowers to a high, coastal bluff featuring the iconic double-dune view that's the subject of paintings, posters, and postcards. Boardwalks and an observation deck atop this lofty perch look out over Lake Michigan and a large chunk of the national lakeshore. A few hill climbs (with some stairs built into the trails) on the way up to the bluff make this a moderate hike: one well worth it!<br /> <br /> As a hike, Empire Bluff is an excellent and popular choice for families and can be done by most people in under an hour. Pack a lunch and enjoy it with looking out at a view with few rivals. Benches line the trail and there are several spots at the top to kick back and soak it all in.<br /> <br /> And the sunsets! Bring a flashlight and arrive at near dusk on a clear evening for a sunset second to none. Just a short time after those spectacular sunsets are over, the stars come out in a brilliance and profusion that you can rarely find on Lake Michigan. The pure darkness here makes this a favorite destination for viewing meteor showers. But come early, this place will be full of families out to enjoy the show.<br /> <br /> And bring your camera with you.</p> <h4>Take the Self-Guided Tour. Look for posts with numbers.</h4> <p><br /> <strong>Stop 1:</strong><br /> The hilly terrain and scattered boulders are evidence of glaciation.<br /> <br /> Only about 11,800 years ago, the last glacier melted from this area. As Glaciers move across the land, they pick up rock and soil, and as they melt, they deposit the debris irregularly to form hills and valleys. Glacially transported boulders located far from their point of origin are known as erractics, literally \"travelers.\" The bedrock in this area is made up of sedimentary rocks such as limestone and shale, but is buried under several hundred feet of glacial deposits.<br /> <br /> The boulder is a glacial erratic. It must have come from a distant place, perhaps Michigan's Upper Peninsula or Canada.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 2:</strong><br /> The glacial soils around Sleeping Bear are quite sandy and not very fertile for farming. However, certain crops, including hay, can be grown here successfully. From post #2, you can see a metal sculpture. Oh, but wait, that's actually a piece of rusted farm equipment from the time of the Great Depression.<br /> <br /> This McCormick Deering No. 7 mowing machine was manufactured between 1929 and 1940. The horse drawn mower cuts a swath about five feet wide. The enclosed gearbox, a significant improvement over earlier models, allowed for efficient gear lubrication, prevented hay from getting tangled in the gears, and provided safer operations for man and animal.<br /> With the development of modern farm equipment, many such pieces of old machinery were abandoned in the fields. A number of old farms are scattered throughout the park and help to preserve the flavor of another era.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 3:</strong><br /> Stop and look around at post #3. This section of trail shows one of the most important types of Northern Hardwood forest in Michigan, the Beech-Maple forest. This forest consists of primarily sugar maple, red maple, and beech. Though, in disturbed areas where sunlight shines below the tree canopy, more sun-loving species, such as paper birch and quaking aspen are often found. White pine is commonly intermixed with the beech maple and depending on sunshine, soil, climate, and time, white pine forest may displace some of the beech-maple.<br /> <br /> Over the years the natural process of plant decay has improved the fertility of the sandy glacial soils. Still they can hardly be called rich. In the summer the trees cast a dense shade. Plants of this forest must be able to tolerate low light levels. Many of the forest wildflowers such as the trillium, bloodroot, and Dutchman's breeches bloom in the early spring before the leaves appear on the trees. Young trees deprived of sunlight grow very slowly. If a nearby tree falls, allowing sunlight to reach the young trees, they show a rapid spurt of growth. Before long the gap in the leafy canopy is closed and dense shade prevails again.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 4:</strong><br /> While the sandy tree-covered dunes of this region are not rich farmland, the temperature, drainage, growing season, and available soil nutrients in these somewhat humus-enriched \"gray dunes\" work well for many species of trees. In particular, the Grand Traverse region, known as the Cherry Capital, is well suited to growing various kinds of fruit trees. In about 1910, the Empire Lumber Company planted extensive orchards on the logged-over lands.<br /> <br /> An orchard extended all the way from the Village of Empire (you may be able to catch a glimpse of it to the north, through the trees) up the hill to this tree-studded meadow. The apple and plum trees growing here today do not seem to be from these old orchards, but may have sprung up from fruit discarded in the area.<br /> <br /> Lake Michigan plays an important role in moderating the local climate. After the long cold winter, the icy waters keep air temperatures cool in the spring. This helps to prevent fruit trees from blooming too early when a killing frost might still occur. Orchards on sloping ground benefit from natural air drainage. Heavy, cold air seeks low ground, while slopes and uplands stay slightly warmer. Thus, the hilly glacial terrain makes ideal orchard country.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 5:</strong><br /> Near the post marked 5 and actually many locations along the trail, you can see various decomposing logs and fallen trees. Bacteria, lichen, fungus, moss, and seedlings take advantage of the nutrients, moisture, and sunlight made available to them by these fallen trees. Large trunks and limbs of which are often referred to as nurse logs. Why do you think that is?<br /> <br /> These rotting logs are an important part of the life cycle of the forest. Their decomposition frees nutrients, which would otherwise not be available.<br /> <br /> Bacteria and insects are among the first organisms to make use of the dead wood. They break it down for use by other life forms. Fungi and mosses also break down dead wood and use its nutrients. As decomposition advances, more complex plants such as flowers and tree seedlings get their nutrients, moisture, and shelter from the rotten wood. Advanced decomposition also adds nutrients and organic matter to the soil, which benefits other organisms.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 6:</strong><br /> About .5 miles from the Empire Bluffs trailhead is a bench marking the South Bar Lake overlook. From here, you can take in the stunning view towards the north from which you can see South Bar Lake and the sweep of Lake Michigan's Platte Bay all the way to the Sleeping Bear Dune.<br /> <br /> A bar lake is formed when winds and currents build a sandbar across a bay, isolating that bay from the larger lake. Declining lake levels can, and in this case did, greatly accelerate this process. As vegetation takes hold, the exposed sandbar traps more sediments and decaying vegetation starts to build up soil, further heightening and stabilizing the barrier between parent and daughter lake.<br /> <br /> To the north of South Bar Lake is the equally imaginatively named North Bar Lake, a popular spot for wading and swimming.<br /> <br /> <strong>End</strong><br /> Here you go . . . the breathtaking part, you are perched about 400 ft. above Lake Michigan on a perched dune (a dune made of several feet of sand on top of hundreds of feet of glacial moraine, geological debris, in this case from the last Ice Age). From here, weather permitting, you can see the following:<br /> <br /> <b>Point Betsie</b> in Benzie County on Lake Michigan about 10 miles to the southwest<br /> <br /> <b>South Manitou Island</b> about 14 miles to the northwest, and about 7 miles offshore. Among its points of interest are an 1871 lighthouse, historic farms, perched sand dunes, and a grove of large, old white cedar trees<br /> <br /> <b>The southern portion of the Sleeping Bear Dune plateau</b> about 6 miles to the north<br /> <br /> <b>A lot of Lake Michigan</b> : your line of sight horizon on Lake Michigan is about 25 miles in any unobstructed direction. If the scenic outlook were six times as high you could see Wisconsin, about 60 miles straight west across the Lake, but from where you stand the curve of the planet blocks that view.<br /> <br /> <b>And you can see most of what's in between those points</b>, including the sweep of Platte Bay, Platte River Point, the Empire embayment to the north, and the beautiful South Bar Lake, once part of Lake Michigan, now separated by a sandbar beach.<br /> Lobes of ice once occupied Platte Bay to the south and the Empire Embayment to the north. Glacial meltwaters deposited the sandy layered sediments of the Empire Bluff. South Bar Lake, just north of the Village of Empire, was once a part of Lake Michigan. Longshore currents deposited the sand bar that now separates the two lakes.<br /> <br /> Beyond the Empire Embayment, the Sleeping Bear Dune itself-or the mother bear-which gives its name to the entire dunes complex, the National Lakeshore, and the other features in the area, appears as a small hill on the top of the high, sandy bluff. Historically, the dune was a landmark for travelers on Lake Michigan. Its location and dark vegetation drew attention to it. Now erosion has destroyed much of the dune.<br /> <br /> The entire National Lakeshore includes about 105 square miles and was authorized by Congress in 1970 to preserve the outstanding natural features of this area: glacial phenomena, sand dunes, beaches, and forests<br /> <br /> Directly ahead you see a section of boardwalk that extends for 500 feet south along the shoulder of the Empire Bluff. This boardwalk has been installed to prevent erosion and gullying of the fragile bluff face. Please do not descend the bluff for your own safety and to protect the natural setting.</p> <p> </p> <h4>Invasive plants</h4> <p>Invasive plant species are a significant threat to both native plants and wildlife.<br /> Spotted Knapweed, purple loosestrife, autumn olive and other invasive plants displace native species and often have few or no predators, that is, they are not eaten by native insects, birds, or animals.<br /> <br /> Take a few seconds here and remember to brush off our shoes, to stay on the trails, and to check clothes for seeds, burrs, and other \"hitch-hikers\" to slow the spread of invasives.</p> <h4>Hike Safely</h4> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.</p> <p>Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.</p> <p> </p> <h4><strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong></h4> <p>Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.</p> <hr /> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/slbe/learn/nature/ticks.htm\">Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</a></h4>",

This section of trail shows one of the most important types of Northern Hardwood forest in Michigan, the Beech-Maple forest. This forest consists of primarily sugar maple, red maple, and beech. Though, in disturbed areas where sunlight shines below the tree canopy, more sun-loving species, such as paper birch and quaking aspen are often found. White pine is commonly intermixed with the beech maple and depending on sunshine, soil, climate, and time, white pine forest may displace some of the beech-maple.<br /> <br /> Over the years the natural process of plant decay has improved the fertility of the sandy glacial soils. Still they can hardly be called rich. In the summer the trees cast a dense shade. Plants of this forest must be able to tolerate low light levels. Many of the forest wildflowers such as the trillium, bloodroot, and Dutchman's breeches bloom in the early spring before the leaves appear on the trees. Young trees deprived of sunlight grow very slowly. If a nearby tree falls, allowing sunlight to reach the young trees, they show a rapid spurt of growth. Before long the gap in the leafy canopy is closed and dense shade prevails again.</p>",

Bacteria, lichen, fungus, moss, and seedlings take advantage of the nutrients, moisture, and sunlight made available to them by these fallen trees. Large trunks and limbs of which are often referred to as nurse logs. Why do you think that is?<br /> <br /> These rotting logs are an important part of the life cycle of the forest. Their decomposition frees nutrients, which would otherwise not be available.<br /> <br /> Bacteria and insects are among the first organisms to make use of the dead wood. They break it down for use by other life forms. Fungi and mosses also break down dead wood and use its nutrients. As decomposition advances, more complex plants such as flowers and tree seedlings get their nutrients, moisture, and shelter from the rotten wood. Advanced decomposition also adds nutrients and organic matter to the soil, which benefits other organisms.</p>",

At post 6, you are perched about 400 ft. above Lake Michigan on a perched dune (a dune made of several feet of sand on top of hundreds of feet of glacial moraine, geological debris, in this case from the last Ice Age). From here, weather permitting, you can see the following:<br /> <br /> <b>Point Betsie</b> in Benzie County on Lake Michigan about 10 miles to the southwest<br /> <br /> <b>South Manitou Island</b> about 14 miles to the northwest, and about 7 miles offshore. Among its points of interest are an 1871 lighthouse, historic farms, perched sand dunes, and a grove of large, old white cedar trees<br /> <br /> <b>The southern portion of the Sleeping Bear Dune plateau</b> about 6 miles to the north<br /> <br /> <b>A lot of Lake Michigan</b> : your line of sight horizon on Lake Michigan is about 25 miles in any unobstructed direction. If the scenic outlook were six times as high you could see Wisconsin, about 60 miles straight west across the Lake, but from where you stand the curve of the planet blocks that view.<br /> <br /> <b>And you can see most of what's in between those points</b>, including the sweep of Platte Bay, Platte River Point, the Empire embayment to the north, and the beautiful South Bar Lake, once part of Lake Michigan, now separated by a sandbar beach.<br /> Lobes of ice once occupied Platte Bay to the south and the Empire Embayment to the north. Glacial meltwaters deposited the sandy layered sediments of the Empire Bluff. South Bar Lake, just north of the Village of Empire, was once a part of Lake Michigan. Longshore currents deposited the sand bar that now separates the two lakes.<br /> <br /> Beyond the Empire Embayment, the Sleeping Bear Dune itself-or the mother bear-which gives its name to the entire dunes complex, the National Lakeshore, and the other features in the area, appears as a small hill on the top of the high, sandy bluff. Historically, the dune was a landmark for travelers on Lake Michigan. Its location and dark vegetation drew attention to it. Now erosion has destroyed much of the dune.<br /> <br /> The entire National Lakeshore includes about 105 square miles and was authorized by Congress in 1970 to preserve the outstanding natural features of this area: glacial phenomena, sand dunes, beaches, and forests<br /> <br /> Directly ahead you see a section of boardwalk that extends for 500 feet south along the shoulder of the Empire Bluff. This boardwalk has been installed to prevent erosion and gullying of the fragile bluff face. Please do not descend the bluff for your own safety and to protect the natural setting.</p>",

From here, you can take in the stunning view towards the north from which you can see South Bar Lake and the sweep of Lake Michigan's Platte Bay all the way to the Sleeping Bear Dune.<br /> <br /> A bar lake is formed when winds and currents build a sandbar across a bay, isolating that bay from the larger lake. Declining lake levels can, and in this case did, greatly accelerate this process. As vegetation takes hold, the exposed sandbar traps more sediments and decaying vegetation starts to build up soil, further heightening and stabilizing the barrier between parent and daughter lake.<br /> <br /> To the north of South Bar Lake is the equally imaginatively named North Bar Lake, a popular spot for wading and swimming.</p>",

Oh, but wait, that's actually a piece of rusted farm equipment from the time of the Great Depression.<br /> <br /> This McCormick Deering No. 7 mowing machine was manufactured between 1929 and 1940. The horse drawn mower cuts a swath about five feet wide. The enclosed gearbox, a significant improvement over earlier models, allowed for efficient gear lubrication, prevented hay from getting tangled in the gears, and provided safer operations for man and animal.<br /> With the development of modern farm equipment, many such pieces of old machinery were abandoned in the fields.

In particular, the Grand Traverse region, known as the Cherry Capital, is well suited to growing various kinds of fruit trees. In about 1910, the Empire Lumber Company planted extensive orchards on the logged-over lands.<br /> <br /> An orchard extended all the way from the Village of Empire (you may be able to catch a glimpse of it to the north, through the trees) up the hill to this tree-studded meadow. The apple and plum trees growing here today do not seem to be from these old orchards, but may have sprung up from fruit discarded in the area.<br /> <br /> Lake Michigan plays an important role in moderating the local climate. After the long cold winter, the icy waters keep air temperatures cool in the spring. This helps to prevent fruit trees from blooming too early when a killing frost might still occur. Orchards on sloping ground benefit from natural air drainage. Heavy, cold air seeks low ground, while slopes and uplands stay slightly warmer. Thus, the hilly glacial terrain makes ideal orchard country.</p>",

The creek gently empties into Lake Michigan. Kids enjoy wading upriver into the belly of the forest and letting the current drift them toward the lake. The creek banks are lined with wildflowers, and the area is considered to be a birding hot spot.<br /> <br /> <b>Leashed pets are allowed to the right of Esch Road</b> <strong>when facing the water.</strong><br /> <b>NO Pets are allowed to the left of Esch Road.</b><br /> <br /> Otter Creek is a popular spot on Platte Bay Beach, particularly with bathers when the lake water is considerably colder than the sun-warmed shallows of the creek. The creek outlet to the lake can move north or south depending on the wave action on the lake. It looks different each time you visit. Watch the interplay between the beach, creek mouth, and waves. The floor of the creek is covered with various patterns of current ripple marks, in contrast to the larger, consistent wave ripple marks on the sandy bottom of the lake.<br />  </p> <h2>Enjoy the beach safely</h2> <h4>Swim safe</h4> <p>The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.</p> <h4>Be alert for rip currents</h4> <p>Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/slbe/planyourvisit/safety.htm#onthisPage-2\">Safety</a>.</p>   <h4>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</h4> <p>Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> <br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br />  </p> <h4>Beach fires</h4> <p>Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!</p> <h4>Take care around plover nesting areas</h4> <p>Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</strong><br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Paddle safe</strong><br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.<br /> <br /> <b>Look! A Petoskey stone! </b><br /> Watchful beachcombers can find a rainbow of pebbles dotting the shore, but uncovering a Petoskey stone is finding beach treasure. Petoskeys have an interesting shape and the intricate hexagonal patterns of the fossil colonial coral. Tossed by the waves, a Petoskey is rounded and smooth. Their attractive gray to brown color make Petoskeys stand apart from all other local rocks, and they are a favorite of rock hounds. Admire these natural beauties all you like, but please don't take them from the beach: it is illegal under federal law to remove stones from the National Lakeshore.

Logs were skidded down this slide during the winter and taken to D.H. Day's lumbermill.<br /> Later, she and her husband, George, purchased the property from Glen Haven entrepreneur D.H. Day before hiring Chicago architect Frank Sohm, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, to design their vacation home.<br /> <br /> For the next 50 years, Mary spent up to nine months every year at the cabin and was joined by her family in the summers. The family loved the lake and liked being away from city responsibilities. They left Chicago for the summer just after the children were out of school at the beginning of June and did not go back until the second week of September. Each summer the family enjoyed an annual dune climb: they motored by boat to the end of Little Glen at the base of the dunes, got lunch from a friendly woman at the base of the dunes, walked up the less-steep forested pathway, and walked across to Lake Michigan. After lunch, the big sport was to roll the large boulders, left from the ice age, down the steep face and enjoy watching the little specks splash into the water. Then they would climb down and back up the the steep bank to Lake Michigan before heading home.<br /> <br /> An ardent gardener and naturalist, Mary landscaped and kept the cabin grounds and a large garden across the road. She loved working in her garden. She and her daughter Margot grew tomatoes, cucumbers and beans. She would pickle the cucumbers and freeze the beans.<br /> <br /> After Mary's death in 1977, the Faust family used the cabin as a greatly treasured seasonal home. Their desire to see it protected and open to the public eventually led to their selling it to the National Park Service.</p>",

Following the death of his wife, ownership of the property passed to Foote's children. The house was destroyed by fire in 1935. In its place, Foote's daughter, Shirley Foote Alford, erected a small house purchased as a kit from Sears & Roebuck.

The offspring of these trees apparently were planted elsewhere in the village area, where they continue to be prominent features of the landscape. Growing conditions were ideal and many old trees remain.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",

The steel-hulled Liberian freighter was bound for Holland via the St. Lawrence Seaway loaded with 940-tons of general cargo.<br /> <br /> The 24-year-old captain, Eduardo Trivizas, and a multi-national crew of 13 men sailed the ship. Captain Trivizas had five years of sailing experience and was a graduate of the Greek Navy School. The Francisco Morazan was his first command. The Captain's wife and traveling companion, Anistasia, age 29 and pregnant with their second child was also aboard.<br /> <br /> By the next day, a 40-MPH wind blew out of the northwest, and the Morazan's decks were awash. After the ship passed the Point Betsie Light, blinded by fog and heavy snow, she ran aground about 300 feet off the southwest shore of South Manitou Island. The ship was in contact with two Coast Guardsmen at the North Manitou Island Lighthouse and with a state forester stationed on South Manitou Island who flashed light signals to the stranded ship. Rescue vessels arrived the next morning along with two helicopters and an amphibian airplane from the Traverse City Coast Guard Station.<br /> <br /> The lake was wild all day, but the ship did not seem to be in immediate danger, but the Captain was worried that some of the big waves might lift the ship off the shoal and carry it into deeper water. He arranged to have his wife lifted from the ship by helicopter on Friday, December 2. By Sunday, Dec 4, the crew abandoned ship and was taken by the ice-breaker Mackinaw to Traverse City.<br /> <br /> The owners of the Francisco Morazan could never be found and nothing was done about removing the ship. It is now home to cormorants and gulls.<br /> <br /> Fierce weather stymied efforts to salvage the cargo. Only about 5 tons of canned chicken and hides were recovered before the wreck, buffeted by heavy seas, began to break up.<br /> <br /> Over the years, cargo was salvaged by islanders for their own use: locals spoke highly of the Blue Star brand canned chicken and the boys especially enjoyed the balsa wood model aircraft kits.</p>",

George Conrad had a son in 1872, also named George. Little did he realize at that time that through his son and grandson's efforts, the island would become internationally famous in agricultural circles.<br /> <br /> George Conrad, Jr, with his son Louis, cultivated a highly productive variety of rye seed, called Rosen Rye, that became the standard in American rye farming. The seed is thought to have come from a Russian student at Michigan State University-apparently, it was a staple in his cold homeland. Rosen Rye increased rye yields threefold, but it needed to grow in isolation, lest it mingle and cross-pollinate, as it would on the mainland. South Manitou Island became the perfect place for cultivation.<br /> <br /> The Rosen Rye seed grown by the Hutzlers won blue ribbons at the Chicago Hay & Grain Show for a few successive years. Father and son would spend the winter sitting at the table in the kitchen with a knife and pick out the best seeds of the Rosen Rye they had grown during the summer. Some of the best seeds were planted in rows and cultivated like corn and other crops. All the farmers on the island participated in the planting and raising of the Rosen Rye.<br /> <br /> The Hutzlers and other island farmers also worked with Michigan State on the development of the Michelite Bean, which also became a national standard.<br /> <br /> The Hutlzers were very hard workers, and their house was always neat and clean-even the barn and machinery. George did most of the calling at square dances that were held on the island during the winter on Saturday nights. And George and Louis were considered to be the best moonshine makers on the island; in fact, they took much pride in whatever they did.</p>",

After immigrating from Germany and landing in Buffalo, New York in mid 1800s, George got a job on the Great Lake steamer, Iowa. On one of the steamer's trips to Chicago, the Iowa stopped at South Manitou to take on wood. George was impressed with the beauty of the island and the surrounding country. He thought he should be able to sell visiting boats almost anything he could grow. He soon got a job cutting wood on South Manitou, and more than a year later, brought his family to the island.<br /> <br /> The Hutzlers worked hard, clearing and farming the land, building a house and a barn, and breeding livestock. Fifteen years after arriving on the island, at the age of 42 with almost no money, George Hutzler's hard work, thrift, and careful planning led to him to become the most successful farmer on the island. He planted an apple and cherry orchard and loved carnations, which he grew near the house.<br /> <br /> George's son, John, took over the farm after his father and lived there throughout his life. John, a fiddler, played for square dances and was in much in demand for the barn dances that were a regular part of social life on the island.</p>",

        "notes": "Glen Haven Beach\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/glen-haven-beach.htm\n\n<p>Glen Haven Beach is a pebbly beach on the edge of Sleeping Bear Bay. This popular beach offers a little bit of everything. Not only the perfect destination for a family getaway, some fun in the sun with friends, or a day to yourself, it is also a fantastic spot to take a break-from biking along the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail, touring the historic Glen Haven village, or hiking through the low-lying dunes along the shore. The beach is a good site for walking, wading, or swimming.</p> <p>Keep your head down while wading in the cool, clear water and you may spy basalts, granites, cherts, limestones, and fossilized corals-some of the many different types of rocks and stones in the Great Lakes.</p> <p>Glen Haven beach is a great place to launch your kayaks or canoe. But remember, Lake Michigan's history is filled with many major shipwrecks over the decades. Look out for high waves and icy waters and storms that can arise quickly on the Great Lakes.</p> <h4>Pets</h4> <p>When accessing the beach from the Glen Haven Picnic Area, pets are allowed both left and right when facing the water.<br /> Pets are permitted right (west) on the beach until the boardwalk entrance to the Maritime Museum Complex (A series of white buildings on the left (south). Pet owners must turn around here as pets are not permitted on the Maritime Musuem Complex grounds or further west on the beach.</p> <h4>What are those posts sticking out of the water?</h4> <p>Do you see any pilings? If the water level is low, you may see peeking out of the water remnants of a large dock that was here when Glen Haven was bustling.</p> <p>In 1865, eight years after he founded the port settlement of Sleeping Bearville (which he soon renamed Glen Haven) CC McCarty built a dock about 150 feet into Lake Michigan. Around the turn of the 20th century, you would have seen up to 70 vessels anchored in Sleeping Bear Bay off or at the docks during the shipping season.</p> <h4>Look out for a dunesmobile!!?</h4> <p>For over 40 years the Dunesmobiles rode over the breathtaking landscape, including this beach. One minute a beachgoer might be lazing in the sun, wading in the water, building a sandcastle, or sifting through beach stones, but the next they are jumping out of the way of a convertible zigzagging along the shoreline, splashing in the shallows, filled with screaming passengers. The speeding convertibles were out; beach time was over.</p> <h4>Look! A Petoskey stone!</h4> <p>Watchful beachcombers can find a rainbow of pebbles dotting the shore, but uncovering a Petoskey stone is finding beach treasure. Petoskeys have an interesting shape and the intricate hexagonal patterns of the fossil colonial coral. Tossed by the waves, a Petoskey is rounded and smooth. Their attractive gray to brown color make Petoskeys stand apart from all other local rocks, and they are a favorite of rock hounds. Admire these natural beauties all you like, but please don't take them from the beach: it is illegal under federal law to remove stones from the National Lakeshore. Leave what you see for others to discover!</p> <h3>Enjoy the beach safely</h3> <h4>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</h4> <p>Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> <br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Beach fires</h4> <p>Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!</p> <h4>Take care around plover nesting area</h4> <p>Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.</p> <h4>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</h4> <p>Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.</p> <h4>Swim safe</h4> <p>The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.</p> <h4>Be alert for rip currents</h4> <p>Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.</p> <h4>Paddle safe</h4> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p>",

Day owned Glen Haven, 5,000 acres around it, 5,000 cherry and apple trees, a farm with hundreds of hogs, and a massive lumber company. Day was a visionary. He could see that the demand for lumber was falling rapidly, and he would need to diversify. So he started a canning company in the building that had been used to house items to be shipped. The Glen Haven Canning Company processed cherries, raspberries, and peaches and shipped the finished canned goods to Great Lake cities.<br /> <br /> Attempting to diversify the town's interest further, Day and the residents of Glen Haven promoted the area's natural beauty. Day worked to draw visitors to the area, helping to build M-109 and M-209, the highway from Empire to Glen Haven, and donating land for Michigan's first state park, which is now the D. H. Day Campground. Day's vision also included building the Glen Lake area into the most exclusive resort in the United States. However, the Great Depression and his death in 1928 put an end to that plan.<br /> <br /> The Cannery Boat Museum currently displays a variety of older boats ranging in size and technology from the Anishinaabek dug-out canoe to U.S. Coast Guard TRS motorized surfboat.<br /> <br /> A wayside in front of the cannery entitled, \"Fruit to go,\" tells the story of the cannery's fruit packing history.</p>",

Built around 1865, the dock stretched a hundred feet offshore and supplied docked steamships with cordwood, the original steamship fuel, cut from Northern Michigan forests. Around the turn of the 20th century, up to 70 vessels could be found anchored in Sleeping Bear Bay or at the docks during the shipping season. Original dock pilings can often be spied peeking out above Lake Michigan's waves.<br /> <br /> During the period between 1910 and 1931, the dock held the crowds gathered on Saturdays and Sundays waiting for arriving resort guests or for fathers and husbands visiting their summer resident families for the weekend. These men would leave Chicago Friday night, explained a tourist publication, \"and get here the next morning; first stop. They're with their families until Sunday night when the boat takes â€˜em back again, ready for the job. Great for 'em!\"<br /> <br /> According to summer visitor Gladys Dillon Young, \"All the people would meet and sit for hours on the front porch waiting for boats to come in. Boats never seemed to come when they were due. People always went down on Sundays to watch. That was the highlight of the week.\"<br /> <br /> Lake Michigan weather did not always make for smooth sailing. One summer family, the Drummonds, recalled sending a family member off on a foggy day. They waited for the ship to come in from the fog to dock:<br /> <br /> \"So dense a fog covers the water that we can only see a few hundred feet. We hear the boat's whistle far out. The bell on the pier clangs in answer. Again and again they signal to each other, but the wind prevents the sound from the bell reaching the boat. But at last she hears it and discovers herself a mile or so past the dock. All eyes strain to pierce the fog. By sound, we have located the position of the boat and at last a darker blur appears in the fog which slowly looms darker and larger-a faint glimmer penetrates the mist and like a phantom ship with all her lights alit she glides in and makes a beautiful landing.<br /> <br /> \"We bid Joseph goodbye 'til next Sunday and watch the boat fade into the fog-lights, music, and all swallowed up a few hundred yards away.\"<br /> <br /> Standing in the sand near Glen Haven dock is a wayside panel entitled \"Arriving...Glen Haven!\" illustrating ship travel to the dock.</p>",

It was the hub of D.H. Day's company. The lumbermen and dock workers were paid in company \"scrip\" so they could only shop at this store. At different times in its history, the store served as a post office, ticket and freight office for steamers, telegraph station, lumber salesroom, real estate office, and U.S. weather station. It was the nerve center in the hustle and bustle of the town. D.H. Day's own wife refused to live in the large home he built her and insisted instead on living above the store.<br /> <br /> Behind the store were an icehouse, granary, slaughterhouse, and croquet lawn.<br /> <br /> What could you buy at the store? Flour, coffee, sugar, canned milk, prepared foods, cleaners, candy; local milk, butter, eggs, fruit, and vegetables; cloth, clothes, shoes, hats, gloves, and bedding; tools, building materials, household items, toys, and farm implements; smoking, chewing, and pipe tobacco; patent medicine for humans and animals; gasoline, oil, tires, inner tubes, pumps, and spark plugs; post cards, booklets, picnic baskets, camping gear, fishing poles, nets; and Native American baskets, birch bark and quill work.<br /> <br /> Gasoline was purchased from the gasoline pump in front of the store. Gas was pumped into the glass cylinder atop the pump, which was marked in gallons like an oversized beaker and then drained via a release valve through a hose into the car or truck's tank.<br /> <br /> The General Store currently sells snacks and souvenirs and offers a small exhibit about D.

With its scattering of white pines, this small picnic area offers a shady escape during a sun-soaked beach day. A great place to enjoy a picnic dinner with a table-side beach views of Pyramid Point and North Manitou, and if you stay long enough, a spectacular sunset.</p> <h3>Good Harbor Trailhead</h3> <p>The 2.8-mile sandy path winds through tall dune grass and is almost entirely flat with just a few small grades. Near the beginning of the trail, there is a short section of low coastal dunes, where there is access to the beach. Then the trail turns away from Lake Michigan and becomes wooded for the remainder of its length. A portion of the trail passes through a swamp, and a small bridge assists in crossing a couple of wet spots.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pets are NOT allowed on this trail from December 1 to March 31.</strong><br /> <br /> The trail lies between Little Traverse Lake and Lake Michigan. This entire strip of land was underwater at the end of the Ice Age and has emerged gradually during post-glacial times. Along this trail, you can see the different plant communities that have developed in zones parallel to the shoreline. Starting from the beach and traveling inland, you pass through an active dune zone, a shrub zone, a pine-oak forest, and the beginnings of a beech-maple forest. Just a few thousand years ago, the forested zones were barren beaches. Plants, through their growth and decay, have built up a topsoil on top of old dunes</p>",

To the west, you can see Pyramid Point and to the north, the Whaleback and North Manitou Island. If you are there on a clear day, the Fox Islands may even be visible.<br /> <br /> <b>Leashed pets are allowed to the right of CR 651 when facing the water.<br /> NO pets are allowed to the left of CR 651.</b><br /> <br /> Good Harbor Beach is located in the northern part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore at the Lake Michigan end of County Road 651. Going north from Glen Arbor, turn left onto CR-651.<br /> <br /> Parking is available in the lot and along the roadside. The beach is 125 feet from the parking area providing carry-in access for your kayaks and paddle boards.</p> <h3>Village of Good Harbor</h3> <p>You may have noticed a few pilings near the shore. These relics are the only evidence of the historic village of Good Harbor. The village was started in the mid-1870s when a man named Vine built a small sawmill and dock. After 1900, the supply of timber gradually decreased and in 1905 the mill and about 1,000,000 feet of lumber in the yard burned. The mill wasn't rebuilt and most of the villagers moved away. The post office closed in 1907. In 1924, John Peters bought most of the remaining buildings including the barn, hotel, stores, a dwelling, and the blacksmith shop for $475. He and his sons tore the buildings down and sold the lumber.</p> <h3>Is this a shipwreck?</h3> <p>Many boats and ships have been lost in the sometimes treacherous waters of the Manitou Passage-the water trail between the mainland and Manitou Islands. The same natural forces of wind and waves that caused most of the wrecks can quickly uncover a wreck site that has been buried in the sand for over a hundred years. The site may remain visible for weeks or only a few days.<br /> Did you find a shipwreck?

The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Beach fires</strong><br /> Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!<br /> <br /> <strong>Take care around plover nesting area</strong><br /> Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</strong><br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Swim safe</strong><br /> The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.<br /> <br /> <strong>Be alert for rip currents</strong><br /> Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.<br /> <br /> <strong>Paddle safe</strong><br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it.

Known as the Copacabana of Sleeping Bear Dunes, Good Harbor Beach is a big, long beach that is great for quiet walks and can accommodate the crowds that flock to it. Its gentler water and huge swathes of soft sand and low slope provides kid-friendly fun at the beach and the perfect setting for a sunset bonfire.</p> <h3>Shalda Creek</h3> <p>Walk a few seconds south to find Shalda Creek, a stream running from the woods into Lake Michigan. The stream is great for kids to play in, fun to follow into the woods, and nice to stand in the warmer waters of the stream after a cold dip in Lake Michigan.</p> <h3>Beach geology</h3> <p>Good Harbor Bay Beach rivals Platte Bay Beach in its size and beauty. The beach/dune system extends eastward from the Point Pyramid headland to Carp River Point, just south of Leland.<br /> Good Harbor Bay is the remnant of a once greater embayment that extended south into the area that is now Little Traverse and Lime Lakes. With time and as lake levels fell, a series of spits and beach/dune ridges formed, separating these lakes and forming a distinct topography of low ridges and swales, although difficult to recognize under the forest cover.<br /> The sands making up today's dunes and beaches have been recycled many times-perhaps having come from Canada as glacial sediment, carried by melt waters from those glaciers, and those deposits eroded by ancestral lakes, carried by waters and wind in bars, beaches, and dunes, over and over. <strong> From William J. Neal & Gregory C. Wilson, Department of Geology, Grand Valley State University</strong></p> <h3>Look! A Petoskey stone!</h3> <p>Watchful beachcombers can find a rainbow of pebbles dotting the shore, but uncovering a Petoskey stone is finding beach treasure. Petoskeys have an interesting shape and the intricate hexagonal patterns of the fossil colonial coral. Tossed by the waves, a Petoskey is rounded and smooth. Their attractive gray to brown color make Petoskeys stand apart from all other local rocks, and they are a favorite of rock hounds. Admire these natural beauties all you like, but please don't take them from the beach:** it is illegal under federal law to remove stones from the National Lakeshore. Leave what you see for others to discover!**</p> <h3>North Unity</h3> <p>If you walk along the beach to the mouth of Shalda Creek, you'll be standing where, in the late 1800s, the community of North Unity stood.<br /> <br /> North Unity was settled in 1855 by a group of Bohemians from present-day Czech Republic and Germany, by way of Chicago. An account of the early settlement written by one of the settlers, Joseph Krubner and published in Chicago Bohemian newspaper reveals the hardships of pioneer life.<br /> <br /> According to Krubner, the Bohemians were looking for paradise. They hoped to find it in Chicago, but winter, few stores, and no jobs required they look further. So, they hired a sailboat and sailed 270 miles up the Michigan coast still looking for paradise. They landed in Good Harbor where they found a group of people who were already living there, so they traveled ten or so miles and settled near Pyramid Point. \"Here, at the Lake Michigan near Pyramid Bay, in deep forests never touched by human hands, began a new city, North Unity, Krubner wrote.<br /> <br /> The immigrants built a wooden 150-foot by 20-foot barracks partitioned into sections to provide temporary housing for the families to house them through winter. In spring they would select a farm site and build more permanent cabins. Some families built their own temporary shelters near the barracks, \"everybody had his own idea,\" wrote Krubner. \"Some houses were all covered with hemlock branches, leaving small openings for windows. They looked more like bear huts instead of homes for humans. Some places they built the log house so low it was difficult for tall man to stand up in one.\"<br /> <br /> The temporary shelters were cold and damp in the harsh northern Michigan, and their first winter was hard and cold. Lake Michigan lake froze and snow began to pile up, cutting off the little settlement. There wasn't enough food. There wasn't anything they could buy except a little corn from the Indians. Some had brought provisions with them from Chicago and shared the little flour and meat they had. No cows meant no milk. Living near the beach buffeted by winter winds, the Bohemians must of questioned whether they had indeed found paradise.<br /> <br /> Hungry and desperate, a small group of men took a sled and traveled across the lake to the island in hopes of buying some potatoes. The islands were settled long before the mainland, and the wooding industry-felling trees for cordwood which was sold to passing steamers for fuel-left cleared areas that islanders planted with potatoes and other crops. Several North Unity men took a sled and walked across the frozen lake to North Manitou Island. They bought a few bushels of potatoes and started back home. The return trip proved more difficult as the ice began cracking and breaking under their feet as the neared the shore.<br /> <br /> The potatoes lasted through the rest of winter, according to Krubner. \"For a while hungry wolves were chased away from our doors. But with approaching spring, when the snow melted and the lake still frozen, no boats were able to reach us, potatoes and whatever we had was gone, hunger began to strike again.\" The Bohemians were saved again, this time by the annual spring migration of the now extinct carrier pigeon--large swarms of pigeons would descend on Northern Michigan, literally darkening the skies. This particicular spring, the pigeons provided ample food for the starving settlers. \"Everyone who had a gun, and was able to use it, was shooting them,\" wrote Krubner. Soon after, the small lakes began to thaw and the Bohemians added fish to their menu.<br /> <br /> As the weather warmed, individual families began to build their own houses, and start gardens, growing potatoes, cabbage, beans, and corns, as well as wheat. Cattle were brought in from Chigcago two years later to provide milk. The small community prospered as more people arrived building a sawmill and schoolhouse. In 1859, a two-story general mercantile and post office opened; dances were held on the second floor. One of the early Czech pioneers, John Shalda, built a gristmill at the outlet of Shalda Creek.<br /> <br /> Fires were common during the 19th century, especially in the spring. And in 1871, North Unity was destroyed by fire. Fires and the insufficient area for supporting the growing community led many familie to move inland to what is know now as \"Shalda Corners\" (M-22 and County Road 669), where they rebuilt their homes, post office, stores, school, and church</p> <h3>Enjoy the Beach safely</h3> <p>**Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!**<br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub.

The land here was first sold by Carsten Burfiend to Thomas Kelderhouse for one dollar in 1861 with the proviso that Kelderhouse construct a dock near the Carsten Burfiend farm. The new dock was first visited by the steamship Oneida, which led to the community's name of Port Oneida.<br /> <br /> The farmhouse was once located near the Port Oneida dock and moved to the farm by John Schmidt many years ago.<br /> During the time when the barn was built in the 1890s, stalks of wheat and oats would have been piled on the floor and beaten with sticks to separate the grain from the straw. Inside this barn, you see one of the first machines that automated the process.<br /> <br /> Because of long winters a big barn to store hay was essential. Neighbors came together for a barn-raising bee when it was time to build a barn. Barn-raisings were a big deal. The entire barn went up in a day, with the help of many neighbors. The women would work all day to feed everyone. Tables made from saw horses with planks across them were set up outside were loaded with food and the workers helped themselves.

        "notes": "Katie Shepard Hotel\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/katie-shepard-hotel.htm\n\n<p>This large, one-and-a-half-story, shingle-style house was constructed in 1895 or 1896 for Mrs. William Shepard and her daughter Katherine, who was popularly known on the island as \"Miss Katie.\" The house was allegedly designed in the style of the Shepards' residence in New Orleans.<br /> <br /> A detached kitchen and dining room was located behind the house. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard converted her cottage into a summer hotel. The Beeches, as it was called offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion and became a popular gathering place.<br /> <br /> One island native who worked for Miss Katie in her youth recalled busy summer days, when the dining room was filled to overflowing with guests waiting on the long-screened porch for a second seating. Ms. Shepard continued to operate the hotel and dining room until poor health forced her to discontinue the business sometime in the early 1930s.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> <br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",

The 65-acre farm was a central gathering place for Port Oneida residents. The present house, built in 1910, was originally home to William and Charlotte Kelderhouse and their children. Not only was it a farmhouse, it was also a grocery store, telephone exchange, and post office, all run by Charlotte, as well as a community meeting location. Local families often rode horses down to the Kelderhouse store with baskets of eggs and rode home with groceries.<br /> <br /> Several gardens, planted and maintained by the Lakeshore and Kelderhouse decendents, harken back to the gardens that most farmsteads cultivated to help feed families and others. Laura Basch remembers picking vegetables from their garden and walking through the woods to neighboring farms, sharing what she had just picked.<br /> <br /> Sugar maples, planted by the students of the Port Oneida school and that still stand near the house, were tapped by the Kelderhouses.<br /> <br /> Apple trees with heritage variety apples were planted in around the early 1920's. A remnant orchard of apple trees is being restored. You can see, near the house, a fenced-in tree nursery of about 250 heritage apple trees, representing about 30 varieties including Cortland, Russet, Wagener, Ben Davis, Wolf River, Rhode Island Greening, Champion, and Spy. There is also a pear tree between the house and the nearby cemetery.<br /> <br /> You may pick limited amounts of ripe fruit for personal consumption.<br /> <br /> The property is currently mostly covered with grasses.

Bertie Bancroft, who grew up in Aral (the town that was located on Otter Creek), sold his land in Aral and, seeing the growing tourist trade, built the Ken-Tuck-U-Inn. Bertie and his wife Donna operated the inn. Other farm inns were developing as the local economy was turning to serve the growing tourist industry. Produce grown on the farm was used to make meals for the guests, which was more valuable than selling it wholesale to local markets.<br /> <br /> The house was built larger than a typical family farmhouse to accommodate the boarders and diners. Chicken dinners using their own farm-raised chickens were a Sunday specialty at the inn. During the peak tourist season, Donna and her staff prepared Sunday dinners for over 100 guests on her wood stove. Dairy products like milk, whipped cream, and ice cream came from the family cows.<br /> <br /> Boarders often returned year after year until they purchased their own summer cottages, and many became good friends. The house, which was painted pale yellow, was surrounded by gardens, flower beds, and trees. A sunroom was filled with books and seashells.<br /> <br /> Bertie lived in this house until his death in 1963. Donna died the following year.<br /> <br /> As you peek in the windows or sit on the steps to the back porch, you can almost hear the chatter and laughter of the guests as they enjoy a good chicken dinner in this serene country setting.</p>",

After his death in 1884, his son, James, inherited the property and in 1889, deeded 40 acres to George and Louisa Burfiend Lawr. Louisa was the daughter of Port Oneida pioneer Carsten Burfiend. They purchased the adjacent 80 acres and built this farm in the 1890s.<br /> <br /> George Lawr was the son of a Scotsman and his mother was from New York. George came to the U.S. from Canada in 1871. He and his wife farmed here until 1945.<br /> <br /> Neighbors remember Lousia as someone that loved everybody. She was known for offering large cream cookies with big raisins anytime someone entered her door. George Lawr was a skilled carpenter.<br /> <br /> During winters, some of the Port Oneida men, including George, would live at home and go work in the woods each day. George and his brother Howard had good teams of horses, and they would partner up teaming. According to George Burfiend, Lawr's nephew, they usually had two teamsters because \"they had to have help getting up the hills, and maybe help down the hills too-dad and Uncle George would have two sleighs, and one would get loaded during the day while they were pulling the other one to Cedar or Maple City or wherever, and then they'd bring that one back and drop it off, and then the next morning they'd hook onto the one that had been loaded the day before and take it over; and then they'd have one there being loaded.\"</p> <h3>Cutting Ice</h3> <p>For many years, the residents of Port Oneida cut all the ice they needed from frozen lakes. Shell Lake was one of the main places they harvested ice as well as Mud Lake near the Lawr place. They'd cut ice off the lakes and haul it up to what they called an icehouse, and then they would pack it all in there in one big bunch with sawdust, and then cover it all with sawdust. People would come together and help each other get their ice using huge, heavy handsaws adapted from the crosscut saws used in the woods. Gas-powered saws replaced the hand-powered ones, and, eventually electric saws came along.</p>",

        "name": "Maritime Boathouse",
        "notes": "Maritime Boathouse\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/maritime-boathouse.htm\n\n<p>The USLSS built the boat house in 1901. A wooden ramp with metal rails leads from the front of the boathouse down to a slip at the water's edge. Surfmen pushed the surfboat on its metal carriage down the ramp and into the harbor. From there, they could row or sail to ships in distress.<br /> <br /> The boathouse contains two of the open surf rowing boats used for open water rescues. It also holds the carriage and the small cannon-Lyle Gun-used to launch a projectile with attached line to a ship within 400 yards for a breeches buoy rescue. In addition, it holds many of the accessories (breeches buoys, megaphones, rope gathering and coiling equipment, etc.) used by the lifesaving team for their practices and work.<br /> <br /> The main qualification for a surfman was the ability to row an open boat in a storm. The surfmen were ranked by skill, the best man being #1, while the least experienced would be #6, #7 or #8, depending on the size of the crew.<br /> <br /> A wayside entitled, <strong>Equipped for Rescue</strong> ,\" features three black-and-white photos of uniformed surfmen performing ship rescues.</p> <h3>Life-saving equipment</h3> <p>Surfmen had a variety of life-saving equipment at their disposal. According to regulation, if one method of rescue failed surfmen were required to attempt all other available forms of rescue. Weekly drills ensured that all surfmen became proficient at using life-saving equipment. Their hard work paid off-the USLSS had an overall 99% success rate.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boats</strong><br /> Generally, the USLSS used two types of rescue boats-the lifeboat and the surfboat. The lifeboat was an English invention adopted by the USLSS. Lifeboats were self-bailing and self-righting. They could be sailed or rowed. Lifeboats were long and heavy; some measured as long as 40 feet and weighed up to 4,000 pounds! Other advantages of this boat included its stability, sturdiness, and ability to handle heavy seas. However, the weight also made the boat almost impossible to haul down the beach; instead, it had to be launched from the boathouse directly into a sheltered harbor. Later models of lifeboats were lighter and even motorized. With the addition of a motor, surfmen could travel to wrecks farther away and get there faster and with much less energy than rowing required.<br /> <br /> Surfmen also used surfboats, an American invention. Surfboats were smaller, lighter, and faster than their English counterparts. These boats sat on a carriage that surfman could haul down beaches and over dunes in order to get as close to a wreck as possible before launching directly into rough surf. The Keeper steered and the surfmen rowed. Surfboats could also carry more shipwreck victims than lifeboats, anywhere from 10-15 victims. One disadvantage was that the first surfboats were not self-righting, only self-bailing. Like the lifeboat, later models were also motorized.<br /> <br /> Eventually, most USLSS stations had both a lifeboat and a surfboat. Surprisingly, in many instances boats were not the surfmen's preferred method of rescue. Instead, surfmen and station Keepers often preferred to use breeches buoys and lifecars to rescue shipwreck victims. These methods of rescue both relied on one of the only guns designed to save lives-the Lyle gun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lyle Gun</strong><br /> The USLSS recruited Lt. David Lyle, an Army Ordnance officer, to design a gun that would aid in shipwreck rescues. Lyle invented small, bronze cannon that sat on a wooden carriage. Depending on size, the cannon and carriage together weighed about 160 pounds. The Lyle gun and other rescue equipment were stored on a cart that the surfmen could pull down the beach, close to the wreck. Surfmen tied a line to an eye bolt screwed onto the end of a cast iron projectile and then loaded it into the cannon. A charge of black powder, up to 8 ounces, shot the projectile and line 250 to almost 700 yards. The goal was to shoot the line over a wreck so that it could be used to haul a series of other lines from the beach. Shipwreck victims attached the heaviest of these lines, the hawser, to the mast (or the sturdiest part of the wreck) while surfmen back on the beach propped up the line with a crotch. Next, surfmen could attach a breeches buoy or a lifecar to the line and haul it out to the wreck.<br /> <br /> <strong>Breeches Buoy</strong><br /> Once the surfmen set up the hawser line, they could attach a breeches buoy and send it out to the wreck. This was also referred to as the beach apparatus. The breeches buoy itself was a life preserver with a pair of canvas breeches, or shorts, sewn onto the bottom. One by one, shipwreck victims would climb into the breeches buoy and the surfmen on the shore would haul on the line, pulling them over the waves and back to shore. This was the preferred method of rescue because the surfmen stayed on the beach and because the breeches buoy was lighter and easier to haul over the beach than the heavier lifecar.<br /> <br /> <strong>Life car</strong><br /> Several designs of lifecars existed as early as the 1840s. The United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) commonly used Joseph Francis' 1847 lifecar. This iron-covered lifeboat included a deck hatch in the top used by shipwreck victims to climb inside to safety. There was room for four passengers inside this iron life-saving device. Early models were so small that passengers had to lie on top of each other in order to fit; later models were taller so that passengers could sit upright. Once the hatch was closed, the lifecar was water-tight. Two rings on top of the car allowed the heavy hawser line to pass through and surfmen could haul the lifecar to and from the shore. Small holes at the top of the lifecar let air inside. However, it would have been a dark, bumpy, uncomfortable ride.<br /> <br /> Like the breeches buoy, the lifecar had some advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage was that instead of only being able to save one victim at a time, the lifecar had room for 4 or 5 passengers. Passengers were also protected from weather, debris, and waves. However, the weight of the lifecar was a major issue. This 550 pound vessel had to be loaded into the already heavy beach cart and hauled through the sand. Surfmen were totally exhausted by the time they reached the site of the wreck, and they still had to fire the Lyle gun, ready the lifecar, and then haul on the line that pulled it out to the wreck and back.</p> <h3>Shipwreck!</h3> <p>During the heyday of shipping on the Great Lakes, the Manitou Passage served as a busy highway. Faster and safer than sailing around North and South Manitou Islands, this passage acted as a shortcut and also provided access to the deep harbor at South Manitou. Thick fog and bad storms led many ships to seek refuge in South Manitou's harbor. Lighthouses on South Manitou, North Manitou, fog signals, a lightship, and a shoal light helped guide mariners through the passage. However, the passage was also dangerous because of shallow shoals where ships could run aground. The surfmen of the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) and later the United States Coast Guard (USCG) responded to hundreds of ships in distress. Read more about some of these incidents below.<br /> <br /> <strong>Walter L. Frost</strong><br /> On November 4, 1903 a night thick with fog, the steamer Walter L. Frost sounded distress signals when it ran aground on the southwest end of South Manitou Island. The island's USLSS crew launched their surfboat and made their way to the wreck where they attempted to free the boat by removing some of her cargo. When that failed, two tug boats attempted to tow her out, which also failed. Finally, worsening weather made freeing the steamer too dangerous and the 21 member crew abandoned her and took refuge at the Life-Saving station. The steamer and most of her cargo of corn and general merchandise were a total loss.<br /> <br /> <strong>Congress</strong><br /> On October 4, 1907, the surfmen at the USLSS station on South Manitou Island received a telephone call from the island post office stating that a steamer loaded with lumber was on fire. The Keeper and his crew launched a surfboat and rowed out to the Congress. They were able to tow the steamer away from the dock and save some of the cargo, but were not able to put out the fire. The steamer continued to burn and sank later that night.<br /> <br /> <strong>Three Brothers</strong><br /> The steamer Three Brothers was bound from Boyne City, MI to Chicago, IL with a load of lumber when it began taking on water during a storm. On the night of September 27, 1911 the captain ran her aground off of South Manitou Island. All thirteen aboard were saved and spent thirteen days at the South Manitou Island station. Most of the lumber aboard was salvaged, but the damage to the steamer was too expensive to repair, so she was abandoned. Eventually, shifting sand covered the Three Brothers and she became buried shortly after being abandoned. Then in 1996, the sand over the wreck washed away and exposed her for the first time in nearly 85 years! Today, the wreck is a popular dive site and is protected by the Manitou Passage Underwater Preserve.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fransisco Morazan</strong><br /> On November 29, 1960, the Liberian freighter Fransisco Morazan ran aground at the south end of South Manitou Island during a blinding snowstorm. The freighter was bound from Chicago to the St. Lawrence Seaway in order to reach Holland. The crew remained aboard the stranded ship until December 4th, when they finally abandoned her and were taken to Traverse City by the USCG. The captain never returned and today the wreck sits in about 15 feet of water.</p>",

A room on the second floor is outfitted as a Steamer Wheelhouse with a panoramic view of the Manitou Passage shipping channel.<br /> <br /> A wayside entitled, \"Coast Guard Station 1902 to 1942,\" tells about moving the station to its present place.</p> <h3>U.S. Life-Saving Service</h3> <p>Congress established the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) in 1871 in an effort to reduce the number of lives lost on the oceans and the Great Lakes due to shipwrecks. The surfmen of the USLSS became known as \"storm warriors\" and \"storm fighters.\" Their unofficial motto was, \"you have to go out, but you don't have to come back.\" USLSS crews braved perilous conditions to save shipwreck victims from certain doom.<br /> <br /> The narrow Manitou Passage, which runs between the islands and the mainland, is one of the most dangerous on the Great Lakes. Ships have to make several turns here because of the shoals surrounding the islands. At night, surfmen patrolled the beaches, looking and listening for any signs of a ship in distress.<br /> <br /> The crew were also responsible for maintaining the station; this included keeping it clean. Every morning they cleaned the lamps and lanterns and trimmed and filled them. They swept the hallways; filled wood boxes; swept sidewalks; cleaned cuspidors and ash trays; dusted the stairway; and made their beds neat and smooth. On Saturdays, or scrub day, all station floors were scrubbed, windows washed, and brass polished.<br /> <br /> Surfmen also kept the buildings and equipment gleaming. Maintenance of buildings usually meant repainting the buildings and cutting and splitting wood (enough wood for the two kitchen ranges and two wood burners in the station). But when needed, expanded to renovation tasks like putting on new roofs, laying new flooring, building new outhouses, and even laying new sod (and watering that sod).<br /> <br /> The main duty of the Service was the protection of life and property on the water. But local citizens often looked to the crew when they needed help. An annual report from 1895 lists some of these \"Miscellaneous Services\": surfmen rigging the rope on the flagstaff of the county building, extinguishing 21 fires in homes or buildings, catching a runaway horse, repairing a wagon owned by two ladies who were kept out of the rain at the station while the surfmen worked on their buggy, finding a child lost in the woods, helping sick people get home. And once, helping a farmer get his horse out of a well.</p> <h3>Living in the Station House</h3> <p>Typical U. S. Life-Saving Service Stations were rectangular framed houses, split in two by a hallway in the middle. One side housed the crew of surfmen: kitchen, dining room, and lounging area, and above that half of the house, the crew's sleeping room. The other half of the house was the keeper's quarters: kitchen, dining area, and a living room, and two second bedrooms. The keeper and his wife slept in one of the bedrooms and the children in the other room.<br /> <br /> The crew spent most of their time in the on the first floor as the sleeping quarters upstairs wasn't heated. They read, played cards, listened to music, cooked meals, and told stories.<br /> <br /> Upstairs in the sleeping quarters, each surfman had an iron bed and a closet with a number over the door to identify who it belonged to. The closet shelves held spare sheets and blankets, a swimming suit, and each man's regulation clothing. The men also kept a case of wooden matches in small wooden boxes, a jack knife, and towels, all folded neatly. Their dress coat which hung on the door. Each man also had a book of regulations.<br /> <br /> There was no washstand upstairs. Washing took place either in the kitchen or out in the laundry room. The station had a shallow water well. A pump by kitchen was the only inside plumbing. They had no electricity, only oil or gas lights. One keeper bought a little metal bathtub and installed it so it drained, but they still had to fill the tub with bucketsful of water heated on the wood stove.<br /> <br /> Many of the surfmen had their own, small houses nearby. This allowed them to be with their families. The surfmen had one day off every 8 days, otherwise they were on duty 24 hours a day. Regulations required the men to sleep at the station except for their day off. But some keepers were more lenient allowing men to stay in their cottages near the station, where they could be called quickly to come in an emergency and let people spend a little more time at home.</p>",

        "notes": "Monte Carlo Cottage\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/monte-carlo-cottage.htm\n\n<p>The cottage known as Monte Carlo was constructed between the time the summer people left in 1893 and returned in 1894. The Monte Carlo is the third dog-trot bungalow cottage on North Manitou Island-a house plan that is exceedingly rare in the northern Great Lakes region. It predates the other Cottage Row houses.<br /> <br /> The Monte Carlo cottage shared this parcel with a house moved from the USSLS complex and remodeled to serve as a communal dining facility for Cottage Row property owners. William Angell purchased the property and stayed there during his visits to the island. The dining hall/hotel, which could house 20-25 guests at a time, was converted into a lodge for guests of the Manitou Island Association (and for hunters), but was destroyed by fire in 1953.<br /> <br /> North of the cottage, the site of the former MIA lodge is marked by a slight earthen depression and a single spirea shrub growing near the walkway.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",

The buildings illustrate the beginnings of the volunteer era and continue through the expansion of the Life-Saving Service into the Coast Guard era.<br /> <br /> Members of the USLSS were responsible for rescuing victims aboard ships in distress using a variety of equipment. The USLSS eventually became the main employer of North Manitou Island residents. Crews on the Great Lakes were usually composed of a Keeper and six to eight surfmen. The crew had a number of duties including twenty-four-hour beach patrol, beach apparatus drill, boat drill, signal drill, and practice at \"restoring the apparently drowned.\"<br /> <br /> For nearly eighty years, the presence of the U.S. Life Saving Service station made North Manitou Village the primary social and economic hub of the island. The U.S. Life Saving Service, and Cottage Row's summer residents, infused the relatively isolated North Manitou Island economy with cash and linked the Island with the larger regional economy. The station represented an important source of employment for residents, and a small, local market for agriculturists. Young men from several island farm families took jobs with the U.S. Coast Guard. Many year-round residents, especially women and children, earned cash wages by performing domestic chores such as washing, sewing, cleaning, and canning. The station crew provided the island with fire protection, first-aid, and police services, and also served as a vital communication link with the mainland and the outside world, and as a center of island social life.<br /> <br /> Today, park employees live and work in the station house during the summer months.</p> <h3>Living in the Station House</h3> <p>Typical U. S. Life-Saving Service Stations were rectangular framed houses, split in two by a hallway in the middle. One side housed the crew of surfmen: kitchen, dining room, and lounging area, and above that half of the house, the crew's sleeping room. The other half of the house was the keeper's quarters: kitchen, dining area, and a living room, and two second bedrooms. The keeper and his wife slept in one of the bedrooms and the children in the other room.<br /> <br /> The crew spent most of their time in the on the first floor as the sleeping quarters upstairs wasn't heated. They read, played cards, listened to music, cooked meals, and told stories.<br /> <br /> Upstairs in the sleeping quarters, each surfman had an iron bed and a closet with a number over the door to identify who it belonged to. The closet shelves held spare sheets and blankets, a swimming suit, and each man's regulation clothing. The men also kept a case of wooden matches in small wooden boxes, a jack knife, and towels, all folded neatly. Their dress coat which hung on the door. Each man also had a book of regulations.<br /> <br /> There was no washstand upstairs. Washing took place either in the kitchen or out in the laundry room. The station had a shallow water well. A pump by kitchen was the only inside plumbing. They had no electricity, only oil or gas lights. One keeper bought a little metal bathtub and installed it so it drained, but they still had to fill the tub with bucketsful of water heated on the wood stove.<br /> <br /> Many of the surfmen had their own, small houses nearby. This allowed them to be with their families. The surfmen had one day off every 8 days, otherwise they were on duty 24 hours a day. Regulations required the men to sleep at the station except for their day off. But some keepers were more lenient allowing men to stay in their cottages near the station, where they could be called quickly to come in an emergency and let people spend a little more time at home.</p>",

        "notes": "North Bar Beach\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/north-bar-beach.htm\n\n<p>North Bar Lake beach is one of the most popular beaches in the Lakeshore. Perfect for families, North Bar Lake and its warmer waters are immediately next to Lake Michigan and connected by a small outlet. If the waves on the big lake are knocking over your two-year-old, you can retreat to North Bar Lake. The outlet between the lakes often is so shallow that very small children can wade in the warmer water.</p> <p>The shallow, crystal clear waters of North Bar offer a great place to for swimming, skim boarding, sand dam building, and general splashing around as well as kayaking and paddle boarding.</p> <p><strong>NO pets are allowed on this beach.</strong></p> <p>It takes a few minutes to climb the trail over the dune that separates the lakes, but it's worth it. Once at the Lake Michigan beach, you can walk along the shore north to the bluffs below the Pierce Stocking Drive Lake Michigan Overlook Platform. This perspective gives you a better appreciation of the size and steepness of the bluffs.</p> <p>Some areas of the low dunes that separate the two lakes have experienced severe dune erosion and are closed for restoration. Please obey closure signs.</p> <h3>The channel between North Bar Lake and Lake Michigan</h3> <p>Unlike many inland lakes, North Bar Lake connects to Lake Michigan with a channel that opens and closes with the crashing of waves and blowing of sand during storms. When the sand bar builds up, it separates North Bar Lake from Lake Michigan. When waves eat the sand away, a small connecting channel exists between the two lakes.</p> <p>Longshore currents help move the sand along the shore. Longshore currents act like a river in the lake transporting sand along the lakeshore and reshaping the shoreline. The longshore current at Sleeping Bear Point carries 60,000 square meters of sand a year away from the point, enough to fill 24 Olympic swimming pools a year. You can often see the longshore current (especially from the North Bar Lake Overlook on the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive): it is the greener water paralleling the shore.</p> <p>North Bar Lake occupies part of a former bay on Lake Michigan. This unique connection creates a diversity of aquatic and ecological communities unmatched in most of Michigan. Without the power of Lake Michigan's waves, this beautiful lake would never have formed.</p> <h3>Is this a Shipwreck?</h3> <p>Many boats and ships have been lost in the sometimes treacherous waters of the Manitou Passage-the water trail between the mainland and Manitou Islands. The same natural forces of wind and waves that caused most of the wrecks can quickly uncover a wreck site that has been buried in the sand for over a hundred years. The site may remain visible for weeks or only a few days.<br /> <br /> Did you find a shipwreck? Read more about identifying a shipwreck in the Beach FAQs section of the app.</p> <h3>Beach Safely</h3> <p>**Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!**<br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Beach fires</strong><br /> Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!<br /> <br /> <strong>Take care around plover nesting area</strong><br /> Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</strong><br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Swim safe</strong><br /> The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.<br /> <br /> <strong>Be alert for rip currents</strong><br /> Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> <br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.<br /> <br /> <strong>Paddle safe</strong><br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p>",

        "notes": "North Manitou Island Contact Station\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/north-manitou-island-contact-station.htm\n\n<p>The Manitou Island Association (MIA), formed in 1926 by island land owners, managed the island's economic and social life. During the 1920s, the MIA earned income from farming and from the sale of cattle, beef, pork and potatoes, and the rental of pasture land, farm labor and draft animals. They also earned income from dairy goods, a cherry orchard, an apple orchard, a sugar bush, fishing, logging, and cutting ice off of Lake Manitou.<br /> <br /> The MIA initially focused its operation on agriculture, basing activities at two farms, one located adjacent to North Manitou Village, and the other at the location of the former Crescent lumber camp. During the 1920s the MIA maintained a large free-range beef cattle herd, and substantially expanded the orchard acreage devoted to cherry<br /> production. The MIA also began transforming the island landscape into a more marketable recreational resource. In 1926 the association released a small herd of white-tailed deer on the island with the intent of eventually establishing a population large enough to sustain hunting both for sport and the for the national venison market. The following year the MIA constructed a sawmill near its North Manitou Village farm and began harvesting small amounts of timber to provide lumber and shingles for the construction and maintenance of island buildings.<br /> <br /> Both of these ventures--sport-oriented recreation, and timber harvesting--became increasingly important components of the MIA's business during subsequent decades.<br /> <br /> The MIA hoped to transform the island into an exclusive fishing and hunting retreat. While Lake Michigan and the island's two small inland lakes provided plenty of fishing, hunting opportunities were limited because North Manitou had no large game. The MIA introduced non-native raccoon and white-tailed deer to the island in 1926 in order to provide more varied hunting for sportsmen.<br /> <br /> The Manitou Island Association's office building reflects the MIA's conception of the farm as a business and the association's hierarchical management structure.</p> <h3>Island deer and early deer hunts</h3> <p>Of all the wildlife located on North Manitou, the white-tailed deer is what you are most likely to see. In 1926, William R. Angell introduced six deer to the island. These few deer became the basis for a rapidly expanding herd which supported a hunting preserve for many years.<br /> <br /> The first deer hunt on North Manitou took place in 1937 with 18 deer taken. By counts in the early 1980s, there were about 2,000 deer on the island. Because there were so many deer, they would constantly browse the vegetation within their reach. Over the years, the deer have eaten off all the vegetation which was palatable to them and left that which was not. They don't really care for American beech, so you can find it growing in great abundance on the ground. The vegetation on South Manitou Island is different than that on North Manitou. South Manitou has a thick lush understory of shrubs, ferns, and vines. But the deer browse line on North Manitou is five to six feet up, giving the island a manicured look.<br /> <br /> Edgar McKee, island manger from 1937 to 1942, often served as a hunting guide (and was the guide when the first deer was shot in the fall of 1937), describes the early deer hunts.<br /> <br /> \"Hunting was divided into two, three-day sessions each week, starting around Nov 1. It would cost each hunter $150, which covered the boat trip to and from the Island, hotel and meals, a trained guide to hunt with, and a guaranteed deer. Sounds cheap, but back then that was a lot of money.<br /> <br /> The island was divided into ten sections. Each guide explored his section in advance, and knew where to find the deer. Only ten hunters were allowed to hunt at one time, and no hunter was allowed out without a guide. This was to assure safety. Also, not hunter was allowed out with a gun if there was any evidence of alcohol impairment.\"<br /> <br /> Most of the island's hunting customers were officials of large companies, invited guests of MIA members. \"None of the hardships of hunting and taking care of your deer existed then. The hunter was transported to his hunting spot and picked up at the appointed time. The hunter's job was to shoot the deer his guide pointed out to him. The guide took care of preparing the deer and dragging it to the appointed spot to be picked up.\"<br /> <br /> \"Not every hunter took home a deer. During my stay on the Island, most of the hunters killed their deer, but some didn't. It was my job to keep hanging a few choice bucks and does to supply that need. That was no problem. I would take my rifle in the company station wagon with a couple of guides, and drive through the woods. Most of the deer I shot, I shot from the window of the car. It was not unusual to take in four or five deer in on afternoon.\"<br /> North Manitou Island functioned as an exclusive hunting preserve, much in the tradition of the private hunting clubs that became popular with wealthy men during the late nineteenth century.<br /> <br /> Deer hunt still occurs in November managed under the NPS. But, unlike the hunts of Mr. McKee's time, hunters are on their own and have to find and move their deer themselves.</p>",

Although the boundaries of this 120 acre farm have remained constant, ownership changed many times. The land was settled by Olsen, who emigrated from Kristiansand, Norway, and landed on North Manitou Island, where he met his wife, Magdalena Burfiend.<br /> <br /> The original owner of 80 acres of this parcel was Andrew Tuffner, who sold it to Thomas Kelderhouse in 1865. Kelderhouse then sold it to Ole Olsen in 1877. Mr. Olsen sold the property to Carsten Burfiend in 1879, and bought it back two years later.<br /> After Ole Olsen built the farm, his son Charles bought it in 1891 and farmed there until 1915 when he married and built a farm on M-22. He later sold this farm to Albert and Ida (Dago) Prause. In 1954, Prause sold the farm to Howard Olsen, a grandson of Ole and a nephew of Charles. Howard Olsen's widow, Bertha, lived in the house until her death in 1995.<br /> <br /> The land changed hands many times, but, for most of the time, it was owned by the Olsen family.<br /> <br /> A short hike of about 1/3 mile east from the buildings will take you behind Narada Lake, where herons, geese, and loons are often seen.</p>",

It's a perfect place to spend the day: pack a picnic, bring your canoe and fishing poles, tie up your hiking shoes, and enjoy the outdoors with family. The trail is surrounded primarily by pine-oak-aspen woods; open fields and lakes are scattered throughout plains.<br /> <br /> <b>Pets are NOT allowed on trail from December 1 to March 31.</b><br /> <br /> There are a number a trail routes you can take, easy, intermediate and advanced: options for every user. Signs are not posted at every intersection so keep your eye on the map.  <br /> <br /> <b>Otter Creek Loop</b> is a 4.6-mile trail that takes you through the woods around Otter Creek and Otter Lake. The terrain is flat and easy through this section.<br /> <b>Bass Lake Loop</b> is a 3.5-mile trail follows a winding course across gently rolling hills through pine-hardwood forest and passes Bass Lake, Deer Lake, and wetland areas. Enjoy the view and wildlife from the bench at the Bass Lake water access. Look for ripening wintergreen berries along the trail mid-loop in the fall.<br /> <b>Lasso Loop</b> is a 6.3-mile trail with diverse terrain and the most difficult terrain in the plains; aÂ few steep ridges and tight switchbacks can be challenging at times, but it offers the best views of Lake Michigan. Take the more strenuous 1.6-mile round-trip spur at the #5 post past the White Pine Backcountry Campground to a quiet Lake Michigan beach and enjoy one of the finest beach walks in the northern lower peninsula.<br /> Be aware: the mosquitoes can be vicious; make sure to bring repellant.</p> <h3>Ridges and swales</h3> <p>The Platte Plains are not your traditional plains with fields, but it is a lowland area between the Platte River, Otter Lake, and Lake Michigan. A satellite view of Platte Bay reveals the ancient shoreline sand dunes, which mark the successive positions of Lake Michigan after each intrusion of glacial ice melted. These geological landforms are called ridges and swales. From the trails, however, they're steep hills.Â </p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Chalenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year? Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> <br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation.

Flora and fauna deal with strong sunlight, poor soils, and constant winds. The wind action alone can dry out plants, expose root systems, or even completely bury vegetation, including trees.<br /> <br /> The cottonwood is the only common tree of the dunes and is well adapted to the dune environment. Because it grows fast, the tree can keep pace with burial by sand. Cottonwood trees grow in a cluster. They reproduce by cloning, sprouting new trunks from roots. The network of roots helps to hold the sand in place, and the tree itself acts as a windbreak, stabilizing the dunes. The dense root networks of various grasses also hold the sand in place. Once the dune is stabilized, new plants can begin growing on it, plants which are not able to survive on an active dune. Common juniper, the evergreen shrub growing among the grasses, is one of the typical plants of stabilized dunes.<br /> <br /> The dunes cover just a small area because they depend on strong winds off Lake Michigan to exist. The active dune zone extends for only about a mile from the lake. Further inland, the wind loses its energy and can no longer build dunes.<br /> The basswood tree across the road is a good example of the contest between trees and vegetation and the wind. Wind action has been threatening the tree's stability. If you were that tree, how much longer do you think you could keep your balance and stay standing?<br /> <br /> As you continue on to the Lake Michigan Overlook, notice the startling contrast between the open, sunny environment of the dunes and the lush, shady world of the beech-maple forest. Sugar maples and American beech are the predominant trees, but non-native insects and diseases are having a devastating effect on these forests. Beech bark disease is killing the beach trees, emerald ash borer, the ash trees. Most of these non-native pests are moved into the Lakeshore by hitching a ride on firewood. Help up protect the forest by leaving your firewood at home!</p>",

There's a lot to take in!<br /> <br /> Here on this plateau, you are at the eastern edge of the sand dunes, standing on top of one of the tallest dunes, 200 feet high. Perched dunes and plant life flourish on this harsh landscape. These dunes are called \"perched\" because they are sitting on top of glacial moraine bluffs made of sand and gravel. Prevailing westerly winds blow the sand out of the moraine and deposit it on top of the bluff. In some places the dune fronts advance a few feet per year, while in other places the dunes are stabilized by plants and don't move at all.<br /> <br /> Please stay off the dunes in this area.

Big Glen Lake reaches 130-feet deep in places, while Little Glen (closest to you) is only 12-feet deep. Different shades of blue indicate lake levels.<br /> <br /> Glacial erosion carved out both lakes during the Ice Age. In post-glacial times, a sand bar developed, separating Glen Lake from Lake Michigan. Both the D. H. Day Campground and the village of Glen Arbor are located on that sandbar.<br /> <br /> The long ridge running along the north side of Little Glen is called Alligator Hill. It is a product of the Ice Age and early post-glacial times. Glaciers carried a tremendous load of sand, gravel, and other rock debris frozen in the ice. When the ice melted, the run-off streams deposited great piles of sediment to form the hill. Imagine how thick the ice must have been to have left hills of debris several hundred feet high.

The Lake Michigan Overlook is the crown jewel of the Scenic Drive; no words can really describe its beauty. This is why you came to the dunes, isn't it? The overlook opens to a myriad of blues from shore to horizon, to glorious sunsets, and brilliant night skies. A popular stop, you'll find lots of people, but there's plenty of room for everyone.<br /> <br /> From the platform, about 450 feet above the lake, if the visibility is good, you will see South Manitou Island ten miles to the northwest; Empire Bluffs four miles to the south; and Platte Bay beyond that. Still further south is Point Betsie, the farthest point of land you can see, 15 miles away as the crow flies. Wisconsin is 54 miles due west, but thanks to the curvature of the earth, you will not see any \"cheeseheads\" waving back at you! Lake Michigan is the largest lake completely within the United States and is the fourth largest fresh-water lake in the world.<br /> <br /> The bluff has been wearing back at the rate of about a foot per year. Waves wear away the base the bluff and sand and rocks from above slide down to the beach. This process has gone on for many years, so we can infer that this hill once extended much further out into the lake. The shallow waters offshore also seem to indicate that a peninsula once extended from here about 2 miles out into the lake. This means that the site of this overlook used to be inland protected from the strong winds off the lake.<br /> <br /> The vast majority of visitors take in the view from atop the bluff and don't risk erosion, injury, and rescue fees by going down-not to mention the hour or two it can take to climb up!<br /> <br /> Take your time, your camera, and a deep breath. Spend some time at the waysides. Learn about the legend and perhaps an Anishinaabek word or two, the migration of the mother bear, and treacherous seas.</p>",

This view is at its best when the fall colors are on display because of the expansive view over the top of the maple-beech forest.<br /> <br /> The small lake below is North Bar Lake. The lake was formed behind a sand bar at the edge of Lake Michigan. At times the wave action builds up the sand bar and separates North Bar Lake from Lake Michigan. At other times, a small connecting channel exists between the two lakes. North Bar Lake was once a small bay on Lake Michigan. It is one of the few lakes in the region that has an open channel to Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> North Bar Lake is ideal for swimming in the summer. It is warmer than Lake Michigan because it is smaller and the sun can warm it up more quickly, and it is surrounded by pure sandy beaches. Children like to play in the small creek that flows from North Bar Lake to Lake Michigan, and the older kids can enjoy the waves of the big lake.<br /> <br /> The shaded picnic area offers cool respite and a place to sit and eat.<br /> <br /> As you leave the scenic drive, notice all the pine trees. In many places in the park, rows of pines were planted where the original mixed hardwood forests had been harvested. Red pines were commonly planted for their uniformity, wood properties, and relative freedom from insects and disease.

A bear and two little cubs were trying to leave that place and come around the lake where there would be more food.<br /> <br /> They walked for many days on the beach together, but after a while the two little cubs began to whimper with hunger and so the bear decided to swim across the rest of the lake. They waded into the water, one cub on each side of the bear, and they swam off into the lake a long way. After a while the cubs began to get very tired, and so the bear said, Try hard, the land is not very far.' And very soon they did come in sight of land. But gradually the cubs got weaker, and only ten miles away, one cub sank into the water. Soon after the other also drowned.<br /> <br /> The bear's heart was broken, but she could do nothing. She waded ashore and lay down, looking out on the water where her cubs had died.

Travel writers called Glen Lake the \"Switzerland of America.\" Not one to miss an opportunity, D. H. Day of Glen Haven began planning an exclusive resort on Alligator Hill in the 1920s (see right). He built an 18-hole golf course and cleared land for an airstrip. There were to be tennis courts, bridle paths, a polo field, ski jump, tobaggan slide, and more than 100 estates-\"ideally restricted.\"<br /> <br /> Two events altered that fate: Day passed away in 1928 and the stock market crashed a year later. Investors pulled their funding. By the 1940s, state residents and officials were imagining a new use for the land: not a playground for millionaires but a park for us all.<br /> <br /> Today, the Alligator Hill Trail network (shown in orange, above) allows you to hike, cross-country ski, or ride a horse down the roads of what was supposed to be \"America's premier summer community.\" Although Day Forest Golf Course stopped operating in 1942, you can still see the fairways through the trees</p>",

The forest is advancing on the dunes; meanwhile, dunes are infiltrating the forest. Believe it or not, 80% of the park is forested, but at one time most of that land was bare sand. Ecologists call this cycle of transformation \"succession.\"<br /> <br /> It starts with sand and wind (left). Long ago, glaciers created the sand; the wind comes from Lake Michigan. As the sand piles up, plants anchor the dunes. However, when hikers walk on dune grasses, the sand compacts and crushes their fragile roots. With no roots to hold the dune in place, it blows away, creating big cavities called \"blowouts.\" At the next stop, you will learn how a blowout has mortally wounded the Sleeping Bear.<br /> <br /> <b>1. Blowin' in the Wind</b><br /> How sand moves in the wind depends on the size of the grains. Large grains tumble or \"creep\" along the ground. Fine grains can be swept into dust clouds. The other 95% move by bouncing or \"saltating\" from one sand ripple to the next.<br /> <br /> <b>2. Grasses Trap the Sand</b><br /> A dune can't form if the sand never stops moving. Here, marram grass acts like a net to trap grains and hold them in place.<br /> <br /> <b>3. Cottonwoods Find a Way</b><br /> These trees are survivors. When sand buries their branches, they clone themselves, sprouting roots to grow new trees.<br /> <br /> <b>4. Shrubs, the Soil Makers</b><br /> Juniper and sandcherry shelter other plants from sun and sand. They also prime the area with their fallen leaves.<br /> <br /> <b>5. Enter the Sun-Lovers</b><br /> Trees that thrive in sunlight like birch and aspen appear first. Once they're tall enough to make shade, pine and oak move in.<br /> <br /> <b>6. Finally, a Forest!</b><br /> See the big tree behind you? That's a basswood. Tall shade tolerant trees like this, maple, beech, and hemlock replace the sun-lovers. Their dense cover provides homes for many native species, including woodpeckers, deer, and porcupines.<br /> <br /> <b>7. If a Tree Falls... </b><br /> Once established, the forest remain stable until fire, flooding, wind, or disease fells trees. Disturbances allow sand to blow in.<br /> <br /> <b>8. Sand Covers All</b><br /> Unlike cottonwoods, most trees cannot survive the abrasion and dehydration when submerged in sand. The forest dies.<br /> <br /> <b>9. The Ghost Forest</b><br /> Eventually, the sand migrates, exposing sun-bleached bones of former trees. You can hike through one at Sleeping Bear Point.<br /> <br /> <b>10. What's in a Log?</b><br /> Fallen snags are not dead zones. They support salamanders, snakes, insects, fungi, and serve as nurseries for future trees.</p>",

Traders arrive with flint, copper, and ideas. Eventually you're growing crops, decorating pottery, and boiling sugar from maple sap at camps on Glen Lake.

Your descendents-the Anishinaabek-form a Confederacy of Three Fires: the Odawa and Ojibwe of the upper Great Lakes and the Potawatomi further south.

They gouged the earth like plows and left piles of sand and gravel called moraines in their wake. In fact, you're standing on one of these piles now! Eventually, the glaciers thawed, turning their deep tracks with great lakes of meltwater. One of these, Lake Nipissing, gradually became Lake Michigan as its water levels fell. Meanwhile, waves were eroding beaches and bluffs. Currents carried the debris along the shore to form sandbars. By about 2,000 years ago, these currents had deposited enough sediment on either side of an island (that we now know as Alligator Hill) to landlock Glen Lake. Over time, grasses and trees took root. Today, this forested sandbar is where you'll find the town of Glen Arbor-and a beach of ancient sand.<br /> <br /> Why is the water so blue?<br /> Lakes in forested areas are often fed by runoff. This floods the lake with soil, leaves, and other dissolved organic matter that stains the water like a teabag. Sunlight is absorbed by the dark water and little light is reflected.<br /> Unlike most lakes, Glen Lake is fed by clear groundwater, not runoff. The water's clarity allows sunlight to reflect off the white, sandy bottom much like you would see in a swimming pool.</p>",

They followed the lakeshore using landmarks like the Mother Bear as their guides. It was their belief that Mishipeshu, a great underwater panther, made waves by thrashing its tail. Storms were the work of Animikiig, the thunderbirds. To protect themselves, the Anishinaabek painted symbols of both spirits (left) on their canoes.<br /> Ship captains were equally cautious. Since the early 1800s, thousands have entered the Manitou Passage-a gauntlet of shoals between the islands and the mainland. Some sought shelter in South Manitou Island Harbor; most were taking a shortcut along the shore. Many did not make it. To date, archaeologists have discovered at least 60 wrecks. An untold number of \"ghost ships\" remain lost below the waves.<br /> <br /> ...scarcely had we gotten out into Lake Michigan than we were beset by a horrible tempest and in an instant our rudder was broken to pieces ...

To the south is Platte River Point. On a clear day, you can also see South Manitou Island.<br /> <br /> Limited parking is available at the end of Peterson Rd and along the roadside. A boardwalk crosses the low dunes from the parking lot to the beach.</p> <h3>Enjoy the Beach safely</h3> <p>**Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!**<br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> **Beach fires**<br /> Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!<br /> <br /> **Take care around plover nesting area**<br /> Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> **Step around the Pitcher's thistle**<br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> **Swim safe**<br /> The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.<br /> <br /> **Be alert for rip currents**<br /> Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.<br /> <br /> **Paddle safe**<br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p> <h3>Lake Michigan Pirates: Roaring Dan Seavey</h3> <p>Lake Michigan's eastern shoreline is a paradise treasured by tourists and recreationists. But during the periods of western expansion, the upper Great Lakes region was a very dangerous place. Up until the mid-1800s, a wild west mentality ruled the Great Lakes. The lakes were a source for all kinds of smuggling, poaching, and piracy. Pirates sailed the waters stealing beaver pelts, timber, and sometimes entire ships. One notable pirate was Roaring Dan Seavey, a man that would sail out into the lakes and plunder wherever and whatever he could.<br /> <br /> Seavey and a small crew would silently slip his schooner, the Wanderer, with no running lights, into ports in the dead of night and make off with anything on wharves, in unlocked warehouses, or on nearby streets-cattle, hay, leather goods, fruit--anything of value and could be carried on the schooner.<br /> <br /> Known for his monumental acts of drinking, brawling, whoring, poaching, and stealing, Seavey also practiced moon cussing: a pirate trick of rearranging or removing or putting up fake port lights so that ships coming in would crash on the rocks. Then, his crew would board the ship and steal the cargo. He earned most of his money from poaching venison and stealing. He also ran an offshore casino and brothel.<br /> <br /> Seavey's biggest heist was stealing the 40-ft schooner Nellie Johnson in Grand Haven, Michigan. As the story goes, he gained the trust of the Nellie Johnson's crew and captain and came aboard with booze and drank them all under the table. When the crew was passed out, he and his crew removed them from the schooner and set sail for Chicago to sell the cedar posts onboard. Unable to sell anything and being discovered as a pirate, Seaver took the Nellie Johnson and fled up the coast of Lake Michigan. He eluded federal authorities for two weeks but was captured near Frankfort. He was taken back to Chicago where he claimed he won the ship in a poker game. The ship's real captain never showed up, so charges were dropped and he was set free.<br /> <br /> The only man ever formally charged with piracy on the Great Lakes, Seavey eventually was deputized as a U.S. Marshall and tasked with curbing poaching and robbery on Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> Pirates in our region were tough, but they were practical too. They wore knitted wool caps and mittens and sweaters. When the lakes iced over, the sweater-wearing pirates would head home until May.</p>",

Hart Visitor Center houses brochures, books, park passes, and all the sound advice you'll need to plan your visit to this special place.<br /> <br /> Named after the U.S. Senator who was the driving force and whose determination and work brought about the legislature to create the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, the center has displays of Sleeping Bear Dune's natural history, fauna and flora, geology, history, and stories about people of the park.<br /> <br /> Brochures and maps are available to help you make the most of your time at the park, which covers 71,000 acres and includes 35 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline, the big dune, scenic drives, more than 100 miles of marked hiking trails, campgrounds, and North and South Manitou islands.<br /> <br /> Stop by and pick up a brochure, ask park rangers questions, pick up a souvenir, or take in the park movie.</p> <h3>Who was Phillip A. Hart?</h3> <p>Philip A. Hart was a U.S. Senator representing Michigan from 1959 - 1976. He was born in Bryn Mawr, PA in 1912. He graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, DC in 1934 and from the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor in 1937 and was admitted to the Michigan Bar in 1938.<br /> <br /> During World War II he served in the U.S. Army from 1941 until discharged in 1946 as a lieutenant colonel and was wounded during the D-Day assault on Utah Beach in Normandy.<br /> <br /> He served as Michigan Lieutenant Governor 1955 - 1958 and was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1958. He served until his death on December 26, 1976. The third Senate Office Building was named for Senator Hart in 1987.<br /> <br /> Senator Hart was instrumental in the establishment of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Through his tireless efforts, the legislature of the United States of America saw fit to protect the magnificent Sleeping Bear Dunes area in perpetuity.<br /> <br /> \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That (a) the Congress finds that certain outstanding natural features, including forests, beaches, dune formations and ancient glacial phenomena, exist along the mainland shore of Lake Michigan and on certain nearby islands...and that such features ought to be preserved in their natural setting and protected from developments and uses which would destroy the scenic beauty and natural character of the area.\"</p> <h4><strong>The visitor center is a one stop shop to plan like a Park Ranger for a safe and enjoyable trip.</strong></h4>",

Wandering children, stopped vehicles, distracted drivers and pedestrians, when combined with our inattention, can quickly turn an enjoyable drive into a series of serious problems.<br />  </p> <h2>A Note to Bicyclists</h2> <p>The scenic drive is a challenging bicycle tour with some steep uphill and downhill grades. Consider your ability before starting. Ride single file, stay to the right, obey the posted speed limit, keep your bicycle under control on the downhill sections, and watch for vehicles entering exiting the scenic overlooks. Remember: Motorists often have difficulty seeing cyclists. Ride defensively.</p> <h2>Who Was Pierce Stocking?</h2> Pierce Stocking spent his youth working as a lumberman in Michigan's forests. He loved the woods and spent most of his spare time there, developing a self-taught knowledge of nature.<br /> <br /> He used to walk the bluffs above Lake Michigan, awed by the views of the dunes, Lake Michigan, and the islands. He wanted to share this beauty with others and conceived the idea of a road to the top of the dunes.<br /> <br /> As a lumberman, he had built roads in difficult terrain before. The planning for the road began in the early 1960s, and in 1967, the road, then known as the Sleeping Bear Dunes Park, first opened to the public.<br /> <br /> Stocking continued to operate the scenic drive until his death in 1976. In 1977, the road became part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Several years later, based on public opinion, the drive was named the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive.",

From the trails, however, they're steep hills.Â </p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year? Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> **Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!**<br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> **Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites**<br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks. Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> After being outdoors<br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:<br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> If you are bitten by a tick<br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> Watch for signs of illness.</p>",

Listen to the water lapping the shore and watch the ducks as you stroll along the scenic, hardened-surface river walk. You can launch your float down the Platte River from the carry-in access point adjacent to the river walk, or fish from one of the decks over the river's edge, or just sit on a bench and take it all in.</p> <p>Above the river, the Platte River Picnic Area is equipped with accessible parking, restrooms, picnic shelters, and raised grills.</p> <h3>Paddling the Platte</h3> <p>Cooling off with a relaxing float on a tube or raft down the Platte River on a hot summer day is one of the most popular recreational activities in the Lakeshore to beat the heat of summer.

It's a wonderful place to take a quick dip if it's a hot day.</p> <p>You can either bring your own tube, raft, air mattress, etc. or you can rent them from local outfitters. If you need to rent during the height of the summer season, you will want to plan ahead and get reservations.</p> <p><strong>From the Platte River Picnic Area water access</strong>, you can float a **one-hour loop** to just above Loon Lake and then carry your tube for a 10-minute walk back to your car.</p> <p>If you want the full paddling experience, a <strong>2-and a half-hour plus float</strong> will take you all the way from the picnic area water access to Lake Michigan. Put in along the ramp and drift down the pristine river, through Loon Lake (you'll have to paddle across the lake), past the fish weir and El Dorado, through beautiful sand dunes, all the way to the mouth of the Platte River. You will need to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.</p> <p>You can also put in at the <strong>fish weir</strong> just below Loon Lake for a <strong>2-hour float</strong> to the mouth of the Platte. In this case, you will have to carry your tube about 1/4 mile from the road to the river along a gravel road to the fish weir and shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.</p> <p>Offering a nice, easy, <strong>1-mile float</strong> to Lake Michigan, a parking lot, and toilet, <strong>El Dorado</strong> is another popular put-in for tubers. You will have to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.</p> <p>During the height of summer, the river is busy. And from late June through August, it can be like â€˜bumper boats' with all the kayaks, canoes, and tubes going down the lazy river. Pick a warm day in early summer or September, and you'll have it pretty much to yourself. Fall floats on the river can be quite scenic and a great time to see a lot of fish!</p> <h3>Platte River Fishing Weir</h3> <p>Floating down the gentle flowing Platte you will pass through the State of Michigan's fish weir: an obstruction in the river with gates that can be raised and lowered to stop the migrating salmon from going up stream in the fall. The weir is in operation from the middle of August until October. When the salmon are running, the DNR uses the weir to harvest the fish, and their eggs are used at their hatcheries. During these months, you must portage around the weir. The best times to see returning adult salmon in the Platte River are from mid September to late October at the lower weir.</p> <h3>Paddle Safe</h3> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p> <p><strong>Clean Your Boats</strong><br /> Please clean, drain, and dry your boat after you leave any body of water, especially Lake Michigan, to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. This is especially important for our inland lakes.</p> <p>For more information on aquatic invasive species and their impacts to lakes, streams, and how we recreate please visit the following websites:</p> <p>www.protectyourwaters.net<br /> www.nps.gov/slbe/naturescience/nonnativespecies.htm</p>",

        "notes": "Platte River Point Beach\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/platte-river-point-beach.htm\n\n<p>This sublime area where the Platte River flows into Lake Michigan is a busy place during the hot summer days. The finish line for Platte River tubers and paddlers means a bustling parking lot, but you're a short walk away from bathing in the shallows of the river or taking a plunge in the depths of Lake Michigan. The river is shallow and flows rapidly at this point, and kids love swimming and floating in the current and wave action that occurs where the waters merge. The awe-inspiring views of Empire Bluffs and Sleeping Bear Point are just icing on the cake.<br /> <br /> <b>NO pets are allowed on this beach.</b><br /> <br /> Many consider this beach to be the best in the park to watch shorebirds. The Audubon Society has designated the area an Important Bird Area (IBA). During the summer look for piping plovers, spotted sandpipers, killdeer, and also Caspian terns.<br /> A popular plover nesting area, sections of the shoreline are often closed (see below). Watch and enjoy plovers from a distance. You can walk the shoreline around fencing. Don't leave food on the beach or feed gulls and animals who may prey on piping plovers.<br /> <br /> <b>Where should I park?</b><br /> Parking lots fill during busy summer months. The Park Service has two lots on the north and south sides of Lake Michigan Road. The south side is equipped with cell-phone coverage, accessible parking, restrooms with running water, accessible dressing rooms and raised charcoal grills. The automated fee station is at the south lot.<br /> Lake Township Park, owned by Benzie County, is just west of the south lot and has a picnic area in addition to parking. A township user fee is required.</p> <h3>Ever changing shoreline</h3> <p>An active dune field has grown at the mouth of the Platte River to form Platte River Point, and the beach is a sandy gravel becoming increasingly sandy to the north. The beach is wide near the point, with a grassy dune field extending back to the forest. During the summer months, small nearshore sandbars migrate onshore and join the existing the beach, causing it to widen. The same sand will be carried offshore again in fall storms. The shoreline is constantly being sculpted by waves and breaking-wave swash which forms a variety of patterns, and often concentrates thin layers of heavy minerals. Bring a magnet to the beach, and you will be able to separate magnetite (the dark-colored sand) from the other high-density minerals.</p> <h3>Early campers</h3> <p>We aren't the first people to be drawn to the beauty and fun of Platte River Point. Turns out the Platte River has been a hot spot for camping for a very long time. Archeological investigations have shown that small groups of closely related individuals from the Woodland Period (600 B.C. to 1620 A.D.) paid short visits to the area. They may have been a family traveling to their winter hunting grounds, or a group of hunters on an extended trip, or a group that came to gather wild plants and berries. No matter why they stopped to camp, I'll bet it was a highlight of their travels!</p> <h3>Enjoy the Beach Safely</h3> <p><strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> <br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Beach fires</strong><br /> Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!<br /> <br /> <strong>Take care around plover nesting area</strong><br /> Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</strong><br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is aÂ threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.Â <br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Swim safe</strong><br /> The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.<br /> <br /> <strong>Be alert for rip currents</strong><br /> Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.<br /> <br /> <strong>Paddle safe</strong><br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p> <h3>Lake Michigan Pirates: Roaring Dan Seavey</h3> <p>Lake Michigan's eastern shoreline is a paradise treasured by tourists and recreationists. But during the periods of western expansion, the upper Great Lakes region was a very dangerous place. Up until the mid-1800s, a wild west mentality ruled the Great Lakes. The lakes were a source for all kinds of smuggling, poaching, and piracy. Pirates sailed the waters stealing beaver pelts, timber, and sometimes entire ships. One notable pirate was Roaring Dan Seavey, a man that would sail out into the lakes and plunder wherever and whatever he could.<br /> <br /> Seavey and a small crew would silently slip his schooner, the Wanderer, with no running lights, into ports in the dead of night and make off with anything on wharves, in unlocked warehouses, or on nearby streets-cattle, hay, leather goods, fruit--anything of value and could be carried on the schooner.<br /> <br /> Known for his monumental acts of drinking, brawling, whoring, poaching, and stealing, Seavey also practiced moon cussing: a pirate trick of rearranging or removing or putting up fake port lights so that ships coming in would crash on the rocks. Then, his crew would board the ship and steal the cargo. He earned most of his money from poaching venison and stealing. He also ran an offshore casino and brothel.<br /> <br /> Seavey's biggest heist was stealing the 40-ft schooner Nellie Johnson in Grand Haven, Michigan. As the story goes, he gained the trust of the Nellie Johnson's crew and captain and came aboard with booze and drank them all under the table. When the crew was passed out, he and his crew removed them from the schooner and set sail for Chicago to sell the cedar posts onboard. Unable to sell anything and being discovered as a pirate, Seaver took the Nellie Johnson and fled up the coast of Lake Michigan. He eluded federal authorities for two weeks but was captured near Frankfort. He was taken back to Chicago where he claimed he won the ship in a poker game. The ship's real captain never showed up, so charges were dropped and he was set free.<br /> The only man ever formally charged with piracy on the Great Lakes, Seavey eventually was deputized as a U.S. Marshall and tasked with curbing poaching and robbery on Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> Pirates in our region were tough, but they were practical too. They wore knitted wool caps and mittens and sweaters. When the lakes iced over, the sweater-wearing pirates would head home until May.</p>",

There was no indoor plumbing at the school; they used the outhouse or privy, with its trademark crescent moon cutout on the door. A hand pump in the schoolyard still provides water. Students planted the row of sugar maples along the southern edge of the school yard to celebrate Arbor Day many years ago. They were tapped by the Kelderhouses to make maple syrup.<br /> <br /> Several generations of Port Oneidans attended the school. To prevent any \"problems,\" boys sat on one side of the room and girls on the other, and there were separate coat rooms for boys and girls. A framed image of George Washington hung on the wall as inspiration.<br /> <br /> During recess, everyone played together. According to one former student, \"We all went out, we played together...everybody played the game. It didn't matter whether you were playing ball or playing keep-away, or run-sheep-run, or anything like that. Everybody played together.\"<br /> <br /> And snow days? Not back then. \"When we'd have a blizzard, my dad would hook up the horses to the sled, and bring out the big blankets, and we'd get underneath the blankets, and here he's sitting up there driving the horses, and we kids are underneath the blankets keeping warm, and he'd take us to school.\"<br /> <br /> Not just a schoolhouse, the school was also a central gathering place of the community after the store near the dock closed around 1900. After the school consolidated with the Glen Arbor School in the early 1940s, the building was used as the meeting place for the Port Oneida Community.</p>",

With a spur to a lookout point high over Lake Michigan. Lookout point is about 0.6 miles from the trailhead</p> <p><strong>Terrain</strong><br /> Hilly</p> <p><strong>Vegetation</strong><br /> Beech-maple forest, fields and pine plantation</p> <p><strong>Trailhead</strong><br /> A vault toilet is available at the trailhead.<br /> <br /> <strong>Comments</strong><br /> Trail leads to a lookout at the top of Pyramid Point. To protect the bluff from erosion and for your safety, do not descend the bluff. Note that the last portion of the trail Basch Road. Watch for traffic. </p> <p><br /> <strong>More details</strong><br /> In an area of the state known for its stunning panoramas of sand dunes, islands, and the many blues of Lake Michigan, Pyramid Point is one of the best. The 2.6-mile trail traverses three diverse landscapes: old farm fields and meadows, century-old beech-maple forests, and the high bluffs overlooking the lake.<br /> <br /> Hike 0.6 miles to the overlook and take in the awe inspiring views of Lake Michigan, the Manitou Islands, and sometimes a Great Lakes freighter. Find the North Manitou Shoal Light-or \"the Crib\"- protecting the passage from a dangerous shoal. It often looks like a large white sail on the lake. Varying depths and shoals create beautiful shades of blues and greens in Lake Michigan. The hike up to the point is fairly easy and appropriate for all ages.<br /> <br /> Going down the steep dune to the water's edge is not advised. It's farther down than it looks (you can't actually see the bottom from the top).<br /> <br /> Most people hike to the the lookout for the view and then return, a 1.2-mile round trip. Continue on the trail and you'll find yourself off the beaten path. Explore the length of this trail and you will be rewarded with gorgeous views, large sand bowls to wander through, meadows of wildflowers, and shaded, leafy forests. You'll often have the trail to yourself. The last 0.4 miles of the loop follows Basch Road, a quiet dirt road.<br /> <br /> There is a connector trail between posts, numbered 2 and 3. This connector shortens the trail to 2 miles. At the end, be careful on Basch Road as you return to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> A vault toilet is available at trailhead.</p> <h4>Hike Safely</h4> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> <br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.</p> <h4>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</h4> <p>Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</h4> <p>Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks. Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <em>After being outdoors</em><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:<br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <br /> <em>If you are bitten by a tick</em><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> Watch for signs of illness.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h4> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year?

        "name": "Riggs Cottage",
        "notes": "Riggs Cottage\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/riggs-cottage.htm\n\n<p>The Riggs Cottage was built in 1924 for Margaret Riggs who was a frequent guest at Katie Shepard's hotel. Although the exterior form of the Riggs cottage resembles a small, one-story, front gable and-ell dwelling, its interior room arrangement mimics that of the Cottage Row dog-trot houses. Instead of a full front verandah, however, the Riggs cottage has only a small, arch-roofed hood that projects over the stoop.<br /> <br /> Margaret Londergan, who was William Angeli's personal secretary, purchased Margaret Riggs' cottage in 1947. Londergan and her daughter, Jean, had spent summers on the island since 1937. Each summer, Londergan traveled to the island with Angell in order to assist him in the management of the MIA and other business matters.<br /> <br /> A garage and a privy were located behind the house. The house lacked an indoor bathroom until the late 1950s. Ornamental vegetation includes large spruce trees in front of the house, a clump of snowberry at the edge of the bluff, and a ruinous well house below. A cluster of fruit trees extends across the western portion of the lot.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",

From 1901 to 1915, surfmen gave aid not only to mariners and shipwreck victims, but also to civilians living on the island. The USLSS reports for South Manitou reveal that surfmen often used their boats to take gravely ill islanders to the mainland doctor or to bring the doctor to the island. They also helped put out fires at farm houses and on board ships, provided basic first aid, and rescued people and animals from drowning.<br /> <br /> USLSS Keepers and Surfmen became members of the island's close-knit community. The station house only provided housing for the Keeper and his family and the single men of the crew. Many island residents turned to the USLSS for work when jobs in logging and farming began to decline. Often, family members served on the USLSS crews together and over time, some families had a several generations of men that served the USLSS.</p> <h3>Surfmen stories</h3> <p><strong>Gerald Crowner</strong><br /> Gerald E. Crowner served as a surfman for the United States Coast Guard on South Manitou Island from 1926 to 1928. He published a memoir, The South Manitou Story, of his time on the island in 1982. His book is filled with short stories, poems, and photos that bring his service on the island to life for readers today.<br /> <br /> <strong>The South Patrol on a Windy Fall Night</strong><br /> by Gerald E. Crowner<br /> <br /> <strong>I walked alone<br /> one starlit<br /> windy night<br /> and saw the clouds,<br /> like stately galleons<br /> pass in flight,<br /> eclipsing the star-beams<br /> with shadowy grace,<br /> as they twinkled<br /> and sparkled<br /> through unending space.<br /> And the surf<br /> came in blasting,<br /> with crests flying high,<br /> like the manes of wild horses<br /> against the dark sky.<br /> And over my soul<br /> came a glorious peace,<br /> as I walked<br /> in the starlight<br /> beside turbulent seas.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>John F. Tobin</strong><br /> John F. Tobin lived on South Manitou Island as a boy. His grandfather, John K. Tobin, served in both the Coast Guard and the Lighthouse Service on South Manitou. John's father, Harold, was born on the island and served at the Coast Guard station there until WWII. While Harold served in the war, John F. and his family moved off of the island. In 2010, John F. was interviewed for an oral history project at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. He shared stories about growing up on South Manitou, attending school, and playing pranks. He was a self-proclaimed \"stinker\" and \"rascal\" during his boyhood days! In this interview clip, John describes the life-saving drills practiced by the Coast Guard, the Navy visiting on the Fourth of July, and the trouble he got into playing with black powder.</p> <h3>U.S. Life-Saving Service</h3> <p>Congress established the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) in 1871 in an effort to reduce the number of lives lost on the oceans and the Great Lakes due to shipwrecks. The surfmen of the USLSS became known as \"storm warriors\" and \"storm fighters.\" Their unofficial motto was, \"you have to go out, but you don't have to come back.\" USLSS crews braved perilous conditions to save shipwreck victims from certain doom.<br /> <br /> The narrow Manitou passage, which runs between the islands and the mainland, is one of the most dangerous on the Great Lakes. Ships have to make several turns here, and because of the shoals surrounding the islands, `they fell asleep. At night, surfmen patrolled the beaches. Each station handled beach patrol a little differently. If stations were fairly close to each other, surfmen on beach patrol carried a small medallion, called a check, which was inscribed with the name of his station and his number. During beach patrol, the surfman hiked down the beach the required distance, up to four or five miles, where he met a surfman from the neighboring station and they exchanged checks. Each surfman turned the check into their Keeper in the morning as a way to prove that he had completed his patrol. Other stations, especially isolated stations such as South Manitou, used time clocks in order to prove that surfmen completed their patrols. A surfman would carry the small clock on a strap over his shoulder as he made their way down the beach. At the end of the patrol was a wooden post in the sand containing a key. The surfman inserted the key into the clock, which recorded the time on a roll of paper. Not only did this prove that surfmen completed their patrols, but also that patrols were completed on time.<br /> <br /> The crew also responsible for maintaining the station; this included keeping it clean. Every morning they cleaned the lamps and lanterns and trimmed and filled them. They swept the hallways; filled wood boxes; swept sidewalks; cleaned cuspidors and ash trays; dusted the stairway; and made their beds neat and smooth. On Saturdays, or scrub day, all station floors were scrubbed, windows washed, and brass polished.<br /> <br /> Surfmen also kept the buildings and equipment gleaming. Maintenance of buildings usually meant repainting the buildings and cutting and splitting wood (enough wood for the two kitchen ranges and two wood burners in the station). But when needed, expanded to renovation tasks like putting on new roofs, laying new flooring, building new outhouses, and even laying new sod (and watering that sod).<br /> <br /> The main duty of the Service was the protection of life and property on the water. But local citizens often looked to the crew when they needed help. An annual report from 1895 lists some of these \"Miscellaneous Services\": surfmen rigging the rope on the flagstaff of the county building, extinguishing 21 fires in homes or buildings, catching a runaway horse, repairing a wagon owned by two ladies who were kept out of the rain at the station while the surfmen worked on their buggy, finding a child lost in the woods, helping sick people get home. And once, helping a farmer get his horse out of a well.</p> <h3>Living at the USLSS</h3> <p>The crew spent most of their down time on the first floor (the sleeping quarters upstairs wasn't heated). The crew's quarters served as a lounging room. According to Gerald Crowner a surfman on South Manitou in 1926, \"A round oak table stood by the east window with a big oil lamp suspended over it. Near the table was a wall bookcase full of books that were seldom read. In the southeast corner stood the little stand that harbored our Monkey Ward record player and the pile of records that were so often played. The big wood burner occupied a space near the south wall, near the door that led to the hallway. Rows of hooks also lined the west wall, where one could hang up coats and caps. Six or eight chairs were lined up under the double window on the north wall that faced the bay.\"<br /> <br /> In the fall and winter months, the monotony of long cold months was broken up by sharing stories and tall tales around the wood burner. Neighbors often stopped in to add their tales. Mail days were happy days. They all looked forward to letters from home, friends, and sweethearts and often gathered at the post office at mail time waiting for the letters to be sorted.<br /> <br /> Many of the surfmen had their own, small houses nearby. This allowed them to be with their families. The surfmen had one day off every 8 days, otherwise they were on duty 24 hours a day. Regulations required the men to sleep at the station except for their day off. But some keepers were more lenient allowing men to stay in their cottages near the station where they could be called quickly to come in an emergency. This allowed the men to people spend a little more time at home.<br /> <br /> There was a telephone cable that snaked its way from Sleeping Bear Point through South Manitou on to the North Manitou Lighthouse and Coast Guard Station and homes. Gerald Crowner a South Manitou surfman in 1926 tells us, \"One of the crewmen on North Manitou played the mouth organ, and he played it beautifully. Quite often, he would call me when I had the midnight to two watch and play songs for me. He could play just about everything in the book. . . .Many times I would call Sleeping Bear Point, and he would call the operator at Maple City, and all of us would enjoy his music and carry on a four-way conversation.\"</p>",

Check out the Shauger Hill Trail. It starts at the Scenic Drive's adjacent parking lot (just after turning off M109 and before the ranger booth) and loops through hilly, quiet woods. Shauger Hill doesn't access water or overlooks of Lake Michigan, but it's a shady escape on a hot summer day, and is especially beautiful in the fall.<br /> <br /> <b>Pets are NOT allowed on the trail from December 1 to March 31.</b><br /> <br /> The trail, an easy loop taken in an overall clockwise direction without difficult uphill sections, is about 2.4 miles and crosses the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive (paved) twice and also Shauger Hill Road (unpaved) twice.<br /> <br /> A 1.5 mile hike along the unpaved Shauger Hill Road will lead you to a swim at North Bar Lake and Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> The Shauger Hill trail winds through mature beech-maple hardwood forests with birches fluttering gracefully in the occasional clearing. In the clockwise direction, about .3 miles from the trailhead is a beautiful large stand of mature beech. Among the maples are a number of striped maples as well as the more commonly seen red and sugar maples.<br /> <br /> Shauger Hill's wildflowers are best in the spring before the forest canopy leafs over; look for the many black raspberry bushes lining the beginning of the trail. Pick a handful to enjoy along the way.<br /> <br /> <b>Skiing Shauger Hill</b><br /> Skiers are advised to take the trail in reverse, starting from the ski trail sign at the parking lot. The downhill sections in the clockwise direction are advanced and steep and some have cut logs from trail clearings just off-trail around the bases of some of the hills.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year? Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> <br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</strong><br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks. Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <strong>After being outdoors</strong><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:<br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <br /> <strong>If you are bitten by a tick</strong><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> Watch for signs of illness.<br />  </p>",

        "notes": "Shingle Mill\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/shingle-mill.htm\n\n<p>Lumbering is an important component of the island's human history. The North Manitou Island Sawmill is a rare, intact example of a steam-powered lumber mill in Michigan and stands as a symbol to the island lumber industry that built two villages and brought entrepreneurs to the island and left cleared fields and forty-two miles of roads behind.<br /> <br /> The latest sawmill on the island, built in the late 1920s, was built with traditional technology of the earlier mills. The engine and equipment date from 1875, and the method of construction and layout are typical of sawmills of the late 1800s. Steam powered mills of this type, which were once common in this area, are now rare.<br /> <br /> The sawmill supplied material for building the large east side barn in 1927-28, as well as providing a continuous supply of timber and heavy planks to maintain the docks, often damaged by ice in the winter and pounding waves during storms. When MIA was expanding the island into a sportsman paradise, it put the mill back into operation: the lodge was remodeled, and a wing housing the grocery store and post office was added; the village barn was also built for dressing and packaging deer shot on the island. The mill remained active, turning out material for all island building projects including rental cottages for married staff, migrant orchard workers' cabins, and many, many shingles. The machinery was antiquated, even by 1940 standards.</p> <h3>Island deer and early deer hunts</h3> <p>Of all the wildlife located on North Manitou, the white-tailed deer is what you are most likely to see. In 1926, William R. Angell introduced six deer to the island. These few deer became the basis for a rapidly expanding herd which supported a hunting preserve for many years.<br /> <br /> The first deer hunt on North Manitou took place in 1937 with 18 deer taken. By counts in the early 1980s, there were about 2,000 deer on the island. Because there were so many deer, they would constantly browse the vegetation within their reach. Over the years, the deer have eaten off all the vegetation which was palatable to them and left that which was not. They don't really care for American beech, so you can find it growing in great abundance on the ground. The vegetation on South Manitou Island is different than that on North Manitou. South Manitou has a thick lush understory of shrubs, ferns, and vines. But the deer browse line on North Manitou is five to six feet up, giving the island a manicured look.<br /> <br /> Edgar McKee, island manger from 1937 to 1942, often served as a hunting guide (and was the guide when the first deer was shot in the fall of 1937), describes the early deer hunts. \"Hunting was divided into two, three-day sessions each week, starting around Nov 1. It would cost each hunter $150, which covered the boat trip to and from the Island, hotel and meals, a trained guide to hunt with, and a guaranteed deer. Sounds cheap, but back then that was a lot of money.<br /> <br /> The island was divided into ten sections. Each guide explored his section in advance, and knew where to find the deer. Only ten hunters were allowed to hunt at one time, and no hunter was allowed out without a guide. This was to assure safety. Also, not hunter was allowed out with a gun if there was any evidence of alcohol impairment.\"<br /> <br /> Most of the island's hunting customers were officials of large companies, invited guests of MIA members. \"None of the hardships of hunting and taking care of your deer existed then. The hunter was transported to his hunting spot and picked up at the appointed time. The hunter's job was to shoot the deer his guide pointed out to him. The guide took care of preparing the deer and dragging it to the appointed spot to be picked up.\"<br /> <br /> \"Not every hunter took home a deer. During my stay on the Island, most of the hunters killed their deer, but some didn't. It was my job to keep hanging a few choice bucks and does to supply that need. That was no problem. I would take my rifle in the company station wagon with a couple of guides, and drive through the woods. Most of the deer I shot, I shot from the window of the car. It was not unusual to take in four or five deer in on afternoon.\"<br /> <br /> North Manitou Island functioned as an exclusive hunting preserve, much in the tradition of the private hunting clubs that became popular with wealthy men during the late nineteenth century.<br /> <br /> Deer hunt still occurs in November managed under the NPS. But, unlike the hunts of Mr. McKee's time, hunters are on their own and have to find and move their deer themselves.</p>",

D.H. Day himself married the daughter of the innkeeper and lived in the second story for a while. In addition to Day and his family, the inn hosted an eclectic mix of lumberjacks, dock workers, businessmen and posh passengers. But these two types of guests were kept apart. The inn was divided into two sections: the visitors or vacationers occupied the better rooms at the front the workmen and lumbermen occupied the crowded upstairs and rear. Management even staggered meal times so that the two types of guest would rarely interact.<br /> <br /> The inn provided three good meals a day with pancakes their specialty: plain, blueberry, and strawberry. The inn did not provide alcohol (alcohol was never permitted in lumber camps because it disrupted worker's efficiency). Travelers were required to abide by those rules also. But, there is a story told about a locomotive operator forgetting to flip a switch and driving the engine right off the dock into Lake Michigan because he was inebriated.<br /> <br /> In 1928 a major renovation modified the Inn, enclosing the porch and adding a wooden stairway in the rear, the two red brick fireplaces, and interior bathrooms. These improvements allowed tourism to live on even after other area industries closed. The Sleeping Bear Inn closed in 1972.<br /> <br /> Look for a sign, high on the east facing wall, that states \"Erected in 1857.\" That was the date the original builder and proprietor, Charles C. McCartey began his many business ventures, not the date of the Inn's actual construction.<br /> <br /> A wayside outside the inn entitled, \"Smell the pancakes?\" tells of the inn's history.</p>",

It started with a 1934 Ford which took four people out to the crest of the dunes and back. It was a thrilling 35-minute ride that took passengers to the crest of the dunes and back for 25 cents each. By the time the rides ended in 1978, there were 13 dunes wagons each carrying 14 passengers on a 12 mile, 35-minute excursion.<br /> <br /> The rides were treated as both a thrill ride and an informational tour. After several years, dunesmobile rides began to attract attention from all around the Midwest. For over 40 years the Dunesmobiles rode over one of the most breathtaking landscapes in the world, bringing those too young, old, or lazy to walk closer to the spectacular beauty of the Sleeping Bear.<br /> <br /> Everyone wanted to be a dunesmobile driver; many past drivers remember it as their favorite job. These chauffeurs were hired to drive the vehicles and ensure that no foolhardy risks were taken. The Sand Dunes Rides operated from Glen Haven and were headquartered at the general store.

Sleeping Bear Point offers a little bit of everything: woods, dunes, water; shaded and more exposed areas; and beauty, beauty, beauty. While trekking the 2.8-mile loop through the sand of the Sleeping Bear Dune plateau is work, it is not nearly as long or strenuous for young children as the Dune trail from the Dune Climb. Take a dip in the cooling waters of Lake Michigan after your hike and add a visit to the Maritime Museum, and you have a great family afternoon in the park.<br /> <br /> Spectacular in every season, with easy-to-follow blue-tipped trail markers, the trail rewards hikers with fantastic views of the dunes, Lake Michigan (Sleeping Bear Bay up to Pyramid Point on the right (east and north) and Platte Bay on the left (south) and across the Manitou Passage to North and South Manitou Islands. Give yourself plenty of time to stop and gaze.<br /> <br /> The trail then cuts inland onto the dune plateau and through a ghost forest. Winds, weather, logging, and other disruptions have resulted in some dune \"blowouts\" resulting in the parabolic shapes in the dunes. The trail continues to move inland and eventually leaves the dunes all together and then cuts into a beautiful lush green forest.<br /> <br /> Don't underestimate this short hike. Walking in sand can be strenuous and in the middle of the summer, sunglasses, a wide-brimmed hat, suntan lotion, and a quart of water are needed to survive the desert-like heat that radiates off the dunes. Drinking water is available just down the road at either the Maritime Museum, the Cannery parking lot, or the modern restrooms and drinking fountain in Glen Haven.<br /> <br /> While about 75% of hikers hike the trail loop counterclockwise, many say going clockwise is a somewhat less strenuous path-and saves the views for last!<br /> About 1/3 mile (.5 km) from the trailhead, going counterclockwise, there is a half mile (0.8 km) spur trail which goes to Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> <strong>What is a ghost forest?</strong></p> <p>The sand that makes up the landscape of the Sleeping Bear plateau is constantly moving. You may not notice this phenomenon one day to the next, but year after year the tiny quartz grains shift little by little. Constant winds blowing off of Lake Michigan cause the dunes to migrate and expand, and for new dunes to grow.Â <br /> <br /> Over time, the drifting and accumulating sand engulfs whatever is in its path, including trees. When migrating sand moves into a wooded area, it gradually buries andÂ kills the trees. As the years pass and the sand continues on its journey, the trees are eventually uncovered. Those that remain standing appear as ghosts-dead, white, and stripped of their branches.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year? Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> <br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation.

        "name": "South Manitou Boat House & Contact Station",
        "notes": "South Manitou Boat House & Contact Station\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/south-manitou-boat-house-contact-station.htm\n\n<p>The USLSS built the boat house in 1901. A wooden ramp with metal rails leads from the front of the boathouse down to a slip at the water's edge. Surfmen pushed the surfboat on its metal carriage down the ramp and into the harbor. From there, they could row or sail to ships in distress.</p> <h3>Life-Saving Equipment</h3> <p>Surfmen had a variety of life-saving equipment at their disposal. According to regulation, if one method of rescue failed surfmen were required to attempt all other available forms of rescue. Weekly drills ensured that all surfmen became proficient at using life-saving equipment. Their hard work paid off-the USLSS had an overall 99% success rate.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boats</strong><br /> Generally, the USLSS used two types of rescue boats-the lifeboat and the surfboat. The lifeboat was an English invention adopted by the USLSS. Lifeboats were self-bailing and self-righting. They could be sailed or rowed. Lifeboats were long and heavy; some measured as long as 40 feet and weighed up to 4,000 pounds! Other advantages of this boat included its stability, sturdiness, and ability to handle heavy seas. However, the weight also made the boat almost impossible to haul down the beach; instead, it had to be launched from the boathouse directly into a sheltered harbor. Later models of lifeboats were lighter and even motorized. With the addition of a motor, surfmen could travel to wrecks farther away and get there faster and with much less energy than rowing required.<br /> <br /> Surfmen also used surfboats, an American invention. Surfboats were smaller, lighter, and faster than their English counterparts. These boats sat on a carriage that surfman could haul down beaches and over dunes in order to get as close to a wreck as possible before launching directly into rough surf. The Keeper steered and the surfmen rowed. Surfboats could also carry more shipwreck victims than lifeboats, anywhere from 10-15 victims. One disadvantage was that the first surfboats were not self-righting, only self-bailing. Like the lifeboat, later models were also motorized.<br /> <br /> Eventually, most USLSS stations had both a lifeboat and a surfboat. Surprisingly, in many instances boats were not the surfmen's preferred method of rescue. Instead, surfmen and station Keepers often preferred to use breeches buoys and lifecars to rescue shipwreck victims. These methods of rescue both relied on one of the only guns designed to save lives-the Lyle gun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lyle Gun</strong><br /> The USLSS recruited Lt. David Lyle, an Army Ordnance officer, to design a gun that would aid in shipwreck rescues. Lyle invented small, bronze cannon that sat on a wooden carriage. Depending on size, the cannon and carriage together weighed about 160 pounds. The Lyle gun and other rescue equipment were stored on a cart that the surfmen could pull down the beach, close to the wreck. Surfmen tied a line to an eye bolt screwed onto the end of a cast iron projectile and then loaded it into the cannon. A charge of black powder, up to 8 ounces, shot the projectile and line 250 to almost 700 yards. The goal was to shoot the line over a wreck so that it could be used to haul a series of other lines from the beach. Shipwreck victims attached the heaviest of these lines, the hawser, to the mast (or the sturdiest part of the wreck) while surfmen back on the beach propped up the line with a crotch. Next, surfmen could attach a breeches buoy or a lifecar to the line and haul it out to the wreck.<br /> <br /> <strong>Breeches Buoy</strong><br /> Once the surfmen set up the hawser line, they could attach a breeches buoy and send it out to the wreck. This was also referred to as the beach apparatus. The breeches buoy itself was a life preserver with a pair of canvas breeches, or shorts, sewn onto the bottom. One by one, shipwreck victims would climb into the breeches buoy and the surfmen on the shore would haul on the line, pulling them over the waves and back to shore. This was the preferred method of rescue because the surfmen stayed on the beach and because the breeches buoy was lighter and easier to haul over the beach than the heavier lifecar.<br /> <br /> <strong>Life car</strong><br /> Several designs of lifecars existed as early as the 1840s. The United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) commonly used Joseph Francis' 1847 lifecar. This iron-covered lifeboat included a deck hatch in the top used by shipwreck victims to climb inside to safety. There was room for four passengers inside this iron life-saving device. Early models were so small that passengers had to lie on top of each other in order to fit; later models were taller so that passengers could sit upright. Once the hatch was closed, the lifecar was water-tight. Two rings on top of the car allowed the heavy hawser line to pass through and surfmen could haul the lifecar to and from the shore. Small holes at the top of the lifecar let air inside. However, it would have been a dark, bumpy, uncomfortable ride.<br /> <br /> Like the breeches buoy, the lifecar had some advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage was that instead of only being able to save one victim at a time, the lifecar had room for 4 or 5 passengers. Passengers were also protected from weather, debris, and waves. However, the weight of the lifecar was a major issue. This 550 pound vessel had to be loaded into the already heavy beach cart and hauled through the sand. Surfmen were totally exhausted by the time they reached the site of the wreck, and they still had to fire the Lyle gun, ready the lifecar, and then haul on the line that pulled it out to the wreck and back.</p> <h3>Shipwreck!</h3> <p>During the heyday of shipping on the Great Lakes, the Manitou Passage served as a busy highway. Faster and safer than sailing around North and South Manitou Islands, this passage acted as a shortcut and also provided access to the deep harbor at South Manitou. Thick fog and bad storms led many ships to seek refuge in South Manitou's harbor. Lighthouses on South Manitou, North Manitou, fog signals, a lightship, and a shoal light helped guide mariners through the passage. However, the passage was also dangerous because of shallow shoals where ships could run aground. The surfmen of the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) and later the United States Coast Guard (USCG) responded to hundreds of ships in distress. Read more about some of these incidents below.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Walter L. Frost</em></strong><br /> On November 4, 1903 a night thick with fog, the steamer Walter L. Frost sounded distress signals when it ran aground on the southwest end of South Manitou Island. The island's USLSS crew launched their surfboat and made their way to the wreck where they attempted to free the boat by removing some of her cargo. When that failed, two tug boats attempted to tow her out, which also failed. Finally, worsening weather made freeing the steamer too dangerous and the 21 member crew abandoned her and took refuge at the Life-Saving station. The steamer and most of her cargo of corn and general merchandise were a total loss.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Congress</strong></em><br /> On October 4, 1907, the surfmen at the USLSS station on South Manitou Island received a telephone call from the island post office stating that a steamer loaded with lumber was on fire. The Keeper and his crew launched a surfboat and rowed out to the Congress. They were able to tow the steamer away from the dock and save some of the cargo, but were not able to put out the fire. The steamer continued to burn and sank later that night.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Three Brothers</strong></em><br /> The steamer Three Brothers was bound from Boyne City, MI to Chicago, IL with a load of lumber when it began taking on water during a storm. On the night of September 27, 1911 the captain ran her aground off of South Manitou Island. All thirteen aboard were saved and spent thirteen days at the South Manitou Island station. Most of the lumber aboard was salvaged, but the damage to the steamer was too expensive to repair, so she was abandoned. Eventually, shifting sand covered the Three Brothers and she became buried shortly after being abandoned. Then in 1996, the sand over the wreck washed away and exposed her for the first time in nearly 85 years! Today, the wreck is a popular dive site and is protected by the Manitou Passage Underwater Preserve.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Fransisco Morazan</strong></em><br /> On November 29, 1960, the Liberian freighter Fransisco Morazan ran aground at the south end of South Manitou Island during a blinding snowstorm. The freighter was bound from Chicago to the St. Lawrence Seaway in order to reach Holland. The crew remained aboard the stranded ship until December 4th, when they finally abandoned her and were taken to Traverse City by the USCG. The captain never returned and today the wreck sits in about 15 feet of water.</p>",

        "notes": "South Manitou Island Cemetery\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/south-manitou-island-cemetery.htm\n\n<p>Some of South Manitou's earliest residents rest eternally in this small cemetery located in the island's interior. A visit here reveals the hardships of life on this remote island. The graves of the Sheridan family-Aaron, Julia, and their son-serve as a reminder of the danger of working and living on Lake Michigan; the family tragically lost their lives in a boating accident. Unexpected history is discovered in the story of Private Andrew T. Burdick-he served in northern Russia at the end of World War I. Here, too visitors learn something about the resilience of islanders. Bertha Peth, beloved by the island children, lived on South Manitou nearly all of her adult life and was known to many as the \"Island Queen.\" Many more untold stories of life on South Manitou Island lay here, waiting for discovery.<br /> The South Manitou Island cemetery is open to the public.</p> <h3>The Sheridan Family</h3> <p>Aaron and Julia Sheridan were both born in New York. They began their married life together on March 21, 1865 in DeKalb, Illinois. Aaron, a wounded Civil War veteran, became Keeper of the South Manitou Island light in 1866. He and Julia started a family on the island, eventually having six sons! After the new 104 foot lighthouse tower was constructed, the Lighthouse Service appointed Julia as the very first Assistant Keeper, making her the only woman to officially serve at the South Manitou Island light. The Sheridan's also owned eighty acres of land on the island near Lake Florence, where they had a small farm.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, tragedy struck the Sheridan family in March of 1878, Julia, Aaron and their youngest son Robert were returning to the island when their boat capsized. All three drowned. The five other Sheridan children went to live with their grandparents in Illinois. Aaron and Julia had lived and worked at the lighthouse for twelve years. Lyman Sheridan, Aaron's cousin, succeeded him as light keeper. Today, descendants of Aaron and Julia often visit the island and work as volunteers. In 2006, the family placed grave stones for Julia, Aaron, and Robert in the island cemetery.</p> <h3>Andrew T. Burdick</h3> <p>Andrew T. Burdick was born on South Manitou Island on November 23, 1889. His parents, Andrew Putnam Burdick and Sarah Ellen Kitchen had been married since 1874. Andrew had six older siblings, five of whom survived to adulthood. His father was a farmer and he and his brothers worked on the farm and went to school at the island's one-room school house. Andrew's oldest brother, James Putnam, worked his way up the ranks at the South Manitou Island lighthouse as a Second Assistant, First Assistant, and eventually the longest-serving Keeper. His brother William also worked as Second and First Assistant. Andrew's father passed away in January 1917, leaving him the head of household on the farm. Later that year in June, Andrew registered for the draft. His draft card reveals that he was unmarried, working as a farmer, and supporting his widowed mother. He described himself as short and of medium build with blue eyes and light hair.<br /> <br /> The United States entered World War I in the spring of 1917. Private Andrew Burdick served in Company B of the 339th Regiment in the U.S. Army's 85th Division. The 85th Division headed to Camp Custer near Battle Creek, Michigan during the summer of 1918 to complete their training before departing for England. Once in England, the men of the 339th were issued Russian weapons and set sail for Archangel, Russia; their mission was unclear-originally, they were only meant to guard military stores. However, their role became much more complicated. While sailing for Archangel, an outbreak of Spanish Influenza had occurred on two out of the three transport ships. When the 339th arrived in Archangel on September 4, 1918, over a hundred men were seriously ill. Andrew Burdick died just fifteen days later on September 19, 1918 of disease at the age of twenty eight. The fall of 1918 marked the start of the worldwide influenza epidemic that claimed the lives of over fifty million people-more than died in World War I.<br /> <br /> Andrew Burdick's regiment went on to become actively engaged in fighting the Bolsheviks, who had overthrown the Russian Czar the previous year. Fighting actually continued past the end of World War I on November 11, 1918. The men of the 85th division became known as the \"Polar Bears\" because of the long winter they spent fighting Bolshevik troops. American troops were not withdrawn from northern Russia until June 1919 and finally returned to Detroit in July. Andrew Burdick was one of over two hundred casualties during the nine months the Polar Bears spent in Russia. He was eventually laid to rest on his peaceful island home.</p> <h3>Bertha Peth</h3> <p>Bertha Peth immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1881 with her parents when she was about seven years old. At some point in the early 1890s, she came to South Manitou Island to work-some people that knew her wrote that Bertha came with a visiting family as a nursemaid for their children; others stated that she was hired by a family on the island. In 1893, at the age of nineteen, she married island farmer John Hutzler in Chicago, Illinois. By 1900, the couple had one child, a son named Stanley. Tragically, Bertha and John lost their son when he was just two years old. He died in Chicago in 1901 after twenty days of illness, possibly of leukemia. Back on the island, rumors began to circulate about the cause of his death and about Bertha. In 1904, John filed for divorce which was granted the following year. Bertha may have stayed in Chicago for a time after the death of her son and divorce, but by 1920 she had returned and was living in a house in the village on South Manitou.<br /> <br /> From the 1920s through the 1940s, Bertha lived in her house in the village and supported herself in a number of ways. She operated a small store from her home, collected and sold wild ginseng, and may have done laundry for the men at the nearby U.S. Coast Guard Station. Former islanders wrote that she and John Hutzler may have helped each other even after they divorced-she baked bread for him and he chopped wood for her. Children that grew up during that time on the island later shared very fond memories of Bertha. Former islanders, like Ronald Rosie, described her as being \"always at a trot\" as she walked around the island, looking for ginseng. Ronald's friend, John Tobin said that he thought the world of Bertha and described her as very motherly, even though she was something of a character. He also mentioned that she \"always had candy.\" Visiting her small store to pick out candy and gum was a treat for school children and many returned to visit her as adults, even after moving off of the island.<br /> According to an article from a Benzie County newspaper published in Charles M. Anderson's memoir of his childhood on the island, Bertha left South Manitou when she was eighty-two. She had injured her eye and the U.S. Coast Guard transported her to the hospital in Frankfort. She then moved into a nursing home on the mainland. Apparently, Bertha had once spent a period of over twenty years on South Manitou without leaving-earning her the nickname of \"Queen of the Island.\" Bertha died in 1953. Her story is still well known by many who visit South Manitou today.</p> <h3>Ronald W. Riker</h3> <p>Ronald Riker arrived on South Manitou Island with his parents, Ed and Esther, and his two older brothers in 1953 when he was just a year and half old. His parents had been hired by William Boals of the Lee Island Company, a group that purchased several farms on the island in the late 1940s and attempted to start a resort business. In addition to tourism, the Lee Island Company also continued some farming and started a small Hereford cattle operation. The Rikers came to work as tenant farmers and raise cattle, but also ran tours of the island for summer visitors. At one point, they were the only year-round residents living on South Manitou.<br /> <br /> When the Riker boys got older, they attended school and lived on the mainland during the school year with their mother, returning to the island in the summer time. Tragically during the summer of 1967, sixteen year old Ronald drowned while exploring the wreck of the Fransisco Morazon with friends. Ed and Esther Riker continued to work for the Lee Island Company until South Manitou Island became a part of the newly-established Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. In 1972, they were the last permanent residents to leave the island. In 2005, Ed and Esther were buried near Ronald in the island cemetery.</p>",

Yet less than a century ago, this island was a bustling logging, farming, and maritime community. Native Americans used South Manitou seasonally for fishing and hunting. They were followed by the first permanent settlers, who began to arrive in the 1830s.<br /> <br /> The island's location along a major shipping channel, the Manitou Passage, and its deep harbor made it a logical place to seek refuge during bad weather. Steamships also needed to refuel with wood cut from the island's forests. Some of South Manitou Island's very first permanent settlers made a living cutting and selling cord word to passing steamships. Logging also soon became a profitable business.<br /> <br /> Once many of the island's hardwood forests were cleared, islanders made a living by farming and fishing. With the increase of commerce and shipping in the area, shipwrecks began to occur at a higher frequency.<br /> <br /> In order to provide aid to mariners, the federal government provided funds for the construction of the first South Manitou Island Lighthouse in 1839 and a United States Life-Saving Service Station in 1901. The men of the Lighthouse and Life-Saving Service and their families quickly became a part of the small island community.<br /> <br /> South Manitou Island was a close-knit, interdependent community. Everyone on the island knew everybody else. Admiral Willard Smith grew up on the island in the 1920s; and according to Admiral Smith, \"growing up on SMI was probably the greatest experience a youngster could have. You had an island with a nice little lake in the middle of it, sand hills and woods, that was your backyard. You could go anyplace you wanted and do anything you wanted to do, and it was a great place to be a small boy.<br /> <br /> The island children liked to watch the beach cart drill, the firing of the little cannon. The children had to stay out of the way as the crew set up the drill, but they would let the children ride down on the beaches buoy once in a while. The surfmen taught the children about signaling, how to tie knots and hand lines, and how to make bow and arrows.</p>",

        "notes": "South Manitou Island Schoolhouse\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/south-manitou-island-schoolhouse.htm\n\n<p>After its construction in 1899, children of farmers, fishermen, surfmen, and lighthouse keepers attended school together in this one room schoolhouse. Wages were low and teachers were charged room and board, but teaching was one of the few occupations open to women on the island.<br /> <br /> The schoolhouse on SMI served as one of the centers of the community. It was here that families gathered for plays, school picnics, and meetings. At Christmas time, the students cut down a tree from the woods nearby and ornamented it with homemade decorations. At recess, they fished in nearby Lake Florence, played ball in the field across from the school house, and had picnics. The schoolhouse was in operation until the early 1940s.</p> <h3>Island Teaching</h3> <p>The young women and men who worked as teachers here were responsible for teaching grades one through eight. Many local teachers, especially women, worked as teachers and lived at home with their parents. Occasionally a teacher from the mainland came to work on the island and boarded with the families of the children that they taught. Teachers had to pump water from the well, split wood, and build a fire in the stove before the students arrived in the morning.<br /> One young teacher, Myrtle Kelderhouse, later wrote of her three years teaching on the island that she acted as a teacher, principal, school nurse, and custodian! Myrtle also wrote: \"What a wonderful place to teach, with nature right at your doorstep-the many beautiful trees, the wild flowers, the farmland, all . surrounded by the beauty of Lake Michigan.\"</p> <h3>Raising the Dickens</h3> <p>Living on a remote island in Lake Michigan posed many challenges for the people that called this place home. But for the children who grew up here, life was something of an adventure! Ronald Rosie, Jr. and John Tobin spent their childhood on South Manitou and were the best of friends. Ron's father served as an Assistant Keeper of the South Manitou Island Lighthouse and Ron lived in the Keeper's Quarters with his parents and his younger brother, Roger. John Tobin's father worked for the United States Coast Guard on the island until World War II began. Ron and John attended school at the island's one-room schoolhouse in the mid-1930s. During their long walks to and from school they picked berries, played games, and stopped at Bertha Peth's house to buy candy from her store. The boys enjoyed fishing in Lake Florence at recess and playing in the wigwam they built across the road from the school. The schoolchildren also had fun putting on school plays at the Coast Guard station; islanders flocked to social events, taking advantage of the opportunity for some entertainment.<br /> <br /> The Coast Guard station provided an almost constant source of entertainment for the children, who often showed up to watch the daily and weekly life-saving drills. One time, John, a self-proclaimed \"stinker\" and \"rascal\" took a bullet from the Coast Guard station and snuck it to school with him the next day. As he sat at his desk, he looked at the lunch pails lined up on top of the wood-burning stove that kept the school warm, and decided that it might \"be kind of interesting\" to see what would happen if he put the bullet in the stove. When his teacher's back was turned, John made a dash for the stove and threw in the bullet. After a moment, it exploded, causing the lids of the lunch pails to fly off and soup and left-over supper splattered all over the room! Years later, John spoke of his adventures with his old pal, Ron and said, \"...me and him played together...I was up there and run them hallways...all over the place, me and Ronald...we'd go down there and raise the dickens.\" He also said: \"...to me, what I remember is we had a lot of fun.\" And they certainly did!</p>",

The house was built by Thomas Thompson, the mail carrier at the time, for his young family. But Thompson drowned in 1910 and left his wife Hattie with two small children in her care. Hattie took over the job as Postmistress, turning her home into the island's post office. To further supplement the family income, she also cooked and cleaned for the men at the nearby Life-Saving Service Station. Hattie remarried and left the island, but the house remained the post office, and in 1923 it also became the island's main general store and a center of activity on the island.<br /> <br /> Although the island residents had gardens and grew their own vegetables and raised cattle, pigs, and chickens for meat and were nearly self-sustaining as far as food was concerned, the island store was still an important fixture. Islanders bought the staples which could not be produced on the island, such as tea, coffee, salt, flour, sugar, molasses, and spices.</p>",

        "notes": "South Manitou Lighthouse Complex\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/south-manitou-lighthouse-complex.htm\n\n<p>For nearly a century, lighthouse keepers kept a light burning at the top of this 104 foot tower to guide mariners through the dangerous Manitou Passage. This passage between the mainland and the Manitou Islands once served as a busy transportation highway for schooners and steamships loaded with cargo and passengers bound for large ports like Chicago and Milwaukee. South Manitou Island also provided the only deep, natural harbor between Chicago and the Straits of Mackinaw where ships could seek shelter during storms. Additionally, the island's dense hardwood forest provided an abundant supply of cordwood for steamships needing to refuel.<br /> <br /> The United States Lighthouse Service recognized the need for a navigational beacon in this hazardous but busy passage and authorized construction of the first South Manitou Island light in 1838. Not much is known about this first building, other than its critical role as the only light in the area for at least a decade. In 1858, construction of a new Keeper's Quarters with a 35 foot tower and a separate fog signal building began. The current lighthouse's construction commenced in 1871 after the Lighthouse Service realized that the island's harbor was one of the most heavily used refuges on the Great Lakes. The 104 foot tower raised the focal plane of the light to 100 feet while the new Third Order Fresnel Lens projected the light 17¾ miles.<br /> <br /> In 1939, the federal government transferred management of all lighthouses to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The USCG ceased operations of the South Manitou Island light in 1958. Today you can climb the 117 steps to the balcony, see the replica Fresnel lens above you, and enjoy a spectacular view of the Manitou Passage and South Manitou Island!<br /> <br /> <b>Hours</b><br /> The South Manitou Island Lighthouse tower is open for tours during the summer months. No admission is charged.</p> <h3>Fresnel Lens</h3> <p>In 1822, French physicist Augustin Fresnel invented a lens that transformed lighthouse technology. This beehive-like lens is comprised of many glass prisms held in place by a brass frame. The lens houses a light which the glass prisms reflect, refract, and magnify. This lens is more effective than an open flame or a light with a reflector behind it; open flames lose 97% of their light, lights with reflectors lose 60-80%, while lights within a Fresnel lens only lose 20%. Prior to the Fresnel lens, the furthest a lighthouse light could be seen was 12 miles. The Fresnel lens increased that distance to a maximum of 20 miles-all the way to the horizon! The size of the lens determines the distance the light can be seen. Originally there were seven orders, or sizes, of Fresnel lenses.<br /> <br /> The Fresnel lens also allowed for lighthouses to be distinguished from one another at night when the tower and accompanying buildings were not visible. The combination of different flash patterns and colored lights gave mariners the ability to know exactly which lighthouse they were passing, and therefore what dangers might lie ahead and where they might be able to take refuge.<br /> <br /> Once the United States Coast Guard decommissioned the South Manitou Island light in 1958, the tower and sat dark and quiet on the shores of South Manitou Island for over 50 years. Luckily in 2009, after a restoration of the lantern room and staircase, and with help from park partners, volunteers and park service staff installed a new lamp and replica lens. Today, you can see the light shine once again from the top of this century-old sentinel every night from May to October.</p> <h3>Outbuildings</h3> <p><strong>Whistle Shed and Fuel Storage</strong><br /> <strong>Whistle Shed</strong><br /> Sometimes the fog rolling in off of Lake Michigan was so thick, mariners could not see the lighthouse or the light. So the Keeper and his assistants used a fog bell and later a fog whistle as a verbal warning to those making their way through the Manitou Passage. The first fog bell was installed in 1839 and was in use until 1874 when the light station received what was possibly the first steam-powered fog signal whistle on the Great Lakes.<br /> <br /> Imagine what it might have been like to live here at the light station on a foggy day. Ronald Rosie, the son of the last lighthouse keeper before the United States Coast Guard assumed responsibility of the light, spoke about the fog horn. He said, \"...you could blow that fog horn for three or four days and we never heard it in the house...we had to listen to see if it was blowing...you got used to it, you didn't pay attention to the darn thing.\"<br /> <br /> <strong>Oil Shed</strong><br /> This small, circular structure is made of metal and was used to store oil and other flammable fuels such as kerosene used to power the lighthouse's lamp. The lighthouse service chose to construct the building out of metal to reduce the risk of fire should the fuel ignite.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fuel Storage/Magazine</strong><br /> This simple brick building with a metal roof was used to store flammable fuel, such as the kerosene used in the lamp housed inside the Fresnel lens. Each morning, the keeper or his assistants filled buckets with kerosene and carried them up the 117 steps to the top of the tower. They refilled the lamp so that it was ready to be lit as the sun was setting that evening. On bad weather days, the lamp might be lit all day and all night, requiring several trips to the fuel storage shed. A Fourth Order Fresnel lens consumed about 5.25 ounces of fuel per hour and a Third Order lens about 7 ounces. Prior to kerosene, whale oil was a common fuel used in the lamps.</p> <h3>Life of a Keeper</h3> <p><strong>Daily Life</strong><br /> From 1840 to 1939, 17 lighthouse keepers and 32 assistants faithfully tended to the South Manitou Island Lighthouse along with help from their families. The life of a lighthouse keeper, though often romanticized, was a difficult job. Keepers and assistants spent most of their time with the very unromantic task of cleaning. They cleaned the glass of the lamp and the prisms of the Fresnel lens every morning. They also had to occasionally polish the lens prisms and the brass framework with special polish.<br /> <br /> Reflectors around the lamp needed dusting and polishing, too. The revolving mechanism and associated clockwork that made the lens rotate had to be cleaned of dust and oiled regularly. The floors and stairs were to be kept clean and free of dust, debris, and residue. Besides this daily and weekly maintenance, keepers were also responsible for painting the lighthouse, inside and out, whenever needed. They also kept the whistle shed, steam whistle, and Keeper's Quarters clean and tidy. Other mundane, but necessary duties include keeping track of all supplies used (including food and household items, such as soap) on a daily basis in order to report back to the Lighthouse Service.<br /> <br /> All of these tasks were necessary to keep the light burning bright all night long and during foul weather. The true job of keepers and assistants was to keep mariners safe, after all. Because of this, the light itself was almost always constantly attended to-especially during storms. Keepers and assistants kept watch from the lookout room below the balcony; they noted the condition of the light and the fog signal, kept track of shipwrecks and offered aid to shipwreck victims when necessary. The lighthouse complex could never be left unattended, so either the keeper or one of his assistants was always on duty.<br /> <br /> Isolated duty stations often meant that life as a lighthouse keeper could be very lonely; however, the keepers at South Manitou were lucky. Even though they lived on an island, the small community of farmers, fishermen, and the United States Life Saving Service crew kept life interesting. One advantage of being a lighthouse keeper, even if you lived in a remote location, was being able to have your family with you. Wives often served as Assistant Keepers. Children helped with the many chores around the station and helped tend to gardens and livestock. They had some time for fun, too! The keeper's children attended school at the island's one room school house and had their friends over to play. One of these island children, John Tobin, fondly recalled spending time with his Ron Rosie, the assistant lighthouse keeper's son. He said in an oral history interview: \"His dad was the lighthouse keeper...I was up there and run them hallways...all over the place, me and Ronald...we'd go down there and raise the dickens.\"<br /> <br /> <strong>The Sheridan Family Tragedy</strong><br /> Life at a lighthouse could also be dangerous. Lake Michigan is an inland sea with dangerous gales, fog, snow, and ice. Living on South Manitou Island meant that if the weather was foul, or you were iced-in, you could be stranded on the island and cut off from medical help, supplies, and mail for long periods of time. Accidents didn't just happen to ships sailing through the Manitou Passage, but to those that lived on the island as well. There are many harrowing tales of accidents and illness on South Manitou, but one of the most tragic is that of Julia and Aaron Sheridan.<br /> <br /> Aaron Sheridan, a Civil War veteran, became Keeper of the South Manitou Island light in 1866. He and his wife Julia started a family on the island, eventually having six sons! After the new 104 foot lighthouse tower was constructed, the Lighthouse Service appointed Julia as the very first Assistant Keeper, making her the only woman to officially serve at the South Manitou Island light. In March of 1878, Julia, Aaron and their youngest son Robert were returning to the island from a boat ride. The boat capsized and tragically, all three Sheridan's drowned. Their five other children went to live with their grandparents. Today, descendants of Aaron and Julia often visit the island and share their story. They placed grave stones for Julia, Aaron, and Robert in the island cemetery in 2006.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Last Lighthouse Keeper</strong><br /> Ronald Rose, Sr. became the last Assistant Keeper of the South Manitou Island Light. He and his wife, Johanna, and two sons, Ronald, Jr. (Ron) and Roger, arrived in 1935. They lived in the Keeper's Quarters for four years before Ronald was transferred to another lighthouse. In 2009, Ron was interviewed about his boyhood on the island as a part of an oral history project for Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. He shared many stories about the work of a lighthouse keeper, attending school at the one-room schoolhouse, and becoming friends with other members of the island community. In the clip below, listen to Ron describe how his father lit the light every night and how the fog horn functioned.</p>",

With 75 trees, they were the first Port Oneida farm to raise cherries for market. They also owned sheep, pigs, chickens, and a few dairy cattle.<br /> <br /> Electricity came to the farm in 1945; the Thoresons bought their first tractor in 1947 and purchased a milking machine in 1949.<br /> John and Ingeborg emigrated from Norway on the same boat, but according to family lore, they never really met on the boat. Ingeborg resided with the higher-priced ticket holders, while John remained below deck with the lower-fare travelers. Along with their sons Ole and Fred, they built the farm around 1890. Ole and Fred Thoreson and Ole's son Leonard ran the farm though the 1950's.<br /> <br /> According to Leonard Thoreson, Port Oneida was the best place in the world to grow up. The neighbors had many good times together but worked hard. \"The farmers all pulled together and thrashed & filled silo and worked together; anybody that needed help buzzing wood, they all helped. The more you helped somebody else, the more people you had to help you on yours.\"<br /> <br /> The Thoresons were welcoming and always seemed to have a someone staying with them. They took care of sick neighbors and hired others who needed money. And if they needed to get their cherries off the trees, neighbors came-women and children-and helped pick.<br /> Remnants of the families' once extensive apple and cherry orchard are visible in a field northwest of the farmyard, with the grid layout still evident.<br /> <br /> In partnership with the National Park Service, volunteers from the Glen Arbor Art Association have been restoring the farm buildings and using the site as an arts education center. The equipment shed has been rehabilitated for class-room and studio space. They have repaired the red granary building and the barn. They are now working on the interior of the house.

A hike through the woods along the old road leads to the fascinating old farmhouse and related buildings.<br /> <br /> <b>Leashed pets are allowed on the trail.</b><br /> <br /> Charles Treat was a farmer and an engineer. He and his wife Martha purchased 220 acres including several buildings from John Tweddle (of the nearby Tweddle Farm) in 1912.<br /> <br /> The farm is of historic and cultural importance and is also one of the most beautiful areas for spring wildflowers in Michigan.<br /> The farmhouse is a white two story building built by the Tweddles. Later the Treats rebuilt the front porch, adding a concrete foundation and a workshop with a metalworking forge under the porch. There was no running water at the house and a deep well dug to provide running water silted up quickly and completely. The Treats modified the gutter system of the house to direct rainwater from the roof to a cistern built into the ground in the back of the house and then hand pumped water into the kitchen.<br /> The barn, restored in 2004, is a steep roofed vertically planked structure with an imposing prow covering the barn's pulley, which was \"mostly used for raising hay into the hayloft.\" Treat bought the barn in the Detroit area. He had it disassembled, had each piece numbered, and had it shipped to the farm where he reassembled it on a concrete foundation which he poured.<br /> <br /> A concrete root cellar built into a hill is the smaller of two structures which show Treat's ongoing interest in working with reinforced concrete.<br /> <br /> There is a larger circular garage which Treat built using four-inch thick reinforced concrete wall, poured a bucket of concrete at a time. The roof was 2.5 inches thick made of reinforced concrete with a frame of heavy cedar and a hand set spiral network of steel bar for reinforcement.<br /> <br /> There are several other buildings including a woodshed and machine sheds for storing farm equipment.<br /> <br /> The Treat Farm was primarily a subsistence farm. They grew asparagus, beans, plums, apples, potatoes and raspberries among other plants, mostly for their own consumption. They raised corn and hay for animal feed. They maintained a small dairy herd and raised chickens as well, and despite the poor soil, continued farming into the 1930's.</p> <h3>Lake Overlook</h3> <p>After exploring the Treat Farm, hike through poplars and other unique foliage to the ridge above the water for a breathtaking view of Lake Michigan and the surrounding beach and dunes. Climb to the top of Old Baldy (you can't miss it) for a wide-open Lake Michigan view and an up-close-and-personal look at the Empire Bluffs immediately to the north.</p>",

        "notes": "Tree House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/tree-house.htm\n\n<p>In 1895 or 1896, a solid-looking shingle-style cottage was constructed here by a couple known as Mr. and Mrs. Hewitt. Shirley Foote Alford described the Hewitts' Cottage Row house, furnished in burlap and calico, as \"the prettiest cottage of all.<br /> <br /> A few years later the Hewitts, who were immigrants from England, sold the cottage to Dr. John Edwin and Louise Rhoades. In a wooded area adjacent to the cottage, the Rhoades built a small play house for their daughter, Margaret. Later, after Margaret married Roderick Peattie, a lower floor was added to the play house, transforming it into a small, two-story, private cottage for Margaret and Roderick called \"the treehouse.\"<br /> <br /> In 1927, soon after inheriting her parent's cottage, Margaret Peattie sold the property to the Manitou Island Association. Jean Lundquist recalled that sometime during 1937-1950s the tree house was occupied by an American Indian man named Raphael. The cottage eventually fell into disuse and was torn down by the Manitou Island Association. However, Margaret and Roderick Peattie's \"treehouse\" remains standing on the site.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",

        "notes": "Trude Cottage\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/trude-cottage.htm\n\n<p>The Trude cottage is one of three Cottage Row houses that appear to be influenced by dog-trot bungalows, a common house type in Gulf Coast resort communities; it was constructed of materials reused from dismantled exhibition booths of the Manufacturers' Building at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition.<br /> <br /> The Trude Cottage was built in 1894 for Frederick H. and Mary Trude, one of the developers of the Cottage Row resort colony. Based on a dog-trot architectural plan; its rooms are arranged along each side of a covered breezeway, with the doors opening into the central passage.<br /> <br /> The origins of the dog-trot plan are traced to the gulf coast area of Mississippi, where it later evolved into a bungalow house type, with a breezeway that was enclosed to form a central room, one or two fireplaces, and a gallery or verandah that extended across the front of the house. The verandah was positioned to capture on-shore/off-shore breezes to cool the house naturally.<br /> How the dog-trot bungalow house type was transported to a remote comer of northern Michigan, far removed from coastal Mississippi, is a mystery that has prompted considerable speculation among architectural historians.<br /> <br /> The Trude cottage, like all of the other Cottage Row houses, originally did not have a dining room or kitchen, as residents took meals at the communal dining hall located at the northern end of the row. As with the other Cottage Row houses, a kitchen was added to the Trude cottage after the closing of Katie Shepard's dining room during the 1930s. The addition also included an indoor bathroom, although the cottage remained without electrical service. The interior walls of the cottage were not plastered; rather, decorative moldings were added in the spaces between structural members, and all of the exposed wood surfaces were varnished.<br /> <br /> The broad front gallery of the Trude cottage takes advantage of the building's orientation toward the Manitou Passage. Located behind the Trude cottage are a water cistern, an automobile garage, a storage shed, and a privy.<br /> <br /> Ornamental vegetation includes a lilac shrub located south of the house, and a cluster of lilacs growing in front of the house, at the edge of the bluff.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex.

        "notes": "Tweddle Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/tweddle-farm.htm\n\n<p>This picturesque farm was home to the Tweddle family. John Tweddle originally settled in this area around 1840 and built a one room log cabin at the present site of the Treat Farm about ½ mile due west from here. The family built the larger house, now known as the Treat Farmhouse, around 1880, and, around 1895, they moved down to this site at the corner of Norconk Road. Sometime later, the Crouch family purchased the farm from the Tweddle family.<br /> <br /> The buildings are typical of small family farms. The barn was used for dairy cattle in the bottom level with hay storage above. The metal silo near the barn was used for silage. The other smaller silo may have been used to store dry grains. There are also several smaller buildings: a corn crib, granary, chicken coop, pump house, etc.<br /> <br /> Dairy operations can often be identified by the silos which were used to store chopped corn or alfalfa, which would ferment and provide a high energy food for the cows. A feed bunk used to feed the silage to the cows. The farmer (or his kids) would climb up into the silo and, using a pitch fork, dig out the packed silage and throw it down the chute to the little room at the bottom. The silage would then be carried in baskets or a wheelbarrow down the bunk for the cows to eat. The cows love this feed, and they would clean it right up. There would be barely a speck of silage left when they were done!<br /> <br /> The Tweddle barn has a good example of stanchions used in the dairy operations. In this case, there are two sets of stanchions facing a manger. Two rows of cows would face each other over a common manger where hay or grain would be placed in front of them, and the stanchions would be closed to hold the cows in place while they were being milked. Cows are creatures of habit and would usually go to the same stanchion day after day.<br /> <br /> The Tweddle Farm is currently used for housing NPS seasonal employees as well as Sleeping Bear's Artist-In-Residence program. You can clearly see why this picturesque farmstead would be so highly inspirational for artists.</p>",

Their farm dates to the late 1850's or early 1860's and is the oldest maintained farm in the Port Oneida Historical District.<br /> <br /> Port Oneida was known as a close-knit community, but this doesn't mean the community didn't have its share of serious disagreements. Fifteen years after building their farmstead, the Werners were informed by their neighbor to the north, Thomas Kelderhouse, that their home was on the wrong side of the line. We don't know why the two men could not come to an easier agreement, but the Werners had to disassemble their hard-built home and farm and relocate 1/4 mile south to this location.<br /> <br /> In 1885, the Werner's son and daughter-in-law, Richard and Katie (Portner) Werner, were farming at this site. After Richard Werner's death in 1890, Katie married Benjamin Holland, who took over the farm. Ben was known for being very particular. \"He had the straightest corn rows in the area!\" By 1891, Frederick and Margaretta Werner had divided their parcel, ceding the northern 122 acres to their daughter and son-in-law, Mattie and John Miller.<br /> <br /> The Werners established a family cemetery atop the bluff along the lake that is believed to contain the five children who died here during the early years, as well as Frederick, Margretha, and others.<br /> <br /> Frederick and Margaretta Werner's great-grandson, Franklin Basch, was raised on the farm and purchased it in 1943. According to Franklin Basch, their farming activities ceased around 1930 because they were unable to produce adequate crops.</p>",

The Apple Tree</strong><br /> The apple tree on the left is an old variety called Duchess of Oldenburg, brought to this country from Russia in 1835 and once widely grown. Look at the trunk: it is riddled with sapsucker holes. The original habitat for this member of the woodpecker family was forests with clearings, but it has come to favor orchards as well.<br /> <br /> Apple trees may have originated in Asia Minor or in the mountains of Caucasia. They were brought to the New World by European settlers, and today cultivation of apples and other fruits is an important industry in northern Michigan.<br /> <br /> Occasionally, cultivated plants suffer from disease, insects and drought. Scientists then turn to old varieties or their wild cousins to seek types that are resistant. Wild plants or old cultivated varieties are a reservoir of genetic diversity, and for this reason it is important to preserve them. Throughout history, many different kinds of plants have proven useful to people. Even today, almost half of prescription medicines contain drugs of natural origin. Unfortunately, we are destroying natural habitat worldwide so rapidly that many species are going extinct before they can be studied to determine potential uses and their role in the natural community.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. The Old Field</strong><br /> This former farm field has been lying fallow for many years since the National Lakeshore purchased the land. Gradually, the natural process of plant succession is occurring. The first plants to colonize an old field can include raspberries and other bushes. Common juniper is often the first large plant to grow. The first trees to enter the old field are those that do well in sunlight, such as poplar, white birch and black cherry. Eventually they will produce so much shade that only the seedlings of other more tolerant species such as maple, oak, and ash can survive. Barring natural disaster or human interference, the mature hardwood forests will eventually again dominate the former field.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. The Young Trees</strong><br /> Did you notice that all the trees for several feet on both sides of the trail are relatively young? The trail follows an old roadbed that was obviously fairly wide. After vehicles no longer used it, tree seedlings began to grow. Now they are relatively crowded, but as time goes on many will die from insufficient sunlight and nourishment and only a few widely spaced and hardy survivors will remain.<br /> Did you know that Michigan has an official state soil? Be sure to stop at the wayside exhibit down the trail a little way and learn why \"It's More Than Just Dirt!\"<br /> <br /> <strong>5. The Big Maple</strong><br /> This giant sugar maple was at least a century old before it died; perhaps even much older. Why do you suppose it was spared when all the other surrounding trees were cut for lumber or to clear the area for farming? Pause here for a moment and think about the changes that have happened on the land since this tree was a seedling. If you feel a sense of awe, then you understand another reason for preserving biological diversity. Every time the world loses a species, we lose the opportunity to experience its unique beauty and wonder.<br /> <br /> <strong>6. Wildlife</strong><br /> Can you see any signs of animal life around this hollow tree? Old beech trees often develop internal rot and the holes become ideal homes for porcupines, squirrels, and raccoons. Beech trees also produce large crops of edible nuts. The outside is spiny and splits into four parts, releasing the triangular nut inside. These are favorite food of the many birds and mammals.<br /> While the park provides habitat for about forty different species of mammals, we should also give a moment's thought to the ones that are rare and absent. At one time bears roamed this area, but now they are seldom seen. Wolves once inhabited most of North America, but now they are limited to just a few locations. The park is not large enough to provide habitat for the large, far-ranging mammals. In order to preserve biological diversity, large tracts of wilderness are necessary.<br /> <br /> <strong>7. Glen Lake Overlook</strong><br /> Over the tops of the trees down the trail you can glimpse a portion of Glen Lake, originally called Bear Lake by early settlers. The lake is actually a remnant of a bay from a few thousand years ago when Lake Michigan was much higher that it is now. As the level of Lake Michigan fell, waves and currents along the shore deposited a sandbar across the bay mouth, leaving Glen Lake landlocked. The village of Glen Arbor now sits atop that old sandbar.<br /> <br /> A variety of habitats exist in the park: sand dunes, lakes, rivers, bogs, forests, fields. When we attempt to preserve biological diversity, we must preserve all of the various habitats that support that diversity as well.<br /> <br /> In 1964, Congress passed the Wilderness Act to assure that a growing population and expanding settlement did not eliminate all lands existing in their natural condition.<br /> <br /> Portions of this park have been designated as Wilderness and are managed as wilderness. Wilderness is important as a recreational resource as well as an area where natural diversity can flourish.<br /> <br /> <strong>8. Woodpecker Holes</strong><br /> Have you ever wondered, \"What good is an old, dead tree?\" Infested trees are a valuable source of food for woodpeckers. The elongated holes are made by the pileated woodpecker. This crow-sized bird with a red crest lives in mature forests, but it has become scarce in places where logging has destroyed its natural habitat. It usually makes a new nesting hole each year, and other birds often nest in the old holes. About 85 different kinds of North American birds including bluebirds, chickadees, wrens, and owls make their nests in old, hollow tress. When these old trees are removed, many different kinds of birds are affected.<br /> There are many complex interrelationships in the web of life. When we damage one strand, we weaken the entire web.<br /> <br /> <strong>9. The Pine Plantation</strong><br /> After loggers cleared the native forest, pine trees were planted. You can recognize pine plantations because they lack variety. Because most of the trees are of the same species and age, they are susceptible to the same diseases and insect infestations. The planting of large tracts of a single plant is known as monoculture. Other examples of monoculture are cornfields and vegetable farms. A natural plant community is healthier because the greater variety of plant life makes for milder effects of insects or disease.<br /> <br /> <strong>Conclusion</strong><br /> It is just a short way back to the trailhead. We hope you have enjoyed the beauty of the natural surroundings and have gained a better understanding of the importance of biological diversity. If this subject has touched you, perhaps you will work through community groups and environmental organizations to assure the continuation of natural, diverse communities on our plant Earth.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year?

What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> <br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> <br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> <br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</strong><br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks. Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <strong>After being outdoors</strong><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:<br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <strong>If you are bitten by a tick</strong><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> Watch for signs of illness.</p>",

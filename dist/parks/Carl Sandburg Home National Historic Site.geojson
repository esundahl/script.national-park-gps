He enjoyed the quiet and peacefulness of this location to edit his work. Exposed rocks like this are located throughout the area and have a long history of use going back to the first peoples to settle the area we know today as Flat Rock.<br /> <br /> This area’s dynamic and ecologically abundant landscape supplied generations of Native Americans a place to develop extensive cultural traditions related to kinship, religion, trade, art, and diverse use of abundant natural resources. Over millennia, these traditions evolved, adapting to environmental and social changes.Take a moment to pause here and reflect on the legacy of this land! These mountains are clothed in a lush hardwood forest teeming with birds, wildlife and an abundance of native berries, nuts, fruit, and flowers.  <br /> <br /> Long ago, native peoples such as Cherokee, Cheraw, and Catawba thrived on this rich abundance.While villages were in outlying areas, these large “flat rocks” near the border of North and South Carolina, were noted as places for traders, pioneers, and settlers to barter goods with the native people. With increased European expansion, the Indian Removal Act of 1838 forced native people to leave their homelands and their ancestral lands were confiscated.<br /> <br /> This removal was devastating, and many thousands perished on what is tragically remembered as the Trail of Tears. Today descendants of these early Cherokee people embrace their rich ancestry and culture and call these mountains home again in Cherokee, NC.

He taught Sandburg that a \"lump\" meant food that was given as a handout, and \"sit down\" was a phrase used when someone would invite a tramp to the kitchen table to eat.</p> <p>Sandburg also found work in Keokuk that would provide some extra cash and meals. He spent a day going door-to-door with a can of asphaltum for blackening rusty stoves, and then:</p> <p><em>I saw a sign “Waiter Wanted” in a small lunch counter near the end of Main Street.

I walked along Berrien Street till I came to the only house in the United States where I could open a door without knocking and walk in for a kiss from the woman of the house. They gave me a sitdown and as they had had only two or three letters from me, they asked me where I had been and I told them the half of it. When I showed my father fifteen dollars and a few nickels, he said the money would come in handy and I should watch it. What had the trip done to me? I couldn’t say. It had changed me. I was easier about looking people in the eye. When questions came I was quicker at answering them or turning them off. I had been a young stranger meeting many odd strangers and I had practiced at having answers... Away deep in my heart now I had hope as never before.

Prior to  his Hobo adventure Sandburg had only traveled as far as  Chicago. He was drawn to head west to Kansas, in time for the wheat harvest, where there would surely be work. Along the way, he would stop to find odd jobs to fund his travels and to keep food in his belly. Sandburg left his friends and family in Galesburg Ill on the last week of June in 1897, he returned to his hometown on October 15th of that same year.  In reference to his hobo travels, Sandburg wrote, I was meeting fellow traveler's and fellow Americans and  what they were doing to my heart and mind, my personality; I could not say then nor later and be certain. I was getting a deeper self-respect than I had in Galesburg, so much I knew. I was getting to be a better storyteller! Quotes used in this tour are Sandburg's own from \"Always the Young Stranger\".

She raised three breeds of dairy goats; Saanen, Toggenburg, and Nubian. Each breed can be seen in the herd today.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Sandburg owned and operated a goat dairy from 1935 to 1965. Here at Connemara, Mrs. Sandburg's goat breeding program produced champion goats and led to the improvement of goats as milk producing animals.</p> <p>Rangers and volunteers are on hand to share this fascinating story about goats and Mrs. Sandburg's dairy goat operation.

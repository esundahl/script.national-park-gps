For Chester County, these were indeed “the times that tried men’s souls”.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{52e4220e-5ba8-4b9c-8785-6a4f28b70298}{239}\" paraid=\"1513046699\">Joseph and Hannah Hoskins had apparently had enough. By the spring of 1778 they left Chester County, Pennsylvania, following the path many others had taken ahead of them down the Great Wagon Road through western Virginia and into the piedmont of North Carolina.  Here, the land was comparatively cheap and the threat of warfare with the Native American tribes like the Cherokee was no longer an immediate concern.  More importantly, they were moving away from the seat of war!  On the 18th of May, 1778, Joseph Hoskins purchased 150 acres of land “on Horsepen Creek and on both sides of the main road” in Guilford County where the Hoskins’ undoubtedly hoped to begin a new life, free from the travails and ravages of war. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9779d3d-61cd-4d18-a564-c9290b260173}{22}\" paraid=\"23427736\"> <br /> The Hoskins’ farm, described as “a considerable plantation” by Lord Cornwallis, included acres of valuable timber. There were also large cultivated fields surrounded by wooden fences like the “worm fence” you see ahead of you to protect the crops. Livestock was commonly allowed to roam freely and forage for food which sometimes led to damaged crops and lawsuits.  In response, the North Carolina Assembly passed an Act requiring that planters construct sufficient fences to protect both crops and animals from damage. A fence deemed “insufficient” by the Court meant the farmer whose crop had been damaged could not collect reparation from his neighbor and might even find himself liable if the neighbor’s animal was injured as it was chased away. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9779d3d-61cd-4d18-a564-c9290b260173}{40}\" paraid=\"1248978709\"> <br /> On the day of battle, these fences would serve a new purpose for the militiamen who lined up along them. They weren’t concerned with the fence stopping cows or pigs. They wanted the fence to stop bullets and British soldiers. <br />  <br /> Consider the fact that all farmers within the thirteen colonies had mixed emotions when they saw the soldiers of either side approaching. Armies “foraged” for food from the countryside, and in the best of times this meant you would be paid for any crops or goods that the army wanted. In the worst of times, both sides were known to take food without compensation. There was also the constant fear of stragglers from either army stealing or committing acts of violence as they passed through, turning the countryside into a war zone. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9779d3d-61cd-4d18-a564-c9290b260173}{72}\" paraid=\"784094844\">The Hoskins farm was only a mile to the west of Guilford Court House along the New Garden Road. The Court House was the center of community life in peacetime, especially during quarterly court sessions. Merchants, traders, artisans, and those who had business with the Court would travel past this plantation to reach the Court House. At the time of the battle, Joseph and Hannah Hoskins lived here with two very young children, Elizabeth and John. Between 1784 and 1797, Joseph Hoskins served as constable, patroller, collector, deputy sheriff, and sheriff of Guilford County. <br />  <br /> Explore the site where the British began the battle of Guilford Courthouse, and learn more about life at the Hoskins Farm by using the park’s Cell Phone Guided Tour and interpretive signs at the farm site. </p>",

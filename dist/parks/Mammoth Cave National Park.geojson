It was set up as a banquet hall with electrical lights in the early 1900’s. There was a gas generator that charged a bank of batteries to power the lights.  In the mid-1800’s cave owner Dr. John Croghan named Audubon Avenue after his friend, the famous ornithologist and artist John James Audubon. In 1838 a visitor reported seeing “tens of thousands” of bats in Little Bat Avenue. Few bats remain, but visitors still see stain on the ceiling from the bat’s feet where they roosted.<br /> <br /> NPS Mobile App Users: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=875A02F8-A363-4333-A20D-CAE4514BE347\">Click here to watch a video on a ranger in Audubon and Little Bat Avenue. </a></p>",

The business ran for eight years until the death of Floyd Collins in 1925 in nearby Sand Cave. This tragedy brought a lot of attention to the Mammoth Cave area, including interest in the Great Crystal Cave, which the Collins family still owned.  <br /> <br /> In 1927, Dr. H. B. Thomas purchased the Collins Homestead and Crystal Cave, renamed the cave to “Floyd Collins Crystal Cave,” and continued the tourism business. Dr. Thomas and his descendants operated the Floyd Collins Crystal Cave as a private show cave from 1927 until 1960 when it was purchased by the National Park Service to be included within Mammoth Cave National Park.  <br /> <br /> The Floyd Collins Homestead also plays a significant role in cave exploration and cave science. The homestead was the first headquarters of the Cave Research Foundation, a group dedicated to the further exploration and understanding of caves and cave science. The Cave Research Foundation used the Floyd Collins Homestead as a base of operations for many of their expeditions to explore the Flint Ridge Cave System. In 1972, a famous expedition occurred that connected the Flint Ridge Cave System with the Mammoth Cave System and proved that Mammoth Cave was the longest known cave with a length of 144.4 miles (232.4 km) at the time of the discovery Since that time further exploration by the Cave Research Foundation and other organizations has extended the known length of Mammoth Cave to over 400 miles (643 km). </p>",

The Rotunda boasts ¼ acre room. Early visitors did not get the opportunity to experience rooms this large. When they would write about their experiences they would often refer to the cave system as mammoth. After a while, that became the name everyone recognized, The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{166}\" paraid=\"727826648\">Why are there no cave formations?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{178}\" paraid=\"818144110\">Mammoth Cave is considered a dry cave. Above all the layers of limestone rock there are two more layers of sedimentary rock, sandstone and shale. These <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/rocks-of-mammoth-cave.htm\">layers of rock</a> were created long after the development of the limestone. A river flowed over this area leaving behind sand, silt and mud. These deposits solidified to form the sandstone caprock of Mammoth Cave. Unlike the soluble limestone, water can not penetrate through this type of rock. The insoluble rock layers keep Mammoth Cave dry. It is this feature that allows Mammoth Cave to be world’s longest cave system and allows all the artifacts in the cave to be preserved. </p> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{212}\" paraid=\"1372615239\">There are a few places where that caprock is weakened or absent and water can slowly make its way through the layers. In this locations we do find the classic <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/stalactites-stalagmites-and-cave-formations.htm\">cave formations</a> such as; stalactites, stalagmites, draperies, soda straws, cave bacon, cave grapes, cave popcorn and rim stone dams to name a few. All of these formations are typical of a wet cave.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{252}\" paraid=\"1694744471\">Tours to see wet formations: Frozen Niagara, Domes and Dripstones, Gothic Avenue, Violet City [lantern tour], Grand Avenue, Great Onyx [lantern tour], Introduction to Caving [crawling tour], Wild Cave [crawling tour].<br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{25}\" paraid=\"806533793\">How often do rocks fall?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{33}\" paraid=\"161328481\"><em>Only Once, lol.

This is a legit question that comes up quite often. The truth of the matter is that it does occur occasionally. These stone passages stabilized themselves long ago and there aren’t many outside forces acting on them. Sometimes there are changes in the environment that affect the rock layers. Areas next to entrances or ventilation shafts experience sufficient temperature change to create ice wedging between the layers. In areas where water is still flowing freely the cave experiences changes as rocks are dislodged by the water. </p> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{252}\" paraid=\"1694744471\"> </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{89}\" paraid=\"1215130733\">Are people still exploring the cave?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{95}\" paraid=\"394914924\">Cave exploration is still active and headed up by the Cave Research Foundation. The group is comprised of scientists, cave enthusiasts and members of the <a href=\"https://caves.org/\">National Speleological Society</a>.  The <a href=\"https://www.cave-research.org/\">Cave Research Foundation</a> (CRF) expedition leaders schedule excursions into the cave on holiday weekends when the members are off from their everyday jobs.

Which means it was formed in soluble rock through a chemical reaction that caused the rock to dissolve thus creating passages. The cave is naturally formed by the underground rivers flowing against the limestone walls. The cave walls and ceiling have not been altered by man. The rivers that flowed through left behind large amounts of sediment and displaced rocks.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{187}\" paraid=\"229064473\">Throughout the use of the cave the floor has been altered. That is to say, loose rocks have been moved around and dirt has been removed in some areas to allow for more clearance between the floor and ceiling. In the Rotunda, the floor has been built up by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/saltpetre-mining.htm\">saltpetre</a> processing. After the nitrates were removed from the sediment, mine workers would shovel the wet mud from the leeching vats. The spent dirt was piled up along the sides of the chamber. This caused the floor of the room to rise almost eight feet in some places.<br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{231}\" paraid=\"597022712\">How many entrances are there?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{243}\" paraid=\"1429546519\">So far, we know of 27 entrances. The Historic Entrance is the largest natural entrance. A total of six entrances are used by visitors to access different guided tour experiences. The Great Onyx entrance is not counted among those because the connection of these two cave systems has not been found yet.  <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{6}\" paraid=\"2085965807\">Is there gold or gems in the cave?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{18}\" paraid=\"1412894393\">No. The limestone rock is not ideal for discovering gold or other gems. However, aside from calcite formations, the cave does have a variety of minerals that can be found on its walls. Salts such as gypsum, epsomite, and mirabilite can be found within the cave. Some of these were harvested by prehistoric <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/historyculture/native-americans.htm\">Native Americans</a>.<br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{51}\" paraid=\"506643395\">What is the black stuff on the walls? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{57}\" paraid=\"64555320\">As the limestone is drying out pushing moisture from its pores, it is picking up other minerals along the way. Here, when the moisture evaporates from the surface of the rock it leaves behind gypsum. The build up can take on various forms depending on the shape of the pore it traveled through. Through small pores a sugary crust will develop along the surface. It sparkles like fresh fallen snow. Naturally it is white in color but also appears light brown due to interactions with impurities found here. If the gypsum is forced from a larger pore, sugary lilies and clusters of delicate flowers will bloom on the walls and ceilings. These fragile formations are rated a two on the Mohs hardiness scale (Diamond being a 10 and talc being a one). They are about the same sturdiness of dried up cake icing. In early tourism visitors were allowed to pluck these beauties from the walls to take as souvenirs. With the creation of this national park, beautiful places like this are now protected for future generations. </p> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{89}\" paraid=\"1605357060\">In this section of the cave, the thin crust has been blackened by the smoke of bonfires and from lanterns. Native Americans harvested gypsum in the main cave. </p> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{103}\" paraid=\"1147832460\">Tours to see dry formations: Great Onyx [lantern tour], Cleveland Avenue, Accessible, Grand Avenue, Violet City [lantern tour], Wild Cave [crawling tour], Introduction to Caving [crawling tour].<br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{115}\" paraid=\"1756035765\">Why is the ceiling flat? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{121}\" paraid=\"1599476800\">Limestone is naturally formed in layers, like the layers of a cake. The limestone in the Mammoth Cave area was created when there was a salty sea covering this area of Kentucky. In this sea was a vast ecosystem of aquatic life. Many of these creatures had hard parts, such as shells. When one of these organisms died, the hard parts accumulated as sediment on the sea floor. This sediment continued to build over time and eventually solidify creating <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/fossils.htm\">fossil</a> rich limestone rocks. When you gaze at the expanse of a flat ceiling in the cave, you are essentially looking at the bottom surface of an exposed layer of limestone. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{192}\" paraid=\"1209508542\">Where is the water that formed the cave now? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{198}\" paraid=\"208636599\">Over thousands of years the Green River has been cutting deeper into the valley. At the same time water in the cave is striving to be at the same level as the river on the outside. As time passes water is finding cracks in the limestone and seeping deeper creating layers of twisting passages. <br /> <br /> Once you leave the cave, you can hike the River Styx Spring trail 0.4 miles from the Historic Entrance to the Green River. This is one of many locations where the water is leaving the cave system and joining with the Green River. That will be deepest point of the subterranean labyrinth. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{254}\" paraid=\"800426675\">Do earthquakes effect the cave? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{5}\" paraid=\"1006150961\">The closest major fault is the New Madrid, located almost 200 miles away. Seismic activity in South Central Kentucky does not occur often, but on the occasion shock waves may reach this area. The areas most impacted by the tremors will be on the surface. To understand this, imagine a rock being thrown into a pond. A duck swimming on top would feel the ripple and waves on the surface of the pond, but a fish swimming at some depth beneath would not be as aware. So while earthquakes can and have caused some impact in the cave, it is relatively a safer environment when compared to the tremendous impacts earthquakes can have on the surface. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{53}\" paraid=\"1264985633\">Where are the bats?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{61}\" paraid=\"981413756\">The bat population has taken a very hard hit with the introduction of White Nose Syndrome and urban development. Bats have been losing much of their natural habitats. This causes them to be found in places they shouldn’t be, such as attic spaces. Food sources are also diminishing due to the increased use of pesticides. Many bat species are now considered endangered or threatened. </p> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{71}\" paraid=\"628125661\">Throughout the year the are about 13 different species of bats that will take up residence in this area of Kentucky. Not all of the bats will come into the cave. During the warmer season many bats opt to sleep in the hollow of trees or the thick canopy. When dusk falls and the insects begin to swarm, the bats are much closer to their food source. These nocturnal creatures like to consume what we call “M&Ms” but that isn’t the good kind we like to eat. Their M&Ms are moths and mosquitos. So think about that the next time you see them flying around at night. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{85}\" paraid=\"490132172\">What is White-nose Syndrome? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{91}\" paraid=\"2138848472\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/bats/white-nose-syndrome.htm\">White-nose Syndrome</a> is disease created by a fungus. It effects the bats echolocation when it grows on their faces. This can cause the bat to starve or fly into obstacles. When the fugus develops on the wings it can create holes that make it impossible for the bat to fly. During hibernation the bats normally slow their body systems to allow them to burn through fat reserves slowly. The growth of the fungus on their body causes an irritation that prevents them to go into hibernation for the full season. Infected bats will sometimes wake before the spring season. This can lead to many issues such as freezing to death or starvation. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{111}\" paraid=\"1436025296\">Why do we walk on the mats after the cave and not before we go into the cave? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{117}\" paraid=\"398467897\">We clean our shoes after going into the cave to stop us from spreading the White-nose fungal spore from Mammoth Cave. Since the fungus is already here we can not stop visitors from reintroducing it.

The church is composed of one building and an accompanying cemetery. It was founded the third Saturday in February, 1842, by church elders Jesse Moon, R.T. Gardner and William Skaggs. The conditions of the church can be seen in a letter written in 1931 by Aunt Susie Blair to Charlie Whittle: “On Sunday we went to church where Good Spring Church now stands. The old house was built of logs and heated with a fireplace.” Her letter also mentions that, when the number of service attendees was larger than the church could hold, they had service outside amongst the trees. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f0fa6d01-d5a2-4c5f-bb19-768a07b96a34}{220}\" paraid=\"4\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f0fa6d01-d5a2-4c5f-bb19-768a07b96a34}{222}\" paraid=\"5\">Before this church was formed, its members had to travel to Nolin Baptist Church or to a church in Beaver Dam. With Nolin Baptist church being about 10 miles away, and with the town of Beaver Dam being about 65 miles away, the construction of the Good Spring Baptist Church saved residents considerable travel time. The church charter members included Brown Blair, Mary Blair, Isaac Blair, Lucy Blair, David Blair, Betsy Blair, J.L. Smith, Sarah Smith, Rachel Pace, William Skaggs, J.D. Sanders, Sally Sanders, Thomas Meredith, Esaline Smith and Pega Davis. Many of these charter members were descendants of the pioneer Baptists that settled in Green County near the Brush Creek Church, located in Tennessee. </p> <p paraeid=\"{02835b6c-8d80-458c-9b0e-bfde06bd7c26}{29}\" paraid=\"6\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{02835b6c-8d80-458c-9b0e-bfde06bd7c26}{31}\" paraid=\"7\">Good Spring Baptist Church had the largest membership of any church in the Green River Association from 1896 to 1900. When the National Park Service acquired the church property, the church dissolved. The church building itself is still standing today. It currently holds reunion services for descendants of the pioneers during a yearly homecoming and dinner on the grounds. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1991.  </p>",

Intrigued, they set off to explore. We find evidence they traveled over 19 miles with river cane torches to light their way. They journeyed into the cave for about 3,000 years before the exploration stopped... Why do you think they stopped coming into the cave?<br /> <br /> It wasn’t until the late 1700s, that a local legend says a young boy, named John Houchin, rediscovered the cave. According to the legend, this young boy was hunting along the ridge line with his father’s Kentucky long rifle. He spotted a large black bear, a mammal we no longer find in the park. Raising the rifle to his shoulder he took aim and fired. BOOM!... When the smoke cleared, he realized he had only wounded the bear. The injured bear took off down the hillside and deep into the cave. Not wanting to come back empty handed, the boy took off after the bear. Do you think he ever found that bear? What we do know is that this story spread and cave travel began once more.<br /> <br /> As you walk down the steps into the entrance, notice the water cascading from the limestone layers of the entrance. This feature will play an important role in one of our future stops.</p>",

These churches served as the center of community life. Locals attended weekly church services, weddings, baptisms, homecomings, revivals, funerals and grave decoration days.social interactions with family and neighbors from the area. These churches were also places of social interactions with family and neighbors as they were sometimes used as meeting houses and schools for the communities they served. <br /> <br /> Before Mammoth Cave National Park was formed there were several churches that served the communities in the immediate area of the cave. Joppa Church is one of three remaining structures that was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The church was established in 1862. The Joppa Church served the community of Elko and the residents of the Joppa Ridge area. Elko or Joppa community lay between Woolsey Valley and the Green River and between Turnhole Bend and Deer Park Hollow. The very earliest settlers to this area in the early 1800’s were the families of Davis’, Jones’, Houchins’, Blairs’ along with others. These families were followed by others that were important in the early history of the area they are the families of Ages’, Denhams’, Gentrys’, Merediths’, Woods’, Minyards’ McCombs’, Rutherfords’ Simmons’, Smiths’, Sanders’, Parkers’ to name a few.  <br /> <br /> In 1880 there was five to six square mile area, with families that had no church to serve them. The first building at Joppa was a log schoolhouse that stood on the grounds where the current church stands today.  <br /> <br /> The church was first known as Pleasant Union and was constituted in the log schoolhouse. Wm. Travis Blair wrote of this event and said, “A Baptist minister living in the community held a series of meetings at the home of John Bailey Blair which resulted in the church being formed.” In the early 1900 the old log church was torn down to make way for the wood frame building that is still standing today.  Today the church grounds and cemetery are open to visitors as a day use area. Joppa Church holds a Homecoming every year on the second Sunday of September. </p>",

The view from Lookout Mountain is focused on a large pile of rocks, known as breakdown.

For thousands of years this site has served as a gateway to the underground world beneath the park. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/historyculture/native-americans.htm\">Prehistoric people</a> first entered the cave through this entrance between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago seeking the resources of minerals the cave holds. Later <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/saltpetre-mining.htm\">saltpetre mining</a> operations dominated the landscape near the entrance, eventually leading way to tourism in 1816. Since then, over two hundred years of guided cave tours have taken place at Mammoth Cave.  </p> <h2>John Houchins and the Bear </h2> <p>Although the credit of the cave’s discovery belongs to the prehistoric Native Americans, the question remains as to how the cave came to the attention of European settlers in the area. According to legend, in the late 1790s a young boy named John Houchins, was out hunting for game for his family. He spotted a black bear roaming through the forest near the entrance of the cave, he took aim and fired. His shot failed to be fatal for the bear, only wounding the animal. The injured bear ran down the hill and took shelter in the cave, leading Houchins into the cave. The legend tapers off at this point, leaving unanswered the question of whether Houchins ever got his bear, but whether or not, Houchins gained the credit of the modern discovery of the great cave. </p> <h2>Visiting the Historic Entrance </h2> <p>The Historic Entrance of Mammoth Cave is viewable all hours, free of charge. To access this area, follow the paved trail down the hill behind the visitor center. The walk along this path travels 0.25 miles and takes about 5-10 minutes. Along the way there are wayside signs that describe the areas geology, and several benches are available. Please note that this trail has a steep incline and is not rated as wheelchair accessible. <br /> <br /> During the busy spring and summer season, the Historic Entrance can be a congested area. Large tour groups pass through this area about every 15 minutes at peak visitation. If there is not a tour entering the cave, you can travel down the 65 stairsteps and travel about 300 feet into the cave opening before reaching the gate.  </p>",

In 1874 Colonel Larkin J. Procter, who was the owner of the stagecoach line, chartered the Mammoth Cave Railroad with his brother George and other investors and leased the railroad rights to Mammoth Cave from the L&N Railroad. <br /> <br /> The new railroad acquired four used steam engine locomotives. They were Baldwin “dummy” steam engines formally used on the street railways in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee. The reason the small steam Baldwin locomotive was called “dummy” was because it was boxed up to look like a passenger streetcar. They also acquired two wooden passenger coaches and two wooden combination coaches and baggage cars.   <br /> <br /> The actual work on the railroad did not begin until 1880, and was officially opened for business on November 8th of 1886. The first passenger, W.F. Richardson, paid $3.00 for ticket #1350 as was recorded in the Mammoth Cave Hotel Register on November 8, 1886. The Mammoth Cave Railroad would make several stops at places such as Diamond Caverns, Chaumont Post Office, Proctor’s Hotel and Sloan’s Crossing during its short 8.7-mile trip from Glasgow Junction (Park City) to the Mammoth Cave. <br /> <br /> The Mammoth Cave Railroad was a short rail line with a small train. This “dummy” type locomotive and its accompanying combine coach were among the last of their kind used in the United States. The final run of the Mammoth Cave Railroad occurred in 1931. The original Locomotive “Hercules” #3 was unable to make the last run, so Locomotive #4 was renamed “Hercules” to keep with tradition.  <br /> <br /> Today, visitors can still travel by foot or bicycle on the rail path as the abandoned line was converted to the Mammoth Cave Bike and Hike Trail in 2004.   </p>",

Named for the enormity of its “mammoth” subterranean vaults and the unparalleled extent of its passages, Mammoth Cave is the longest known cave system in the world with 412 miles surveyed to date.<br /> <br /> In 1941, Mammoth Cave’s superlative qualities led the Southern Appalachian National Park Commission to recommend that the cave be made into a national park along with other national treasures such as Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah. The Mammoth Cave National Park Association and the Kentucky National Park Commission began the necessary, and unprecedented, 15-year process to convert settled areas into parklands, and once congressional requirements were met, Mammoth Cave National Park entered the national park system.<br /> <br /> Today, Mammoth Cave National Park (the park) comprises approximately 52,830 acres in Edmonson, Hart, and Barren counties in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Visitors are drawn to the park by its caves, scenic river valleys, bluffs, forests, and abundant wildlife. The park offers ranger-led cave tours and surface walks, camping, hiking, horseback riding, bicycling, scenic drives, canoeing and kayaking, fishing, accessible trails, and picnicking. This breadth of activities is available because Mammoth Cave National Park is a park on two levels—reclaimed hardwood forest and winding riverways above, and complex cave systems below.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>African American History at Mammoth Cave</strong><br /> The history of enslavement and manumission at Mammoth Cave began in the earliest days of the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> century, when teams of enslaved Africans and African Americans labored extracting minerals from cave soil for the commercial production of gunpowder before and during the War of 1812. Commercial tours began almost immediately after and continued through the Civil </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">War, when several skirmishes and battles, including the battle of Munfordville in September of 1862, occurred less than 20 miles from the cave entrance.</span></p> <p>Serving as guides and explorers at Mammoth Cave partially rescued at least four men from the obscurity of enslavement. Stephen Bishop, Materson Bransford, Nicholas Bransford, and Alfred Croghan, all had their existence documented in the written journals and diaries of various 19<sup>th</sup> century Mammoth Cave visitors. They were physically described, their personalities contemplated, their intelligence gauged, and their dialects imitated. At least one abolitionist characterized Stephen Bishop, who found many miles of new cave passages, as a charismatic natural leader who could govern the citizenry of freedmen in Liberia, should he choose to relocate there.</p> <p>Modern cavers and researchers have monitored the cave explorations of these men for years. Their dated signatures are found in various places around the cave, often documenting discovery dates of passageways and exploration parties involved. With the exception of Mat Bransford, the personal and professional lives of enslaved Mammoth Cave Guides are shrouded in mystery and continue to be researched. The park’s cultural and geographic landscape, including segregated cemeteries, lends some understanding of these early guides, their families, and their enslavement.</p> <p><strong>Content used with permission from Eastern National’s <a href=\"http://generalstore.eparks.com/store/product/92424/Guidebook-to-African-American-History-in-the-National-Parks/\">Guidebook to African American History in National Parks.</a></strong></p>",

Pipes carried water from the waterfall at the entrance of the cave to these leeching vats. The water slowly seeped through the layers of dirt, pulling with it the nitrates from the soil. The muddy solution would travel through the filter made by the interlocking logs at the bottom, separating debris from the nitrate rich water. The mixture was piped to the surface and placed in large cauldrons where workers would add some ingredients and then boil it down until all that was left was a crystal known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/saltpetre-mining.htm\">saltpetre</a>. This crystal is the number one ingredient of black gun powder. America was still young at the time of this operation and the saltpetre created here became very important during the War of 1812. By the end of the war in 1815, America had maintained its freedom. Unfortunately, the majority of the workers in the saltpetre production were enslaved men who would not reap the benefit of freedom for themselves. <br /> <br /> With the end of saltpetre production a new means of industry would develop here at Mammoth Cave. A steel door was installed in the Houchin’s Narrows barring entry. Curious bystanders would now need to purchase a ticket to gain entry into the darkness. Parties were led by local guides that had knowledge of the cave. By 1816, tourism would become the new business model for Mammoth Cave. What do you think it was like for those early visitors?</p>",

Long exposure to cooking and heating fires in the cold clammy cave wrecked havoc on their weakened conditions. The cure for consumption would not be found in the depths of Mammoth Cave. <br /> <br /> The eight wooden huts are no longer standing due to development of tourist trails and people venturing too close to the historic buildings. The second stone building in the distance had to be stabilized. The reconstruction of the shelter left some of the walls incomplete.</p>",

Following his return to Kentucky, Lynn and several friends were camped in the Green River Area. Lynn became separated from his friends and could not be found for several days. Each night, they returned from the search reporting “No Lynn.” The river at which they camped became known as the Nolin.</p> <p>Many of the early settlers in the area around the Nolin River came from Nordic regions which is reflected in community names such as Stockholm and Sweeden. Others came from France, showing influence through community names like Moutardier and Chalybeate.

For it is told that one day when his cave friends need him, the giant shall rise from his slumber and walk these passages once more. Till that day, people like you and I can help protect this subterranean world for future generations.</p>",

The overlook provides a scenic view of the northside, a section accessed by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/green-river-ferry.htm\">Green River Ferry</a> within the park.<br /> Depending on season and leaf cover, there may also be a view of Turnhole Bend Spring. When river travel was common, this spring area connecting to the Green River provided a wide enough space for river boats to turn around safely. While this turn around area is no longer used, the name remains as an artifact of that time period.</p>",

On the surface, water has found a weak spot in the sandstone caprock and over time has dripped down creating a vertical shaft. It was here that early guides would stop with their groups and spin a tale about being able to tell what time it was by the steady dripping of the water. The story has been passed down through generations of guides. Earning this location the name, “The Water Clock”. Is it possible to tell the correct time by the dripping? … This is simply a tall tale. The drip rate is never constant due to the rainfall from the surface. </p>",

Moving rocks, they crawled into a passage shown on no map. Their lights found burnt touches, untouched since the last visitors left them – over 2000 years earlier. The researchers left until they could bring an archaeologist with them to record the find. In time, they would name the new passage “Watson Trace” after archaeologist Patty Jo Watson and geologist Red Watson, whose research here led to much of what we know today about Mammoth Cave’s ancient explorers. This section of the cave is not open to the public. <br /> <br /> NPS Mobile App Users: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=C67BF6F7-FB1A-4D3D-911B-67AAC53826CD\">Click here to watch a video of a ranger at Watson Trace.</a> </p>",

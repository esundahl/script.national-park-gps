It is also extremely important to note that the root is toxic if ingested at any point. Only the stalks and leaves should be eaten. <br /> <br /> Medicinally, Angelica has been used for hundreds of years, and around the world, not just in the Northwest Arctic. The root can be used outside the body to help for aches, pains, sores, cuts, and more. The best way to use the root is by cutting, mashing, and boiling it to create a poltice and then placing it directly on treatment area, even for deep pains.<br /> <br /> Chewing on the leaves is said to cure a head cold and the many symptoms associated with it. <br /> <br /> Native Siberians inhaled fumes of the roasted Angelica root for a seasickness remedy.<br /> <br /> This plant should not be confused with the Poison Water Hemlock (Cicuta mackenzieana) which also grows in the region. There are many ways to tell these two plants apart. Wild celery smells strongly like celery. Its flowers are in a stiff, flat cluster with wide, flat leaves. Poision water hemlock on the other hand has loose flowers and thin leaves. It also has an obvious waxy look when compared to wild celery.<br /> <br /> Sources: <ul> <li>Jones, Anore. <i>Plants That We Eat: Nauriat Nigiñaqtuat</i>.

Many are drawn to the area thanks to the nearby backcountry landing strip.<br /> <br /> By base camping from the landing strip to the west of Copter Peak, you can explore many of the nearby peaks and valleys through day hikes. Willows surrounded the area, and little streams cut through the valleys between tall, craggy mountains. Everywhere you look are beautiful sights to see.<br /> <br /> The area delights many animal seekers as it is home to the more reclusive Dall Sheep. There are also opportunities to see many other animals such as bears, moose, many species of birds, and more. Hunters use this general area for caribou hunting.<br /> <br /> This area has been used for thousands of years for hunting and gathering purposes by the Iñupiaq people who still inhabit the area to this day. On-going subsistence activites in the area keep people connected to the land.<br /> <br /> Visiting Copter Peak is not for the faint-hearted. This is a remote area that offers no amenities. Visitors must pack in and out all their necessities. However, for the experienced backpacker, this site offers a beautiful area to spend a week in the quiet of the Alaskan backcountry.",

This area draws hunters and backpackers alike.<br /> <br /> Desperation Lake is a site of a traditional Iñupiaq settlement and has been utilized for thousands of years. Archaeology is ongoing in the area.<br /> <br /> A rock-lined qargi has been found near Desperation Lake. Qargi are traditional gathering spaces for the Iñupiaq. They served as a meeting space for the men of the community. These structures were larger than the average home to allow space for dancing, boat building, sporting competitions, and community gatherings. They also served as a place to share the oral history and traditions of the Iñupiaq with the next generation. Nearly every Iñupiaq settlement had a qargi. <br /> <br /> Caribou hunting is among the many reasons this site has been utilized. Caribou would be driven into the lake by hunters using drive lines, or strategically positioned rocks. These rocks would trick the caribou into believing there were predators on high ridgelines and they would herd themselves onto lower ground and, eventually, into the lake. Caribou are much slower in the water, giving hunters the opportunity to get closer to them. The hunters would use umiaqs (boats) to get along side a caribou, allowing for the safe dispatching of a single animal without harm to the herd and the hunters.<br /> <br /> Hunting by boat is still used to this day by many local subsistence hunters. In the fall, Desperation Lake continues to draw hunters for plentiful hunting opportunities it provides.",

A favorite plant of many animals, including moose, the feltleaf willow can be found in boreal forests or along side water in the tundra. <br /> <br /> The willow family has many successful members in the greater tundra area. The most easily recognizable of them, however, is the feltleaf. Feltleaf willow come in all shapes and sizes and can be anywhere from one to 20 feet tall. Although smooth to start, the stems and the leaves gain a nice fuzzy appearance as they mature.<br /> <br /> The young, tender shoots can be eaten once the bark is removed. Many compare the taste to cucumbers at this stage. As the shoots age, their flavor becomes woodier, making them less sought after. <br /> <br /> Like most willows, the Feltleaf has long been used for medicinal purposes. The bark of the willows contain salicin, an active ingredient that is compared to aspirin. It has been known to help with mouth sores, headaches, colds, fevers, and bee stings. Some will draw medicinal benefits from this plant by simply stripping the bark off and placing it directly in their mouth to be chewed. Others brew the bark into a tea. It is believed that animals will seek out willows to help ease their pains as well.<br /> <br /> Sources: <ul> <li>Jones, Anore. <i>Plants That We Eat: Nauriat Nigiñaqtuat</i>.

One of the popular float destinations is the Noatak River. Many of these floaters are surprised when they discover themselves in the middle of a deep canyon. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon of the Noatak is beautiful proof of a dynamic landscape. Hills and mountains form, pushing the land toward the sky, and rivers wear them them back down again over the course of thousands of years. Unlike many rivers of the lower 48, the Noatak River runs free. Its course can change as needed, carving new paths; and its water levels rise and fall with the seasons. However, this canyon stands as witness that at least a portion of the river has been in the same place for a long time. <br /> <br /> Fishing is a popular activity along the Noatak River. Backpackers and floaters supplement their packed foods with fish as they continue their journey. <br /> <br /> Humans are not the only animal drawn to these waters. Wildlife in Noatak National Preserves will venture to its edges to drink or forage for fish. Bears, caribou, moose, fox, and more use the area.

It grows low to the ground and boasts bright pink flowers in the spring and bright red berries in the late summer and fall. The berries are known for being tart when compared to other tundra berries. Although they can be eaten at almost any time, locals wait until after the first frost to pick lingonberry to allow for the flavor to fully develop.<br /> <br /> Lingonberries have been proven to contain more antioxidants than commercially grown cranberries, increasing their health benefit. Lingonberries have been used traditionally for medicine as well. Chewing the berries can help a sore throat, headache, or relieve an upset stomach<br /> <br /> While looking at the patch of Lingonberry, you may notice a few other plants growing along side of it. One of these such plants is tundra tea.<br /> <br /> Tundra tea (Ledum palustre) grows abundantly in our area. You may also hear this plant referred to as Eskimo tea, Labrador tea, or Tilaaqqiuq (Iñupiaq). The plant boasts a cluster of small white or pinkish flowers and narrow green leaves on a long brown stem. <br /> <br /> Medicinally, making a tea from the leaves is good for colds, inflammation, arthritis, and works as a laxative. Local wisdom either picking the leaves very young, or gatherings the leaves in the fall and winter after they have dried out as it changes the levels of certain chemicals in the leaves. <br /> <br /> However, this plant contains ledol, a toxin known to cause unwanted symptoms such as diarrhea and drowsiness if used in excess. This plant should only be used in moderation. It is not suggested for those with diabetes or heart conditions. </p> <p><br /> Sources:</p> <ul> <li>Jones, Anore. <i>Plants That We Eat: Nauriat Nigiñaqtuat</i>.

This striking plant can be found on the tundra, especially in the marshy areas.<br /> <br /> Sourdock's most recognizable feature is its tall, thin stalk that is often bright red in color. The stalk is a short-lived feature. A more standard part of the plant to see during tundra exploring is its large, flat leaves that can be tipped in bright red.<br /> <br /> The leaves are the most commonly eaten portion of the plant. Typically people will freeze or cook them before consuming. This reduces the amount of oxalic acid in the leaves, which can be harmful if eaten in large amounts. Small amounts of raw leaves are not considered harmful, but always exercise caution when consuming.  <br /> <br /> Sourdock has the ability to be used as a laxative. Only small amounts of the plant are needed to help cure stomach and bladder troubles.

In Iñupiaq, it is known as Sargiq or Sargiġruaq. Although the common name makes it sound like this plant is disliked, Stinkweed is known as the miracle plant of the area and can be used for any number of fixes. <br /> <br /> True to its name, this plant carries a very distinct smell. It is difficult to describe, but even more difficult to forget. Once you are in front of the plant, reach out and gently rub one of the leaves. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the other plants on our garden tour, Sargiq is not encouraged as a food source. Small amounts can be ingested in tea form or as spices. However, certain species of Artemisia can contain absinthol and, when overindulged upon, can cause serious side effects such as tremors. <br /> <br /> Stinkweed can be utilized in a variety of forms, including tea, poltice, salve, oil, simply dried or even as a soak. <br /> <br /> Tea can be drank to help with cold symptoms and indegestion. <br /> <br /> A poltice of leaves, salve, or the oil can be placed directly on sores or cuts to help draw out infections, reduce scar tissue, and speed the healing process. Salves can also be used as a moisturizer for cracked hands through the winter. <br /> <br /> Dried leaves can be placed inside pillows and set under aching joints. This is said to help with arthritis. Or they can be placed in shoes to help dry the items while reducing microbes that may be causing unpleasant smells found there. This is also a treatment for athlete's foot. Some even use sargiq in their babies diapers to this day.  <br /> <br /> It is also called wormwood as it has been used historically to clear intestinal worms from livestock. Humans with issues of round worms or pinworms may benefit from drinking the tea regularly. There has been some research to suggest wormwood can be helpful to those suffering from malaria. <br /> <br /> What a miracle plant! It is no wonder that sargiq is the most frequently turned to of the local medicinal plants!<br /> <br /> Sources:  <ul> <li>Jones, Anore. <i>Plants That We Eat: Nauriat Nigiñaqtuat</i>.

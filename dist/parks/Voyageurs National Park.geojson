This bedrock dates from the birth of North America. Some 2.8 billion years ago, massive volcanoes erupted through this area and deposited layer after layer of ash and lava, building up the island landmasses. These island arc volcanoes collided forming still larger landmasses. Subsequent uplifting, folding, superheating along with tremendous pressure created igneous and metamorphic rock to form the present day granite and schist of the Kabetogama Peninsula. Eons of erosion then wore down these volcanic mountain ranges to the landscape you see today. </p> <h4>Visiting Anderson Bay </h4>   <p>Anderson Bay exemplifies the outstanding scenery for which Voyageurs was established. The exposed white granite cliffs of Anderson Bay rise 80 feet from the water and provide spectacular views of the bay and Rainy Lake. It is one of the most photographed areas of the park. There are picnic tables, fire ring, and privy at this Visitor Destination and Day Use site. Visitors can also hike the 1.75-mile loop trail to see the bluffs from the top. In addition, this is the northern trailhead for the 9.5 mile, one way, Cruiser Lake Trail system that crosses the Kabetogama Peninsula to connect with Lost Bay on Kabetogama Lake. </p>",

Jack Ellsworth, the garden’s creator and a self-taught artist, used natural elements of the native northern Minnesota landscape as his artistic media, creating an original and distinctive art environment on the north shore of Kabetogama Lake. <br /> <br /> Over a period of roughly twenty years, Ellsworth, a carpenter from Chicago, used art and engineering to create a complex, terraced garden on a prominent rock outcrop. Ellsworth constructed 62 terraced flower beds on the outcrop, which he filled with more than 13,000 lilies and other flower varieties. He then accented his garden landscape with over 200 abstract rock sculptures that have been compared to the work of modern sculptors like Noguchi and Brancusi. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness and magnitude of Mr. Ellsworth’s creation and the garden’s importance as a recreational destination since the 1940s establish its significance. The gardens are eligible for the National Register for Historic Places and are the most popular day use destination in Voyageurs National Park. </p>",

This Day Use site has a picnic table and fire ring. Visitors are welcome to enjoy a shore lunch while immersing themselves in Voyageurs’ fishing history. Peek into the ice house, relax, watch for birds, and enjoy Harry Oveson’s life on Rainy Lake. <br /> <br /> Harry Oveson was born in 1906 in Roseau, Minnesota and moved with his family, in 1921, to International Falls. In his youth, he worked at many different jobs; from his father’s bait and tackle shop to the local lumber mill. During the Great Depression, Harry engaged in train hopping to travel across America. During World War II, Harry served in the U.S. Army stationed in Alaska. In 1959, he settled on Rainy Lake to build his fish camp.<br /> <br /> In a typical day, Harry would rise before dawn and often see the sun come up from his front window. By 6:00 am he headed out on his 16-foot Alumacraft boat to lift his nets, remove the fish, and reset the nets for the next morning’s catch. At 10:00 am he would be back at the fish house to prepare and pack the fish. He removed the entrails of the whitefish, but the walleye could be packed whole. His catch of the day would be packaged in fish boxes and put on crushed ice for transport. A good day’s catch would produce around 300 lbs. of whitefish and 50 lbs. of walleye. As a bachelor, he was content with his dog Goofball and the various birds that frequented his North Woods haven. Quiet evenings and dark skys made for excellent reading and star gazing, two of Harry’s other interests.</p>",

Visitors can enjoy the area as a day use visitor destination. This site provides park visitors a dock, picnic tables, and a privy. The historic boathouse, cabins, ice house, and root cellar are open for exploration. The pilings for the trestles and railroad grade can also be seen.</p> <h4>History</h4>   <p><em>The Logging Era<br /> Camp 75</em><br /> <br /> In 1905 Edward Hines and the Weyerhaeuser family pooled their resources to create the Virginia and Rainy Lake Lumber Company. The flag ship of the company was its sawmill in Virginia, Minnesota, which could process one million board feet of lumber a day.<br /> <br /> To transport logs to the sawmill before the days of modern logging technology, logs had to be floated down rivers and winched across lakes in giant booms by amphibious boats called gators. Hoist Bay, home of the Virginia and Rainy Lake Logging Camp 75, was one of these destinations.<br /> <br /> At Hoist Bay, a hoist machine lifted the logs out of the water and placed them on empty train cars for transportation. Pictured below is the railroad trestle and hoist built across the water. The train then transported the logs to Virginia, Minnesota to be cut into boards.<br /> <br /> Between 1913 and 1929 the camp in Hoist Bay operated for 16 years. In its lifetime, 13.5 million board feet of lumber entered its waters. By 1929 most of the white and red pine stands were cut; Camp 75 was shut down and dismantled, ending one part of the Hoist Bay story.<br /> <br /> <em>The Recreation Era<br /> Monson's Resort</em><br /> <br /> The Hoist Bay area lay dormant for almost 10 years, changing ownership 50 times, until 1939 when Ted and Fern Monson purchased the land, starting a new chapter in its history.<br /> <br /> When the Monsons arrived, there were few reminders of the previous logging era. The only remnants included the railroad trestle, an old root cellar, and a garbage dump.<br /> <br /> Between 1939 and 1945 the Monsons built 4 cabins; each cabin had 4 bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. Modern amenities such as indoor bathrooms and electricity were added in the 1950s.<br /> <br /> In all, the Monsons built 14 buildings that were enjoyed by summer visitors, and they catered to their guests’ needs for 35 years only closing for 3 years during World War 2.<br /> <br /> Ted and Fern decided to sell the resort in 1973, and in 1978 the Hoist Bay land was acquired by the National Park Service. It was designated a point of interest for visitors, and a new chapter in the history of Hoist Bay began.</p>",

Due to this plant’s prolific roots and early growing season, reed canary grass stole resources from vulnerable native plants, transforming this once bountiful site into a barren field. The term ‘ethnobotanical' refers to the cultural importance of the native plants and their uses to the local inhabitants. By the early 1700s the Ojibwe people had moved into the area that is now Voyageurs National Park and remain closely connected to this land. </p> <p paraeid=\"{208c138a-94ad-41f0-a3bf-3dfa576e2227}{235}\" paraid=\"1368233752\">Our lives depend on the environment in which we live.

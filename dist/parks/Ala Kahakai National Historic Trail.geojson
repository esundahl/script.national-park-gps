It may seem like just a simple trail, but if you look closely it will tell the story of the progression from footpaths to roadways.<br /> <br /> Imagine what this island would look like with no roads…. How about with no trails! It would certainly be difficult to get around in this rugged lava landscape. When the Polynesian Voyagers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands, that was their reality. An untouched, rugged, lava wilderness. So, in ancient times, a network of trails was constructed to connect people, places, and resources.<br /> <br /> This section of trail is called the 1871 Trail, due to improvements made in… You guessed it, 1871. However, this small segment of trail is just one section of the larger Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail which is the 175-mile-long trail corridor that traverses from the northernmost tip of the island, along the western edge, around the southern tip and into Puna.<br /> <br /> This historic trail generally follows the ancient coastal <i>alaloa</i>, or long trail that formed primary route of travel around the island. The alaloa that the Ala Kahakai NHT follows is sometimes referred to as the <em>\"</em><i>alanui aupuni</i>,\" the Hawaiian Kingdom government road, that you can still see as the \"King's Trail\" in North Kona/South Kohala or the \"Māmalahoa Trail\" in North Kona which intersects our sister park, Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park. This ancient network of trail also included shorter more locally important trails like the <i>alahele</i> that ran laterally with the shoreline, and the <i>mauka-makai</i> trails, that ran from upland areas to coastal areas.<br /> <br /> Over the years, many of these anicent trails were straightened and widened to reflect changes in transportation while others were simply abandoned. Some of the trails that survived the tests of time were preserved, like the Ala Kahakai NHT, or even converted into roadways we know today. As you continue down the trail you see evidence of this evolution as you will pass historic and ancient structures, see impressive geologic features, and immerse yourself in the <i>kahakai</i> (coastal) environment.</p>",

That's a <em>hōlua </em>sledding track. <em>Heʻe hōlua</em>, \"sled surfing,\" or \"land sledding,\" was a popular sport in Hawaiʻi. A hōlua slide was made of dry-laid local stones taking advantage of the natural inclines or hills to create a long-sloped ramp that was then covered in fresh soil and reeds making a slick surface which was then lubricated with <em>kukui </em>(candlenut) oil.<br /> <br /> Individual riders rode down the slide on a <em>papa hōlua</em> (sled), often reaching speeds of up to 60 miles per hour (96.6 kph) The papa hōlua was carved from wood and was long and narrow in shape with two runners held apart by crosspieces. Two smaller rails sat on top of the crosspieces and acted as a platform. The whole sled was lashed together with coconut fiber. The sled could be as long as 14 feet (4.3 m) and weigh as much as 50 pounds (22.7 kg). See a replica of a papa hōlua in the bookstore at the visitor center.<br /> <br /> The papa hōlua's design allowed riders a choice of different riding techniques on their journey to the bottom of the slide, with two techniques being the most popular. Riders using the first technique would stand sideways on the papa hōlua, kick with one foot to launch themselves, and then put both feet on the sled and extend their arms for balance – much like a modern snowboard rider. Sliders using the second technique would jump onto the papa hōlua chest-down, face forward, and grip the narrow sled tightly for control. Both techniques allowed skilled sliders to steer the papa hōlua by shifting their body weight. Control of the papa hōlua was essential as a mistake or loss of control meant injury or possible death.<br /> <br /> He'e hōlua was a prestigious sport in the Hawaiian Islands. It was played mostly during <em>Makahiki</em>, the four-month winter New Year's celebration in honor of the <i>akua </i>(god) Lono, and only the Hawaiian <i>ali'i</i> (chiefs) were allowed to compete in the races.<br /> <br /> Would you be brave enough to test your skill on the papa hōlua?</p>",

These walls are constructed using <i>uhau humu pohaku </i>or traditional dry-set masonry. Instead of using mortar or cement between stones, walls are held together by friction, requiring precise placement of stones. Walls such as these are used to divided property and are built as boundary markers. Enclosed stone walls seen here and along the trail were garden plots or animal pens. Networks of stone walls, called <i>kuaiwi, </i>could also serve as raised trails or causeways themselves.<br /> <br /> You may also notice that stones line the edges of the trail. These curbstones were part of improvements made to the 1871 trail when it was widened to easily accommodate two horses at one time. The curbstones delineated the trail making it easier for pack animals to follow it without constant guidance from their riders. Around the island, these types of “two horse trails” were constructed during an 80-year period lasting from 1841-1918. In 1918, the section north of Hōnaunau underwent a further evolution when it was modified to accommodate wheeled traffic. You might have even driven on it on your way to the park! However, this section south to Hoʻokena was never modified for motorized vehicles and remains a historic trail, frozen in time.</p>",

In his book, <em>Letters from Hawaii</em>, Mark Twain described what he believed was the tumultuous history of these cliffs:</p> <blockquote> <p>“<i>An old volcanic eruption sent its broad river of fire down the mountainside here, and it poured down in a great torrent from an overhanging bluff some fifty feet high to the ground below.

        "notes": "H - Alahaka Ramp\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/alahaka-ramp.htm\n\n<p>Another historic improvement to the 1871 trail was the construction of the Alahaka Ramp, the massive stone ramp that connects the trail to Kiʻilae Village. Historical accounts collected over the years indicate that access to Kiʻilae, prior to the construction of the ramp, was via a ladder or rope. So, it was pretty dangerous!<br /> <br /> There is no clear indication as to when the original ramp was built, but it most likely occurred sometime in the mid-1800s when a series of large-scale government programs were initiated to improve to public resources, such as roadways. However, the first version of the ramp would definitely not have held up to our modern-day safety standards. Local <em>paniolo</em> (Hawaiian cowboys) described the original ramp as the “one-foot-out trail,” as they would ride up and down the ramp with one foot out of the stirrup just in case they had to make a hasty escape due to the poor condition of the ramp.<br /> <br /> Due to this dangerous part of the commute to Kiʻilae village, improvements were made in 1868 to widen and stabilize the ramp. In a letter to the Hawaiian Kingdom Minister of the Interior dated Feb. 4, 1868 George Hardy, the road supervisor at the time, said: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"<i>In South Kona, I have repaired [a very] bad place known by the name of Alahaka in the village of Ki'ilae, a place of great danger where several horses had been kill'd: and where people were [sic] in danger of going up and down. I have made it wide and a substantial road</i>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately later that year, in 1868 there was a particularly destructive eruption event from Mauna Loa that caused multiple massive earthquakes (7-7.9) which in turn caused tsunamis and landslides across the island. During this event, the ramp may have been damaged and by the late 1890’s the Alahaka Ramp had fallen into a state of disrepair. In a letter dated December 31, 1897 road supervisor T. H. Wright wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"<i>Napo’opo’o to Ho’okena beach road in a fearful condition, it needs repair of the worst kind. The Walahaka [Alahaka] pali (cliff) is very dangerous. This road is used every day for the convenience of the public, going and back to these places</i>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Over the years, repairs were made, but in 1951, a large earthquake caused an upper section of the ramp to slough off and that continued to deteriorate. So, when the National Park Service came in, about twelve years later, the ramp was once again in a state of disrepair. This prompted a major stabilization project to restore and strengthen the Alahaka Ramp. Stabilization efforts consisted of removing the earthquake-damaged sections, clearing away boulders, and rebuilding the entire <em>makai</em> (ocean-facing) side.<br /> <br /> Given its proximity to the ocean and the cliffside, even today the Alahaka Ramp requires periodic maintenance and stabilization as a result of high surf, storm, and earthquakes. During the most recent effort, which occurred in 2010, NPS crews repaired a damaged portion of the outer face and stabilized the ramp buttress and trail trea This, of course, was no easy feat, as the work was located right along the steep ocean cliffside.<br /> <br /> As the years go on, and climate change causes increased storm intensity and sea level rise, these coastal trails will require a sustained joint effort to continue to preserve these pieces of history and the stories they contain. <i>What is something or someplace that means a lot to you that is threatened by climate change?</i> <i>What efforts do you hope are taken to preserve it?</i></p>",

And for the John Ahu house site that you see before you on the <em>makai</em> (ocean) side of the trail, the location was in a very prime spot indeed! Not only for expansive ocean views that would cause the price of this house site to soar in modern times, but also easy access to the main route of travel and the ocean. Below the house site is one of the few suitable canoe landing spots along this stretch of coast. As you continue down the trail a little bit, look back up at the house site and notice the gradual slope down to the water. That’s the spot! In addition to being able to land a canoe, this cove was also the only place with deep enough sheltered waters for larger boats to unload goods to exchange with villagers.<br /> <br /> When finding a place for one’s house, it’s important to make sure that you are close to all amenities, especially water. While there is certainly ample saltwater available at this location, fresh water is often hard to come by. In this part of the island, there are no streams or rivers to provide freshwater and instead, freshwater sources are either collected rainwater or the brackish water of anchialine pools.<br /> <br /> In Kiʻilae village most of the houses had thatched roofs and only the most well-to-do houses, like the John Ahu house, had tin roofing. With tin roofing came the ability of water catchment, and thus the cistern that you can see in what remains of the house site. However, even with water catchment, rain on the South Kona coast is not guaranteed, and in many cases, the Ahu cistern had to be filled via mule train from the wetter areas up <em>mauka </em>(mountain).<br /> <br /> Even today, many residents of South Kona live on rainwater catchment systems, however when the catchment is low, water trucks and roads allow for much easier access to freshwater than the mule trains of the past.</p>",

        "notes": "L - Kiʻilae Village\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/kiilaevillage.htm\n\n<p>Kiʻilae Village offers a glimpse into the past, when Hawaiʻi was changing rapidly, but still supported traditional aspects of daily life. With the arrival of Europeans in the Hawaiian Islands, many things changed. New plants and animals were introduced and settlements began moving away from the coastal villages to the more fertile uplands and larger harbor cities. What remains in Kiʻilae today are abandoned house sites, agricultural features, animal pens, and salt pans that can be seen from more recent times.<br /> <br /> It is not known exactly when Kiʻilae village was established, but it may have been inhabited as early as the 1600’s due to availability of water, fishing grounds and upland fields. Indigenous knowledge points to the early settlement at Kiʻilae as a place where <em>kahuna</em> (priests) trained. By the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Kiʻilae had a population of approximately 100 people consisting of about 10 extended families.<br /> <br /> Unlike the difficulty assigning a beginning date for Ki‘ilae Village, the end of its occupation is well documented. By 1913 only one family remained in coastal Ki‘ilae, and sometime the 1930’s the last full time resident moved away. Its depopulation was largely the result of a changing economy that focused increasingly around the mauka areas near the current Māmalahoa Highway. Green (1993:534) explains the changing economy and shifting population with the following:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>The improved belt road around the island, which provided access to trade centers, effectively isolated the shoreline settlements, causing much of their population to move inland nearer to the road and the kula garden areas.</i></p> </blockquote> <p>So, it seems that the change in community pattern along this coast was triggered not only from the evolution of transportation in the area, but also a change in the economy from a barter economy to a “work-for-money” economy.<br /> <br /> As you continue along the trail into the heart of Kiʻilae village, remember to stay on trail and practice Leave No Trace principles to help protect these sites.</p>",

They were fisherman.<br /> <br /> Like many Kiʻilae residents, fishing was essential for survival, but it was hard work. Most fishing gear was handmade, including the wooden canoes used to access the coastal waters. Fisherman, like the Kahikinas, would fish for <i>ʻōpelu</i> (mackerel scad) as well as <em>ahi</em> (tuna) if two people were available to haul the large fish aboard. Fisherman would often feed the fish, banging on the outside of their canoe beforehand to alert the fish. The fish would then gather, and a large catch could easily be achieved. These fish were a major source of income for members of the community. Fresh fish were sold by girls door-to-door before school and any fish leftover could be dried and sold to stores.<br /> <br /> John Kahikina, one of the last to leave Kiʻilae, was an expert octopus fisherman. To see below the surface of the water when he was fishing, he would chew kukui nuts and then spit them in the water. The oil from the kukui nuts would create a make-shift window to the depths, allowing him to drop his lure on top of the octopus and quickly pull it up.<br /> <br /> However, as times begain to change, the traditional way of living could no longer sustain the remaining Kahikinas and as Frances Jackson states in his report on Kiʻilae Village,</p> <blockquote> <p>“John Kahikina explained, there was “<em>Nothing to do, no work.</em>” The coastal waters still could be fished, the kula gardens were there, but the economy had changed; a money-making job was almost a necessity.”</p> </blockquote>",

These trails are referred to as mauka-makai trails and highlight the importance of connecting the resources available from mountain to ocean.<br /> <br /> In ancient Hawaiʻi, the land was divided into long sections called ahupuaʻa that ran from the mountain to the ocean providing the people living in them almost everything they needed to survive. Larger trees for carving from the forest, fertile lands with ample rainfall in the <i>kula</i> (uplands), and abundant ocean resources from the <i>kahakai</i> (coastal area). Resources from each area were meticulously managed and shared throughout the ahupuaʻa along mauka-makai trails.<br /> <br /> While the primary village area for Kiʻilae was concentrated in this coastal area around the 1871 trail, as historian Frances Jackson (1966) states,</p> <blockquote> <p>“to attempt to show Ki‘ilae Village as existing only at the shore would show barely a third of the life of the villagers.” </p> </blockquote> <p>Families also maintained <i>kula</i> gardens with <em>ʻuala</em> (sweet potato), yams, pumpkins, squash, <em>kō</em> (sugar cane), papaya, <em>maiʻa</em> (bananas),<em> pia</em> (arrowroot), <em>ipu </em>(gourds), and <em>ulu</em> (breadfruit). These <i>kula</i> gardens were located far enough upslope to receive regular rain. In addition to kula gardens, many also cared for dryland <em>kalo</em> (taro) fields located even further upslope. A network of trails connected fields to field houses and to a mauka-makai trail that served as the main artery for travel between the <i>mauka</i> gardens and the coastal residences.<br /> <br /> This is no longer a maintained trail.

These walls enclosed house sites, or pā hale, and kept out animals such as pigs, cows, and goats that roamed the are Walls would rarely have gates and instead would have places built up to step over the wall into the house site. Later, stone walls were modified to accommodate ranching operations in the area.<br /> <br /> Within the walls would be a house platform upon which a house would be built. In Kiʻilae village, the majority of the houses were the old-style thatched grass houses. However, the more “well-to-do” houses were constructed with modern lumber and had tin roofs, like the John Ahu house. Showing the transitional nature of these times, some houses met halfway with thatched walls and a tin roof. Houses typically were just one large room for the entire family.<br /> <br /> One of the things that all of these house site had in common was the lack of a bathroom or even a pit outhouse. Bathing was done in the ocean and other activities were just done outside or in the tidal areas. The village also did not have electricity. In the evenings, light was provided by kerosene lanterns or kukui nut lights in which sundried kukui nuts were strung onto coconut midribs and lit. According to residents, one string of kukui nuts would last half the night.<br /> <br /> In the “yard” of the pā hale, families would grow any useful or decorative plant that could survive in the dry coastal environment, but most of the food was grown in the kula gardens upslope. “Yards” would also have a designated area for garbage, sometimes walled off from the rest of the area.<br /> <br /> <em>How are these traditional pā hale different or similar to the home you live in today?</em></p>",

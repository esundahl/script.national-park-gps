A walk along the Rio Grande leads to the entrance of a magnificent limestone gorge that splits the Sierra del Carmen Mountains. Along the way, look for ancient fossils that existed when this area was under an ocean, and pre-historic grinding holes that indigenous inhabitants used in food production.<br /> <br /> This area is also a great place for scenic photography. The colors on the Sierra del Carmen at sunset are well worth the journey. During summer months, it is best to explore the canyon in the mornings, since daytime temperatures often exceed 110 degrees. Water and good footwear are essential items here, and for any hike in the Chihuahuan Desert. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> From the parking lot, this trail climbs a small rise before descending to the Rio Grande. The trail surface is rock and dirt. Once down at river level, the trail transitions to sand and the remainder of the walk is a flat, pleasant stroll along the river. Eventually the high limestone walls and the river prevent further travel and it's time to turn around and head back to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> The paved parking lot provides parking for about 15 vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Bring plenty of water!</span></em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike.

In the early part of the 20th century, hardy homesteaders constructed not only dwellings, but an elaborate network of irrigation ditches so they could farm the Rio Grande floodplain. The crops they planted and harvested included cotton, melons, and corn. These crops were either grown for their own consumption, or sold to provide income. <br /> This adobe house is the last remaining Daniels Ranch structure. It undergoes periodic conservation treatment that allows visitors to see a great example of adobe architecture. The entire system of irrigation ditches remain visible throughout the farm complex. The ditches extend from the building eastward through the campground, and almost 1/2 mile north of the Rio Grande Village visitor center. Some of the ditches are currently used to provide water to the campground and the Black Hawk nesting area. A portion of the irrigation complex north of the campground is being removed to restore that area to conditions similar to the pre-homestead era.  ",

The area was also a popular place for ancient Americans for thousands of years. The confluence of Tornillo Creek and the Rio Grande was especially inviting as important food sources are available in greater quantities than the area further from the river. The hot water emanating from the edge of the river was, and is, inviting to all who found this spot. Evidence of ancient people is found on the rocks in the form of pictographs and petroglyphs. While the meaning is lost to time, one can ponder their relevance, or simply enjoy the view. <br /> <br /> J.O Langford had heard of the springs, and since he was in ill health, decided to homestead here since hot springs were purported to heal all ills. He improved the water catchment and started to develop a commercial enterprise that attracted tourists and those seeking health benefits. Mr. Langford left for a few years during the Mexican Revolution, but returned to begin business once again. He constructed the motor court, found just down the trail, to provide overnight lodging to guests. The business attracted customers from the United States and Mexico. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Maggie Smith took over operations and continued doing business even after the creation of the park.

Langford's impressive bathhouse is long gone; today the spring is contained by the foundation remains of the bathhouse, on the north bank of the Rio Grande. Relish a primitive bathing experience while enjoying unparalleled scenery.</p> <p>Along a stretch beginning upstream of Rio Grande Village, a series of thermal springs emerge adjacent to the Rio Grande. All of the hot springs in this region are believed to be related to normal faults. These Basin and Range type faults formed between 18 and 23 million years ago. Today, groundwater circulating deep in the earth becomes heated before it returns to the surface as hot springs.</p> <p>The most famous of the thermal features along the Big Bend of the Rio Grande is the Langford Hot Springs. Located where Tornillo Creek enters the Rio Grande, some four miles upriver from Boquillas Canyon and the Mexican village of Boquillas. The natural springs at the site are known as Boquillas Hot Springs. <em>Boquillas</em> is Spanish for \"little mouths\" and refers to the many small streams or arroyos that drain this part of the Sierra del Carmen range and flow into the Rio Grande. Later, when the springs were promoted for their health benefits, the settlement and spa resort there was called Hot Springs, and a post office by that name was established at the site in July 1914. Although there are several other small hot springs in the area, these larger and more accessible springs are the best known.</p> <p>Hot spring water is considered old water, fossil water, ancient and irreplaceable. Heated by geothermal processes and emerging at 105° F., the water carries dissolved mineral salts reputed to have healing powers. The water contains calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, and lithium. The springs' flow rate in 1936 was 250,000 gallons a day, but more recent measurements show a decrease. The therapeutic value of heat has long been touted as a remedy of both body and soul.</p> <p>Be aware that some hot springs can burn you either with the scalding effects of heat or the caustic nature of the water chemistry. Use caution when bathing and limit the exposure of children to the warm waters.</p> <h2><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Visiting the Langford Hot Springs</span></h2> <p>Contact <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/contacts.htm\">Big Bend National Park</a> for more information and before visiting to get any current conditions or updated information.  </p> <h3>The Rules</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Be respectful of others; soak only, and use no soaps or oils.</p> </li> <li> <p>Swimming is not recommended; be aware that adjacent river currents and depths can be unpredictable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Please help to keep the area clean by picking up trash.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alcoholic beverages and glass containers are prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>Overnight camping in the area of the Hot Springs is prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is illegal to purchase items from vendors operating on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Directions</h3> <h4><strong>Hot Springs Road</strong></h4> <p>The two-mile gravel road descends down a rough, narrow wash to the Hot Springs Historic District and trailhead area. <em>Note: Motor homes and oversize vehicles are prohibited on the one-way sections of the Hot Springs road.</em></p> <h4><strong>Hiking to the Hot Springs</strong></h4> <p>From the trailhead, the hot spring is a 0.5 mile round trip.

From the top of the short trail, you can see the remnants of the irrigation system and the tree-lined course of the Rio Grande. When this overlook was created in 1959, the cottonwood trees along the river were sparse and the river was visible from the top of this hill. If you look carefully at the cliff the tunnel goes through, the old road that originally went around the hill can be seen. The old road curve was known as Dead Man's Curve, due to a shooting that occurred here in the early 20th century.",

The first part of the trail is a boardwalk over a small pond that showcases riparian plants and animals. The trail proceeds up and around a small ridge that has a 360-degree view of the Rio Grande, the Sierra del Carmens in Mexico, and the Chisos Mountains in the park.<br /> <br /> This trail is great for first time as well as seasoned visitors. The mornings are alive with birdsong and animal life, and the late evenings showcase the colors of a typical Big Bend sunset.  <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> This trail begins from the back end of the campground. A level path leads to a wheelchair-accessible boardwalk that crosses a wetland area. The trail then becomes dirt and gravel and climbs to the top of, and back down, a small hill with the aid of wooden logs for steps. <br /> There are two small pullouts at the back end of the campground which provide parking for about four cars.  <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail. ",

A surprising animal to find in the desert, the beaver here along the Rio Grande are called \"bank beaver\" since they construct dens in the river bank instead of building lodges. Furthermore, the beaver is listed as an endangered species in Mexico and must compete with nutria, an exotic non-native species often seen in the pond. It is easy to mistake a nutria for a beaver, but close examination of the tail will reveal the differences in these two large rodents.

At first glance, ocotillo (pronounced “Oh-co-TEE-yo”) looks like a tall, spindly shrub that died - a cluster of drab, gray stalks covered in sharp half inch spines, and no obvious signs of life like leaves along the branches. This bare bones appearance is actually part of ocotillo’s desert survival strategy. Plants lose most of their water through their leaves during photosynthesis. Ocotillo and several other desert plants have adapted to desert life by moving the photosynthesis into their stems. This strategy of photosynthesis is not as efficient or as productive as in typical plants, but the plants do save a lot of water and that is the principal issue for a desert dweller. Leaves are either not produced, or only produced during wet times of the year when the water losses are affordable to the plant. <br /> The real surprise though is in the spring when seemingly “dead stalks” of ocotillo burst into bloom. Slender clusters of bright red orange, tubular flowers form at the ends of the stalks, and in areas with abundant ocotillo plants it can look like a red haze is hanging just above the plants from a distance! Ocotillo are often mistaken for cactus, but in fact they are a member of a small, unrelated family of primarily South American plants, of which it is the northernmost representative. ",

        "notes": "River Road - East\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/river-road-east.htm\n\n<p>The River Road traverses the remote southern portion of the park, roughly connecting the areas near Rio Grande Village and Castolon. While generally following the course of the Rio Grande, the road runs a considerable distance from the river, especially in its mid-section near Mariscal Mountain. You cannot actually see the river along the River Road unless you take a side trip to one of the primitive roadside campsites located next to the river. Due to its length and usually rough road conditions, allow a full day to drive from end to end.<br /> <br /> Before heading out on this road, be well prepared for safe backcountry driving with plenty of water, a jack, and good spare tire. On these isolated, infrequently patrolled backcountry roads, a disabled vehicle can quickly <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/bc_road-safety.htm\">become a life-threatening situation</a>.<br /> <br /> A variety of <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/roadsidecamps.htm\">primitive roadside campsites</a> (<em>permit required</em>) located along the road, allow for extended exploration. Highlights along the River Road include remote desert scenery, exploring the ruins of the <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/bibe/learn/historyculture/mariscalmine.htm\">Mariscal Mine</a>, and access to the rugged but spectacular <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/mariscal-rim-trail.htm\">Mariscal Rim Trail </a>(6.5 miles roundtrip hike).<br /> <br /> The west side of the River Road is lesser used, and generally in a rougher condition. Unless you have full confidence in your high-clearance vehicle, consider backtracking from the Mariscal Mine and returning via the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/glenn-springs-primitive-dirt-road.htm\">Glenn Springs Road</a>. The River Road crosses numerous washes, and regularly becomes impassable after rains.<br /> <br /> Protect Big Bend. Always stay on established roadways.<br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>OFF ROAD DRIVING IS PROHIBITED</strong>.</span></p>",

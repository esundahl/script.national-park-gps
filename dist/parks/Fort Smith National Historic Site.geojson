People who are convicted found guilty and are sentenced to less than one year also go to jail. If a sentence is more than one year, the convict is sent to prison. Fort Smith was home to two different jails.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> <strong>Hell on the Border Jail 1872 - 1888</strong><br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> In 1872, the basement of the old enlisted men's barracks was converted to a jail. There was no heating, cooling, or cross ventilation. Hygiene was poor. The horrid conditions led to the jail's nickname, \"Hell on the Border.\"<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> <strong>Second Jail 1888-1917</strong><br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The second jail completed in 1888 was a major improvement.

The wood is good for building furniture and buildings.  It would have a good building material for the fort and excellent fuel to make fires. The early settlers and soldiers in Fort Smith had very little in their lives to consider a luxury. This tree helped relieve some of that hardship by offering a kind of candy. Settlers and soldiers could peel back the park to expose the liquorish flavored sap so they could chew it like gum. This is why it has the name sweetgum.  ",

As a result, Fort Smith was no longer needed and closed in 1871.<br /> <br /> Built in 1903 by the St. Louis & San Francisco Railway, the station was an imposing Missouri ashlar limestone structure with a two-story colonnade in front. The ten ornate columns, standard of the Classical Revival style, gave way to a grand entrance. The side entrance was for an excluded class of society - a group of people labeled “colored.” Fort Smith was no different from the rest of the South where segregation was legislated between blacks and whites in public places.<br /> <br /> The Frisco Train Depot remained in operation through the early 1950s.</p>",

Four companies were created on December 19, 1863, with a fifth company in March 1864. They spent most of their time drilling and performing mundane and routine duties such as working on earthwork fortifications that surrounded the town of Fort Smith, serving as guards, and participating in formal dress parades.<br /> <br /> In August 1864, the unit experienced its first real military action. In mid-July the five companies of the 11th USCT, numbering 265 men, moved into Indian Territory. Their assignment was to guard government livestock and cut hay at Gunther's Prairie, 12 miles northwest of Fort Smith. At daybreak on August 24, 300 to 400 Confederate cavalry, both white and Indian, attacked the 11th USCT. The fighting started at 7:30 and continued for two and a half hours. According to military records, for one hour the contest was close and fire almost incessant. The cavalry made three separate charges and were repulsed each time and finally were compelled to retreat.

        "notes": "Fort Smith National Historic Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/fort-smith-national-historic-site.htm\n\n<p>Shaped by diverse people and groups—American Indians, soldiers, outlaws, and lawmen— Fort Smith National Historic Site evokes 80 years of turbulent history on the western frontier. At the park you can explore the remnants of two frontier forts, the tragic story of the Trail of Tears, and the historic jail and federal courthouse of Judge Isaac C. Parker. The U.S. military and federal court presence at Fort Smith changed the fate of the region by introducing a new political system, economic structure, and set of rules and social values from which people benefited, adapted to, or perished. Fort Smith National Historic Site provides opportunities to create a dialogue to reflect on the profound impact that the concept of Manifest Destiny and frontier heritage played in the nation’s history and the influence it has had on the fabric of American identity.<br /> <br /> Fort Smith National Historic Site is a landscaped park, interwoven with interpretive opportunities through restored and recreated elements of 19th century history. Fort Smith National Historic Site was authorized on September 13, 1961, and currently encompasses 37 acres within the urban environment of Fort Smith, Arkansas. Much of the park grounds, including the First and Second fort, is a national historic landmark.<br /> <br /> Historically, the landscape and setting were continually modified between 1817 and 1896, directly related to activities associated with the evolving nature and purpose of the site. Between 1897 and 1955, the historic scene and setting was significantly modified by urban development when the property of the fort and federal court were deeded to the City of Fort Smith. Since the late 1950s, the City of Fort Smith and the National Park Service have worked collaboratively to preserve and restore the 19th century historic scene and setting by removing buildings, streets, and other intrusive landscape alterations that occurred at this site in the early 20th century while restoring, replacing, recreating, and marking missing key features of Fort Smith. These improvements help to evoke a feeling and association with the 19th century site history, while at the same time developing the site as an urban greenspace.<br /> <br /> According to historic accounts, when army units first arrived at Belle Point, the land was heavily wooded with several varieties of oak, hickory, and cottonwood trees. Canebrakes occupied low ground along the rivers’ edge. The forests soon disappeared as the trees were cut down to be used as construction material and fuel for the first Fort Smith. Construction of the First Fort Smith was started in 1817 by a detachment of the U.S. Rifle Regiment and was 132 feet square with two blockhouses and many outbuildings. Soldiers cleared land for an 80-acre garden to feed the garrison. One correspondent noted in 1838 that “nearly all remaining timber on the land for near half a mile back” from Belle Point was cut down.<br /> <br /> The distinctive location at Belle Point, the rocky promontory selected by Major Long for the fort site, was a significant intersection of several important trade routes with continued use dating back at least 1,000 years. This site and its associated history is a powerful reminder of natural and cultural interconnectedness and how each affects the other. Beyond the mission endowed by Congress through the park’s enabling legislation, the park establishes common ground where people come together to share in the American experience and formulate a public identity.<br /> <br /> The purpose of the U.S. Army military installation at this location was to protect the expanding sovereign interests and ensure regional influence by the United States of America against other sovereign European nations that laid claim to territory within North America, as well as American Indian sovereign nations. President James Monroe signed treaties with the Cherokee, moving them into Western Arkansas in the 1820s. The First Fort Smith also served as a post to mediate a peaceful coexistence between local Osage Indians and Cherokee Indians who had been resettled there. The Cherokee had clashed severely with the local Osage populations, as well as with American immigrant hunters and squatters who had moved into the region. Through Army efforts, the immigrant squatters were removed from the region and in 1822 the two Indian tribes successfully negotiated a treaty.<br /> <br /> The federal government, after passing the Indian Removal Act of 1830, forcibly removed the Choctaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminole from their ancestral homelands in the Southeast to Indian Territory. Fort Smith is directly associated with the historic events surrounding the removal of many American Indian tribes, both before and following the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Fort Smith National Historic Site and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail preserve the specific location and physical remnants of a portion of one of the historic American Indian removal routes.<br /> <br /> The overlook site and associated setting provide opportunities for visitors to experience this significant location where key events occurred that were instrumental in the ensuing history. The intrinsic qualities associated with this specific site, as well as the individual stories and related history, are integrally connected and embedded within the landscape. These inherent qualities encourage personal reflection, essential dialogue, and discussion that ultimately engender a greater understanding of these events in our collective history.<br /> <br /> The Second Fort Smith, begun in 1838 a short distance from the site of the First Fort Smith, was garrisoned until 1871. The Fort Smith Commissary received incoming goods such as food, medicine, hay, tents, and uniforms, for distribution to approximately 17 forts. The fort continued in this function until 1861, when peace in the Indian Country, a goal shared by the Army and the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Seminole, and Creek Nations—who were known as “the Five Civilized Tribes”—was shattered by the Civil War.<br /> <br /> A significant “meeting of nations” occurred at Fort Smith in 1865 called the “Council of 1865.” This council was called to address several major issues following the Civil War. Three significant topics were reinstatement of tribal loyalty to the United States by those tribes who supported the Confederacy; additional attempts by the U.S. government to acquire land cessions from various tribes along with rescinding much of their original tribal authority; and the initial naming and establishment of “Oklahoma” as a territory. The tribes did not agree to the initial provisions of the treaty, and the negotiation process continued until 1866 when the treaty was finally signed in Washington, DC. The Treaty of 1866 has had a lasting impact on federal relations and American Indian policy to this day.<br /> <br /> After the fort was abandoned by the military, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, which included jurisdiction within Indian Territory, moved into the facility in 1872.<br /> <br /> By the late 19th century, Social and economic upheaval spread through the territory in the aftermath of the Civil War that created an environment conducive to criminal activity. Judge Isaac C. Parker was appointed to the bench in 1875 and for a few years, Parker’s jurisdiction initially extended over 74,000 square miles—half of Arkansas and all of the Indian Territory. In 21 years Parker tried more than 13,000 cases, sentencing 160 men and women to be executed by hanging. Of those, only 79 men were hanged. The Courthouse/Jail remains today through the initial restoration work of the Fort Smith Public Historical Restorations, Inc.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>African American Soldiers at Fort Smith</strong><br /> Black enlisted Army soldiers helped establish the first Fort Smith in 1817.  </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1863, the 11</span><sup>th</sup><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> Regiment USCT was recruited after the Union captures the post from Confederate forces.

He worked as a posse for deputy marshals and was hired as deputy marshal. He worked for the Fort Smith Federal Court until 1897 and two other federal courts until 1907. Known as one of the best deputy marshals in the Indian Territory, he was a police officer in Muskogee from 1908 until he died in 1910. Freed by Union Soldiers during the Civil War, George Winston worked for the Union army and they became a waiter in 18657. He joined the 38<sup>th</sup> infantry and in 1872 became a security guard for the Fort Smith Federal Court. He was hired to replace the previous bailiff and was pushed out in 1893 by racist policies. <br /> <br /> <strong>Fort Smith Today</strong><br /> The exact location of the First Fort Smith foundation was unknown until the 1959 test excavation by Clyde Dollar, an archeologist employed by the Department of Defense. The site was excavated in 1963 by the National Park Service for preservation and for viewing by park visitors. Today the foundations of the First Fort Smith are stabilized and accessible to visitors.<br /> <br /> Archeological digs conducted from 1978 to 1985 revealed where major portions of the Second Fort Smith wall existed. Further, Second Fort Smith wall foundations were discovered at the former quartermaster building, an area that is now separated from the remainder of the Second Fort Smith by railroad tracks. The wall foundations were uncovered extending from the east and south sides of the Commissary and in lots that were formerly used for parking by the Speer Hardware Company and the Fort Smith Paper Company.<br /> <br /> Early in 1983, during the monitoring of the Coca-Cola Complex demolition, foundations from the officers’ quarters were also discovered by Dollar and archeologist Roger Coleman. Their findings were documented in the report “Search for Officers’ Row at Fort Smith, Phase One (1982).” In July 1983, the massive support system for the Second Fort Smith flagpole (which stood about 100 feet high) was located under what was formerly Second Street and was partially excavated.<br /> <br /> The historic Frisco Railroad Station (the Frisco), situated north of the Commissary, is within the park’s boundary and listed in the National Register of Historic Places, although for reasons not related to the park’s military and federal court history. Historically there were nine other railroad stations in Fort Smith and today, the Frisco is the only remaining train depot in the city. Completed in 1904, the Frisco was constructed of limestone blocks cut smoothly to resemble grey marble.<br /> <br /> A trail system at Fort Smith National Historic Site provides a contemporary means for visitors to use and enjoy this historic site. Being in an urban setting, the trail system allows visitors to move from the downtown commercial district to the urban greenspace the park provides along the river. By increasing accessibility throughout the park grounds, the visiting public and local members of the community can enjoy the riverfront historic site both for educational and recreational purposes.</p>",

The ten ornate columns, standard of the Classical Revival style, gave way to a grand entrance for white passengers. This feature was removed and replaced by a contemporary wood portico. The side entrance was for a separated class of people labeled as “colored”.

In Fort Smith, 81 men were hanged for murder and 5 for rape. Crowds in the thousands came to watch the earlier executions. Two years after Judge Parker arrived, a fence was erected and executions became private. In order to attend an execution, individuals had to get permission from the U.S. Marshal by providing a reason to be there. Those who attended executions included reporters, clergy, medical personnel, and family members of both the victim and the condemned.<br /> <br /> The current gallows are a reproduction based on images and historic records.

Each successive owner modified the building to meet the demands of changing times. At the end of the 1800’s, after the Federal Court no longer needed it, the Commissary building was sold to a private owner. During this time, the massive stone walls of the second fort were dismantled and sold to local citizens.<br /> <br /> In 1910, a ladies’ group acted to save the Commissary as a place to preserve the community’s heritage. The Old Commissary Museum (later known as the Old Fort Museum) occupied the building for nearly seventy years, longer than either the army or the Federal Court. In the 1980’s, the National Park Service continued the restoration work begun by the museum. Throughout its early restoration, the Commissary served as the seed of historic preservation in Fort Smith.</p> <h3>Judge Parker's Office</h3> <p>From 1875 - 1890, Federal Judge Isaac C. Parker's office was on the second floor of the building. It is thought that his office was on the north side of the building looking toward where the bridge is today.</p> <h3>Home Sweet Home</h3> <p>The Hammersly family used the first floor as their home from 1890-1896. They divided the room to accommodate the family of six. Jacob Hammersly was the Court Crier and his daughter Florence was a Deputy Court Clerk for Judge Parker.</p> <h3>Old Commissary Museum</h3> <p>In 1910, the Old Commissary Museum was established, saving the building from demolition. The museum remained at this site until 1979, when it moved one block east to the Atkinson-Williams Warehouse. The name also changed to the Fort Smith Museum of History.</p>",

The seeds of the tree are called acorns. Indians across America used acorns for making bread. The acorn of this particular oak was preferred by both humans and animals because it is less bitter than those of other oaks. Though soldiers did not typically eat acorns, they hunted the birds, bear, deer, and squirrel that did. Therefore, acorns assisted in the soldier’s survival by feeding the animals they relied on for food. Unlike most trees, the wood can be used to contain liquid. Therefore, it was often used for barrels, canteens, houses, and boats. The keel boats that the soldiers arrived in were probably made of the white oak. This tree is even a symbol of American independence and can be seen on the back of the Connecticut state quarter.  <br />  </p>",

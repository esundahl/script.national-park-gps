I wanted it shared by many people...when I wasn't around to enjoy it myself.\" - Catherine Filene Shouse, 1994<br /> <br /> This pond is a reminder of the farming culture that dominated lands from the 17th to 20th century, prior to the Park's creation. In the 1930s, Mrs. Catherine Filene Shouse purchased the 53-acre plot known as \"Wolf Trap Farm,\" which grew to become a 168-acre country retreat. Encroaching roads and suburban development inspired Mrs. Shouse to gift her property to the American people in 1964. It became the first and only National Park devoted to the performing arts - a natural enclave for visitors to find spiritual nourishment in theater, music, and the peacefulness of nature.<br /> Today, after centuries of cultivation, native flora and fauna are repopulating the Park. This pond was once a livestock pond, used by cows to cool off during the hot summers. Now, it is teeming with dozens of amphibians, reptiles, and insects.<br /> <br /> Mind your manners - Snake Etiquette<br /> Snakes can be spotted basking on rocks in the humid, forested habitats of the park. They are not aggressive but will defend themselves if they feel threatened. The venomous northern copperhead crossbands that camouflage well in the leafy litter. To avoid disturbing our slithery friends, make sure to watch where you step while hiking. <br /> <br /> Want to learn more about the natural world found here at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts?

These misconceptions helped justify the destruction of over half the wetlands of the the United States. After decades of scientific research, we now know that wetlands play an important role in water purification, flood control, and shoreline stabilization. <br /> <br /> \"Wetland\" describes any ecosystem in which water saturates the soil for part of the year. The wetlands here in the park are wet meadows. Often found in poorly drained areas such as shallow lake basins and low-lying farmlands, wet meadows collect runoff during periods of high rainfall and help reduce river bank erosion. They also provide important refuge to insects, act as corridors to allow species to travel between larger parks, and serve as outdoor classrooms to educate the public about the importance of wetlands. <br /> <br /> The Veritable Villains<br /> The real monsters of the wetlands have no feet, teeth, or claws: they are invasive plants! Invasive plants compromise wetland health by monopolizing scare soil nutrients and crowding out native species. One of the park's most dangerous invasives is Japanese Stiltgrass, picture above. The fluorescent-green grass quietly blankets the ground, but don't be deceived! a single plant is capable of producing 1000 seeds and spreads like a disease.<br /> <br /> Want to learn more about the natural world found here at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts?

Congress accepted her farm as a donation to the National Park Service in 1966 and created Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts. Nestled within a large expanding metropolitan area, this protected woodland forest plays a role in protecting our environment.<br /> <br /> Forest protect water quality by slowing rain runoff, reducing erosion, absorbing nutrients and shading steams to reduce water temperature. Forest also improve air quality by removing harmful air-borne particles and transforming gases like carbon dioxide into breathable oxygen. Forest provide natural habitat for birds and animals. Habitat is where wild animals and birds live and seek shelter and food.<br /> <br /> Protected woodlands enhance our quality of life, creating an oasis within our urban environment. To appreciate the value of quiet open spaces and the forest, take time to walk along this path.

Don't miss nature's show in the garden! Native plants attract pollinators - bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds - that carry pollen from flower to flower, fertilizing plants to reproduce.<br /> Nature's cues coordinate seasonal timings of life-cycle events like insects hatching and flowers blooming. Rising temperatures could put the timings of flowerings and pollinators out of sync.<br /> Take photos on the nearby picture post to help us monitor impacts of climate change.<br /> <br /> Long-term Resilience<br /> Plants with long blooming times, like mountain mint (below), can help pollinators adapt to climate change. Because it flowers through late summer, pollinators can still eat mountain mint nectar even as nature's timing cues shift.<br /> <br /> Short Windows for PollinationPlants that bloom only briefly, like spring beauty (below), are vulnerable to climate change. Bees and bee flies have only a week to pollinate its flowers. As warming temperatures cause earlier flowering, will pollinators emerge in time to fertilize spring flowers?<br /> <br /> See how one citizen scientist uses photography to help science.

To promote greater plant and animal diversity, this meadow and other specified areas have been designated as \"no-mow\" zones. In 2012, park staff and volunteers planted 42 species of native grasses and wildflowers here to create a habitat that now supports over 40 kinds of bees and 25 types of butterflies. Look, smell, and listen to discover the spritely birds, fragrant flowers, and buzzing pollinators of the meadow.<br /> <br /> Common milkweed is a native meadow plant that provides food and shelter to many animals. So many, in fact, that one might consider it an ecosystem in and of itself. Honeybees and hummingbirds feed on the nectar and polen, monarch butterfly caterpillars munch on the succulent leaves, and white-footed mice collect the silk to build nests. Do your part to protect the milkweed by staying on the designated paths and keeping your dog on a leash.<br /> <br /> Want to learn more about the natural world found here at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts?

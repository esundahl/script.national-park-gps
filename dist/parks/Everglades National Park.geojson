In 1931, William P Wharton joined the fight for a national park in the Everglades.</p> <p paraeid=\"{386eba4a-ecc6-4cce-bd3f-d7e5035f43df}{225}\" paraid=\"10292663\">Wharton was involved in the Massachusetts State Park System, National Association of Audubon Societies, and the American Forestry Association, a perfect match to join Olmsted Jr. in crafting the report for a proposed national park in the Everglades. Olmsted Jr. and Wharton would spend ten days walking extensively in the Everglades region, speaking with fisherman, guides, hunters, and trappers.</p> <p paraeid=\"{386eba4a-ecc6-4cce-bd3f-d7e5035f43df}{229}\" paraid=\"1947744284\">After their adventure, the two concluded the Everglades not only had all the qualities necessary for a national park but was also so different from any other in existence, having a “special force of novelty”. Olmsted Jr. and Wharton believed that coastal mangrove forests and “the abundance of many species of wild bird life not commonly found in other parts” made the Everglades highly desirable for a national park.</p> <p paraeid=\"{386eba4a-ecc6-4cce-bd3f-d7e5035f43df}{233}\" paraid=\"166938486\">Despite not proposing any specific recommendations for park development, they firmly believed believing “that the primitive character of the region should be protected to the utmost.” Not only did they see the Everglades as providing recreational enjoyment, they also saw the importance it would serve as a study site for botanists, zoologists, and geologists.</p>",

It can be confusing and difficult to navigate as the mazes of mangrove–lined creeks and bays all begin to look the same. With proper planning, you can avoid the frustration and hours wasted from getting lost. The 99-mile Wilderness Waterway attracts interest because it connects Flamingo and Everglades City. Most paddlers allow at least eight days to complete the trip. This route is recommended for experienced paddlers only. Paddlers traveling in one direction only need to make arrangements in advance for a vehicle shuttle from a friend or private company. There are many areas of very shallow water that may be encountered along the Wilderness Waterway. Powerboats over 18' long may have to detour around Alligator and Plate Creeks. The “Nightmare” and Broad Creek are passable only to paddlers at high tide. To prevent prop dredging, which results in increased turbidity and the destruction of sub-merged natural features, boats with drafts of two feet or more, including the propeller, should not use the waterway.",

Though connected to the Gulf of Mexico to the west, a series of shallow banks, typically covered with and stabilized by seagrass communities, limits the exchange of water between the gulf and the bay. These banks separate the bay into basins, each with its own physical characteristics. These basins provide unique habitat for many plants, invertebrates, fishes, birds, mammals, and reptiles, including several threatened or endangered species such as the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and species of special concern such as the roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja). Approximately 1,625 square kilometers of Florida Bay are located within Everglades National Park and protected by the National Park Service. Boating in the Florida Bay is a task for the skilled. Treacherous passes cut through long banks of mud and seagrass that separate the shallow basins that make up Florida Bay. Safe boating requires the ability to \"read the water\" as well as a chart. Shallow areas are not always marked, so polarized sunglasses are a key to reading the water. Having a weatherproof copy of NOAA chart #11451 is highly recommended. Visitors should know the limits of their boat. On average, the bay is less than 3 feet deep, so knowing the draft (depth) of your boat is important.",

It housed soldiers and officers, included a mess hall and recreational facilities, and had offices for all “up range” purposes. The Battery Commander would work from this building, and if the decision was made to fire the missiles, the launch buttons would have been pressed here.<br /> <br /> Integrated Fire Control buildings had to be kept at a distance from the “down-range” facilities, where the missiles were kept. First, if there were a mistake with one of the missiles, the distance provided some protection of the people “up-range.” Second, this is where the radar towers stood, now gone. Five towers were here, both to track incoming aircraft and to track any missiles launched from the base. If the radar tracking the missiles were less than 3000 feet (about 1 km) from the launching missile they were to track, the missile would travel so fast as to be out of the range of the radar before the radar could lock onto it.",

The large paved area between the road and the barn had three launch pads with rails between so two soldiers could roll out the five ton missiles to their positions. At Nike bases elsewhere in the country, the missiles would be housed below the launch pads and elevators brought the missiles up; here the water table is too close to the surface to have underground facilities, so the barns were built.<br /> <br /> Maintenance and cleaning had to be kept to perfection here. If there was so much as a pebble in the rails, the missiles might not be able to be readied quickly enough to destroy incoming aircraft from Cuba. Security was at its tightest, as shown by many of the warnings on the inside walls. Crews had to call security within 60 seconds of entering the barn. As you explore, note that the displays added by the Park Service are on tables and easels. Everything on the walls of the barn is exactly as it was left when the site was decommissioned in 1979.The missile on display is a real Nike Hercules missile, though it no longer has its nuclear warhead. It was restored in 2012 by students at George T. Baker Aviation School in Miami, 50 years after the Cuban Missile Crisis.",

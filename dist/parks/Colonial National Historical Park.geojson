Historic Jamestowne, the first permanent English settlement in North America in 1607, jointly administered with Preservation Virginia, and Yorktown Battlefield, the final major battle of the American Revolutionary War in 1781.<br /> <br /> These two sites represent the beginning and end of English colonial America. Situated on the Virginia Peninsula, these sites are connected by the 23-mile scenic Colonial Parkway. Colonial NHP also includes Green Spring, the 17th century plantation home of Virginia's colonial governor, Sir William Berkeley, and the Cape Henry Memorial, which marks the approximate site of the first landing of the Jamestown colonists on the Atlantic Coast in April of 1607.<br /> Colonial NHP has a variety of natural resources including extensive wetlands, forest, fields, shorelines, and streams, as well as rare, threatened, and endangered plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">As Colonial National Historical park prepared for the 400</span><sup>th</sup><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> anniversary of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America, the focus of interpretation shifted and began emphasizing the coming together of three cultures during the 17</span><sup>th</sup><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> century – English/European, Virginia Indian, and African. The first Africans arrived at Jamestown in 1619. About 20 Africans aboard a Dutch ship were traded for food near Point Comfort, sent to Jamestown, and placed in servitude. Length of service and number of survivors is unknown but some did gain their freedom. Over the next century, enslaved Africans and their offspring became the primary labor force to support the cultivation of tobacco. Laws passed at Jamestown transformed an indentured form of servitude do one that was based upon race and lifetime enslavement.</span><br /> <br /> A study by historical at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation helped identify those who lived and worked at Jamestown and connect them to actual sites throughout Jamestown Island. It was used to develop exhibits and audio visual programs for the new visitor center, artwork, and waysides that were installed throughout Jamestown and adjacent areas. The research enhanced ranger-led tours and living history programs conducted by volunteers and staff, such as the life of Anthony Johnson, one of the first African Americans in Jamestown who gained freedom and owned property in Virginia.<br /> <br /> The park holds events focusing on African American history, one if February during African American history Month and one in August to commemorate the arrival of the first Africans. These include speakers on the African American story and living history presentation portraying an African American soldier who served with the Union Army and Jamestown during the civil War. </p>",

        "notes": "Independence National Historical Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/independence-national-historical-park.htm\n\n<p>Established in 1948, Independence National Historical Park covers more than 51 acres in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and beyond. As an administrative unit of the National Park Service, Independence National Historic Park also manages and operates three other legislated national park units in and around the city of Philadelphia. The site includes Independence National Historical Park, Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site, Gloria Dei Church National Historic Site, and Thaddeus Kosciusko National Memorial.<br /> <br /> Established in 1948, Independence National Historical Park was created to protect the historic places associated with the birth of the American republic, standing as icons of freedom and democratic ideals for people around the world. The park spans more than 51 acres within the City of Philadelphia, preserving and interpreting a rich collection of the United States of America’s Colonial, Revolutionary, and Federal period heritage. The park’s designers were strongly influenced by the City Beautiful Movement as well as the trend toward colonial revival in design introduced at Williamsburg, Virginia. While the urban renewal movement in Philadelphia was underway, the National Park Service was working collaboratively with local preservationists and stakeholders in developing Independence National Historical Park. Pioneering historic structure restoration in the 1950s and 1960s, with architects, engineers, archeologists, curators, and historians working on Independence Hall as well as other park structures, landscapes, and collections, led to development of a modern methodology and rigorous standards for restoration and reconstruction that are still a model for the National Park Service and private sector professionals. Most of the park’s historic structures are located in the vicinity of the four landscaped blocks between Philadelphia’s Chestnut, Walnut, 2nd, and 6th Streets. Here, along these streets, amid these venerable houses and public buildings, colonists began their quest for freedom and independence. Here too, the United States of America was born and its ideals enacted in the Constitution.<br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the park is Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution were debated and adopted in the late 18th century. Independence Hall and nearby Congress Hall were the principal meetinghouses of the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 1783 and the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. In Independence Square, the Declaration of Independence was read publicly for the first time on July 8, 1776. The legacy of the nation’s founding documents—universal principles of freedom and democracy—has influenced lawmakers around the world and distinguished Independence Hall as a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site.<br /> <br /> Across the street from Independence Square, the Liberty Bell, an iconic symbol of independence and an international symbol of freedom, is displayed in the Liberty Bell Center. Hung in the State House in 1753, it summoned the Pennsylvania Assembly to work. In the 1830s anti-slavery groups named it the Liberty Bell. The bell cracked sometime around 1846, but its message still rings out. Surrounding the Liberty Bell Center is the park’s Independence Mall, one of Philadelphia’s great outdoor public spaces, which runs between 5th and 6th Streets, from Chestnut Street to Race Street.<br /> <br /> Independence National Historical Park is much more than Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. The park preserves and interprets many of our country’s most important resources associated with the establishment of the government of the United States of America. Carpenters’ Hall is the site of the First Continental Congress held in September 1774. The Supreme Court of the United States first met at Philadelphia’s Old City Hall. The site of the President’s House, where George Washington and John Adams and their households lived and worked during their terms as the first and second presidents of the United States, prior to Adams’ move to the White House in 1800, is interpreted by the park, especially in the paradox of the Washingtons bringing their enslaved people to work and live there. Franklin Court preserves the site of Benjamin Franklin’s house and businesses, providing a window into the life and times of this founding father. Washington Square, one of William Penn’s five original squares, is home to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the American Revolution.<br /> <br /> The park also protects the First and Second Bank buildings of the United States; the Merchants Exchange Building; and the faithfully reconstructed social, cultural, and political center of Philadelphia during the park’s period of significance, the City Tavern. These are just a few of the many historic buildings and landscapes managed and protected by Independence National Historical Park.<br /> <br /> With so many important places under its care, Independence National Historical Park works collaboratively with many partners and stakeholders in the stewardship of our national heritage. The park works closely with the city of Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania, and with the Independence Visitor Center Corporation jointly managing the Independence Visitor Center located on 6th and Market Streets. Some of the historic buildings in the park are still owned by private organizations such as the American Philosophical Society and the Carpenters’ Company of the City and County of Philadelphia, so the park must work closely with these groups on the protection and interpretation of these properties. The park is also involved with numerous houses of worship and congregations, whose churches and cemeteries are an integral part of the historic significance of the park. Congress created the National Constitution Center as a private nonprofit organization in the park, located in a federally owned building on the mall, to be a nonpartisan interpreter of the history of the Constitution and its current relevance. There are numerous civic organizations, nonprofit groups, corporations, and countless stakeholders locally, nationally, and internationally that the park engages with on a regular basis. The diverse interests and passion of the park’s many partners and stakeholders reflect the importance of buildings and resources protected by Independence National Historical Park.</p>",

        "notes": "The Moore House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-moore-house.htm\n\n<p>Commissioners met at the Moore House to negotiate the terms of surrender.  The British sent Lt. Col. Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross. The allies sent the Viscomte do Noilles (Lafayette's brother-in-law) and Colonel John Laurens. The British argue the terms for many hours, but to no avail.</p> <p align=\"left\">The site on which the Moore House now stands was first patented by Governor John Harvey in the 1630's, and was named \"York Plantation.\" A century later, it was part of a 500 acre plantation called \"Temple Farm\" where Lawrence Smith II built a family home. In 1754, the estate passed to Smith's son, Robert. By 1760, however, Robert found himself in financial straits, and was forced to sell the farm that had been in his family for three generations. He sold the 500 acre estate to his brother-in-law, Augustine Moore.</p> <p align=\"left\"><b>Augustine Moore</b></p> <p align=\"left\">Augustine Moore began his career as a merchant at the age of 14, when he became an apprentice to William Nelson of Yorktown. He served the Nelson firm for many years, and became parter of \"Thos Nelson, Jr. & Co.\" in 1773.<br /> In 1767, Augustine inherited three plantations from his father, establishing him as a landowner of some estate. The following year he purchased \"Temple Farm\", and eventually moved his wife and son into the present plantation house to become a gentleman farmer in the fashion then prevalent in Virginia.<br /> In 1781, when General Cornwallis moved his British army into Yorktown, many residents left their homes and fled the area. The Moore family may also have abandoned their home, temporarily moving to Richmond during the Yorktown Siege. What they certainly could not have known, was that their home would become a site of national significance on October 18, 1781, when it was selected to be the backdrop for one of the final scenes of the American Revolution.</p> <p align=\"left\"><b>The Surrender Negotiations</b></p> <p align=\"left\">At 10 o'clock on the morning of October 17, 1781, a drummer beating a \"parley,\" and a British officer with a flag of truce, mounted a parapet south of Yorktown. The allies saw the signal, and soon the incessant, devastating artillery fire ceased. A hushed stillness fell over the field.<br /> Lord Cornwallis, realizing the defeat of his army was inevitable, sent a message to General George Washington:</p> <p align=\"left\"><i>\"Sir, I propose a cessation of hostilities for twenty-four hours, and that two officers may be appointed by each side, to meet at Mr. Moore's house, to settle terms for the surrender of the posts of York and Gloucester.\"</i></p> <p align=\"left\">Why Cornwallis selected the Moore House for the negotiations was not explained, however, there are a number of possibilities.The Moore House was well outside the line of siege fire, and therefore, not damaged. It was a neutral location, hiding the British situation in town, and possibly selected in the hope of securing better surrender terms. And finally, it was a convenient location for both sides to reach, as it was situated along the York River.<br /> <br /> Washington agreed to only a two hour cease fire for Cornwallis to submit general terms of surrender. Messages continued to pass over the battlefield between the two commanders.<br /> <br /> Finally, on the afternoon of October 18, the two British commissioners, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross met in \"Mr. Moore's house\" with the allied officers, Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens, for the Americans, and Second Colonel Viscount de Noailles (Marquis de Lafayette's brother-in-law), representing the French.<br /> <br /> The negotiations ended before midnight, and Laurens carried a rough draft of the articles to General Washington. Washington, however, was not completely happy with the results and made a few minor changes. Once the articles were revised and redrafted, a copy was sent to Cornwallis in Yorktown for his signature.</p>",

Nelson's devotion to the patriot cause during the American Revolution contributed significantly to the creation of the United States.<br /> <br /> The Nelson House is one of the finest examples of early Georgian architecture in Virginia. (The Georgian style took its name from the four British kings named George, who reigned from 1714 to 1830). Georgian architecture was popular in the 1700s because its simple, balanced appearance gave an impression of order and stability. Many of its features, such as the triangular pediment above the front door and the cornice, or decorative molding, under the eaves of the roof, can be traced to ancient Greece and Rome.<br /> <br /> Most of the Nelson House is original, including the bricks and most of the mortar in the outer walls. Inside the house, the wall panels and most of the wooden floors are original, a notable exception being the floor in the downstairs hall. The paint on the walls matches the color of the first paint applied after the house was constructed.<br /> <br />  During the colonial period five or six small outbuildings of Georgian design were clustered in an area to the right of the Nelson House. The buildings were used at various times as kitchens, wash houses, poultry houses, dairy houses, smoke houses, spinning houses and servants' quarters. The outbuildings made the Nelson household virtually self-supporting.<br /> <br /> <strong>I</strong><b>nformal tours of this early 18th-century home's first floor are offered through the year as staffing permits.

Hike through old-growth forest or around freshwater lakes, saltwater marshes and ocean tidelands. Gape at the breathtaking views. Launch your boat from Baker Bay. Benson Beach is a popular clam-digging destination, and fishers love to set up on the North Jetty to catch salmon and crab. The beaches at Cape Disappointment also lure kite-fliers, sand-castle builders and those who love to walk and explore.  <br /> <br /> But be sure to visit the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center for numerous interactive displays. Standing high on the cliffs of the Cape, 200 feet above the pounding Pacific surf, the Center is filled with information, artwork, and film presentations about the Corps of Discovery.  From April 1 to October 31, it’sr open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.<br /> <br /> Summer hours for the park are from 6:30 a.m. to dusk. A Washington State Park Discovery Pass is required; an automated pay station is on site.  A separate fee is required for the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center.  For more information, go to: http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment\">Cape Disappointment</a> is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> On November 14, 1805, while the expedition sheltered at Dismal Nitch, Lewis “concluded to proceed on by land & find if possible the white people the Indians Say is below and examine if a Bay is Situated near the mouth of this river as laid down by Vancouver in which we expect, if there is white traders to find them.” On November 17, Lewis “returned haveing travesed Haleys Bay to Cape Disapointment and the Sea Coast to the North for Some distance.” Gass remarked, “They had been round the bay, and seen where white people had been in the course of the summer: but they had all sailed away.” The next day Clark and 11 others “who wished to See more of the main Ocian” made the trip to Cape Disappointment and the northern coastline, rejoining the main party at Station Camp on November 20.<br /> <br /> The cape was a notable maritime landmark of the Pacific Northwest, with the first known documentation in 1775 by Spanish explorer Bruno Heceta, who named it “Bahia de La Asuncion.” British trader John Meares named it “Cape Disappointment” in 1788, due to his mistaken belief that the mouth of the Columbia River was only a bay. The United States deemed Cape Disappointment strategically significant enough to base military fortifications there during the Civil War and World War II. Construction of a lighthouse was complet­ed in 1856. The decommissioned military fortification and lighthouse are now encompassed by the <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment\">Camp Disappointment State Park</a>, which includes a <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment\">Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center.</a></p>",

Getting around Point Ellice/Distress would have allowed them to meet up with one of the last trading ships of the season and refresh their supplies.<br /> <br /> What the Corps didn’t realize, however, was that it was about to run into some of the journey’s most treacherous moments. A fierce winter storm forced the Corps off the river on November 10, and pinned the group to a north shore cove consisting of little more than jagged rocks and steep hillside. Captain William Clark named the dreary spot “that dismal little nitch.” For six stormy days, the group was trapped by fierce wind and high waves at the rocky shoreline. For only the second time in the expedition, Clark said he was concerned for the safety of the Corps. <br /> <br /> It would be five days later, on November 15, that a break in the weather finally allowed the men to move forward. Once the wind and river calmed, Clark ordered the canoes loaded as quickly as possible and the Corps was able to make it around Point Ellice/Distress. They landed on a sandy beach where they established Station Camp. They missed the trading ship, but eventually achieved their exploration goals.<br /> <br /> In the following years this site became a fish receiving station to support a cannery operation, and later a ferry landing and train station. Eventually in 1968 and 1969 the Washington Department of Highways demolished the ferry landing and constructed the Megler Rest Area in its place. The Megler Rest Area was renamed the Dismal Nitch Rest Area in 2005. <h3>Today</h3> Located on SR 401, ten miles south of Naselle, Washington, visitors will find interpretive wayside exhibits about the expedition, as well as a short trail that leads to the approximate location of Lewis and Clark’s campsite.

When passing through on January 8, 1806, William Clark’s guide pointed out these village to the explorer. In his journal, Clark describes them, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>“… from this point of View my guide pointed to a village at the mouth fo a Small river near which place he Said the whale was, he also pointed to 4 other places where the princpal Villages of the <em><a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tillamook%20Indians\">Kil la mox</a> </em>were Situated, I could plainly See the houses of 2 of those Villeges & the Smoke of a 3rd which was two far of for me to disern with my naked eye— <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-08#n27010809\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> after taking the Courses and computed the Distances in my own mind, I proceeded on down a Steep decent to a Single house the remains of an old <em><a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tillamook%20Indians\">Kil a mox</a> </em>Town <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-08#n27010810\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> in a nitch imediately on the Sea Coast, at which place great no. of eregular rocks are out and the waves comes in with great force…\"</p> </blockquote> <p>After scaling the north slope of Tillamook Head and reaching one of its viewpoints, Clarke described the vista as “… the grandest and most pleasing prospects which my eyes ever surveyed…”</p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>The park’s network of trails include an 8 mile segment of the Oregon Coast Trail, and a 2 1/2 mile historical interpretive route called the Clatsop Loop Trail. Part of the Clatsop Loop Trail and the trail over Tillamook Head follow in the footsteps of the Corps of Discovery. <br /> <br /> Entrance into the park requires an entrance fee or park pass. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=136\">Ecola State Park - Oregon State Parks</a>.</p>",

After finding a location that offered plenty of game and close proximity to the ocean, Clark sketched a preliminary site plan, and they began construction in early December. The fort was completed by January 1st and housed 32 men, one woman, a baby, and a dog. Joseph Whitehouse wrote that the officers named the fort \"after a nation of Indians who resided near us, called the Clatsop Nation.\" They spent the extremely rainy winter collecting supplies, making salt and leather, and preparing their maps and journals. <br /> <br /> After the expedition finally departed on March 23, 1806, Fort Clatsop gradually deteriorated. A reconstruction of the fort based on Clark's sketch was completed in 1955, but burned down in 2005. Today a second replica, completed in 2006, can be explored in the same location.</p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>Visitors can experience the newest replica of Fort Clatsop by walking through the rooms, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/trails.htm\">hiking the trails </a>around the area, chatting with costumed rangers, and participating in ranger-led programs during the peak seasons.<br /> <br /> The visitor center located at this site provides basic amenities and offers a museum, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/learn/bookstore.htm\">bookstore</a>, and two films.

However, the items Lewis offered—including his fancy dress uniform—were not a sufficient trade for the valuable canoe.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{59296d9b-333c-45a8-8acd-4fa3a96fe73d}{168}\" paraid=\"1756275604\">Rather than offer more, Lewis directed his men to steal a canoe: “we yet want another canoe, and as the <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians\">Clatsops</a> will not sell us one at a price which we can afford to give we will take one from them in lue of the six Elk which they stole from us in the winter.” But Coboway had already brought presents to make up for the stolen elk. </p> <p paraeid=\"{59296d9b-333c-45a8-8acd-4fa3a96fe73d}{205}\" paraid=\"1398587761\">And so, after all Coboway’s kindness and hospitality, Lewis and Clark broke the trust established through months of friendship and trade with Clatsop people and stole a canoe. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Chinook Point, the setting of this historic fort, is within the accustomed territory of the Chinook Indian Nation and is designated as a National Historic Landmark for its historical significance over three centuries. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark passed through this area as well on January 9<sup>th</sup>, 1806. <h3>Today</h3> <br /> Fort Columbia Historical State Park features a self-guided interpretive walk that details the area’s history, and visitors will find informational exhibits near the fort’s gun batteries. In addition to it's history, the area offers bird watching, miles of forested hiking trails, secluded beaches, wildlife viewing opportunities, and an interpretive center. Here, visitors will find exhibits focused on the history of Fort Columbia, including the area’s early exploration, fur trade, and western settlement. A pass is required to enter the park.<br /> <br /> For more information on the park or to download a park brochure, visit their website at <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/506/Fort-Columbia\">Fort Columbia Historical State Park</a>.",

When Europeans first arrived in the area, it was the site of a large Clatsop settlement, and William Clark noted eight large houses on the site when they passed by in 1805. <br /> <br /> The area later became a Civil War-era military fort established in 1863. The original earthen fort was built to keep British and Confederate gunboats from entering the mouth of the Columbia River. <br /> <br /> After World War II, Fort Stevens was considered obsolete, and it was turned over to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for use as a headquarters in 1947. Then, in 1975, the site was officially designed a state park after being leased to Oregon State Parks.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Georgia, Times, \"Times New Roman\", serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Today</span><br /> Visitors can visit the historic Fort Stevens and Point Adams. The park’s visitor center and museum interpret the site’s long history. Tours through the old earthen fort and artillery gun batteries are also available. Those with a passion for the outdoors will enjoy the golf course, fishing, 15 miles of multi-use trails, and access to Coffenbury Lake for swimming and boating. Picnic tables are available on a first-come-first-served basis.<br /> <br /> There are several camping options available in one of the countries largest public campgrounds.

The Hudson’s Bay Company, whose headquarters by the time of The Pig War was this building in London, shipped European trade goods and technology to North America, where they were sold to Native Americans for animal fur which was then resold in Europe and Asia, hence their corporate motto “Pro Pelle Cutem” which in latin means “A pelt for a skin”. Unlike the corporations we are familiar with today, the Hudson’s Bay Company fused governmental power, military capabilities, and diplomatic functions with its quest for profit. It operated throughout Canada and was especially powerful in the Pacific Northwest, where the Hudson’s Bay Company was the most potent non-native force in the region in the early days of European colonization.<br /> <br /> The Hudson’s Bay Company’s global trading business and the strategies that made it successful relied upon a diverse workforce. Acquiring fur required Native American participation and the company hired Native American employees and carefully stocked trade goods that catered to Native American consumer preferences. Company operatives often married high ranking Native American women and their alliances helped encourage trade and cooperation; children of these cross-cultural marriages often worked for the Hudson’s Bay Company, where they acted as cultural mediators who understood the needs of indigenous people and the company’s commercial empire. In the Pacific Northwest, the company found itself short on labor and hired Hawaiian men as laborers, farmers, seafarers, and fur trade adventurers.<br /> <br /> The Hudson’s Bay Company built a string of trading posts throughout the Pacific Northwest in the 1820s-1850s at a time when the United States and the British Empire both claimed the Oregon Country (the future states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Wyoming and Montana). These posts became centers for settlement, economic development, and imperial power at a time when few U.S. citizens inhabited the Oregon Country. It was only in the 1840s, as masses of U.S. emigrants used the Oregon Trail to settle in the Pacific Northwest that the Hudson’s Bay Company and British imperial power were contested. When the Oregon Treaty of 1846 gave the states of Washington and Oregon to the United States, the Hudson’s Bay Company was forced to wind down operations at its bases in Washington and Oregon, which included at one time parts of the future <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nepe\">Nez Perce National Historical Park</a><br /> <br /> Still, the Hudson’s Bay Company remained powerful within British territory; one way that they demonstrated this power was by founding a massive operation on San Juan Island. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a>, established in 1853, grew into a massive agricultural complex with over 4,000 sheep and more than a dozen Hawaiian and native employees. It was a Hudson’s Bay Company pig that rooted through Lyman Cutlar’s potato patch on June 15, 1859, sparking the Pig War. During the joint occupation of San Juan Island, American Camp was established adjacent to Belle Vue Sheep Farm headquarters and the farm wound down operations on our island.<br /> <br /> Though the Hudson’s Bay Company is no longer on our island, it remains a major corporation. No longer in the fur trade, it is now one of Canada’s largest department stores. It’s unique contribution to our region’s history and to global history is crucial to understanding how San Juan Island developed.",

Hawaiians had been working in the Pacific Northwest since 1787 and over time became an increasingly pivotal part of the fur trading workforce. At this office, the HBC recruited Hawaiian workers, sold British goods and Pacific Northwest agricultural products, and resupplied its ships headed from Hawaii to China and American whaling ships which regularly stopped in Honolulu. By the mid 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the Honolulu Agency was a vital part of a global trading empire that encompassed London, North America, and Asia.<br /> <br /> Hawaiians’ importance to the HBC can be seen in the writings of Chief Factor John McLoughlin who in 1830 asked the Honolulu agency to “Sen[d] us as many of them [Hawaiians[ as possible.” These workers filled numerous vital positions for the HBC; many worked on its ships as sailors. Others, like the sixteen Hawaiians who landed on San Juan Island in 1853, were agricultural workers who grew crops and herded sheep. Still others served as construction workers whose labor helped establish fur trade outposts or as teamsters, carrying goods hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles to trade with Native Americans in the extensive network of fur trade forts that the HBC operated throughout the Pacific Northwest. It is estimated that by the mid-1800s, approximately 1/3 of the HBC’s Pacific Northwest labor force were Hawaiians.<br /> <br /> Hawaiians were hired on time-limited contracts that specified their pay and term of service. In 1844, a Honolulu newspaper claimed that “they are generally engaged for a period of three years and gain $10 per month.” Though little documentation exists, it is likely that many of these migrant workers sent wages home to their families in Hawaii. Many Hawaiians regularly renewed their labor contracts and worked for decades in the Pacific Northwest either with the HBC or as independent settlers who homesteaded after leaving HBC employment. Hawaiian migrants also worked at other National Park Service sites that were once HBC establishments, such as <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historical Site</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a>. On San Juan Island place names like Kanaka Bay and Friday Harbor (named after a Hawaiian man who settled there whose English name was Peter Friday) and Eastern Oregon place names like Kanaka Creek, Kanaka Bar, Kanaka Glen, and the Owyhee River demonstrate the longstanding impact of Hawaiians in the Pacific Northwest.",

        "notes": "Middle Village & Station Camp\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/middle-village-station-camp.htm\n\n<h3>Middle Village History</h3> <p>Right along highway 101 on the north side of the Columbia River, east of Chinook, Washington, you’ll find Middle Village, the site of a significant Chinook village. For thousands of years, the Chinook people have lived along the Columbia River and their home near the river's mouth was strategically located to provide abundant food, such as salmon and shellfish. In addition, the nearby forests were home to game animals and the grasslands and marshes provided ample materials for making shelter, clothing and trade and household goods. The river provided a way for Chinook traders to travel to the south shore and up and down the Columbia.</p> <p>They developed a sophisticated, rich culture and enjoyed great success as traders. The waterway near Middle Village became a virtual trade \"water highway.\" During the 10 years before Lewis and Clark arrived overland at the this spot almost 90 trade ships from Europe and New England are documented to have crossed the Columbia River Bar to trade with Native Americans. These ships brought metal tools, blankets, clothing, beads, liquor and weapons to trade for beaver and sea otter pelts. By the time the Corps reached the site, the Chinook's had moved to their winter village and this village was unoccupied.<br /> <br /> In 2005, archeologists found abundant physical evidence to support the importance of the site as a Chinook trade village. More than 10,000 artifacts were uncovered, including trade beads, plates, cups, musket balls, arrowheads, Indian fish net weights and ceremonial items. The European artifacts are from both before and after the Corps' visit in 1805, and attest to the vitality of the Chinook social and economic life at the site.</p> <h3>Station Camp History</h3> <p>The Corps spent just 10 days here, but used Middle Village as a departure point for an overland trek to their first view of the Pacific Ocean and an exploration of the area. Historians called the spot \"Station Camp\" because it was Clark's primary survey station to produce a detailed and accurate map of the mouth of the Columbia River and surrounding area. This was the most detailed and accurate map he made during the entire trip.</p> <p>On Nov. 24, 1805, the explorers desperately needed a winter campsite, one rich with game and near friendly tribes who would trade for supplies. To assist in deciding where the Corps should winter, the captains took <em>\"Solictations of every individual.\" </em>This included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/york.htm\">York</a>, who was an enslaved man, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sacagawea.htm\">Sacagawea</a>, a Lemhi Shoshone woman who was married to Toussaint Charbonneau. The majority chose to cross to the south side of the Columbia River, near modern-day Astoria, Oregon, to build winter quarters, which soon would be known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-clatsop-or.htm\">Fort Clatsop</a>. </p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>The Middle Village - Station Camp site focuses on the Chinook Indian Nation history, as well as telling the story of early contact, the Corps', and the town of McGowan. Middle Village - Station Camp was dedicated on August 18, 2012.<br /> <br /> The site is open during daylight hours. Check in at the visitor center at Fort Clatsop to pay any <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">park fees</a> and get additional information.</p> <p><br /> Middle Village - Station Camp is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a></p>",

Each was home to an extended family—some 100 people may have lived in the village. They caught fish, and when the tide was low, they gathered crabs, mussels, snails, and barnacles. Some men in the village hunted seals and sea lions. To walk down to the beach, they carved handholds in the rocky cliff.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{143}\" paraid=\"1465818087\">White men and a Shoshone woman, members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, arrived at NeCus’ in January 1806 during a time of bounty and commotion: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cannon-beach-oregon.htm\">a huge whale</a> had just washed ashore!  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{185}\" paraid=\"203910835\">The whale blessed them with enough food for themselves and to trade with their neighbors, Clatsop and Chinookan people. Nehalem people were hard at work boiling the whale for oil and cutting up the blubber, to prepare it to eat or sell.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{213}\" paraid=\"348821851\">William Clark wanted to buy some of the whale blubber and oil, trading glass beads for it. He bought so much that some people might have wondered how he planned to carry it back. He did so with the help of others in his party, including Sacagawea. Maybe the people of NeCus’ Village were excited to have such a bustling town with so many visitors—what an opportunity, what a big party! Maybe some children liked meeting all of the visitors from across the region. Older people may have been happy for an excuse to reunite with old friends. And maybe some people were just plain tired of smelling the rotting whale, even if they liked the taste of blubber.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2e553370-7fce-44b3-9d51-8197b92d1518}{12}\" paraid=\"154739475\">Whatever they felt, NeCus’ Village was the place to be that January. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Bring your non-motorized boat or sign up for a<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/paddle-tours.htm\"> ranger guided canoe and kayak trip</a> during the summer months.</p> <p>The launch is part of the Lewis and Clark Columbia River Water Trail, a 146-mile stretch of water that follows the explorers' route on the Lower Columbia River from Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean, near Ilwaco, Wash. For more detailed information go to the<a href=\"https://www.estuarypartnership.org/water-trails/columbia-river\">Lower Columbia River Water Trail website</a>.</p> <p>Netul Landing also marks one end of the new Lewis and Clark River Trail. The river trail is a 1.5-mile gentle walk along the river to Fort Clatsop. Visitors may park in the parking area and follow the trail to the Fort Clatsop Visitor Center, where they will learn about the area’s history. At the landing and along the trail, interpretive panels are installed that discuss Lewis and Clark’s time here. Visitor's can also connect with the Fort to Sea trail and trace the Corps' trip to Sunset Beach.</p> <p>Visitors are required to pay an entrance fee to Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, which can be paid at the visitor center.

Salt was important for meat preservation and thus for the crew’s survival on the trip back home. The rivers near the fort weren’t salty enough, and so a better place had to be found. The men found an ideal spot on the Pacific Ocean approximately 15 miles from Fort Clatsop where they set up the salt processing camp.<br /> <br /> Making salt required a bit of planning and a lot of work. Sea water had to be collected and allowed to sit till the sand sank to the bottom. Then the men had to collect a large supply of firewood and build a stone furnace, on top of which they placed five kettles that had to boil 24 hours a day to produce the salt. Captain William Clark and few additional men joined the others at the salt works a little over a week later on January 9, arriving in the early afternoon. The group stayed at the salt works until February 20, when they left with 3.5 bushels (about 28 gallons) of “Excellent, fine, strong & white” salt. <p> </p> <h3>Today</h3> Today, visitors can see the site believed to be the expedition’s salt works. It was identified by a rock cairn and the testimony of Jenny Michel, born in 1816 to a Clatsop man who had pointed the place out to her when she was a child. According to her father, this was the place he had seen white men boiling water.<br /> <br /> The site is located on the Promenade. At the intersection of US Highway 101 and Avenue G, turn west to Beach Drive, then left to Lewis and Clark Way. Park where available without blocking private driveways. Walk west on Lewis and Clark Way to the Salt Cairn.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

The room to its left was the captains quarters for Lewis and Clark. The third room down was known as the Orderly Room and may have been for the three sergents and perhaps the other civilian Geourge Droulliard. It is unknown if Captain Clark's enslaved man, York, would have stayed in the captains or sergeants room. The final room on this side was the storage room for meat, tools, trade goods, and the few other supplies they had left. It was the duty of the sergeants to ensure no one got into the storage room or bothered the captains without due reason.</p>",

William Clark polled everyone on November 24, 1805, and tallied their votes in his journal.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{72}\" paraid=\"401436884\">Clark recorded the vote of York, a Black man he enslaved. This was decades before Black men had the right to vote in the United States. Several years after the Lewis and Clark Expedition, York asked for his freedom. Clark denied his request. How meaningful was York’s vote, if he still was not free? </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{108}\" paraid=\"1376804430\">Clark also asked Sacagawea’s opinion on where to stay over the winter. Her vote was not tallied, but Clark made a note that she wanted to stay somewhere with lots of wapato, to make sure they had enough food for the winter. The group decision did not heed her concerns, but her point played out: they spent much of the winter trading with the Clatsop for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/wapato.htm\">wapato</a> and other food. And their health suffered at times when they had only dried salmon or spoiled elk meat to eat. </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{166}\" paraid=\"1297852312\">Ultimately, Lewis and Clark’s party decided to stay south of the Columbia River, where the Clatsop people lived and where there would be easy access to the ocean. The hunting would be good there, it was close to the ocean for salt-making, and they hoped the rain wouldn’t be as bad. </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{178}\" paraid=\"641365020\">Sacagawea voicing her opinion in 1805 gained more attention a century later. The women’s suffrage movement used Sacagawea’s input at Station Camp as a symbol of why women deserved the right to vote. That right came at the national level in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. However, barriers to suffrage still existed for people of color, including Indigenous women, until well into the twentieth century.</p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{218}\" paraid=\"1878192478\">Sacagawea and York gave their opinions to the White men leading the expedition—an expedition that neither of them freely chose to join. But did their votes make a lasting difference for Black people, Indigenous people, or women?  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

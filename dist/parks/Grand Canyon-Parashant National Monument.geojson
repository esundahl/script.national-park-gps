        "notes": "Grand Gulch Mine\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/grand-gulch-mine.htm\n\n<p>Boom and bust. Birth and rebirth. Life and death. These words describe the vicious cycle of Grand Gulch Mine, a troubled copper mine on the Arizona strip. Grand Gulch Mine has a complicated history that details the ruggedness of the area and the struggles of many settlers in their search for fortune in the desert.<br /> <br /> In 1871, a member of the Shivwits Band of Paiutes relayed his findings to some men at a nearby Mormon settlement where interest was piqued. The men paid the Paiute with a horse and some flour, and excitedly began plans to prospect the mine. Samuel L. Adams showed the most enthusiasm, and began by packing in tools and supplies on mules to the mining site. A few years later work began--roads were built, workers were brought in, shafts were dug, and the Grand Gulch Mining Company was formed.<br /> <br /> They were immediately faced with challenges, as the mine was 80 miles from the nearest city, St. George, Utah. The cost of hauling the ore from the mine to St. George was eventually too much to bear and the mine closed in 1876. The mine went through several more periods of prosperity followed by inactivity over the next 40 years. Even with the addition of a nearby railroad, an onsite smelter, mechanized equipment, new shafts, and new owners, the cost of running the mine and shipping the ore was too high. For years it continuously started up and shut down, and not until 1916 did it begin to boom.<br /> <br /> The start of WWI brought on an almost instant demand for minerals like copper. Copper production across the U.S. increased by 39% and the price increased by 55.4%. The mine was bustling with 75 total workers, the highest number recorded at the mine. However, as the end of the war neared, the quality of the copper began to drop. By 1919, WWI ended, copper prices tanked, and production halted once again.<br /> <br /> Full-time copper mining never occurred at the site again. Grand Gulch Mine changed hands in the years after, and some companies dug for copper in the waste rock piles, while others simply scrapped some of the old structures for parts. Eventually it fell into complete disuse, and in 2000 many of the buildings and old equipment was encompassed by Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument to be preserved for its geologic history and mining culture.</p>",

        "name": "Grand Wash Cliffs Wilderness",
        "notes": "Grand Wash Cliffs Wilderness\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/grand-wash-cliffs-wilderness.htm\n\n<h3>Area Description</h3> <p>You won't find the Colorado River, the force of nature that eons ago carved the Grand Wash Cliffs of Arizona, anywhere near the cliffs themselves. Today the Colorado flows about 20 miles to the south, sculpting the Grand Canyon. However this wilderness, in Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, marking the transition zone between the Colorado Plateau and Basin and Range Provinces, preserves the river's intricate handiwork--rugged canyons, scenic escarpments, and colorful sandstone buttes. Most remarkable are the 12 miles of towering cliffs themselves, which are cut into two giant steps, the first about 2,000 feet high, and the second a 1,000-foot leap to the Shivwits Plateau. Between the two steps lies a shelf that stretches one to three miles wide. Several canyons cut deeply into the sculpted cliffs and provide opportunities for tough scrambling to the top where a piñon-juniper woodland overlooks a plain of Mojave desert shrubs below. Elevations in this Wilderness range from approximately 2,650 to nearly 6,700 feet.<br /> <br /> Climate in the Arizona mountains varies greatly with elevation. The higher elevations generally receive much more precipitation and much cooler temperatures than the lower elevations. Summers at the high elevations bring warm daytime temperatures with cool nights. Low elevations often experience very hot summer temperatures. Afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summer. The winter and early spring months bring snow and sometimes cold temperatures to the highest elevations but frequent clear, sunny days. Winter brings moderate temperatures to the low elevations - a great time to recreate in these snow free areas - allowing both winter and summer type activities within very short distances.<br /> <br /> One 11-mile maintained trail traverses the length of this Wilderness above the Grand Wash Cliffs in pinyon-juniper country. You will find extraordinary opportunities for solitude and primitive recreation as well as rugged canyon hiking, if you don't mind the effort. Gila monsters, desert tortoises, and desert bighorn sheep live here in solitude. Access is difficult, but seekers of solitude will find it well worth the effort.</p> <h3>Non-Federal Lands</h3> <p>Some of the land south of the Grand Wash Cliffs Wilderness is not federally administered. Please respect the property of the land owners.

        "notes": "Nampaweap\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/nampaweap.htm\n\n<h3>Welcome to Nampaweap.</h3> <p>This location includes one of the largest petroglyph sites on the Arizona Strip. Inside the ravine, you walk on the rugged lava fields of the Uinkaret Plateau. Volcanism produced the cinders, cones and basalt flows that dominate the region. Beginning 150,000 years ago, seeping eruptions covered the ground. They formed multiple, thin beds of basalt. Slow cooling caused fractures that wind, water, and ice worked on resulting in huge chunks falling from the cliff. The scattering of boulders and the fragmented cliffs created perfect canvases for rock writing.</p> <p>A pottery sherd embedded in a small chunk of basalt from the nearby Little Springs Eruption suggests that recent volcanic activity in this area occurred around A.C.E. 1050. The distinct style of the bowl dates the sherd, indicating the presence of people who witnessed and interacted with the blazing processes of geologic rebirth.</p> <p>The Southern Paiute believe their Creator placed them on these lands, where they have lived in respectful balance since time immemorial. Religious specialists made petroglyphs in places full of power such as locations with important plants, rocks, or water. They documented events, histories, family stories, and perhaps their own vision quests, at Nampaweap. The recorder struck basalt with a hammer stone to peck away the dark, desert varnish. Hundreds of geometric designs, spirals, handprints, anthropomorphs (human-like figures) and zoomorphs (animal-like figures) grace the cliffs. Petroglyphs shed light on the world where the Old Ones lived. Stories of game kills, enemy attacks, marriages, family lives, and relationships with plants and animals remain as teaching tools for the elders who continue to take youths to visit petroglyphs to share history, culture and spiritual beliefs.</p> <p>Nampaweap Canyon is an isolated location on the Arizona Strip and as such, precautions are needed to explore it. Water is not available here and heat radiates off the black basalt in the canyon, making even a short hike potentially dangerous. Balance plenty of water intake with salty snacks and remember that preparation is key: the nearest conveniences and medical services are approximately 3 hours away in Saint George, Utah or Fredonia, Arizona. Watch for rattlesnakes hiding in covered places.</p> <h3>Petroglyph sites are fragile. You can minimize your impact in the following ways:</h3> <ul> <li>Don’t climb on the rocks. If you need to get a better look, use binoculars or a camera.</li> <li>Supervise children.</li> <li>Stay on established trails to protect native plants and preserve the surrounding environment.</li> <li>Please don’t touch petroglyphs. When people touch petroglyphs, they leave a residue of body oil on the surface of the rock. Over time, the oil causes images to fade and history is lost.</li> <li>Remember petroglyphs by photographing or sketching them, not by making rubbings or tracings.</li> <li>Respect the inhabitants of this land and their culture by leaving the landscape intact. It is illegal to remove rocks or cultural artifacts from a national monument.</li> <li>Pack out all trash and tissue papers, leaving Nampaweap Canyon as though you were never there.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Vandalism impacts many petroglyph sites throughout the Southwest, including Nampaweap Canyon. Increased public awareness of the value of petroglyphs is one of our best weapons against the destruction of these irreplaceable resources. You can help protect them by reporting any signs of vandalism or suspicious activity to a park ranger when you return to cell service:</p> <p>Parashant Law Enforcement: <b>(435) 688-3280</b></p> <p>Archaeological Resources Protection Act Hotline: <b>1-800-227-7286 </b>or <b>1-800-637-9152</b></p>",

        "name": "Pakoon Springs",
        "notes": "Pakoon Springs\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/pakoon-springs.htm\n\n<p>In the late 1970’s Pakoon Springs had seen many seasons. Several different owners, including Native Americans, homesteaders, and ranchers laid their claims on the area, but none made their claim quite like a self-proclaimed “weekend cowboy” by the name of Charles “Chuck” Simmons.<br /> <br /> Delbert “Dell” Allan, the owner of the property since 1966, sold his property to an eager Chuck for a cheap price, knowing that the land would be in good hands. Little did Dell know what surprises Chuck would bring to the ranch.</p> <p>One of the first interesting critters to be introduced to Pakoon Springs was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/para/learn/historyculture/gator-country.htm\">Clem the alligator</a>. In the late 1980’s Clem was transported over from Georgia by a few friends of Chuck’s as a gift to the rancher. Chuck, not knowing exactly what to do with an alligator, sent him into the pond and wished him the best. Clem kept to himself most days, barring a few exceptions when he was lured out with 7 whole chickens or children swimming in his pond. Chuck even thought at one point he had been scooped up by a helicopter using the water in the pond to put out a nearby wildfire. Clem, however, was eventually found in 2003 by BLM workers, but not before making true the wild tale of the alligator on the Arizona Strip.</p> <p>Chuck also raised about 500 ostriches at Pakoon at one time. Running cattle became a difficult process—it was more work than it was worth. In the 1980’s ostrich meat became a new craze, and Chuck decided he would have a go at the booming industry. Unfortunately, the demand for ostriches in the U.S. plummeted quickly, and Chuck had more ostriches than he knew how to deal with. He had to give most of them away, because if he turned them loose he wasn’t sure how the Bureau of Land Management would react to 500 ostriches roaming the Mojave Desert!</p> <p>In addition to an alligator and ostriches, Chuck and his family also raised pigs and burros on the ranch. In an interview, Chuck once told the story of a man who offered by buy the pigs from his father-in-law, who was living on the property at the time. The man arrived at Pakoon, only to find no pigs, and nobody to sell them. After waiting a few hours, Chuck’s father-in-law arrived, introduced himself to the man, and then promptly fired his shotgun in the air three times. Faster than you could say Jack Robinson, the pigs all arrived eagerly at their pens. After a puzzled look from the man, Chuck’s father-in-law explained: “They think it is chow time. I have been feeding them burros!”</p> <p>Burros, while also serving as food for the hogs, also became some beloved, and pestering pets to the family. One year they rescued a crippled burro that couldn’t walk. After nursing it back to health, the burro stuck around as she had grown quite close to the family. But she soon became somewhat of a nuisance. Anyone who didn’t feed her at the time of her liking was knocked clean over until her bucket was full of feed.</p> <p>Pakoon Springs is a very different place now that there are no ostriches, alligators, or pigs, and the burros that remain are now wild. Today, the springs are part of a comprehensive rehabilitation project to restore the area to its natural habitat. Desert springs are an essential component of life on the Arizona Strip, as they are often the only sources of natural groundwater, and play important roles in their delicate ecosystems. One disruption of these springs can have severe consequences. Because the springs at Pakoon are so important to the area, Grand Canyon Parashant NM worked to restore the area to its natural habitat. The springs are slowly taking on their natural form, but not without remembering its wild and wonderful past, full of ostriches, alligators, and pigs.</p>",

        "name": "Tassi Ranch",
        "notes": "Tassi Ranch\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/tassi-ranch.htm\n\n<h3><b>A Desert Oasis</b></h3> <p>The sound of a bubbling spring was music to a pioneer’s ears. Running water was a highly valuable resource on the Arizona Strip, and when the early settlers of the strip found it, they held on. Tassi Springs was a popular spot in the pioneer days for just this reason. There are multiple different natural springs on the ranch, which made this area a lifesaving water source, a comfortable place to rest, and an ideal place to make a desert home. Travelers were first documented as taking refuge at Tassi around the 1870’s, although archaeological evidence points to Native American use as early as 5,000 BP.<br /> <br /> While technically owned by the federal government, Tassi was used by several different people groups, but was never truly settled until the 1920’s. At one time, over 20 people were documented to be camped out at Tassi. The Hecklethornes, a shepherding family used Tassi as their base camp for a bootlegging operation during prohibition. The Nays, another family occupying the area, were the only settlers who filed for legal ownership of the land, although they abandoned the area before the application was approved. Ed Yates, a rough and tumble cattleman, was one of the first settlers to stake his claim on Tassi Springs, and keep it. Ed Yates began to homestead Seven Springs, a few miles North of Tassi. However, he eventually expanded his property to Tassi Springs. After running off the Hecklethornes and purchasing unofficial water rights from another family, Ed began to develop his ranch. He built reservoirs, a new stone house, a barn and corrals, dug irrigation ditches, and planted cottonwood trees.<br /> <br /> After briefly moving away and selling his land to an uncooperative tenant, Ed reclaimed the land and moved back with his daughter and son-in-law. Tassi Ranch thrived with the Yates family back on the land. There were green pastures, and a bountiful garden with tomatoes, corn, watermelon, casabas, chard, and even fig trees. However, Ed retired and sold his land again, this time to the Whitmore family. The Whitmores ran cattle there and made a number of developments in the area, until 2001 when Tassi was officially closed from public grazing. The National Park Service gained full control of the Tassi Ranch area, and began restoring it in order to preserve the precious springs and the ranching history. Today, Tassi Ranch remains a bright spot in the Mojave Desert.</p> <h3><b>Visiting Tassi Ranch and Spring</b></h3> <p>This site can be reached after a long drive on rocky and sandy roads (Mohave country roads 111 or 113 and NPS1213) in the Pakoon Basin below the Grand Wash Cliffs. Be advised that the historic area floods frequently both from winter storms and summer monsoons. Because of flooding there is no developed parking area. Walking conditions are rough over rocks outside the fence. Inside the fence the area is unmaintained grass. A short section of old roadbed climbs steeply up to the spring and stream. As you explore the site watch for snakes and the threatened relict leopard frogs that could be underfoot.<br /> <br /> A vault toilet was installed on the bluff just south of the ranch in 2022 along the NPS1213 road. Driving to the bluff just past the wash provides a beautiful view of the historic area.</p> <h3><b><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Safety Warning</span></b></h3> <p>Please stay out of the historic house. The building has become unstable and could collapse. This historic structure is being preserved but is not safe for entry.

While a trip to-and-from Twin Point can be done in a day from Saint George, consider a camping trip to see the sunset and sunrise. There are several campsites along the Grand Canyon rim. On the way to Twin Point you'll see cattle and cowboy line shacks and drive through a ponderosa pine forest.<br /> <br /> While almost all of the Parashant has no cell service, it was recently discovered that Verizon customers can get service (data and voice calls) at the a few places along the Twin Point road by the canyon rim with a line of sight view to the south. There are two cell towers on the south rim at Peach Springs, AZ and the Grand Canyon West Skywalk, both on the Hualapai Reservation.<br /> <br /> This guide starts in St. George. You will need a full tank of gas for this drive. There is no gas available on the Arizona Strip. Mileages listed below are approximate. Be aware that some trucks and SUVs have minor differences in odometer readings if tire size differs from the factory setting. All turns should be well marked by road signage. Rangers recommend you bring the free <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/para/planyourvisit/maps.htm\">National Park Service Parashant Map</a> with you before starting out as the roads to Twin Point are all shown on this map. The drive to Twin Point utilizes the same roads in and out. The NPS map can be picked up at the address at the bottom of the page or mailed to you. If you plan to travel other roads near Twin Point you will need the <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/files/WEST%20-%202016%20Arizona%20Strip%20Visitor%20Map.pdf\">2016 BLM Arizona Strip Visitor Map</a> that shows every road.<br /> <br /> <b>Vehicle Recommendations:</b><br /> • High Clearance 4x4 Trucks or SUVs are needed.<em> Passenger cars, crossovers, minivans, and RVs <strong>will not</strong> make it to Twin Point. The road is too rough and has very sharp turns.</em><br /> • Four Wheel Drive<br /> • All-Terrain Tires<br /> <br /> <b>Directions</b><br /> From Interstate 15, take Exit 2 east onto the Southern Parkway (Hwy 7) toward the airport. Take Exit 3 (River Road) and turn south. Set your vehicle trip odometer to 0 where the pavement ends at the state line.<br /> <br /> <b>BLM Road 1069</b><br /> You have now crossed into Arizona and are on BLM road #1069. The road is well maintained gravel. For the first 4 miles you will be on Arizona State Trust Land. At mile 4.4 you will pass the BLM Arizona Strip sign. You are now on BLM land. BLM1069 winds its way up to Quail Hill Pass, at 5,082 ft elevation. At mile 20.6 you will reach the BLM1004 junction in Wolf Hole Valley.<br /> <br /> <b>Mohave County Road 5 to CR103 to BLM1019</b><br /> At the BLM1004 junction in Wolf Hole Valley continue straight. Here BLM1069 ends and becomes CR5. At Mile 39.1 you will reach a Y intersection with a sign to Mt. Dellenbaugh and Twin Point. Turn right onto CR103. You are now headed southwest. Reset your odometer to 0. After a few miles Poverty Mountain will be on the south side of the road. You will travel 25.2 miles on CR103. Shortly after you begin to see tall ponderosa pine trees you will reach the junction with BLM1019.<br /> <br /> From Wolf Hole Valley on CR5 to Poverty Mountain on CR103 the road is usually in very good condition when dry. Between Poverty Mountain and Twin Point the road is primarily clay and will be impassible after heavy rain for at least a few hours. In winter travel is not advised to Twin Point due to snow and ice. Contact us at the bottom of this page to get current road conditions.<br /> <br /> <strong>LM1019/NPS1219 to Twin Point</strong><br /> BLM1019 turns off CR103 in an area called Oak Grove. You will pass the ruin of a small ranch house. The road then enters the ponderosa forest. This area can be impassible after heavy rain as water pools in the clay ruts. Shade from the trees keeps the road from drying quickly, especially in winter when the road may be impassible.<br /> <br /> Continue on BLM1019 to the National Park Service boundary sign. You are still in Parashant but are now in the NPS portion of the monument. The road becomes NPS1219 and winds through pinyon and juniper trees. Long wheelbase pickups may have trouble navigating a few of the tight turns.<br /> <br /> You will see two trailheads as you head south. The first, on the east side of the road into Twin Creek Canyon, is one area for hikers who want to access the Sanup bench. Overnight trips into Grand Canyon National Park (all lands below the Grand Canyon rim) need a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">backcountry permit</a> from Grand Canyon National Park.<br /> <br /> The next trail, on the west side of the road, is the Burnt Canyon Overlook Trail. This easy 3-mile round trip trail follows an old level road bed to a scenic view (pictured).<br /> <br /> It is approximately 15 miles on BLM1019/NPS1219 from the CR103 junction to Twin Point. There are numerous camp sites along the rim. Rangers ask campers to use existing campsites and fire rings rather than establish new ones.<br />  ",

It represents the beginning of the Battle of Brices Cross Roads. The first shots of the battle took place in this location between the Federal Cavalry represented by the 4th Missouri and the Confederate cavalry represented by the 7th Tennessee.<br /> <br /> During the battle the road you drive on which is now Mississippi highway 370 was a winding dirty and muddy road surrounded by a blackjack oak forest.

The federal troopers feel back close to Brices Cross Roads and formed a skirmish line to stop the confederate attack.<br /> <br /> The inscription on the historical markers reads as follows:<br /> \"FIRST SHOTS OF<br /> THE BATTLE OF<br /> BRICE'S CROSSROADS<br /> WERE FIRED HERE<br /> AT 9:30<br /> MORNING OF<br /> JUNE 10, 1864<br /> <br /> SCOUTS FROM GENERAL<br /> NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST'S<br /> 7TH TENNESSEE (CONFEDERATE)<br /> MET SCOUTS FROM GENERAL SAMUEL D.

It was here that the Federals attempted to stop the Confederate pursuit or at least slow it down to give the other Union regiments time to get themselves and the wagon train to safety.<br /> <br /> The Union line consisted primarily of the units from Colonel Alexander Wilkin's First Infantry Brigade and Colonel Edward Bouton's United States Colored Infantry Brigade. Bouton's men--the 55th and 59th United States Colored Troops--were ordered to charge Morton's guns and Forrest's dismounted cavalry with their bayonets. Colonel Edward Bouton described the charge as \"The right and center of our line, embracing most of the Fifty-ninth Regiment, here rallied and charged, driving the enemy back with bayonets and clubbed muskets nearly 400 yards, leaving great numbers of his dead on the ground.\"<br /> <br /> The African American troops, many of them formerly enslaved, wanted to punish the Confederate soldiers responsible for the massacre of black soldiers at Fort Pillow in Tennessee two months earlier. Some USCT soldiers even wore badges on their uniforms saying \"Remember Fort Pillow.\" According to Captain Morton the USCT soldiers advanced within \"hand shaking distance\" of the Confederate cannons. The arrival of Colonel Lyon's Confederate cavalry drove back the union soldiers. The Federals soon abandoned their position on the ridge and continued their retreat back towards Memphis, Tennessee.<br /> <br /> The Brice's Crossroads Battlefield main battlefield site is managed by the Mississippi Final Stands Visitor and Interpretative Center in Baldwyn, Mississippi.",

During the battle the blackjack oak in this area grew thick and it was hard for the opposing soldiers to see each other. The Union cavalry dismounted and started to fight on foot. The 2nd New Jersey Cavalry were equipped with Spencer repeating rifles and were able to inflict heavy casualties on the Confederate forces. The Confederate cavalry were equipped with infantry muskets and the Federal Cavalry though they had infantry in front of them instead of Confederate Cavalry. This confusion led the Federal Cavalry to break off the skirmish and fall back up the hill to form their first battle line. <br /> <br /> A Civil War army on the march protected itself with lines of skirmishers, troops deployed in loose formation in advance and/or on the flanks of the main body. These troops drew the enemy's fires, developed his position, and warned comrades of imminent clash. Infantry manual in use during the war devoted much coverage to skirmisher tactics, made popular by Napoleon's heavy reliance on them during the Continental warfare of the early 1800s.<br /> <br /> The Historical Marker inscription is as follows:<br /> \"ADVANCE FORCES OF<br /> GENERAL FORREST<br /> AND<br /> GENERAL STURGIS'<br /> CAVALRY MET IN<br /> SKIRMISH HERE.<br /> <br /> THE 3RD, 7TH, 8TH AND 12TH<br /> KENTUCKY (CONFEDERATE)<br /> MET THE 4TH MISSOURI, 3RD<br /> 9TH ILLINOIS AND 2ND NEW<br /> JERSEY SHORTLY BEFORE<br /> FORMING FIRST BATTLE<br /> LINE.<br /> <br /> ERECTED BY ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE OF<br /> THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.<br /> <br /> J.P.

Confederate artillerymen rained fire upon the scrambling Federal soldiers with four field guns--two twelve-pounder howitzers and two three-inch ordnance rifles.<br /> <br /> The Confederate artillery, led by Captain John W. Morton, played a significant role in this battle at multiple points. Their performance that day all the more impressive because of the difficulty maneuvering the guns and caissons through the woods and along muddy roads. The Confederate artillery continued to pursue and attack the Federals across Tishomingo Creek and through the swampy woods, even pushing the guns along by hand.<br /> <br /> The Brice's Crossroads Battlefield main battlefield site is managed by the Mississippi Final Stands Visitor and Interpretative Center in Baldwyn, Mississippi.<br />  ",

The rains of the previous several days had raised the water level of the creek, making it difficult to cross without using the bridge. The bridge soon became a bottleneck for General Sturgis expeditionary force as horses, wagons, cannon, and men attempted to cross the creek.<br /> <br /> Oscar Kelton was one of many union soldiers killed on June 10, 1864. During the Federal army retreat near the creek is when Oscar Kelton was killed in action while the rest of the federal army retreated back to Memphis. On June 15th, five days after the battle, the Kelton family received a telegram that no family wanted to receive. It was sent by one of Oscar’s comrades and read “Oscar D Kelton was killed in battle near Corinth last friday his body is in the hands of the enemy...”<br /> <br /> Two years later in 1866 Fernando Kelton, Oscar’s father traveled to the Brices Cross Roads battlefield to find his son’s remains and transport him home to Columbus, OH. Fernando was able to find Oscar’s remains with the help of a local woman and Oscar was returned to his family in Ohio on May 7, 1866 and was buried in the family plot at the Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus, OH.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brcr/learn/historyculture/oscar-kelton.htm\"> 1st LT Oscar Kelton</a> for additional information..<br /> <br /> A critical factor in the Union defeat at Brices Cross Roads was the decision, by an unknown officer, to bring most if not all of the Union supply train across the Tishomingo Creek Bridge and in the area you now stand. When the time came to retreat, the slow moving wagons clogged the narrow bridge, creating a panic among the exhausted soldiers. <br /> <br /> The supply train consisted of 250 wagons, each pulled by a team of four to six horses or mules. The wagons carried ammunition, food, forage and equipment and also served as ambulances.<br /> <br /> The Brice's Crossroads Battlefield main battlefield site is managed by the Mississippi Final Stands Visitor and Interpretative Center in Baldwyn, Mississippi.</p>",

Sergeant Jourdan was buried on their property, and at some point two cedar trees were planted to mark his grave.<br /> <br /> Over three hundred men were killed in the battle on June 10, 1864. The bodies of the dead soldiers were hastily buried. The bodies of Union soldiers were exhumed in 1867 and re-interred in the national cemetery at Corinth, Mississippi. The graves of many soldiers, especially those strewn along the Federal Army retreat route, had no markers and are now unknown to history.<br /> <br /> Confederate burials were given more care. Some like Jourdan, were buried on private property. Some of those bodies--such as that of John Rice, who was buried on the Agnew property--were later removed and taken home by friends and relatives. Still other soldiers were laid to rest in a section of the cemetery at nearby Bethany Church. While some soldiers have memorial gravestones at the Bethany cemetery, the actual locations of their remains are unknown.<br /> <br /> During the Battle of Brices Cross Roads there were 12,000 men engaged on June 10, 1864 with 3,105 killed or wounded.

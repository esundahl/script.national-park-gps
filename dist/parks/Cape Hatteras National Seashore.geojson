It was instrumental in expanding the southern Outer Banks' reputation as a world-class fishing destination when a world-record breaking red drum, weighing in at a little over 94 pounds, was caught just yards away from the pier structure in 1984. Since then, red drum hunters have flocked to the Avon Fishing Pier in hopes of making their own record-breaking catch.<br /> <br /> The pier, the only operating pier within Cape Hatteras National Seashore, is currently run by a park concessionaire.</p> <h3>Visiting</h3> <p>The Avon Fishing Pier is open during the summer season from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm daily.<br /> <br /> For additional information, visit <a href=\"https://www.koruvillage.com/pages/avon-pier\">avonfishingpier.com.</a></p>",

Midgett on August 17, 1899. A hurricane was driving winds and water over the island, and he was alone on patrol when he saw the <strong>Priscilla</strong> , a 643-ton ship, grounded 100 yards off the beach.<br /> <br /> The cries of the crew forced him to make a hard choice: take three hours to get help from the Gull Shores US Life-Saving Station or attempt a solo rescue now. Midgett, one of a long line of the local surfmen, chose the latter. Seven times he waded to the ship through crashing waves, and seven men he brought to safety, one at a time.<br /> <br /> Even then, three were still on the <strong>Priscilla</strong> , too injured and exhausted to make the journey. Midgett, undaunted, risked his life and braved the raging sea to climb the <strong>Priscilla</strong> 's side and carried each man down the boat and to safety.<br /> <br /> For his efforts, Midgett was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal of Honor \"In Testimony of Heroic Deeds in the Saving of Life from the Perils of the Sea.\" The US Coast Guard still recognizes the rescue from the <strong>Priscilla</strong> as one of the top ten rescues in American maritime history.</p>",

The airstrip is operated by the North Carolina Department of Transportation Division of Aviation, through a special agreement with the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> There are minimal facilities at this airstrip consisting of two portable restrooms and a pilot operations room. No water or fuel is available.</p> <h3>Air Power Demonstration</h3> <p>My children in the lifetime will see aeronautics become the greatest and principal means of national defense and rapid transportation all over the world and possibly beyond our world into interstellar space.<br /> -- Brigadier General \"Billy\" Mitchell, 1933<br /> <br /> In September 1923, Brigadier General \"Billy\" Mitchell provided a chilling view of the effectiveness of aerial bombardment on surface vessels to skeptical government and military observers. Taking off from his temporary Hatteras Village airfield, Mitchell rendevoused with Martin bombers from Langley Field, Virginia. Equipped with newly developed bombsights and super-charged engines, the bombers quickly sank the obselete battleships \"Virignia\" and \"New Jersey\" anchored just 20 miles off the Hatteras Island coast.<br />  </p> <h3>Improvised Airfield</h3> <br /> Responding to General Mitchell's urgent call for construction of a temporary airfield, local Hatteras residents built a landing strip by filling holes, tidal pools, and marshy areas and packing level the ground. This was all done with shovels, hoes, horse-drawn carts, and a tractor pulling a weighted pallet. Their quick work helped ensure the success of Mitchell's demonstration. <h3>Operating Hours</h3> <br /> The airstrip is open from 30 minutes before sunrise to 30 minutes after sunset. <h3>Pilot Facility</h3> <br /> Access by using \"Squawk VFR.\" <h3>Parking</h3> <br /> There are 39 tie-down locations, 31 near the pilot facility and 8 located mid-field. Aircraft are allowed to park for 14 consecutive days during any 30 day period. <h3>Fuel</h3> <br /> There is no fuel. The closest airports with fuel are Dare County Regional Airport (MQI) to the north and Michael J. Smith (MRH) to the south.",

The confusion exists on multiple levels. It starts by the improbable naming of the inlet. When a gigantic hurricane ripped open a huge void between Bodie Island to the north and Pea Island to the south on September 7, 1846, a nearby sailing vessel named <em>Oregon </em>was nearly wrecked by the storm and so passed through the new inlet to seek safety out of the Ocean. The inlet quickly became known locally as the Oregon Inlet, while the more logical name would be “the Bodie Inlet,” much like “Hatteras Inlet” is named from the gap between Hatteras and Ocracoke, and “Ocracoke Inlet” is named for the water between Ocracoke Island and Portsmouth Banks.</p> <p>The confusion began in earnest with the naming of the first station south of Oregon Inlet. It was one of the first seven of 1874-style, but somehow it was named as the Bodie Island U.S. Life-Saving Station No.16 even though it was clearly not on Bodie Island, but rather Pea Island (or the northern end of Hatteras Island). The first keeper of this station was Edward Drinkwater.</p> <p>In the next round of construction in 1878, one of the eleven 1876-type stations was built a mile and one-eighth north of the 1872 Bodie Island Lighthouse and named Tommy’s Hummock (Hummock is a rounded knoll or small hill frequently made from the shifting winds of the Outer Banks).</p> <p>In 1883, the mis-naming was corrected by renaming Tommy’s Hummock as the Bodie Island station. That meant that the ‘old’ 1874 Bodie Island station still on the south side of the inlet had to be renamed and so became the Oregon Inlet station.</p> <p>Dating this structure can also be confusing. The “blueprint plans” were dated 1876, so this is called “an 1876-type.” But it was built in 1878 and finished in December of that year. Some, some say it is an 1878 station. However, it was not commissioned, occupied and active until the next month, January 1879 – so, that is the official date.</p> <h2>Significant Dates in Its History<a name=\"onthisPage-1\"></a></h2> <p><strong>1879:</strong> Jan. 15-16, Keeper Jessie T.

Tried to use the beach gear, but although three shot lines were placed on board, the swift current prevented the successful working of the apparatus. Finally launched the surfboat, the keeper of the Nags Head Station accompanying the Bodie Island crew. At about the same time a fishing smack ran down the beach outside the breakers and had taken off four of the crew when the surfboat reached the schooner. The life savers took off the remaining 6 persons and received into the surfboat the four men who had got into the smack. Landed them safely, and succored them two days at the station and provided clothing. The captain remained at the station 9 days.<br /> <br /> Compiled and written by James D. Charlet.</em></p>",

Coste of the revenue cutter Campbell to examine the coastline for potential lighthouse sites that would supplement the existing one at Cape Hatteras. Coste determined that southbound ships were in great need of a beacon on or near Bodie Island by which they could fix their position for navigating the dangerous cape. He punctuated his recommendation with the statement that \"more vessels are lost there than on any other part of our coast.\"<br /> <br /> Congress responded with an appropriation for a lighthouse that same year, but complications over purchasing the necessary land delayed construction until 1847. This was but the first of many problems. Though the skillful Francis Gibbons was contracted as engineer, the project's overseer was a former Customs official named Thomas Blount, who unfortunately, had no lighthouse experience at all. This proved disastrous when Blount ordered an unsupported brick foundation laid, despite Gibbons' recommendations to the contrary. As a result, the 54-foot tower began to lean within two years after completion. Numerous expensive repairs failed to rectify the problem and the lighthouse had to be abandoned in 1859.<br /> <br /> The second lighthouse fared little better than its wobbly predecessor. Though funded, contracted, and completed in prompt fashion at a nearby site in 1859, it soon succumbed to an unforeseen danger: the American Civil War. Fearing that the 80-foot tower would be used by Union forces, retreating Confederate troops blew it up in 1861.</p> <h3>Current Lighthouse</h3> <p>After the American Civil War, the coast near Bodie Island remained dark for several years while a replacement tower was considered by the Lighthouse Board. Though the Board was disposed against the idea, numerous petitions came in from concerned ship captains and, finally, it decided in favor of a third Bodie Island Lighthouse. Still, it was not until 1871 that construction began. The first two Bodie Island Lights had been located south of Oregon Inlet, actually on Pea Island. The new 15-acre site, purchased by the government for $150.00 from John Etheridge, was north of the inlet.<br /> <br /> Work crews, equipment, and materials from the recent lighthouse project at Cape Hatteras were used to build necessary loading docks, dwellings, and facilities. Government contracts brought bricks and stone from Baltimore firms, ironwork from a New York foundry, and granite from Mount Airy, North Carolina. Construction of the tower proceeded smoothly and it first exhibited its light, magnified by a powerful first-order Fresnel lens, on October 1, 1872.<br /> <br /> Early problems with flocks of geese crashing into the lens and improper grounding for electrical storms were quickly rectified with screening for the lantern and a lightning rod for the tower. There have been few other difficulties with the lighthouse itself since its completion.</p> <h3>Fresnel Lens</h3> <p>Mariners have depended on lights for navigation for over 2,000 years. As maritime travel and commerce increased, so did the quantity and quality of navigational lights. Brick and metal lighthouses replaced wooden platforms. Brighter burning oil lamps took the place of simple wood or coal fires. Parabolic or spherical reflectors were added to concentrate the lights and increase visibility. In 1822, one of the greatest improvements in lighthouse technology came when Augustin Jean Fresnel, a French physicist, introduced a new lens design.<br /> <br /> Fresnel's lens resembles a giant beehive with a system of multi-faceted glass prisms mounted in a brass framework. The prisms refract (bend) light and magnify it, thereby taking rays of light that would normally scatter in all directions and focusing them into a single beam. Because of this design, a Fresnel lens is much more efficient than traditional light sources. Tests show that an open flame loses nearly 97% of its light. A light with a reflector placed behind it loses 60-80% of its light. With a Fresnel lens, only a maximum of 20% of its light is lost! Before this, the brightest lighthouse beams could reach 8 to 12 miles away. The light from a Fresnel lens could shine all the way to the horizon, which is more than 20 miles away!<br /> <br /> Prior to the Fresnel lens, most lighthouses had only solid, steady lights. This made it difficult to distinguish one light from another, often causing confusion and dangerous conditions for passing ships. But the Fresnel lens could produce an almost unlimited combination of patterns, depending on the number of installed flash panels and the speed that the lens revolved.</p> <h3>Signaling Ships</h3> <p>The Bodie Island Lighthouse has a first-order Fresnel lens with an interesting flash pattern that reaches over 20 miles out to sea. The light is on for 2.5 seconds, off for 2.5 seconds, on for 2.5 seconds, and then off for 22.5 seconds. Originally run on various types of oil, the light was electrified in 1932, phasing out the need for on-site keepers.<br /> <br /> During the day, the Bodie Island Lighthouse is distinguished from other lighthouses along the coast by the horizontal black and white stripes. This paint pattern is known as a daymark.</p>",

Along the way, and at the observation deck at the end of the boardwalk, smell the freshness of the marsh and listen to the wildlife around you. Birds migrating along the Atlantic Flyway make use of the freshwater ponds, providing a chance to spot different birds throughout the year. The pond and surrounding wetlands are also home to a diverse range of species, including blue crabs and snapping turtles!<br /> <br /> Parking is available at the start of the trail in the parking lot north of the Bodie Island Visitor Center. Also at the start of the boardwalk are restrooms, a drinking fountain with a pet fountain and water bottle filling station, a trash and recycling station, and a bike rack. The observation deck at the end of the trail has three benches and spectacular views of the Bodie Island Lighthouse and surrounding ecosystems.</p> <h3>Atlantic Flyway</h3> <p>Migrating birds move from one location where they breed and raise young in the summer months to another location where they overwinter. Across North America there are four major flyways (paths that migrating birds follow) with one of those four being the Atlantic Flyway.<br /> <br /> The Atlantic Flyway is the eastern-most of these four flyways, and is roughly bounded by the Atlantic Coast of North America on the eastern side and the Appalachian Mountains on the western side. The Atlantic Flyway terminates in the north at the eastern Arctic islands and Greenland, and in the south in the Gulf of Mexico region. This area provides a relatively flat land surface to fly over with a variety of species-rich ecosystems to utilize along the way.<br /> <br /> Different migratory birds travel through here at different times of the year, making Cape Hatteras National Seashore a wonderful place to observe birds throughout the year.</p> <h3>Phragmites</h3> <p><strong>Phragmites australis</strong> is an exotic plant species that is currently threatening the salt and brackish marsh ecosystems of Cape Hatteras National Seashore, ecosystems which heavily contribute to estuarine productivity. This exotic plant species is a significant resource concern because it is able to outcompete native vegetation and is not utilized by the native wildlife. <strong>Phragmites australis</strong> typically grows in brackish and alkaline wetlands, and tends to inhabit the marsh-upland interfaces where it grows in continuous dense stands. You can see examples of this exotic plant species along the boardwalk.</p>",

Prior to the bridge, access was only available via vehicle ferry from the Oregon Inlet Fishing Center. The completion of the bridge brought well needed connections to the southern Outer Banks, as well as faster evacuation routes during severe weather.<br /> <br /> The Bonner Bridge reached the end of its functional lifespan in the 2010s, and the North Carolina Department of Transportation began a bridge replacement project. In 2019, the new Marc Basnight Bridge opened, replacing the Bonner Bridge. As part of the replacement project, the remnant 1000ft of the bridge on the Hatteras side of Oregon Inlet was retained as a structure to help train the ocean current further into the center of the inlet to aid navigation and as a pedestrian and fishing structure. <h2>Rules</h2> <br /> Fishing is a fun and rewarding experience.

The grisly flotsam was evidence of World War II's toll imposed by German U-boats. Two foreign sailors who lost their lives during this time are buried in this cemetery. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, established by Royal Charter in 1917, marks and maintains the war graves of Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom no matter where they lie.<br /> <br /> Every year, the National Park Service, the US Coast Guard, and the British Royal Navy have a ceremony at the site to honor the men who lost their lives in the attacks.</p> <h3>Operation Paukenschlag</h3> <p>On December 7, 1941, the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor thrust the US unexpectedly into active hostilities. It also compelled Germany's dictator, Adolf Hitler, to declare war on the US.<br /> <br /> This declaration brought about a secret plan-code-named Operation Paukenschlag (English translation: Operation Drumroll)-for a swift, decisive submarine assault on the American eastern seaboard. The strategy, conceived by German Rear-Admiral and U-boat commander Karl Donitz, was to take advantage of poor American war preparations and strike at the vulnerable, merchant-rich sea lanes just off the Atlantic coast.<br /> <br /> Initially, only five submarines were assigned to the operation, and as they began their stealthy voyage across the Atlantic in late December 1941, not even Admiral Donitz could foresee the success that these few U-boats would achieve.</p> <h3>Paukenschlag Response</h3> <p>A storm was approaching the US, which they were ill-prepared to weather. Naval patrol vessels assigned to the Atlantic were few in number, and those available were obsolete, slow, unseaworthy, or totally inappropriate for anti-submarine duty.<br /> <br /> Only one ship, the 165-foot cutter Dione, patrolled the crucial 5th Naval District-a huge section of ocean which included the waters off Cape Hatteras. Designed during Prohibition to thwart rum-runners, the Dione was a fine US Coast Guard vessel. Alone against tested German U-boats, however, she was simply overmatched.<br /> <br /> Every year near the anniversary of the <strong>HMT Bedfordshire</strong> 's sinking, members of the National Park Service, US Coast Guard, and British Royal Navy join visitors and local citizens to honor the service of the men buried in the cemeteries. Officers place wreaths at the graves and local citizens read the names of the dead. The sounding of <strong>Taps</strong> and a 21-gun salute conclude the memorial services every year.</p>",

A 1¾-mile long, self-guided, loop trail leads from the picnic area through Buxton Woods, and back again. Along this relatively level path, you can see the diverse forest ecosystem up-close, practice your skill at identifying trees, listen to the call of birds, and traverse some of the highest points on Hatteras Island.<br /> <br /> With both saltwater and freshwater ponds, and a canopy of pines or centuries-old live oaks, the maritime forest is able to support a variety of species that are normally unheard of on a barrier island. These species include red-tailed foxes, raccoons, river otters, mink, deer, squirrels, and even a variety of forest-dwelling or marsh-dwelling birds like cardinals, falcons, owls, and bald eagles.<br /> <br /> Buxton Woods also has its fair share of reptiles, which often make skittish runs across the trail. These species include green anoles, eastern box turtles, and southern dusky salamanders.<br /> <br /> Note that for hikers, bug spray is all but required in Buxton Woods, regardless of the season. A warm winter day can produce green flies, black flies, or even mosquitos just as well as a warm summer day can.

This site and museum is located on Hatteras Island in the village of Rodanthe on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.<br />   <p>isitors will find heroes, the early history of US Life-Saving Service/US Coast Guard in North Carolina and the home of the state’s first trained, shore-based rescue responders at Rodanthe’s Chicamacomico Life-saving Station. Chicamacomico was the first of seven Life-Saving Stations built in North Carolina in 1874 and is one of the most unique historical maritime sites on the East coast. The original building at Chicamacomico, commissioned Dec. 4, 1874, was the first Life-Saving Service staffed in North Carolina. It houses all of the equipment for fundamental Life-Saving Service training, such as drill pole, breeches buoy and cart, a rare life-car and original surfboat.</p> <p>Chicamacomico features two original Life-Saving Service/Coast Guard station buildings and their accompanying structures, such as cook houses, stable, water towers, a potable water beehive cistern, and assorted period rescue equipment. The unique historic site is carefully preserved and protected by the Chicamacomico Historical Association with help of dedicated local volunteers and generous contributors.</p> <p>The US Coast Guard recognizes the 1918 “Mirlo” rescue by the Chicamacomico station as one of the top rescues in maritime service’s history. Late in World War I, daring, well-trained Chicamacomico surfmen, led by the station’s Keeper John Allen Midgett, saved 42 sailors of the British tanker Mirlo from a fiery Atlantic after the ship was struck by a torpedo from German U-boat 117.  The actual surfboat No. 1046 used in the Mirlo rescue, photos, interviews, period and replica equipment which would have been used by these heroes and a sense of their daily lives can be found at the Chicamacomico site.</p>",

Gravity and plants keep them stable, but not static. Waves and wind shape the land, bringing new sand and moving it across the dunes. We carry sand away in our shoes and toss it to the wind as we shake our towels. Grain by grain, wave by wave, small changes add up over time. When a big storm, like a hurricane or nor'easter, strikes, dramatic changes happen fast. Winds whip the dunes and waves churn the beaches, finding weak points to cut an island in two. Storm surge overflows the islands, dropping beach sand on the soundside, which changes the shape of the island. This has been the natural cycle for thousands of years.<br /> <br /> - Waves and currents constantly change the coastline.<br /> - Wind carries sand across the islands.<br /> - Dramatic changes can be caused by heavy storms, such as Hurricane Irene in 2011.<br /> - In many ways, man-made elements alter the shape of the islands.</p>",

There are plans to improve the trail in the near future.</em><br /> <br /> The trail begins its journey to the marshy grass-lined edge of Pamlico Sound in a shrub thicket woodland. It crosses a boardwalk and splits into its loop just past a small, freshwater branch of Island Creek. Go right, and the trail passes an open dune scape where you'll notice low-growing prickly pear cactus. The path swings into a pine forest where distance from the ocean and an accumulating layer of soil invites less salt-tolerant species to take hold and mature.<br /> <br /> After more shrub thicket, a wooden viewing platform appears on the edge of the sound. Along the marsh, vegetation varies from the saltmeadow hay found above the highest tide lines to black needlerush and saltmarsh cordgrass. A rich organic stew of minerals, saltwater, and decaying sea and plant life creates the perfect nursery for fish and crustaceans such as clams, crabs, and oysters.<br /> <br /> The black skimmer, a gull-like bird, is often seen swooping low to use its large lower bill to scoop fish and other food from this fertile marsh. To the west, the setting sun might be dipping into the waters that obscure the distant shore of North Carolina.<br /> <br /> The trail swings back away from the marsh among thickets and then re-enters the pine forest. This low, protective cover is the key to survival for the forest's population of rabbits, black racers, skinks, mice, and tree frogs. It protects them from owls and the northern harriers often seen circling overhead.<br /> <br /> These are dunes slowly being clothed in a young forest.</p>",

The keepers did not live in the lighthouse but, when they were on duty, they would be found in the watch room at the top of the tower. Originally, the US Lighthouse Board provided housing, staple foods, medicine, and an annual salary up to $800. After the 1880s, keepers wore dark blue wool dress uniforms.<br /> <br /> They worked at the lighthouse performing maintenance, repair, and administrative duties. Each keeper was required to stand a four-hour watch during the night. The time of these watches alternated daily from keeper to keeper. On one day, the Principal Keeper may take the 8 pm to midnight watch, the 1st Assistant Keeper would take the midnight to 4 am watch, and the 2nd Assistant Keeper would take the 4 to 8 am watch. The following night the Principal Keeper would take the midnight to 4 am watch, and so forth. The keeper on watch at the end of the night would be responsible for all morning maintenance of the lamp and lens to prepare them for the upcoming night.<br /> <br /> The keepers' duties included:<br /> <br /> - Hand-carrying fuel up to the lantern room;<br /> - Fueling the lamp;<br /> - Trimming the wicks (later, replacing the mantles and pumping up the oil vaporizer);<br /> - Regularly cleaning and polishing the glass chimney, lenses, and windows;<br /> - Polishing brass fittings and tools;<br /> - Cranking up the weight, latching it, and letting it free when they lit the lamp at night;<br /> - Lighting and extinguishing the lamp;<br /> - Closing lantern room curtains by day to prevent sun damage of the lens glass;<br /> - Cleaning and lubricating the clockwork;<br /> - Painting the structure;<br /> - Routine maintenance and repairs of all buildings;<br /> - Greeting and lodging visitors and inspectors;<br /> - Writing reports, keeping records, and ordering supplies; and<br /> - Monitoring the light and nearby shipping at night.<br /> <br /> As the Cape Hatteras light station grew, so did the number of staff. In 1803, there was only one keeper, though sometimes he hired someone to help with jobs around the station. With the improvements of 1854, an assistant keeper was officially hired. When the current lighthouse was completed in 1870, it was determined that a second assistant was needed. By the late 1870s, a third assistant had been hired to maintain the Cape Point beacon (a small light at the edge of Cape Point). So for a time, there were four keepers and their families living on the light station grounds.</p>",

        "notes": "Historic Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/historic-cape-hatteras-lighthouse-site.htm\n\n<p>This is the location where the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse stood from 1870 to 1999.<br /> <br /> In 1999, the Cape Hatteras Light Station, which consists of seven historic structures, was successfully relocated 2,900 feet to the west from this spot. Because of the threat of shoreline erosion, a natural process, the entire light station was safely moved to a new site where the historic buildings and cisterns were placed in spatial and elevational relationship to each other, exactly as they had been at the original site. While the National Park Service has met its obligation to both historic preservation and coastal protection, the much-heralded move of the historic station, especially the lighthouse, was hotly debated and closely watched.<br /> <br /> Now, the nearby beaches are a popular spot for surfing.</p> <h3>Retreat from the Sea</h3> <p>The scene in front of you marks where the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse stood. Although built to withstand hurricanes, the lighthouse was no match for the encroaching Atlantic Ocean.<br /> <br /> Barrier islands, like Hatteras Island, move. Storms, wind, and water cause the island's ocean coastline to naturally migrate westward. Although the island moved, the lighthouse stayed in the same place. Efforts to shore-up the beach and keep back the sea, such as groins and sandbags, didn't help and often made things worse. Sea level rise compounded the issue.<br /> <br /> Eventually the ocean was within 60 feet of the tower and, to best protect the lighthouse, the National Park Service decided to move it inland. In 1999, the tower and its adjacent buildings were lifted and moved 2,900 feet to the southwest. With this retreat from the sea, the Cape Hatteras Light Station sits safely behind you...for now.</p> <h3>Encroaching Sea</h3> <p>When completed in 1870, the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was located a safe 1,500 feet from the ocean. Even then, however, storm-driven tides completely washed over Hatteras Island, eroding sand from the ocean side of the island and depositing it on the sound side. By 1970, this process, which has caused the gradual westward migration of the Outer Banks for at least the past 10,000 years, left the lighthouse just 120 feet from the ocean's edge and almost certain destruction.<br /> <br /> The key to preserving the 1870 tower is its \"floating foundation.\" Yellow pine timbers sat in fresh water on compacted sand, with a brick and granite foundation on top of them. This foundation was built because pilings could not be driven through hard sand located barely 8 feet below ground level when construction began. As long as the sand surrounding the foundation remained in place, and the timbers remained bathed by the fresh water in which they were placed in 1868, the foundation was secure. If a storm eroded the sand or the fresh water was disturbed by salt water intrusion, the timbers would rot and the foundation would eventually fail.</p> <h3>Protection Attempts</h3> <p>Since the 1930s, efforts were made to protect the lighthouse from the encroaching sea. The US Coast Guard installed the first sheetpile groins (walls built perpendicular to the shore) to try to protect the tower. In 1936, however, they temporarily abandoned the lighthouse to the sea and moved the light to a skeleton steel tower in Buxton Woods. In the 1960s and 1970s, as the ocean continued to creep closer, various attempts to stabilize the coast included beach nourishment and three new groins installed north of the lighthouse.<br /> <br /> A severe storm in 1980 accentuated the island's westward movement, washing away the foundation of the first (1803) lighthouse, which had been 600 feet south of the existing lighthouse. In 1803, that lighthouse had been one mile from the shoreline!<br /> <br /> Also in 1980, the National Park Service (NPS) began planning, under the National Environmental Policy Act, for long-term protection. A three-year process that included public meetings yielded several alternatives. Relocation was considered but quickly discounted as impractical. The option finally selected was a concrete and steel seawall revetment that would have protected the lighthouse in place, but would eventually have created an island as the coastline receded to the southwest. As moving technology advanced during the decade and additional information became available about relocation versus the approved seawall, the National Park Service examined the alternative that allowed it to accommodate natural processes while still preserving the historic structures of the light station.<br /> <br /> In 1987, NPS requested the assistance of the National Academy of Sciences, a group of scientists and engineers who advise the federal government on technical matters. The Academy's 1988 report, <strong>Saving Cape Hatteras Lighthouse from the Sea: Options and Policy Implications</strong> , considered ten options but recommended relocation as the most cost-effective method of protection. NPS also considered this the best overall solution in that it would preserve the structures and accommodate the natural shoreline processes.<br /> <br /> However, many people feared the lighthouse's destruction if moved improperly. From 1988 to 1995, the relocation option was debated and discussed, with no funding requests made at the Congressional level or concerted fund-raising campaigns undertaken in the private sector. As Federal budgets became leaner, NPS employees worked with the US Army Corps of Engineers on a short-term (10 to 20 year) protection option to build a fourth groin south of the lighthouse. Officials hoped that it would protect the most vulnerable section of the lighthouse area, and would give time to raise federal funds for relocation. However, North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission staff stated that it would not recommend a permit for building the fourth groin since placing any hardened structures on the North Carolina coast is prohibited by state statutes.<br /> <br /> In 1996, North Carolina State University independently reviewed the National Academy of Sciences' report and then issued its own report, <strong>Saving the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse from the Sea</strong> , in January 1997. It not only endorsed the National Academy of Sciences' findings, but also recommended that \"the National Park Service proceed as soon as possible with its present plans to obtain the financial resources necessary to preserve the lighthouse by moving it.\" NPS managers then initiated a concerted effort to begin the planning and funding process to move the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. Funding was finally appropriated by Congress beginning in fiscal year 1998.</p> <h3>Moving the Lighthouse</h3> <p>The decision to relocate the Cape Hatteras Light Station was a sound public policy decision based on the best science and engineering information available. International Chimney Corporation of Buffalo, New York was awarded the contract to move the lighthouse, assisted, among other contractors, by Expert House Movers of Maryland. In simple terms, the concept of moving the 4,830-ton structure consisted of lifting it off its foundation, transferring the load to a transport system, moving the tower along a prepared move route, and installing it on the new foundation.<br /> <br /> To accomplish this feat, the original foundation down to the pine timbers was replaced by temporary shoring beams and supports. Then a steel beam mat was inserted over the timber mat with temporary posts on top. As cross beams and main beams were set, the temporary shoring parts and beams were removed. Hydraulic jacks built into the main beams were used to effect the 6 foot rise so that roll beams and rollers could be introduced. After all jacks were shored, using oak cribbing, the system was pressurized and the jacks began lifting. At each lift level, jacks were retracted and shored up in sequence and the system lifted again to 6 feet. At this point it was ready to roll.<br /> <br /> After it was lifted, the tower moved along to its new location 2,900 feet to the southwest on steel mats starting on June 17, 1999. Steel track beams became rails and roller dollies permitted the support frame to move along the track. Three zones of hydraulic jacks kept the lighthouse aligned. Push jacks, clamped to the track pulled the frame forward 5 feet at a time. The lighthouse was equipped with sixty automated sensors to measure the transfer of the load, tilt, vibration, and shaft diameter. A weather station was installed at the top to monitor wind speed and temperature.<br /> <br /> The Principal Keeper's Quarters, Double Keepers' Quarters, oil house, cisterns, and sidewalks, which were moved during February, March, and April, awaited the lighthouse. On July 9, 1999 the lighthouse was carefully placed onto its new foundation, which consists of a 60' x 60' steel-reinforced concrete slab 4 feet deep, 5 feet of brick, and 1 1/2 to 2 feet of rock. The light station was whole once again with all the buildings being in the same relative position as they were originally.<br /> <br /> The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, sentinel of the perilous Diamond Shoals, where the Gulf Stream meets the Labrador Current, witness to the tragic sinking and triumphant rescues claimed by the \"Graveyard of the Atlantic,\" resumed its duties on November 13, 1999 and continues to do so to this day. Now safely 1,500 feet from the ocean, it should not be threatened by the indomitable ocean waves for another 100 years.</p> <h3>Move at a Glance</h3> <p>- Over a year of preparation work<br /> - Moved 2,900'<br /> - Moved in just 23 days... from June 17, 1999 to July 9, 1999!<br /> - Moved using horizontally mounted hydraulic jacks which pushed the tower along a track system in 5-foot increments<br /> - After the tower was pushed approximately 5 feet, the jacks were retracted and reset along the grid beams<br /> - Cost $11.8 million<br /> - Set back approximately 1,500' from the shoreline</p>",

The 1874 station has been beautifully restored. Little Kinnakeet was one of the first seven life-saving stations erected on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. These were all 1874-type designs, and all built in 1874. A kitchen/mess room was added to Little Kinnakeet in 1892. In 1900 the original station was moved to the west side of the highway. It was converted to a boathouse in 1904 when a Southern-pattern station house was added to the southeast corner of the grounds. The station was deactivated June 14, 1954. <br /> <br /> The United States Life-Saving Service Station No. 6 Little Kinnakeet, the southern-most of NC’s first seven, existed as an operational station from 1874 until 1915. It continued as operational U.S. Coast Guard Station No. 181 until 1954 when it was decommissioned and turned over to the U.S. Department of the Interior and became under the stewardship of the National Park Service (NPS), Cape Hatteras National Seashore (CHNS). The remaining site is extremely and uniquely significant: The 1874 Life-Saving Station is only one of three remaining in America; The 1904 Life-Saving/Coast Guard Station was one of only four ever built, all in North Carolina, and the only remaining example of the Southern Pattern architecture of Victor Mendleheff. The complex is currently not open to the public, but can be viewed from the nearby soundside access off-road vehicle ramp.<br /> <br /> <b>Significant Wreck & Rescues by Little Kinnakeet</b></p> <p>A sampling of rescues from the <i>Annual Reports</i> from the United States Life-Saving Service:</p> <ul> <li>Schooner <i>Henry H.

        "notes": "ORV Frequently Asked Questions\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/orv-frequently-asked-questions.htm\n\n<p>Cape Hatteras National Seashore’s Off-Road Vehicle (ORV) management plan and special regulation helps preserve the unique plants and wildlife of this dynamic barrier island ecosystem while permitting the use of vehicles on designated ORV routes. This FAQ provides information on the Seashore’s ORV regulations and how you can obtain a permit to drive on the beach within the Seashore.</p> <h3><strong>Basics</strong></h3> <p><strong>What is an ORV?</strong><br /> An ORV is any motor vehicle used off of paved park roads; such vehicles must comply with the vehicle and equipment requirements established by the park’s ORV management plan and special regulation, and use designated ORV routes. Any vehicle that does not comply is not authorized for use off of park roads. ATVs, UTVs, and motorcycles are not allowed on park beaches.</p> <h3><strong>Permits</strong></h3> <p><strong>Do I need a permit to use a vehicle off-road at the seashore?</strong><br /> Yes. An ORV permit is required.<br /> <br /> <strong>What are my options for obtaining an ORV permit? </strong>There are two types of permits: 10-day/$50 permits (valid from the date issued) and annual/$120 permits (valid for one year from the date issued).<br /> <br /> You may obtain a permit at any time via the web by visiting <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/\">www.recreation.gov</a>. Search for “Cape Hatteras ORV” from the home page or call 1-877-444-6777 to be connected to a recreation.gov representative. Proof-of-permit must be displayed on your vehicle during off-road driving.<br /> <br /> After you purchase the permit online, you will receive a digital copy of your permit registration, the rules and regulations, and a proof of permit windshield tag.</p> <ul> <li>Page one of the printed permit is the registration form and should be secured in the glove box of the permitted vehicle while driving on Seashore beaches. The signature block on the permit form must be signed in order for the permit to be valid.</li> <li>Page two of the printed permit contains all the beach driving rules and regulations.</li> <li>Page three of the printed permit is the visible proof of permit that must be affixed (taped) to the inside bottom corner of the driver’s side windshield. The visible proof of permit must be affixed and displayed properly, in order for the permit to be valid.</li> </ul> <p>Annual permittees may print at the time of purchase a temporary proof of permit. The permanent annual decal will be mailed to the permittee within 7-10 business days. The temporary proof of permit must be affixed, using tape, to the inside of the driver’s side windshield and must be displayed at all times that the permittee wishes to access the beach with an ORV. The temporary proof of permit can be used for no longer than 30 days and should be immediately substituted with the permanent decal once it is received via U.S. mail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Do I have to print the permit, or can I keep it digitally on my smart phone?</strong> You must print all three pages of the permit. The permit must be signed and the proof of permit must be properly displayed to be valid. If you cannot print the proof-of-permit, read how to get a self-certification card above.<br /> <br /> <strong>I need assistance with a problem I have with an online permit order. Who do I contact? </strong>If you need assistance with ordering an ORV permit, please contact Recreation.gov directly. You may contact the customer service department by phone, email, and chat. Here is the information that you will need:</p> <ul> <li>Email or chat, go to <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/contact-us\">https://www.recreation.gov/contact-us</a>. They will respond to your email inquiry within 24 hours.</li> <li>Reservation Line and Customer Service: 1-877-444-6777.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>What if I don’t have access to a printer? </strong>If you cannot print the proof-of-permit, you can pick up a self-certification card from outside the visitor centers or at many local tackle shops. On the self-certification card, simply write in the information from your permit, sign the card, and place on your dashboard.<br /> <br /> <strong>If I misplace my permit, or lose it, can I print another copy?</strong> Yes, here are the instructions:</p> <ul> <li>Login to your Recreation.gov account.</li> <li>Click on your name in the upper right corner.</li> <li>Click on the <strong>“My Reservations\" </strong>from the list.</li> <li>Find the correct permit and click <strong>\"Reservation Details.\"</strong></li> <li>Click on <strong>\"Print Permit.\"</strong></li> <li>Watch the 3.5 minute ORV Safety Video on the Cape Hatteras ORV Permit page at recreation.gov.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Are there any specific permit requirements for my vehicle?</strong><br /> Yes. To get an ORV permit your vehicle must:</p> <ul> <li>Be registered, licensed, and insured for highway use and comply with inspection requirements for the state, country, or province where the vehicle is registered;</li> <li>Have no more than two axles and have tires that are listed or approved by the <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/Tires+Rating\">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>; and</li> <li>Have a low-pressure tire gauge, shovel, jack, and jack support board.</li> <li>Other equipment that is recommended, but not required, is a full-sized spare tire, first-aid kit, fire extinguisher, trash bag or container, flashlight (if night driving), and tow strap.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Is there a limit to the number of ORV permits available?</strong><br /> No. There is no limit to the number of permits available.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Does the ORV permit guarantee that all ORV routes will be open for me to use?</strong><br /> No. There are several reasons that parts of ORV routes may be closed to ORV use:</p> <ul> <li>There are seasonal closures along certain routes from April 15 to October 15. These are shown on the ORV route map;</li> <li>Routes may be temporarily closed if the carrying capacity is reached;</li> <li>Routes may be temporarily closed if there is a specific need for resource protection; and</li> <li>Routes may be temporarily closed for safety reasons.</li> </ul> <p>All closures are clearly signed. For the most up-to-date route status, please visit <a href=\"https://go.nps.gov/beachaccess\">https://go.nps.gov/beachaccess</a>.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Several of my family members have ORVs. Do we need to get a permit for each vehicle?</strong><br /> Yes. You must get a permit for each vehicle.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can family members or friends use my vehicle on the beach if I have </strong><strong>an ORV permit for it?</strong><br /> Yes. The person driving the ORV permitted-vehicle must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license. The ORV permit must be in the vehicle and the proof-of-permit properly displayed. You should carefully review the regulations printed on the ORV permit with any person you let operate the vehicle. Your ORV permit can be revoked if they violate these regulations.</p> <p><br /> <strong>I plan to rent or lease an ORV during my vacation. How does the permit work with that?</strong><br /> In general, the person renting or leasing the vehicle should be the one applying for the ORV permit. Businesses that rent vehicles specifically for beach driving may obtain annual ORV permits for their fleet of rental vehicles and allow renters to use the permitted vehicles. The operator of the vehicle, whoever that may be, must obey the ORV regulations. The business-owned permit can be revoked if a customer violates the regulations.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I use my Interagency Amer</strong><strong>ica the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Senior or Access pass to get my ORV permit?</strong><br /> No. The ORV permit falls under the NPS Special Use Permit Program, so Federal Recreational Lands passes do not provide discounts for your ORV permit.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Is a separate permit required for night driving, when night-driving is allowed?</strong><br /> No. You only need your ORV permit.</p> <h3><strong>Routes</strong></h3> <p><strong>Where can I get a map of the designated ORV routes?</strong><br /> You can pick up an ORV route map from any park visitor center or any Outer Banks Visitors Bureau welcome center.<br /> <br /> <b>How do I find out which ramps and routes are open?</b><br /> Visit the Seashore's <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/beachaccess\">beach access table web page</a> to view the current status of beach ramps and routes.<br /> <br /> <b>What are the priority ocean beach routes? </b>Routes that are accessible from Ramps 2, 4, 25, 27, 43, 44, 48, 49, 70, and 72.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why do I sometimes see ORVs in areas closed to ORVs?</strong><br /> In addition to NPS vehicles being used by NPS employees to conduct approved management activities and emergency response vehicles, the NPS allows ORV use in certain areas closed to ORVs only for very specific purposes, this includes:</p> <ul> <li>Participants in regularly scheduled fishing tournaments if such tournament use was allowed in that area for that tournament before January 1, 2009.</li> <li>The use of special-permitted ORVs to transport mobility-impaired individuals to a predetermined location in a beach area in front of a village that is not otherwise open to ORV use. Stop by your local permit office for more information about this mobility-impaired transport permit.</li> <li>Commercial fishermen with a NPS commercial fishing permit when actively commercial fishing—as long as a beach is not a resource closure or a lifeguarded beach. Also, commercial fishermen can drive on the beach at 5 am on days when night-driving restrictions are in effect for the general public if they are actively engaged in authorized commercial fishing activity and able to present a fish-house receipt from the previous 30 days.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Driving on the Beach</strong></h3> <p><strong>How does the carrying capacity work?</strong><br /> The maximum number of vehicles allowed on any ORV route at one time is, basically, the length of the route that is open divided by 20 feet (6 meters). This, in essence, allows vehicles to park side-by-side, one row deep, as long as there is still room on the beach for two-way ORV traffic to pass behind parked vehicles safely. The carrying capacity prevents over-crowding and best provides for safety and visitor experience. In past years, such closures have only occurred on the Bodie Island spit for several hours, once or twice a year—and there were still many miles of beach open for ORV use elsewhere on the seashore.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I drive my two-wheel-drive vehicle on ORV routes?</strong><br /> Yes. Four-wheel-drive vehicles are recommended however, two-wheel-drive vehicles are allowed if, in your judgment, the vehicle is capable of off-road use in deep, soft sand.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What about tire pressure? What if my vehicle gets stuck on the beach?</strong><br /> When driving on ORV routes, tire pressure must be lowered in order to keep adequate traction within the posted speed limit. Tire pressure of less than 20 psi is recommended for most vehicles. The softer the sand, the lower the pressure needed. Re-inflate tires to normal pressure as soon as possible after you return to paved roads. If you get stuck and cannot get your vehicle out, your best bet is to call a commercial towing service. NPS rangers are not allowed to pull or tow your vehicle.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I tow a boat or utility trailer with my vehicle on ORV routes?</strong><br /> Yes. Towed boat and utility trailers with one or two axles are allowed. Trailers with more than two axles are prohibited.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I tow a travel or camping trailer (a trailer with sleeping and/or restroom facilities) on ORV routes?</strong><br /> No. Travel or camping trailers are prohibited on ORV routes. If you camp in the park, you must use one of the park’s designated campgrounds.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What is the speed limit on ORV routes?</strong><br /> The speed limit is 15 mph unless otherwise posted.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What are right-of-way rules I need to know?</strong><br /> Pedestrians always have the right-of-way. Vehicles must yield to pedestrians and move to the landward side of the beach when approaching or passing a pedestrian. When traveling within 100 feet of pedestrians, ORVs must slow to 5 mph.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I drive on ORV routes at night?</strong><br /> Yes, but there are some seasonal restrictions:</p> <ul> <li>November 16-April 30, all designated ORV ramps are open to night driving (24 hrs a day);</li> <li>May 1–July 31, to help protect nesting sea turtles, priority ORV ramps open at 6:00 am and close at 9:00 pm. All other designated ORV ramps open at 7:00 am and close at 9:00 pm;</li> <li>August 1-September 30, to help protect nesting sea turtles, priority ORV ramps open at 6:30 am and close at 9:00 pm. All other designated ORV ramps open at 7:00 am and close at 9:00 pm; and</li> <li>October 1 - November 15, All designated ORV ramps, including priority ramps, open at 7:00 am and close at 9:00 pm.</li> <li>September 15-November 15, all designated ORV ramps, including priority ORV ramps, open at 7:00 am and close at 9:00 pm. Transition to night driving could occur if there are no sea turtle nests remaining along a route.</li> </ul> <p>Priority ocean beach routes are routes that are accessible from Ramps 2, 4, 25, 27, 43, 44, 48, 49, 70, and 72.<br /> <br /> For the most up-to-date route status, please visit <a href=\"https://go.nps.gov/beachaccess\">https://go.nps.gov/beachaccess</a>.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Can I leave my ORV parked on the beach if I don’t drive it between 9 pm and 7 am during the seasons that night-driving restrictions are in effect?</strong><br /> No. During the restricted seasons, all vehicles are prohibited on ocean beaches.</p> <h3><strong>Wildlife Closures</strong></h3> <p><strong>Can I walk in the water around a wildlife closure?</strong><br /> Walking in the water adjacent to the park boundary can pose several issues for anglers. First and foremost, safety is a huge concern. The NPS does not recommend anglers walk in the ocean outside of the NPS boundary to avoid a temporary wildlife closure because they would be violating federal regulations if they became tired and needed to walk onto the beach (into the closure). Even if anglers stayed outside the NPS boundary the entire time, disturbance that they caused to the wildlife within the temporary closure area would be a violation of federal regulations. Temporary wildlife closures and buffers are in place to protect federally listed species, species of concern, and other wildlife at Cape Hatteras National Seashore.</p> <p>The best way to avoid a potentially unsafe condition that may result in a fine is to avoid walking in the water adjacent to temporary wildlife closures.</p>",

With showers, changing rooms, restrooms, and lifeguards on duty during the summer months, this is the perfect place to enjoy the beach while on Ocracoke Island.</p> <h3>Playing with Energy</h3> <p>Cape Hatteras is known for its waves. Whether you are a surfer, body-boarder, or just like to play in the sea, waves are part of your experience.<br /> <br /> Offshore winds pushing open ocean water create the wave energy you see near the shoreline. As the seafloor slopes up to the beach, that under-water energy compresses, water is pushed up, the energy is released, and a wave is born. If the wave gets too tall and steep, it will topple onto itself.<br /> <br /> You can get a sense of the seafloor below the water's surface by watching how the waves topple. Slow rolling breakers signal a shallow slope, while plunging tall breakers are evidence of a steep drop-off just beyond the beach.<br /> <br /> Waves follow patterns and rhythms. Several smaller waves are followed by larger waves; which is called a wave set. Take a moment before you go in the water to watch the breakers, see the patterns, and get a sense for the energy you will be part of in each and every wave.<br /> <br /> - The crest is the highest point of the wave, while the trough is the wave's lowest point. Wave height is the vertical distance between the crest and trough. Wave length is the overall horizontal length between two consecutive crests or troughs.</p> <h3>Know Before You Go</h3> <p>The seashore is an enjoyable place for swimming, but rough surf and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Tides, waves, and winds constantly barrage these barrier islands. Even at the shore's edge, crashing waves can pick you up and throw you to the sandy bottom causing injuries.</p>",

German U-boat 558 fired a torpedo that struck <strong>HMT Bedfordshire</strong> in a manner that caused the vessel to sink almost immediately. All 37 British Royal Navy sailors were killed. In the following days, the bodies of four sailors washed ashore on Ocracoke Island and were buried in local cemetery plots by residents.<br /> <br /> Every year, the National Park Service, the US Coast Guard, and the British Royal Navy have a ceremony at the site to honor the men who lost their lives in the attacks.</p> <h3>Operation Paukenschlag</h3> <p>On December 7, 1941, the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor thrust the US unexpectedly into active hostilities. It also compelled Germany's dictator, Adolf Hitler, to declare war on the US.<br /> <br /> This declaration brought about a secret plan-code-named Operation Paukenschlag (English translation: Operation Drumroll)-for a swift, decisive submarine assault on the American eastern seaboard. The strategy, conceived by German Rear-Admiral and U-boat commander Karl Donitz, was to take advantage of poor American war preparations and strike at the vulnerable, merchant-rich sea lanes just off the Atlantic coast.<br /> <br /> Initially, only five submarines were assigned to the operation, and as they began their stealthy voyage across the Atlantic in late December 1941, not even Admiral Donitz could foresee the success that these few U-boats would achieve.</p> <h3>Torpedo Junction</h3> <p>Meanwhile, merchant ships came and went along the coast as they pleased, one at a time, with their running lights ablaze and often without a zig-zagging course-a defensive maneuver which made torpedo attacks more difficult.<br /> <br /> Conditions ashore were just as bad. No blackout restrictions were enforced, which meant that coastal lights provided a bright backdrop for passing ships and eased enemy targeting, lighthouses and navigational buoys remained lit, proper patrol aircraft were unavailable, and, despite warnings from their concerned subordinates as well as their adamant British allies (who had broken the German naval code), the American naval command seemed oblivious to the potential for impending disaster.<br /> <br /> Disaster came promptly, nevertheless.<br /> <br /> The U-boats-their crews seasoned by two years of war and with no American defenses to concern them-roved at will and struck with predatory precision. As a result, Allied merchant ships went down in staggering numbers. From January to June, 1942, a total of 397 ships were sunk in American-protected waters!<br /> <br /> Off the North Carolina coast, where, as the U-boat commanders realized, Cape Hatteras served as a navigational focal point, so many merchant ships were sunk that captains referred to the area as \"Torpedo Junction.\" Flaming tankers burned so brightly off the Outer Banks that on shore, it was said, one could read a newspaper by the glow at night, while the grim flotsam of war-oil, wreckage, and corpses-was strewn across local beaches.</p>",

        "name": "Ocracoke Light Station",
        "notes": "Ocracoke Light Station\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/ocracoke-lighthouse.htm\n\n<p>The Ocracoke Lighthouse was built in 1823. It is the oldest working lighthouse in North Carolina, and the second oldest working lighthouse in the nation! Unique among the Outer Banks lighthouses, Ocracoke is an inlet light rather than a coastal light. Its job is to guide ships safely through Ocracoke Inlet. The lighthouse is still used and needed due to the constantly changing nature of the inlet and its shoals.<br /> <br /> Though it is not open for climbing, the site can be visited daily. The parking lot only has four regular-sized and one accessible space, so it is recommended that this site is visited by walking from the Ocracoke Island Visitor Center.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Ocracoke Inlet was first placed on the map when English explorers wrecked a sailing ship there in 1585. Two centuries later, this was one of the busiest inlets on the East Coast. Ocracoke Inlet was the only reasonably navigable waterway for ships accessing inland ports such as Elizabeth City, New Bern, and Edenton. Ocracoke Village, then known as Pilot Town, developed as a result of the inlet's use. Pilots, hired to steer ships safely through the shifting channels to mainland ports, settled the village in the 1730s.<br /> <br /> The US Lighthouse Service recognized that a lighthouse was needed to assist mariners through Ocracoke Inlet. In 1798, a wooden, pyramid-shaped tower on nearby on Shell Castle Island began helping mariners navigate the inlet. Unfortunately, the lighthouse was obsolete in less than 20 years due to the migration of the main channel. By 1818, the channel had shifted nearly a mile away! That same year, both the lighthouse and keeper's house were destroyed by lightning.<br /> <br /> A need for a navigation beacon still existed, so the Ocracoke Lighthouse was built in 1822 and first lit in 1823. A fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed in 1854, replacing the old reflector system. Its hand-cut prisms and magnifying glass greatly intensified the light.</p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>Fully automated, the lighthouse no longer needs a resident lightkeeper to tend to its daily needs. The US Coast Guard now oversees the operation of the light, while the National Park Service preserves the lighthouse.</p> <h3>Fresnel Lens</h3> <p>Mariners have depended on lights for navigation for over 2,000 years. As maritime travel and commerce increased, so did the quantity and quality of navigational lights. Brick and metal lighthouses replaced wooden platforms. Brighter burning oil lamps took the place of simple wood or coal fires. Parabolic or spherical reflectors were added to concentrate the lights and increase visibility. In 1822, one of the greatest improvements in lighthouse technology came when Augustin Jean Fresnel, a French physicist, introduced a new lens design.<br /> <br /> Fresnel's lens resembles a giant beehive with a system of multi-faceted glass prisms mounted in a brass framework. The prisms refract (bend) light and magnify it, thereby taking rays of light that would normally scatter in all directions and focusing them into a single beam. Because of this design, a Fresnel lens is much more efficient than traditional light sources. Tests show that an open flame loses nearly 97% of its light. A light with a reflector placed behind it loses 60-80% of its light. With a Fresnel lens, only a maximum of 20% of its light is lost! Before this, the brightest lighthouse beams could reach 8 to 12 miles away. The light from a Fresnel lens could shine all the way to the horizon, which is more than 20 miles away!<br /> <br /> Prior to the Fresnel lens, most lighthouses had only solid, steady lights. This made it difficult to distinguish one light from another, often causing confusion and dangerous conditions for passing ships. But the Fresnel lens could produce an almost unlimited combination of patterns, depending on the number of installed flash panels and the speed that the lens revolved.</p> <h3>Dimensions</h3> <p>- Height: 75 feet<br /> - Diameter at base: 25 feet<br /> - Diameter at top: 12 feet<br /> - Wall thickness at base: 5 feet<br /> - Wall thickness at top: 2 feet<br /> <br /> An octagonal lantern crowns the tower and houses the light beacon.</p> <h3>Oil/Generator House</h3> <p>The small block building formerly provided storage for lamp fuel. Whale oil, porpoise oil, and mineral oil (kerosene) have all served as fuel for the light. Today the light is electric, and this building now houses an auxiliary generator.</p>",

As duties at the lighthouse increased, an assistant keeper position was established. To house the additional keeper and his family, a second story was built onto the original quarters in 1897, and another section was added in 1929. The building is currently closed to the public.</p> <h3>Keeping the Light</h3> <p>Keepers at this light station performed a wide range of duties. Maintaining the buildings and grounds, hauling oil, trimming wicks, and polishing the lens were part of a well-trained lightkeeper's life.<br /> <br /> Ocracoke lighthouse keepers also fished, hunted waterfowl, raised livestock, and planted gardens. Due to the proximity of the village, the keepers and their families enjoyed a social life on Ocracoke and their children were schooled in the village. The US Lighthouse Service provided a traveling library to their isolated employees. Cases of library books were circulated every six months to light stations along the coasts.<br /> <br /> During hurricanes, the light station served as a place of refuge for some local residents. Situated on higher ground, the complex often remained above flood waters. Villagers, sometimes arriving by boats which navigated inundated roadways, waited out the storm in the keepers' home.</p> <h3>Storage Shed</h3> <p>Located between the keepers' quarters and the lighthouse, this small building of board and batten construction with a steep gabled roof with shingles of wood was constructed to act as a storage shed.</p>",

Others are born in the ocean and travel through inlets into the sound to spend their adolescence before returning to the sea. Some adult fish come into the sound to deposit their eggs among the protective eelgrass. Once hatched, the young stay and grow before leaving the sound for the ocean; only to return, maybe years later, to continue the cycle.<br /> <br /> - In the sound, food such as plankton, is readily available. Tall eelgrass gives shelter from the elements and predators.<br /> - The grass shrimp, periwinkle snail, and fiddler crab are some of the animals that spend their entire lives in the Pamlico Sound.<br /> - Some animals, like the red drum, flounder, bull shark, and clear-nosed skate are born in the sound and later live in the ocean.<br /> - The American eel and the green sea turtle are examples of sea life that may go from the ocean to the sound during their lifetime.</p>",

The same flat stretches of shoreline which caused the lighthouse's relocation also provide an easy pathway to the water, with no dunes to climb.</p> <p>Lighthouse lovers will also want to make a trek to the original location, which is designated by a circle of granite stones marking the original perimeter of the lighthouse's base. Most visitors are surprised at both the lighthouse's former proximity to the ocean, and the wide expanse of land from its old location to its new one - clear evidence of the dedicated and painstaking efforts that were involved in such a huge and long move.</p> <p>Beachcombers will also enjoy this stretch of Hatteras Island seashore, as the same jetties that pump up the ocean waves also allow for large deposits of shell piles on either side of the barrier.

In 1846 the hurricane created a wide, watery gash between present-day Bodie Island and Pea Island. During the storm, a ship that was caught in the Pamlico Sound, the Oregon, witnessed the sudden formation of the new inlet. After the storm had passed, the crew spread the word of the new, wide inlet that now separated Hatteras Island from the rest of the Outer Banks. As a result of their initial accounts, the inlet was named after this ship.<br /> <br /> At 2.5 miles wide, Oregon Inlet is one of the larger Outer Banks inlets, but that distance changes regularly with shifting sand bars, and incoming or outgoing tides.</p>",

The free-ranging animals were permanently penned in 1959 to prevent them from over-grazing the island's vegetation, and to safeguard them from traffic after the highway was built in 1957.<br /> <br /> Visitors can see the ponies from a wooden viewing platform that rises above the double wooden pasture fence, or by following a boardwalk about Â¼-mile to a second raising viewing platform. There is a donation box (summer-only) to the left of the stairway, for those who wish to help support the care of these cultural icons. For those wishing to support the care during the winter months, please stop by the Ocracoke Island Visitor Center to make a donation in person.<br /> <br /> From the parking lot, the beach is accessible from a boardwalk.</p> <h3>History of the Horses</h3> <p>Legend has it that the \"Banker\" horses of Ocracoke were left here by shipwrecked explorers in the 16th or 17th century. European ships commonly carried livestock to the \"New World.\" If a ship ran aground near the coast, animals were thrown overboard to lighten the load so that the ship could be re-floated. The livestock were often left behind when the ship again set sail. Sir Richard Grenville's ship <strong>Tiger</strong> ran aground at Ocracoke in 1585. There is speculation that he may have unloaded Spanish mustangs on the island.<br /> <br /> Horses have been documented on Ocracoke since the first European settlers came to stay in the 1730s. There have been as many as 300 horses on Ocracoke. While small and powerful, they are full-grown horses that are often called or referred to as \"Banker\" horses as their range included most of the Outer Banks. Physically, the Ocracoke horses are different from other horses-they have a different number of vertebrae and ribs as well as a distinct shape, posture, color, size, and weight that sets them apart.<br /> <br /> The horses have played a major role in the island's history, serving residents as beasts of burden at work and play, in beach rides and races. When the early colonists settled Ocracoke, they used the ponies to help make life easier on the island by pulling carts to haul freight and fish. The US Life-saving Service used them for beach patrols and to haul equipment to shipwreck sites. The US Coast Guard kept a small band of \"Banker\" horses to patrol the beaches in World War II. As time progressed, the families that lived on the island claimed the horses, holding penning events in the summer. Riders would start early in the morning at the north end of the island and drive the horses into the village where holding pens had been constructed. Once the horses were in the pens, the villagers would sort out the horses and brand the new ones. Some horses would be broken for riding or sold, and the rest were turned loose to roam free again.</p>",

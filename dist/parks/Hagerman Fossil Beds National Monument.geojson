This southern Idaho route was typically hot, dry, and dusty and exhausted travelers. Stopping at the Snake River made for a welcome respite. However, the volcanic geology found in this part of Idaho makes getting to the river difficult. Fortunately, the southern part of what is now Hagerman Fossil beds is made of sedimentary rocks, which not only preserved the monument's famous fossils, but also allowed emigrants on the Oregon Trail to access the river.<br /> <br /> For information about viewing the Oregon Trail and other features in the monument, stop by the park's visitor center in the town of Hagerman. There, get the latest information, see an introductory movie, view fossils up close, and obtain maps and information about what there is to see and do in the area.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> 17970 US Hwy 30, Hagerman Idaho</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hafo/index.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Traveling through this area was difficult for emigrants on the Oregon Trail. Heavy wagons dug into the ground, leaving behind deep ruts that are still visible today. To view these ruts and to hike alongside them, follow Bell Rapids Road from the town of Hagerman. The road enters the monument and travels to two overlooks.<br /> <br /> The first, <strong>Snake River Overlook</strong>, provides a view of the Snake River. Across from the overlook, on the road's south side, lies the Oregon Trail. Also here is one of two trailheads for a three mile hiking trail that follows the Oregon Trail.<br /> <br /> To reach the second overlook, the <strong>Oregon Trail Overlook</strong>, continue driving on the road for a few miles. From this overlook, deeply eroded wagon ruts can be scene. This is also the location of the other trailhead for the Oregon Trail hiking trail.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Bell Rapids Road, south of Hagerman, Idaho)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hafo\">Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

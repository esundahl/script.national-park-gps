If you look carefully, you can find finger mark indentations left by the people who smoothed the <em>bousillage</em> mixture into place. Built in the mid-1800s, it consists of architectural features that were evident during Colonial Louisiana. Such features include a post-in-sill wood frame, <em>bousillage</em> walls, and a wraparound porch roof; these types of roofs helped protect the walls and provided shade.<br /> <br /> On any plantation the blacksmith, as well as the carpenter, played essential roles as the plantation was being established. The blacksmith created hand-wrought nails, shod horses, and made tools and implements to be used on the plantation. Even well into the 20th century the blacksmith played an important role at Magnolia. As cotton prices declined, the Hertzog’s increased their cattle production. Brand marks are imprinted on the inside of the door, possibly to advertise the Blacksmith’s skill or maybe to test the accuracy of the brander or branding iron.<br /> <br />  ",

        "notes": "Magnolia Cotton Gin Barn\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/magnolia-cotton-gin-barn.htm\n\nThe Gin Barn houses cotton ginning and pressing equipment.  One side of the Gin Barn contains an 1830s wood screw cotton press used to press cotton into bales for market. One of only six wood screw presses remaining in the United States, this rare artifact predates the days of steam ginning and pressing. Enslaved laborers hand-picked the cotton. The cotton was cleaned and placed into the top box. As the press rotated around the stationary wood screw, the cotton lint compressed and formed a bale. The power source for the Magnolia press is unknown. Other presses used draft animals, so it is likely the Magnolia press operated the same way. A cotton bale weighed almost 500 pounds and used approximately one acre of cotton.<br /> <br /> The other side of the Gin Barn contains steam gins and a double-box steam press, which dates to the late 1800s. In front of the Gin Barn the large circular brick cistern collected rainwater from the roof to power the steam engine. This mechanization allowed for more efficient cotton production. Laborers no longer had to painstakingly clean, or gin, the cotton because the ginning equipment did this. Working the machinery was dangerous. If workers were not careful, they could lose limbs or even their lives. One person would call the press by singing a song with a beat that matched the timing of the machinery. This beat helped workers to know when to avoid putting their hands and arms inside of the machinery to avoid injury.",

Overseers were usually white men who were paid an annual salary, provided with a house, and a domestic worker, they managed the day-to-day plantation operations.

Pigeonniers were status symbols because they served to emphasize the wealth and importance of the plantation owner. Young pigeons, called squab, were used as food. Two popular and delicious meals were pigeon pie and squab on toast. Nothing went to waste on a plantation, not even the pigeon droppings, which were collected and used as fertilizer for the gardens.<br /> <br /> Standing near the Pigeonnier, Magnolia Plantation’s Main House is visible on the other side of the fence, behind the trees on PRIVATE PROPERTY. The Main House is not part of the Cane River Creole National Historical Park because it is still privately owned by the descendants of the LeComte-Hertzog family. The LeComte family came to the Cane River area in the 1750s, but it wasn’t until 1835 that Ambrose LeComte II and his wife Julia Buard established Magnolia Plantation, which was later managed by Matthew Hertzog, the son-in-law of Ambrose LeComte II. The LeComte family originally grew tobacco and indigo but soon changed the cash crop to cotton. Magnolia Plantation became one of the largest and most successful French Creole cotton plantations with over 6000 acres of land. Because the LeComte-Hertzog family farmed here until the 1960s Magnolia Plantation is recognized as a Bicentennial Farm.<br /> <br /> The Main House you see here today was constructed during the 1890s, after retreating US soldiers burned the original house during the Red River Campaign in 1864. During the time it took the LeComte-Hertzog family to rebuild the Main House, they lived in the Slave Hospital/Overseer’s House.<br /> <br /> The Cook’s Cabin is located on PRIVATE PROPERTY behind the fence to the right of the Main House. This building served as the Cook’s house and the kitchen for the Main House. The kitchen was always located away from the plantation’s Main House because of the risk of fire from cooking over an open flame.",

It was also an entertainment center. Local musicians would play music while men, women, and children danced and played dominos or shot craps on the porch and in the yard.<br /> <br /> Mostly empty now, this store was once stocked from floor to ceiling with merchandise. Items for sale included the some of the same things we use today, such as candles, kerosene, and small tools. Some foodstuffs for sale included wheat flower, condiments, such as sugar and salt, and canned goods. Agricultural items included seed, fertilizer, and insecticide.<br /> <br /> Prior to the 1930s, sharecroppers and tenant farmers were paid in plantation-specific paper scrip or brass tokens which could be redeemed only at that plantation store. Sharecroppers were dependent upon a good harvest to settle credit debt. If the harvest was poor, it was very easy to become buried under a mountain of debt. As the number of sharecroppers dwindled, so did the importance of the plantation stores. Magnolia’s Plantation Store closed in 1973.",

As many as twenty-four of the Magnolia Plantation Cabins were two-room brick structures with back-to-back fireplaces, accommodating a family or group in each of the two rooms. Converted to single family tenant housing after Emancipation, eight cabins of the Magnolia Plantation Quarters have survived. Many of the families who lived here were formerly enslaved, and their descendants, who continued to toil in the same fields where their ancestors labored.<br /> <br /> The terms tenant farmer and sharecropper are sometimes used interchangeably. A tenant farmer lives and farms on land owned by someone else. A sharecropper does not live on the land that is being farmed. To work the land, tenant farmers and sharecroppers gave a portion of the crop to the landowner. These workers shopped for goods at the plantation store on a credit system. When the crop came in, workers settled their debt with the landowner and the store. Whatever was left over was their net profit. If it was a bad growing season, or if boll weevils invaded the crop, workers might be in debt at the end of the year. It was difficult to get ahead under this system, so many workers migrated to large northern cites to find better jobs. Other workers were displaced by the modern tractor. The last family moved out of the Tenant Cabins around 1969.<br /> <br />  ",

Parterre gardens, with their low plantings and geometric patterns, were designed to be seen from the gallery of the raised house and were common to French landscape design. After a blight killed the boxwood hedges, the Prud'homme family used bottles from the wine cellar below the house to line the planting beds. The family maintained this tradition until the National Park Service acquired the property, replacing broken bottles with new ones or older ones from the wine cellar.<br /> <br /> Today, the roughly rectangular Bottle Garden contains beds in geometric shapes: rectangles, diamonds, hearts, waves, circles, clovers, and stars, laid out with sense of symmetry. The bottle edging includes wine bottles from Taylor Wine Company, ale and stout beer bottles, salt-glazed stoneware bottles, Anheuser-Busch beer bottles, mineral water bottles, soda water bottles, and bitters bottles. The oldest bottles date to around 1790, while the newest bottles dates to the late 1990s. The Bottle Garden is one of the more unique features at Oakland.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

The punkah was usually operated by an enslaved child and functioned as a fan to provide a breeze which also helped keep flies off the food. Mary Harris, interviewed in 1940 at age 86, recalled her experience as an enslaved child in Louisiana, “…Sure, I remember slavery times. I was a big girl, turned eleven.

The main house conveyed success but was only a small part of a plantation. Far more important was the work done beyond the main house.<br /> <br /> The Prud'hommes were not the only family living on this land. Generations of the same families of laborers, enslaved and tenant, lived on these lands for over two hundred years. The plantation’s first cash crops were tobacco and indigo, followed by cotton in the early 1800s.<br /> <br /> According to the Prud'homme family, the house was built entirely of local materials. The enslaved carpenters framed out the raised Creole house in cypress wood, using few, if any, nails. Although most of the carpenters are unidentified, documents record both Dominique Toussaint and Solomon Wilson as enslaved carpenters on the plantation. The walls are <i>bousillage</i>, which is made from mud mixed with Spanish Moss, and straw. Later wooden siding was put over the <i>bousillage</i>.<br /> <br /> In 1821, the upper level of house consisted of only four rooms, the parlor, dining room, and two bedrooms surrounded by a wide wrap-around gallery (porch). The original two rooms at ground level were the enslaved nanny’s room and wine cellar. Like many wealthy Cane River plantation owners Emanuel built a town house in Natchitoches and may not have lived on the plantation all year, instead relying on the overseer to manage day-to-day operations.<br /> <br /> By the 1940s, the need for manual laborers decreased with the increasing numbers of tractors and other equipment.

Smaller houses were typical in this area, as much of the day was spent on the galleries (porches) to catch cool breezes. It was common to have many children sleep in the same bed. As children got older, the boys would be moved into other rooms.<br /> <br /> There is a “trundle” bed underneath that is pulled out at night and then is pushed out of the way during the day to give more floor space for the children to play. The large bed, typical of the 1830-1840 period, is a display of the Prud’homme family’s wealth.<br /> <br /> Below the children's room was the room of the enslaved nanny. When she needed to care for the Prud’homme children, she came up a stairway through a trap door into this room. There is a photograph of a woman named Marie who was enslaved on the plantation– the caption says that she “grannied” seven of the family’s nine children. She may have been the widow of Solomon Wilson an enslaved carpenter.<br /> <br /> By the 1950s this was the bedroom of Vivian Prud’homme, the last child born in the house, and her aunt Lucie Prud’homme.",

Investing in an enslaved labor force and cotton provided the means to build the four-room house completed in 1821; that same year Emanuel and his wife Catherine went to Paris to buy furniture. However, most of the larger pieces, such as the armoire, bed, and chest-of-drawers, were purchased in New Orleans. The bed is from the 1830s and was purchased from prominent furniture merchant Mallard of New Orleans. The armoires were used instead of closets.<br /> <br /> The Prud’homme family’s Catholic heritage is reflected throughout the room and includes a picture of St Therese of Lisieux, a <i>prie-dieu </i>(prayer bench), and holy water font. Catholicism was also part of the lives of the enslaved. The French <i>Code Noir</i> (Black code), that provided a framework on how to run the institution of slavery, mandated that enslaved people be baptized into the Catholic faith. It is from these baptismal records that we learn the names and ages of some of the children enslaved on the plantation, including Magdelena, age two months, daughter of Juanna; Marie Therese, age nine months, daughter of Marthe; and Anna, age one year, daughter of Maria Luisa.<br /> <br /> Catholicism is a hallmark of Creole culture. Historically, Creole referred to people born in Louisiana during the colonial period, who spoke French, Spanish, and /or creole languages, and practiced the Roman Catholic faith regardless of their ethnicity. Creole goes beyond racial boundaries. It connects people to their colonial roots, be they descendants of European colonists, enslaved or free Africans, or those of mixed heritage. Many define Creole through foodways, music, folklore, family traditions, architecture, the Catholic faith, and genealogy.",

The invention of the cotton gin in the early 1790s made growing cotton profitable, but it dramatically increased the use of enslaved labor to produce that wealth. In 1795 the enslaved population was 38, but in less than fifty years it had nearly quadrupled to 145 persons. By the Civil War, nearly 160 enslaved individuals labored at Oakland. African American labor sustained Oakland Plantation and contributed to the wealth of the Prud'homme family.<br /> <br /> The paintings and photographs you see around the parlor are many generations of the Prud'homme family and their relatives. The man in the portrait to the right of the double doors is the founder of the plantation, Emanuel Prud’homme. The man in the large portrait on the side wall is Ambrose LeComte II, founder of Magnolia Plantation. His youngest daughter Elise married Jacques Alphonse Prud'homme I, who later inherited Oakland. By 1860, Ambrose LeComte II enslaved more people (235 individuals) and produced more cotton than any other Natchitoches Parish plantation.<br /> <br /> Music was an essential part of education for the wealthy, and many of the Prud’homme women were accomplished musicians. However, there were many talented self-taught musicians on the plantation, including Dominique Toussaint. Born enslaved on Oakland, Toussaint was a skilled carpenter who likely was involved in building the house. In addition, he was an accomplished fiddler who played for dances.",

The Prud’homme family imported casks of wine from France. Historical records show that in 1860 or 1861 Phanor Prud’homme and some of his relatives received twelve casks of claret from Bordeaux. Once bottled the wine would be stored in the wine cellar. The brick walls, built by enslaved masons, were painted red with mortar joints “penciled” in white, a popular treatment of brick until the 1900s, a technique meant to disguise irregularity of color, texture, coursing typical of handmade brick. The floor is paved with brick. The wooden racks along all four walls have holes to allow the bottles to be stored upside down. Storing wine this way prevented the corks from drying out. Bottles from the wine cellar would later be used to edge the flower beds in the formal garden in front of the house.",

These buildings were home to generations of workers at Oakland Plantation--first enslaved families and later tenant farming families. Many of those later families and individuals were formerly enslaved or descendants of enslaved people, who continued to toil in the fields where their ancestors had labored.<br /> <br /> Sharecropper and tenant farmer families lived in these quarters as late as the 1960s. The interior is historically furnished to the tenant farming era. Tenant farmers and sharecroppers did not own their own farms, and to work the land they had to turn over a share of the crop to the landowner. These people would shop for goods at the plantation store on a credit system. When the crop came in, they had to settle their debt with the landowner and the plantation store, and whatever was left over was their net profit. If it was a bad growing season, or if the boll weevil invaded the crop, the sharecroppers might be in debt at the end of the year. It was extremely difficult to get ahead under this labor system, so many farm workers from the south began migrating to large northern cities to find better jobs.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

You are about to enter one of the most intact Creole Plantations in existence. Creole can mean different things to different people. Here in the Cane River area, Creoles are descended from Louisiana’s colonial settlers. This can be any combination of colonial French, Spanish, African, or Native American descent. The term Creole can also be used to label the contributions of the Creole Culture, including their language, food, and architecture.<br /> <br /> Oakland Plantation was a thriving agricultural community for nearly 200 years. The workforce was originally comprised of enslaved laborers. Following emancipation, sharecroppers and tenant farmers worked the fields. Along with the people who worked the fields, you also had doctors, blacksmiths, carpenters, laundresses, and store clerks. All these people played key roles in ensuring the success of the plantation. Founded by Jean Pierre Emanuel Prud’homme around 1785, Oakland would remain in the family for the next two centuries. During that time span the family would endure the Civil War, outbreaks of the boll weevil, and the great depression.<br /> <br /> As you tour the plantation today, you will gain an understanding of life on a cotton plantation and come away with a new appreciation for the contributions of the diverse group of people who lived and worked on this land.",

In the words of historian Ann Malone, “the postbellum rural merchant was all things to his community…His store was the hub of the local universe. It was the marketplace, banking and credit source, recreational center, public forum, and news exchange.” Oakland’s store also served as a post office on and off during its existence, further enhancing its importance in the community.<br /> <br /> The plantation store could also prove to be a financial burden to the sharecroppers. Quite often sharecroppers could not get out from under the mountain of debt that they accumulated at the stores. Historian Carol Breedlove noted, “Perhaps the Prud’hommes could have done more, or been more generous [with the sharecroppers]. On the other hand, they could certainly, in their environment and historical period, have done less, been less supportive and more selfish.” As the numbers of sharecroppers dwindled, so did the importance of the plantation stores. The Prud’hommes closed their store for good in 1982.<br /> <br /> The Oakland Plantation Store is the park's main visitor contact station. Inside the store you will find historic exhibits, NPS passport stamps, Junior Ranger books, and a gift shop.",

The wash house was where laundry was done.<br /> <br /> Chickens were a common site on plantations. In historian, John Michael Vlach’s book <i>Back of the Big House </i>he cited the following advantages to raising chickens: “they provided both meat and eggs; they could be maintained on very small amounts of feed; and they could be killed on short notice, thus reducing the risk of spoilage.”<br /> <br /> Laundry was originally done by enslaved workers, and then by paid domestics.

Corn was an essential part of the diet of the enslaved worker, and used as feed for livestock. Today on Cane River, corn has surpassed cotton as the main agricultural product.<br /> <br /> Beside the Corn Crib, sits a brick cistern. The groundwater in this region was unsuitable for drinking, so the people built cisterns to collect rainwater. Cisterns can be made from brick and buried underground, or they can be constructed from wood and placed above ground or in attics.

They signal the change from floating in the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge to floating through private lands. <br /> <br /> There are two private canoe, kayak, and tube landing/launches on the Northern bank of the river as well as a public restroom, a section for public parking, and great views of the Berry Falls from all angles.<br /> <br /> We love viewing the falls from the Berry Bridge in every season. The falls flow year-round and under the guise of a gentle snowfall bring a sense of calm and stillness. The sound of the falls feeding into the river with the echoes of laughter from floaters rings in the summer season. <br /> <br /> Floaters on the river take their time passing these waterfalls; it is rare to get so close to waterfalls while floating the Niobrara River. Many of the other waterfalls are tucked up and into canyons or are too high up on the river walls for visitors to feel the spray and splash of the flow. <br /> <br /> Climbing on the Berry Falls is not allowed. The land of that river bank is actually privately owned, and the owners would like to preserve the structure of the Berry Falls for many years and visitors to come. ",

Sergeant John Ordway observed that “the water Shoots in to the Missiouri verry Swift, & has thrown the Sand out, which makes a Sand bar & Sholes from the mouth a considerable distance.” The shoals and the rapids, according to William Clark, made the river “not navagable for even Canoos without Great difficulty.” Clark managed to eke his way a few miles up the river, however, where he saw an empty Ponca village (everyone was out on a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/independence-creek.htm\">bison hunt</a>). </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{58}\" paraid=\"787271977\">To Ponca people, the rivers and surrounding landscape are a source of sustenance, physically and spiritually. This is their homeland.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{80}\" paraid=\"1310773078\">Stories passed down by Ponca elders describe the area around the Niobrara as Wašé, or plenteous. The silty deposits in the river bottoms created fertile soil for cedar, oak, and elm trees. Ponca families farmed in the bottomlands, growing corn, squash, and pumpkins. Fish flourished at the confluence of the Missouri and Niobrara Rivers. The high bluffs and sheltered gullies teemed with mule deer, bison, geese, and other game.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{92}\" paraid=\"1539239419\">Ponca camps and villages could be found as far north as the Black Hills of South Dakota and as far south as the Platte River. But, according to Ponca elder Louis Headman, the Niobrara “was the last area of land they considered theirs before the removal” to reservations in Kansas and Oklahoma.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

When flow is high, the chute can be flooded in water so high that even the stone ledges on each side are covered. We love the view in years when the walls can be seen and sometimes even walked out on. <br /> <br /> The Norden Chute is protected by both the National Parks Service and the Nature Conservancy organization that protect the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/niobrara-valley-preserve.htm\">Niobrara Valley Preserve</a> on the South side of the river at this location. <br /> <br /> Our recommendations for a great visit to Norden Chute are to take time to use five sense to experience this powerful river feature. What do you see, smell, taste, feel, hear?<br /> <br /> The Norden Chute looks like a waterfall in the middle of the Niobrara river, but is more accurately known as a \"hydraulic feature.\" Meaning that the force of the water falling over the ledge causes erosion when it \"lands,\" and a plunge pool that is deeper than the rest of the streambed is formed. The water falling into the plunge pool causes suction and vortexes that can pull other objects deep under the water like sediment, rocks, debris, and in extreme cases, a kayak or canoe. <br /> <br /> The hydraulic forces under the Norden Chute are dangerous and paddlers and floaters are required to portage around it, meaning that there is a location up stream on the North river bank where floaters get out of the water and carry their floating vessels further downstream past the chute where it is safe to float again.",

        "notes": "Smith Falls State Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/smith-falls-state-park.htm\n\nSmith Falls is an iconic waterfall in the State of Nebraska. It is the tallest waterfall in the state at 63 feet tall and has been a popular stop for floaters and visitors of the Niobrara River Valley for many years.<br /> <br /> Early settlers first knew the waterfall as Arikaree Falls, a tribute to the names that were given to the local bodies of water by the 21 Native American Tribes who called the Niobrara River Valley home.<br /> <br /> In 1896, the first homestead patent for the land where the waterfall resides was filed by Frederic Smith. Since then, the falls have been known as Smith Falls.<br /> <br /> In 1941 Fred Krzyzanowski purchased the land and his family has owned the parcel ever since; in 1992 the Krzyzanowski family leased the land to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to form Smith Falls State Park. <br /> <br /> The Smith Falls State Park is 250 acres on the Niobrara National Scenic River corridor and boasts handicap accessible board walks to the Smith Falls viewing platform and the visitor center.<br /> <br /> Smith Falls State Park is a common landing location for kayaking, canoeing, and tubing on the Niobrara National Scenic River, and in the summer is a popular wayside excursion for floaters with a landing just 300 yards from the Smith Falls observatory.<br /> <br /> Not a floater? That's okay. The State Park offers hiking on the Jim MacAllister Nature Trail, fishing on the river banks, camping on the riverside, and other historic interpretive sites. These were first established by Fred Krzyzanowski in an attempt to accommodate the swelling public interest that the Smith Falls received before the park was leased to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission for management.  <br /> <br /> The Smith Falls are an area of unique biodiversity along the Niobrara National Scenic River where the Smith Aspen, a one of a kind aspen hybrid species, can be seen. The cool, wet canyons along the Southern shore of the Niobrara River, like the one where the Smith Falls flow, are a crossroads of ecosystems and to this day host the spruce and paper bark birch trees that began to die off when the last glacier retreated from the plains and the weather became warm and dry in the region. The unique flora are a reference to the Ice Age and and prehistoric history of the Niobrara River Valley. <br />  ",

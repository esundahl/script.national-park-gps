However, why the earthwork was built and when it was built remains a bit of a mystery. What is known is that Ralph Lane, the expedition leader of the 1585 expedition, was familiar with and had built similar earthworks to this one. Also, that artifacts pertaining to metallurgical work were found just to the west of the earthwork, further reinforcing the leading idea that this earthwork was built in 1585. However, no evidence yet has been uncovered to prove that, or to explain the purpose of the earthwork.<br /> <br /> The trench of the earthwork was excavated by archeologist J.C. Harrington in 1947, which determined the shape of the earthwork. In 1950, using techniques from the late 1500s, archeologists reconstructed the earthwork by excavated out the fill material in the trenches and piling the material into walls.</p>",

Word spread throughout North Carolina that slaves could find \"safe haven\" on the Island. By the end of 1862, over a thousand runaway slaves, freed men, women and children found sanctuary here.<br /> <br /> This colony, precursor to the Freedmen's Bureau, was to serve as a model for other colonies throughout the South. Once again this small island, site of the first English attempt at permanent settlement in the New World, became a land of historic beginnings.<br /> <br /> The Freedmen's Colony encompassed unoccupied, unimproved lands from Manteo to the north and west shores, including some of the land today known as Fort Raleigh National Historic Site. A sawmill, hospital, a school with black female teachers and homes were established.<br /> <br /> Able-bodied men were offered rations and employment to build a new fort. They also enlisted to form the First and Second North Carolina Colored Regiments. The colony could not remain self-supporting without men and became a refuge for three thousand women, children, aged and infirmed.<br /> <br /> Upon the war's end, the federal government discontinued rations and supplies to colonists and returned land to original owners. Reminiscent of early English efforts, the Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony was abandoned by 1867. Many freed people remained, and their descendants would become respected local residents. Others settled in communities throughout the region and would become an integral part of eastern North Carolina culture. <p> </p> <h3>Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony</h3> <p>The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony was created shortly after the Battle of Roanoke Island in February 1862, when Union forces seized control of the area from Confederate troops.<br /> <br /> From 1862 to 1867, the colony, under the direction of US Army chaplain Horace James, operated on land in the northwest portion of Roanoke Island. Churches, schoolhouses, homes, storefronts, and a sawmill were all constructed and, at its peak, the colony had a population of over 3,000 freed and escaped slaves.<br /> <br /> At war's end, politics played a major role in the dismantling of the colony, and by 1867 the colony was mostly abandoned. The exact location of the colony is still unknown.</p>",

This force was under the joint command of General Ambrose Burnside and navy Flag-Officer Louis Goldsborough.<br /> <br /> After several delays due to bad weather, the Union fleet, consisting of numerous troop transports and more than 20 war vessels, arrived at the southern end of Roanoke Island. On February 7, 1862, Federal warships bombarded Fort Bartow, southernmost of the Confederate defenses. The fort returned the fire but with little effect. The Confederate fleet, under Captain W.F. Lynch, waited to engage the Federals behind a line of obstructions placed in Croatan Sound to retard the Federal advance. However, the Confederate fleet, after a sharp engagement which was ended only by darkness, was forced to retire due to a lack of ammunition.<br /> <br /> On February 8, 1862, the Federal fleet bombarded various positions on Roanoke Island in support of General Burnside's land offensive. After the Union victory on the afternoon of February 8, a detachment of Federal ships under Commander S.C. Rowan was sent into Albemarle Sound in pursuit of the Confederate fleet.

There are great opportunities for birding along the trail, and several trailside markers provide some perspecitve on the area and ecosystem. Trail is a half-mile loop.<br /> <br /> A Strange New Land</p> <br /> In the late 1500s, Roanoke Island and London had very little in common. Imagine what it was like for Thomas Hariot when he first set foot on this strange new land. New people, new plants, new animals- everything was truly \"new.\" Is this land new to you? Look carefully and listen closely as you walk this trail. What strikes you most about this foreign land?<br />   <h3>A Very Costly Venture</h3> <br /> Although supported by Queen Elizabeth, the Roanoke Voyages were privately funded. Surely there was wealth and power to be gained in the New World, but how much, and where? Sir Walter Raleigh assigned Thomas Hariot, one of the most preeminent scientists of the time, to answer these questions.<br /> <br /> While here in 1585, Hariot documented the value of the plants, animals, and minerals he found. Returning to England in 1586, Hariot brought good news to Raleigh and his investors, enthusiastically praising both the people and the land of the New World<br /> <br /> > ...commodities alreadie found or to be raised...as by way of trafficke and exchange with our owne nation of England, will enrich your selves the providers; those that shal deal with you; the enterprisers in general; and greatly profit our owne countrey men... -Thomas Hariot, <strong>A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia</strong> <p> </p>",

Here on Roanoke Island a great moment in history occurred when 116 men, women, and children planted the roots of English society on the shore at Fort Raleigh. The colonists' hopes for a better life in the New World, however, clashed with the neighboring Indians. The settlement soon disappeared but the colonists' dreams lived on.<br /> <br /> Since the early 1900s, the residents of Roanoke Island have paid tribute to these early English beginnings by staging events each summer. Success of a 1921 movie about the ill-fated settlement led the the creation of an outdoor drama, <strong>The Lost Colony</strong> .<br /> <br /> Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Green created the semi-fictional script from firsthand accounts. <strong>The Lost Colony</strong> is presented each summer in the outdoor Waterside Theatre by the Roanoke Island Historical Association. To the millions of people who have witnessed the play since 1937, <strong>The Lost Colony</strong> remains a tribute to those who struggled and died colonizing the New World.</p>",

Algonquians, Europeans, and African Americans have all played their parts here.<br /><br />First here were the Carolina Algonquian, who farmed the land and fished the sounds. In 1584, English explorers sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh arrived here. It was the first of three voyages in England's attempt to colonize North America. During the American Civil War, the US Army established a freedmen's colony here. The colony prepared formerly enslaved people for life after the war.<br /><br />Today, The Lost Colony dramatically interprets the 1580s interactions between the Algonquian and English.

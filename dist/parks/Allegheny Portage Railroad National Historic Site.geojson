It is built over the foundation of the original Engine House 6 and helps to protect its remains from the elements. The machinery housed inside is also a reproduction of the many wheels, gears, boilers, and brakes of the stationary steam engine and its accessories that raised and lowered rail cars and canal boats on the incline. Engine houses were very dangerous places to work with all of this machinery in motion, fires and scalding hot water in the boilers and many cars going back and forth along the rails. In 1852, the boilers actually exploded and killed several of the workers. The glass-walled “discovery room” contains several hands-on exhibits that help to further explain the workings of an inclined plane on the Allegheny Portage Railroad.

There were 10 inclines on the railroad between Hollidaysburg and Johnstown. In the 1830s, when the Portage Railroad was built, the primitive locomotives couldn’t haul trains up steep grades. The engineers of the Portage came up with the idea to build 11 sections of nearly level track that were connected by 10 inclined planes to raise or lower trains from one level to the next. This made the railroad like a giant staircase up one side and down the other side of the mountain. Each incline was operated by a stationary steam engine housed in a structure like the one to your right. The rail cars and sectional canal boats were attached to a large hemp rope that raised and lowered them. Accidents were common and this hemp rope was eventually replaced by John Roebling’s iron wire rope. The tracks in front of you are reproductions. Notice how there are no stone sleepers here. They would have shifted out of place on the steep incline, so wooden ties were used instead on all 10 planes. Also notice that the rails themselves are mostly wood, with just a strap of iron on top since heavy locomotives wouldn’t be traveling on the incline. On select summer days, rangers can be seen making these wooden ties just like they did in the days of the Portage along the trail to your left.",

It is the original structure and has been restored by the National Park Service to what it would have looked like around 1840. This tavern was operated by Sam and Jean Lemon and provided food and drink to the travelers and workers of the Portage Railroad. Though the structure appears very large, overnight guests were not a frequent occurrence. The building was constructed large enough to contain the tavern business, plus upstairs living quarters for the Lemon family and their many employees. Similar businesses sprouted near to all 10 inclines of the Portage because of the delay in travel caused by the slow inclines. In addition to this tavern, the Lemons also operated a coal mine, sold stone, wood, and water to the state-run Portage Railroad, and leased horses to pull rail cars in and out of the Engine House. The Lemon’s business interests led them to become one of the wealthiest families in the area. The Lemon House is open daily from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.

The yellow paint on the walls is a copy of the original color, intended to do its best to brighten a dark and smoky room. The furnishings are reproductions of the types that would have been found here. The spit boxes and spittoon on the floor were meant to catch the tainted saliva that was the product of the most common nasty habit of the day. Visitors to America at that time commented on how seemingly everybody they encountered was constantly chewing and spitting. The raccoon gazing down from the shelf in the corner is the symbol of Mr. Lemon’s beloved Whig Party, the counterpart to the Democratic Party in the two-party system of pre-Civil War America. The main hall from which you entered the bar was a place to relax and catch up with the news by way of the newspapers left behind on the benches by other travelers. Local businesses posted notices on the walls to entice potential customers passing through the area. The painted canvas oilcloth on the floor protected the wood from the many wet, muddy shoes that passed through the door.

Many transportation companies scheduled their meal breaks at the Lemon House, and even in the cases of those that didn’t, there was ample time to stop in for a bite because of the delay caused by Incline 6. The fare wouldn’t have been fancy, usually some sort of stew, because it could be kept warm all day waiting for the next group of travelers to come through the door. There was no menu or special orders. Everybody at the same thing. This was the fast food of the 1830s and 40s. And it was all you can eat for 25 cents. Before you say what a bargain that was, remember that most workers of the time only earned about 50 cents a day. Notice other similarities to the modern fast food establishments—the hard seating surfaces so you don’t stay too long, the easily wiped tables-no table cloths here, and the flooring that allowed spills and muddy footprints to be easily cleaned up.

This was truly a multi-purpose room. People could be eating at one table, while other travelers may be engaged in a game at another in the corner. A businessman from Pittsburgh could be catching up on the latest news in a chair by the fireplace, while his wife may be playing the piano under the watchful gaze of Mrs. Lemon, or at least from her painting that hangs above.

This bridge was required because the turnpike and railroad crossed paths along the length of Incline Plane #6 and therefore a standard wooden railroad crossing would not work because of the ropes of the incline. The privately-run turnpike also required the state-run Portage to build the bridge at the exact angle the turnpike crossed the railroad. The state had actually started to build the bridge at a much-easier-to-build right angle to the railroad, which they then had to tear down and start over at the correct angle. The construction journal of May 21, 1833, notes the expense of “taking up and relaying of masonry in consequence of alteration in place.” Fenlon, Darlin, & Co. was the contractor and the bridge was completed at a cost of $2327.44. The bridge continued to be used until the early 20<sup>th</sup> century and actually carried automobile traffic. Make sure to examine the spiraling stonework on the underside of the arch. The skills of the stonemasons are very evident there. If you reached the bridge by way of the trail, please be careful crossing the highway on your way back.",

You’ve made it to the Staple Bend Tunnel, the first railroad tunnel in America. Hopefully you didn’t forget your flashlight, because there are many interesting things to see inside. If you’re biking, please walk your bike through the tunnel for safety. The Staple Bend Tunnel opened in 1834 and allowed the tracks of the Portage to bypass a long bend in the Little Conemaugh River. Mainly Irish and Welsh workers constructed the tunnel by hand-drilling long holes which were then filled with black powder. Once a series of holes were drilled and blasted, the broken stone was carted out and used as fill on other sections of the railroad. The tunnel was excavated from each end and the two crews met in the middle. On Christmas of 1832, a large party was held at the tunnel on this occasion of “holing through” and the contractors, officials, and workers made many toasts in celebration. Amazingly no workers were killed in the tunnel during its construction, but at least 4 people were killed inside as the result of careless accidents during the operation of the Portage. The tunnel was abandoned in 1852 as the first section of the New Portage Railroad, which bypassed the inclines, was opened. The restored tunnel reopened in 2001 when this trail was completed. Enjoy your time exploring the tunnel and be careful on your return to the parking lot.",

Though some were impressive viaducts, the most famous of which was the Conemaugh Viaduct with an 80 foot span, most of these passages were stone culverts and drains with spans of just a few feet to twenty feet. Passages for water had to be created for even the smallest of streams, even ones that are dry for part of the year, because during storms rushing water could quickly wash the railbed away and cause travel delays and expensive repairs. These culverts were all created from hand cut sandstone that was quarried nearby and then covered over with earthen fill to create a level roadbed for the tracks above. The park has been restoring many of these culverts, but many others are still in good repair and still function to divert water under and away from the railroad to this day.",

They were called sleepers and were hand-cut from local sandstone. These sleepers were used on about 31 of the 36 miles of the Portage Railroad. Stone sleepers were not used on the inclines of the Portage because the heavy stone blocks would have shifted out of place on the steep slopes. Each sleeper took about 24 hours of total work to create, from the quarry to being ready to place in the railbed. The workers made over 200,000 sleepers for the railroad. Can you imagine making a 500 pound sleeper with just a hammer and chisel? Hard work indeed! Notice that there are two holes drilled into the top of each sleeper. Wooden plugs were pounded into these holes and then railroad spikes to hold the iron rails had a place to be driven into. Stone sleepers were only used for a short time on early railroads in America. The technology had been copied from Great Britain and American railroad builders quickly determined that it would be much easier and cheaper to use wood for railroad ties instead. Wooden ties would not be permanent like ones made of stone, but they would be cheap and easy to replace and also created a more stable railroad because the two rails of each track were actually connected together and could not spread apart like rails laid on individual sleepers.",

Look at or feel the marks left behind from these stonecutters on the outcropping of stone near the boardwalk. These marks are from the hand drills that were used to split large blocks of stone into smaller ones. Feel how rough the stone is and imagine how tough your hands would have become handling this for hours on end each day.

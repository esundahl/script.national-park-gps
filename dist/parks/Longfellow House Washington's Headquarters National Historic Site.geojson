The design of this structure is both distinctively Colonial Revival and Classical Revival in character; it modestly evokes triumphal arches and Romanesque church architecture.

A popular legend claims that George Washington took command of the army under the “Washington Elm” but there is no historical evidence to support this claim. The tree fell due to disease in the 1920s. Throughout the Boston Campaign, the Cambridge Common was used by the Continental Army as a place for drill and encampment. Today Cambridge Common has several monuments, including a plaque representing where the Washington Elm once stood, as well as a nearby trio of cannons dedicated to Revolutionary War figures. The cannons are dedicated to Brigadier General Tadeusz Kościuszko, Major General and Boston native Henry Knox, as well as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">George Washington</a>.

Most of the founding members of the congregation were from the wealthy families that lived along Brattle Street, many of whom later became loyalists during the conflict. By 1774, with the church building you see today still incomplete, many of these loyalist congregants fled Cambridge for the safety of Boston and England. Due to the church's reputation as a loyalist organization, the Continental Army took control of the building and housed soldiers there during the Siege of Boston. Martha and George Washington forestalled the church's destruction when they requested to hold service there in December of 1775, but this spark of interest was not enough to save the church immediately. The building remained closed and in disrepair for nearly 15 years. By the end of the 1700s, however, a new Episcopal congregation reopened the church. That new congregation is still active there today.</p>",

It is the present purpose, to make the new Cambridge Bridge one of the finest and most beautiful structures in the world.\" The Longfellow Bridge was authorized by the same 1894 legislation which authorized the Boston Transit Commission, the Tremont Subway, and the Charlestown Bridge. Like the Tremont Street Subway, the Longfellow Bridge was in large part a result of heavy streetcar congestion brought about by the increased traffic of the new electric cars. The old West Boston Bridge, constructed in 1793 and rebuilt in 1854, had been on the very first route to carry horsecar traffic, in 1856. Originally known as the Cambridge Bridge, the present structure was begun in July 1900 and completed in 1907, named for Cambridge poet <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-wadsworth-longfellow.htm\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> in the centennial year of his birth.</p> <p>Though not the original structure, in 1855 the bridge into Cambridge played a role in the fugitive slave case of John Jackson. Escaping enslavement in Virginia, Jackson settled in Boston and found work on a coasting vessel. However, after being in Boston for a couple of weeks, Jackson’s former enslaver learned of his whereabouts and sent slave catchers to apprehend him. According to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-liberator.htm\">The Liberator</a>, while walking home from work in January of 1855 Jackson, “was accosted by a white man who, from the description given, answers very well for a noted slave-catcher of this city, and asked if his name was not Jackson.”<sup>1</sup> Jackson refused to give his name and, when pressed about his home address, Jackson lied, telling the slave catcher he lived in Cambridge.</p> <p>Believing this lie, Marshall Asa Butman hoped to catch Jackson on his way to work. The next day, as reported by <em>The Massachusetts Spy</em>, “Notorious Asa O. Butman was seen to take a position upon the bridge early on Wednesday morning where he remained for about three hours.”<sup>2</sup> Butman, the slave catcher that arrested <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>, did not get a chance to apprehend John Jackson. Jackson, with the aid of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committee</a>, left Boston and relocated to Worchester, remaining free for the rest of his life.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/486365b2-0027-4247-a314-ffc92add7123\"><img alt=\"Handwritten record listing R.F.

The result was an Italian Renaissance garden with a Gothic “rose window” in the center and an overall Persian carpet pattern; remnants of this design can still be seen today.</p> <p>Following Henry Longfellow’s death in 1882, the garden fell into disrepair. The poet’s daughter, Alice Longfellow, took an interest in the garden, hiring one of America’s first female landscape architects, Martha Brookes Hutcheson, to restore it in 1904. Hutcheson reestablished the original boxwood parterres, then enclosed the garden with fences, gates, and a pergola to make an “outdoor room,” typical of the Colonial Revival style.</p> <p>At the center of the garden, Alice Longfellow placed a sundial inscribed “Pensa che questa di mai non raggiorna” or “Think that this day will never dawn again.” It was a favorite line of her father’s from Dante’s <em>Purgatorio</em>.</p> <p>In 1924, Longfellow hired Ellen Biddle Shipman to rejuvenate the space. She was known for her painterly design, enclosed spaces, and for emphasizing the relationship between garden and house. Shipman planted the rectangular borders with heirloom roses and added evergreens and ornamental fruit trees to give the garden height. Just as importantly, Shipman made detailed planting diagrams and cultivar lists for future maintenance.</p> <p>In the late 20th century the garden again fell into disrepair, and only the smaller center portion of the garden was maintained by the Cambridge Plant and Garden Club. In 2003, the Friends of Longfellow House-Washington’s Headquarters funded the restoration of the garden. Using Shipman’s extensive documentation and heirloom varieties of plants, Alice Longfellow’s Colonial Revival garden has been recreated for visitors to enjoy today. The pergola and fences are reproductions of the 1904 originals, the flowers are varieties and colors enjoyed by Alice Longfellow, and the central rose window feature honors the Victorian design.</p>",

In 1759, John Vassall, Esquire used his family’s wealth – which derived from Jamaican sugar plantations – to purchase large plots of land in Cambridge and build the mansion you see today. Vassall built this house in a traditional Georgian style, having a rectangular shape and symmetrical design typical of that era. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b01f525c-fcd9-4b55-a42c-5244fee202ca}{224}\" paraid=\"1931254607\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{b01f525c-fcd9-4b55-a42c-5244fee202ca}{228}\" paraid=\"1566385727\">When the Craigies bought this property in 1792, they focused on embellishing the landscape to show off their wealth. Here at the front of the property, the Craigies removed part of the brick wall replaced it with the wooden fencing you see today (a popular trend of the era). It is also likely that prior to the Craigies, a circular driveway was in front of the house, which the Craigies then moved to the western side (where you see the carriage loop today). </p> <p paraeid=\"{80ecc1a4-42d0-4682-99ba-0c87168c18f6}{3}\" paraid=\"771452523\">Later on, the Longfellows added to the Forecourt in a way that embellished and attempted to preserve the house’s charm. The lilac beds you see today were first planted by the Longfellows to shield the Forecourt and home from the bustling noise on Brattle Street. Furthermore, Henry Longfellow preserved the elm trees in the Forecourt the best he could. He believed the elms dated to Washington’s era, writing that “the magnificent elms… signalized the place and under whose shadow Washington had walked.” In 1872, Henry also added the balustrade (fence-like structure) you see running along the path leading to the sides of the house. </p>",

        "notes": "Mount Auburn Cemetery\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/mount-auburn-cemetery.htm\n\n<p>Mount Auburn Cemetery is the first landscaped rural or “garden” cemetery in the United States. Established in 1831 in Watertown and Cambridge, Massachusetts, the cemetery was not only designed as a resting place for the deceased, but also as an attraction and pleasure ground, with picturesque landscapes, winding paths, a variety of horticulture, and sculptural art. Its success inspired other cemeteries’ designs and in turn articulated the need for public parks and gardens launching the American parks movement.<br /> <br /> In the early 19th century, Dr. Jacob Bigelow’s concern that crowded cemeteries in congested urban areas might promote the spread of contagious diseases spawned his idea for Mount Auburn Cemetery. In 1825, Bigelow, a Boston physician and Harvard professor, invited a group of civic leaders to his house and proposed that they establish a new kind of cemetery. Located on the outskirts of the city, the new cemetery would place family burial lots in a landscaped setting filled with trees, shrubs, and flowers. In 1831, Bigelow’s idea became a reality when the newly formed Massachusetts Horticultural Society agreed to take a lead role in developing a rural cemetery. They located a 72-acre farm in Watertown and Cambridge that was an ideal location for the cemetery and for an associated experimental horticultural garden. The key feature was a 125-foot central hill that provided spectacular views of Boston and Cambridge.<br /> <br /> Henry A.S. Dearborn, President of the Massachusetts Horticultural Association, was largely responsible for the cemetery’s design. Influenced by European naturalistic landscape design ideas, Dearborn incorporated ideas from English landscaped parks and the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris into his design for Mount Auburn Cemetery. Working with civil engineer Alexander Wardworth, Dearborn laid out the cemetery with winding roads that followed the natural contours of the land, naturalistic landscaping elements including wooded areas and reflective ponds, and panoramic views from the central hill’s summit.<br /> <br /> Dearborn also established a separate experimental garden at Mount Auburn, planted with many domestic and exotic varieties of fruits, flowers, and vegetables. As news of the garden cemetery spread, horticulturalists from around the world sent gifts of seeds, including magnolia trees from Ohio and vegetable seeds from the London Horticultural Society. These gift plantings became part of both the horticultural garden and cemetery. By the end of the 1830s, Mount Auburn had several hundred trees planted.<br /> <br /> The popularity of the new cemetery grew, and new cemetery lots sold quickly. In 1835, the cemetery became a private nonprofit corporation severing its relationship with Dearborn, and the experiential garden ended. The cemetery has continued to embrace horticultural experimentation and high standards of horticultural maintenance and practices as part of its mission.<br /> <br /> Mount Auburn Cemetery has played an important role in conservation thinking by creating a designed landscape open to the public. The popularity of the design led to political support for local and regional parks and park systems. Mount Auburn has continued to incorporate conservation ideas over time. By 1870, with the growing interest in Mount Auburn as a destination for birdwatching, the Mount Auburn Trustees established a Committee on Birds that recommended plantings of trees and fruit-bearing shrubs that would attract birds. In the 20th century, Mount Auburn President Oakes Ingalls Ames further developed the cemetery’s landscape as an arboretum and a bird sanctuary with his “hands-on” approach to managing the cemetery.<br /> <br /> Mount Auburn Cemetery currently has a collection of over 5,500 trees, shrubs and other plants from around the world that cover the 175-acre cemetery. More than half of the trees on the grounds display labels, which give the botanic and common names, the date planted, and the native range of the species. Mount Auburn is also designated as a Massachusetts Important Bird Area. Some current conservation initiatives include planting native New England plants in the Consecration Dell area, managing the four ponds to provide good habitat for wildlife, and practicing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for control of insects.<br /> <br /> Many famous Bostonians lie buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. Some have important conservation connections, including Jacob Bigelow (founder of Mount Auburn Cemetery), landscape architect Charles Eliot, activist Harriet Lawrence Hemenway (founder of Massachusetts Audubon Society), Horace Gray (who established a horticultural garden in the Boston Public Garden in 1838), Asa Gray (American botanist), and ornithologists William Brewster and Ludlow Griscom. Other distinguished people include Henry Cabot Lodge and Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. (U.S. senators), Dorothea Dix (activist), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-wadsworth-longfellow.htm\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> (educator and poet), Oliver Wendell Holmes (author and poet), Julia Ward Howe (author and reformer), and Charles Sumner (abolitionist and U.S. senator). The Secretary of the Interior designated the cemetery a National Historic Landmark in 2003.<br /> <br /> Mount Auburn Cemetery is located at 580 Mount Auburn St. in Watertown and Cambridge, MA. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

Like most settlements in the New World, establishing a place to bury the dead was an important priority. Harvard College also saw the burial ground as necessary to place students who had died from diseases like smallpox, which were common in the 1600s. From its establishment in the mid-1600s until the early 1900s, the Old Burying Ground took in new burials. It now offers a look into life and death in the Colonial Period of the Greater Boston area.</p> <p>The Old Burying Ground has several notable burials including:</p> <ul> <li>half a dozen Presidents of Harvard College</li> <li>nineteen soldiers from the Revolutionary War, including enslaved people Neptune Frost and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/cato-stedman.htm\">Cato (Stedman) Freeman</a></li> <li>members of the intermingled colonial elite families of Brattle Street, incluing the Vassalls, Phipps, and Olivers</li> <li>diplomat Francis Dana (1743-1811), poet Richard Henry Dana (1787-1879), and many members of the Dana family</li> <li>artist Washington Allston (1779-1843)</li> </ul>",

Henry, a member of a prominent Vassall family who owned plantations in Jamaica, died in 1769, leaving his widow in the house alone. Penelope Vassall fled to her family’s plantation in Antigua after the violence of the Powder Alarm in September 1774. Though her brother Isaac Royall of Medford was explicitly banned from re-entering Massachusetts after the Revolutionary war, Penelope returned and is buried in the Vassall Tomb in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-burying-ground.htm\">Old Burying Ground</a> next to Christ Church. The house was used as a medical facility during the Revolutionary War and it was here that Dr. Benjamin Church was confined under house arrest after he was accused of passing information to British General Gage. Today the house is a private residence.</p>",

When <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">General George Washington</a> first arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts on July 2, 1775 to take command of the Continental Army, it was here that he first set up his headquarters.

The day after arriving in Cambridge, Washington rode from here to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cambridge-common.htm\">Cambridge Common</a> to officially take command of the troops. At the end of his first week in Cambridge, on July 9, 1775, Washington convened the first Council of War, and they are believed to have held their meeting in Wadsworth House.

Initially known as Battersea, the building was renamed Harmony Hall by Elizabeth Hesselius Addison after the harmonious living arrangement she and her husband, Walter Dulaney Addison, enjoyed while sharing the home with Addison’s brother and his wife from 1792-1793. <br /> The mansion is located on a 62.5-acre open pasture land estate along the Potomac River. This estate was purchased by the National Park Service in 1966, to preserve southern Maryland cultural heritage. Surrounded by a rich landscape, it offers visitors many chances to connect with Colonial History. The park also home to the remains of the Want Water House and canal.</p>",

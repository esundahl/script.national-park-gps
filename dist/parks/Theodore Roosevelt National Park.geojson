        "notes": "Elkhorn Ranch Cabin Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/elkhorn-ranch-cabin-site.htm\n\nOn February 14, 1884, tragedy struck Theodore Roosevelt’s life, when both his wife and mother passed away on the same day. Four months later, he returned to Dakota Territory, having decided that he would devote his life to ranching. He found, though, that he desired more solitude than that offered by the Maltese Cross Cabin, which was relatively close to the town of Medora. Eventually, he settled on a location 35 miles north, where he would establish his Elkhorn Ranch.<br /> <br /> While the Elkhorn Cabin no longer stands, foundation stones indicate where the structure, built of the local cottonwood, was once located. A visitor, stopping and closing their eyes, can imagine what Roosevelt’s ranch life might have been like.<br /> <br /> \"My home ranch-house stands on the river brink. From the low, long veranda, shaded by leafy cotton-woods, one looks across sand bars and shallows to a strip of meadowland, behind which rises a line of sheer cliffs and grassy plateaus. This veranda is a pleasant place in the summer evenings when a cool breeze stirs along the river and blows in the faces of the tired men, who loll back in their rocking-chairs (what true American does not enjoy a rocking-chair?), book in hand--though they do not often read the books, but rock gently to and for, gazing sleepily out at the weird-looking buttes opposite, until their sharp outlines grow indistinct and purple in the after-glow of the sunset.\" - From <em>Hunting Trips of a Ranchman</em> by Theodore Roosevelt.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visiting the Elkhorn Ranch Site</strong><br /> <br /> The Elkhorn Ranch is a remote unit, located between the North and South units of the park. Reaching the Elkhorn Ranch requires a drive of approximately 90 minutes each way, mostly on gravel roads.<br /> <br /> <strong>Driving from the North Unit to the Elkhorn Ranch Unit</strong><br /> - Take US 85 north (left). Travel 13.8 miles to Watford City.<br /> - Turn left at the light to stay on US 85. Travel 16.5 more miles on US 85.<br /> - Turn left onto ND-68 W. Travel 16.7 miles.<br /> - Turn left onto ND-16 S. Travel 31.4 miles.<br /> - Turn left on Black Tail Road/FH 2 (gravel).<br /> - Travel 12.2 miles.<br /> - Turn right on Bell Lake Road (still FH 2).<br /> - Travel 3 miles.<br /> - Staying on FH2, turn left towards the USFS Elkhorn Campground. Follow FH2 for 3 miles, continuing past the campground and MDHT trailhead to the Elkhorn Ranch Unit parking area.<br /> <br /> <strong>Driving from the South Unit to the Elkhorn Ranch Unit</strong><br /> - Take I-94 westbound to exit 10.<br /> - At the end of the exit ramp, turn right on County Road 11 (gravel). Follow County Road 11 for 8.8 miles.<br /> - Turn right on Westerheim Road. Follow Westerheim road for 6.5 miles.<br /> - Turn left on Bell Lake Road. Follow Bell Lake Road for 11.7 miles.<br /> - Turn right onto FH2 towards the USFS Elkhorn Campground. Follow FH2 for 3 miles, continuing past the campground and MDHT trailhead to the Elkhorn Ranch Unit parking area.",

He later said, \"I would not have been president had it not been for my experience in North Dakota.\"</p> <p>Those experiences began in 1883, when Roosevelt arrived in the Dakota Badlands to hunt bison. Before he left, he purchased the primary interest in the Chimney Butte Ranch (known locally as the Maltese Cross Ranch). Roosevelt thrived on the vigorous outdoor lifestyle, actively participating in the life of a working cowboy. He would write three books about his experiences, which would deepen and broaden his career-defining conservation ethic.</p> <p>What became known as the Maltese Cross Cabin was only a temporary home for Roosevelt. He would split his time between Dakota and New York for the next several years. Following the death of his wife and mother in February of 1884, Roosevelt returned to Dakota, establishing a second ranch he named the Elkhorn. By 1887, Roosevelt began to sell his interests in the cattle industry. By 1900 the Maltese Cross Cabin was claimed by other residents.</p> <p>During Roosevelt's presidency, the cabin was acquired for the 1904 World's Fair, hosted in St. Louis, MO. The cabin traveled from Missouri to Portland, OR for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. It would spend time in Fargo, ND before settling on the grounds of the state capital in Bismarck, ND.</p> <p>The Daughters of the American Revolution eventually took over the care of the cabin, and acquired many of the items you can see today. In 1959, twelve years after the park was established, the Maltese Cross Cabin came to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thro/index.htm\">Theodore Roosevelt National Park</a>. Restored to its original state, you can walk in Roosevelt's footsteps by touring the cabin behind the South Unit Visitor Center.</p>",

Over the years, it changed hands and expanded, with the ranch house built circa 1885. After the Olsen family bought it in 1915, the ranch became a tourist destination, with guided horseback rides, camping, and roundups.<br /> <br /> The ranch was sold to the federal government in 1936, and the house then served as headquarters for Civilian Conservation Corps, Works Progress Administration, and Emergency Relief Administration staff. When Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park was established in 1947, the ranch became the first park headquarters. After the new headquarters moved to Medora in 1959, a series of concessionaires ran guided horseback rides out of the ranch until 2014.<br /> <br /> Today, the ranch buildings are still there, newly renovated. Standing on the boardwalk that stretches between the ranch house and the stable, one can feel transported back to a different time, to a frontier dude ranch in the badlands of North Dakota.",

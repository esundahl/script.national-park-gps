The area provides critical winter habitat for elk, bison, deer, and pronghorn.</p> <p>Elevations are lower and the area receives less snow than elsewhere in the park. Often the ridge tops and south-facing hillsides are clear of snow, a result of wind and sun.</p> <h2>Managing Elk Populations</h2> <p>Until the mid-1960s, park managers actively managed the elk and bison of Yellowstone. Elk population limits were determined according to formulas designed to manage livestock. When elk reached those limits, park managers “culled” or killed the animals to reduce the population. Bison were likewise heavily managed.</p> <h2>Modern Management</h2> <p>In 1963, an advisory group made of prominent scientists released a report recommending national parks “maintain biotic associations” within the context of their ecosystem based on scientific research. The recommendations, known as the Leopold Report, established the framework for park management still used today throughout the National Park System. By adopting this management philosophy, Yellowstone went from an unnatural managing of resources to “natural regulation”—today known as Ecological Process Management.</p>",

There are numerous steps and steep grades ascending the back part of the loop to reach the mudpots.</p> <h2>Hydrothermal Features</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). This area is known for the mudpots, which put on quite an interesting show of splattering \"mud\" and a symphony of different sounds.</p> <h2>Mudpots</h2> <p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

The surrounding area is covered in hard sinter and a few other smaller steaming vents. Before an earthquake in 1983, Aurum was actively boiling but eruptions were rare. Now, eruptions are irregular, ranging from 22 hours to over 2 weeks. Erupts 20 feet (6 m) for 70 seconds.</p> <p>Aurum Geyser has an average temperate of 199.4°F (93°C), an average pH of 8.6, and an average conductivity of 1761 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system.

This sudden activity is known as a “thermal disturbance” and can last a few days, or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to “normal.”</p> <p>No one fully understands why this happens. Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. The water chemistry changes as the water levels of underground hot water reservoirs fluctuates.</p> <p>Although Norris is known for its acid features, it also have alkaline hot springs and geysers.

        "notes": "Bearclaw Geyser\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/bearclaw-geyser.htm\n\n<p>Stop and listen. Bearclaw Geyser makes a gurgling noise while it erupts. Its eruptions are small, with water only bubbling a few inches up into the air. As with many geysers in the area, this geyser appears to be linked to the eruptions of Fountain Geyser.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

During periodic energy shifts, the level of one spring rises as the other lowers. These pools were initially named due to their clear, hot, bright waters. In years since, most noticeably since 2002, the pools have cooled dramatically and colors have changed. Beauty Pool still quietly steams, but the shallow outer parts of the pool are filled with orange thermophiles that can thrive in the cooler waters.</p> <p>Beauty Pool has an average temperate of 135.6°F (57.5°C), an average pH of 8.8, and an average conductivity of 2042 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

It last erupted in 1991. Sapphire remains one of the most beautiful blue pools in the park. Mustard Spring provides a bright color contrast, and Jewel Geyser erupts every 7-10 minutes.</p> <p>The following trails can be accessed from this trailhead:</p> <ul> <li>Biscuit Basin Trail</li> <li>Mystic Falls Trail</li> <li>Summit Lake Trail</li> </ul> <p><b>Biscuit Basin Trail</b></p> <p>Biscuit Basin is traversed by an easy 0.6-mile (1-km) lollipop loop boardwalk trail, which leads past many fascinating hydrothermal features, such as Sapphire Pool, Avoca Spring, and Jewel Geyser.</p> <p><b>Mystic Falls Trail</b></p> <p>This 2.4-mile (3.8-km) there-and-back trail follows a lovely creek through mixed conifer forest to the 70-foot Mystic Falls, over which the Little Firehole River drops from the Madison Plateau.</p> <p><b>Summit Lake Trail</b></p> <p>This moderately strenuous 14.5-mile (23.3-km) one-way trail starts a little ways down the Mystic Falls Trail, which starts at the west end of Biscuit Basin. The trail, which is part of the Continental Divide Trail, ascends the hillsides overlooking the Upper Geyser Basin and the Firehole River. Both Summit Lake and the Smoke Jumper Hot Springs Thermal Area are about midway along the trail.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps downs several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color and Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Trail has a wheelchair-accessible overlook at Wall Pool.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

It uprooted and coated nearby trees with thick mud.</p> <p>Since then, this mudpot moved south 200 feet (60 m) along the crack. The spring feeding nearby Sour Lake was much more active before Black Dragon’s Caldron formed. Perhaps underground changes diverted heat energy from Sour Lake to form this mudpot, which a park ranger named for its color and the apparent lashing of the “dragon’s tongue.”</p> <h2>Mudpots</h2> <p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble.

Stay at least 100 yards (91 m) from bears. Do NOT feed bears or other animals.</p> <p><b>If a Bear Charges You:</b> Stand still, do not run. Stand your ground and use your bear spray. Spray when the bear is 60 feet (18 m) away or closer. If a bear charges, it may be a bluff charge.</p> <p><b>If a Bear Makes Contact:</b> Drop to the ground; play dead. Lie face down and clasp your hands over the back of your neck; stay still and silent. Wait several minutes after the bear leaves before getting up and leaving the area.</p>",

For example, dead standing trees provide nesting cavities for many types of animals; fallen trees provide food and shelter for animals and nutrients for the soil. However, park managers will remove dead or burned trees that pose safety hazards along roads or in developed areas.</p> <h2>How Does Fire Benefit Yellowstone?</h2> <p>Fires are a natural part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and vegetation has adapted to fire and in some cases may be dependent on it.</p> <p>Fire promotes habitat diversity by removing the forest overstory, allowing different plant communities to become established, and preventing trees from becoming established in grassland.</p> <p>Fire increases the rate that nutrients become available to plants by rapidly releasing them from wood and forest litter and by hastening the weathering of soil minerals. This is especially important in a cold and dry climate like Yellowstone’s, where decomposition rates are slower than in more hot and humid areas.</p> <p>Additionally, natural fires provide an opportunity for scientists to study the effects of fire on an ecosystem.</p>",

Occasionally, the molten sulfur oozes the surface where it flows like molasses.</p> <p>Because contact with air causes the liquid sulfur to turn to black, it is impossible to tell by looking if the dark areas are oil and sulfur.</p> <p>Calcite Springs was named for the milky-white calcite crystals that cover the area. Mixed in with the calcite are translucent, honey-colored barite crystals. Inside the conduits of hot spring are beautiful but smelly yellow sulfur crystals.</p> <p>The Calcite Springs hydrothermal area is closed to visitors. To see directly down into Calcite Springs, hike the Yellowstone River Picnic Area Trail. The short, easy trail follows the canyon rim opposite this overlook. To reach the trailhead, turn right (north) at Tower Junction and park at the picnic area 0.5 mile beyond (east of) the bridge.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Wildlife Watching</h2> <p>Look for bighorn sheep along the Yellowstone River opposite of Calcite Springs.</p> <p><b>Animals are Dangerous</b></p> <ul> <li>Do not approach or feed any animal.</li> <li>Bison and elk have injured people.</li> <li>Stay 100 yards (91 m) from bears and wolves.</li> <li>Stay 25 yards (23 m) from all other animals.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think Safety, Act Safely.

What colors are present today?</p> <p>This spring occasionally goes dormant for brief periods of time. Vibrant pinks and neons are sometimes seen.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>A wheelchair-accessible trail to this view of the spring is available.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Windproof, hooded outer layer</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool or other insulated garments underneath</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool or synthetic trousers</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool or synthetic long underwear</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</span></p> <h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winter Hazards</span></h2> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather.

        "notes": "Castle Geyser\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/castle-geyser.htm\n\n<p>The cone of Castle Geyser is thousands of years old and rests upon even older platforms. Together, they form one of the largest sinter formations in the world. Castle currently erupts, on average, every 14 hours.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/geyser-activity.htm\">##View all geyser predictions</a></p> <p>The water eruption frequently reaches 75 feet (24 m) and lasts about 20 minutes, followed by a noisy steam phase of 30-40 minutes.</p> <p>If Castle has a minor eruption (a few minutes of water but no steam), its next major eruption cannot be predicted.</p> <p>Castle Geyser has a unique, large, tall geyserite cone structure that may be reminiscent of a castle. This large structure is possibly due to trees growing in the area years prior that became coated in sinter and allowed the height to build up. Layers of geyserite cascade in step-like terraces from the geyser vent and continues to cover the surrounding area. Due to this amount of fragile sinter and the height of the cone, the water is inaccessible for scientific measurements. The western side of Castle Geyser appears smoother than the sinter steps on the east side. As the story goes, thermophile mats use to live on the cone but were peeled off by visitors, permanently damaging the cone structure. Now the water flows down the east side and no thermophiles are visible.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape.

This sudden activity is known as a “thermal disturbance” and can last a few days, or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to “normal.”</p> <p>No one fully understands why this happens. Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas.

        "notes": "Congress Pool\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/congress-pool.htm\n\n<p>Congress Pool was named in 1891 when scientists from around the world converged upon Yellowstone for the Fifth International Geological Congress. Its activity varies from a steaming, dry vent to a boiling murky hot spring to an overflowing blue pool.</p> <p>It was one of the first pools discovered to contain <i>Sulfolobus</i>, a thermophile that uses sulfur for energy and turns hydrogen sulfide to sulfuric acid in hot acidic water. Newly discovered viruses have been found using <i>Sulfolobus</i> as their host.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color and Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Norris Geyser Basin</h2> <p>Norris Geyser Basin is one of the hottest and most acidic of Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. It is outside of the most recent Yellowstone caldera, but inside the first and largest caldera. It sits on the intersection of three major faults and is a very active earthquake area.</p> <p>Each year, new hot springs and geysers appear while others become dormant. Geologic events trigger many of these changes. Even small earthquakes can alter hydrothermal behavior. This sudden activity is known as a “thermal disturbance” and can last a few days, or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to “normal.”</p> <p>No one fully understands why this happens. Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. The water chemistry changes as the water levels of underground hot water reservoirs fluctuates.</p> <p>Although Norris is known for its acid features, it also have alkaline hot springs and geysers. As underground water and chemistry shift suddenly, they could contribute to dramatic changes in minerals and pH.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

The intense swarm lasted about seven months. This hillside experienced increased heat, causing the vegetation to die.</p> <p>Researchers are able to study tree rings to learn about past earthquake swarms and other geological activity that preceded human records, using the records of increased carbon dioxide found in the tree rings.</p> <h2>The Smell</h2> <p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p> <h2>Mud Volcano Area</h2> <p>The Mud Volcano area has many mudpots and hillsides strewn with trees cooked by steam. The hydrothermal features here are some of the most acidic in the park.</p> <p>Mud Volcano is near the greatest uplift and sinking of the Yellowstone Caldera floor. Many faults converge here and earthquakes are common.</p> <p>The areas surrounding the Mud Volcano vent and the other major vent near Old Faithful are called resurgent domes. Resurgent domes are active ground deformation, where the land moves up or down with the fluctuation of the magma chamber below. Scientists monitor these domes closely for information about ongoing volcanic activity.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

It is the largest building in Fort Yellowstone.</p> <p>The Army protected the park and ensured access, but they could not fully satisfy the visitors' desire to learn about the park. Further, each of the 14 other national parks established in the late 1800s and early 1900s was separately administered, resulting in uneven management, inefficiency, and lack of direction.</p> <h2>Setting the Stage</h2> <p>The management of Yellowstone by the Army helped set the stage for the creation of an agency whose sole purpose was to manage the national parks. Promoters of this idea gathered support from influential journalists, railroads likely to profit from increased park tourism, and members of Congress.</p> <p>In 1916 when Congress created the National Park Service, the Army turned Fort Yellowstone over to the new agency. Local resistance made this transition difficult, and the Army returned in 1917. The park was fully under National Park Service control in 1918, and the Army departed.</p> <p>Fort Yellowstone is reminder of the role veterans of the US Army served in protecting and preserving Yellowstone National Park for future generations.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-tour-fort-yellowstone.htm\">Explore the Fort Yellowstone Historic District</a></li> </ul>",

An unknown European American gave it the current name. Its previous names include Gothic Grotto, Blowing Cavern, and The Belcher.</p> <p>The surging action has decreased since 1994, though no one is sure why. In 1999, more dramatic changes occurred: the water temperature dropped 10 degrees and the color changed from green to chalky white.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>The Smell</h2> <p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p> <h2>Mud Volcano Area</h2> <p>The Mud Volcano area has many mudpots and hillsides strewn with trees cooked by steam. The hydrothermal features here are some of the most acidic in the park.</p> <p>Mud Volcano is near the greatest uplift and sinking of the Yellowstone Caldera floor. Many faults converge here and earthquakes are common.</p> <p>The areas surrounding the Mud Volcano vent and the other major vent near Old Faithful are called resurgent domes. Resurgent domes are active ground deformation, where the land moves up or down with the fluctuation of the magma chamber below. Scientists monitor these domes closely for information about ongoing volcanic activity.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

These minerals weather into soils that can store more water and provide better nutrients than another volcanic rock in Yellowstone (rhyolite).</p> <p>The soil supports more vegetation, which adds organic matter and enriches the soil. You can see the result when you drive over Dunraven Pass or through other areas of the park with Absaroka rocks. They have more diverse plants, including mixed forests interspersed with meadows.</p> <p>Remember that many of Yellowstone’s wildflowers are also very important parts of animal diets. The seeds of most wildflowers are used by birds and insects. Even the petals of many flowers are eaten by animals. Bees and other insects collect nectar and pollen.</p> <h2>Bighorn Sheep</h2> <p>Bighorn sheep are often seen along the slopes of Mount Washburn near Dunraven Pass.</p> <p>All bighorn sheep have horns. The rings on horns can be used to determine age, though it is easier to count the rings on a ram.</p> <p>Ram skulls have two layers of bone above the brain that work as a shock absorber.

        "notes": "Ear Spring\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/ear-spring.htm\n\n<p>Ear Spring is a truly hot spring, with surface water temperatures often above the boiling point of 198°F (92°C) at this elevation. True to its name, this pool is shaped somewhat like an ear.</p> <p>Very rarely, Ear Spring erupts. The last eruption happened on September 15, 2018 (14 years since the last known eruption). This eruption proved to be historic, for it actually ejected old coins, cans, a cement block, and even a baby pacifier along with the usual water and steam. This is a good reminder to never toss anything into thermal features, as they can damage the features, sometimes to the point of plugging the vents completely. Thankfully, it appears that the major of objects ejected from Ear Spring were historic rather than contemporary objects.</p> <p>Ear Spring has an average temperate of 197.1°F (91.7°C), an average pH of 8.4, and an average conductivity of 1889 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

The water in this 27-foot deep pool is so hot (close to boiling) that only the most heat-tolerant thermophiles can survive.</p> <p>In sulfur-rich hot springs, such as Emerald Spring, some microorganisms use sulfur as their energy source. Byproducts from these reactions can be used by other microbes. This kind of “recycling” ties the various microorganisms into diverse functioning communities.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color and Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Norris Geyser Basin</h2> <p>Norris Geyser Basin is one of the hottest and most acidic of Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. It is outside of the most recent Yellowstone caldera, but inside the first and largest caldera. It sits on the intersection of three major faults and is a very active earthquake area.</p> <p>Each year, new hot springs and geysers appear while others become dormant. Geologic events trigger many of these changes. Even small earthquakes can alter hydrothermal behavior. This sudden activity is known as a “thermal disturbance” and can last a few days, or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to “normal.”</p> <p>No one fully understands why this happens. Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. The water chemistry changes as the water levels of underground hot water reservoirs fluctuates.</p> <p>Although Norris is known for its acid features, it also have alkaline hot springs and geysers. As underground water and chemistry shift suddenly, they could contribute to dramatic changes in minerals and pH.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

The water spouts from the small vents and the outflow channel runs directly into the Firehole River. Fan Geyser eruptions tend to fan out, instead spraying out in a defined jet, hence the name. Fan Geyser's activity is closely related to that of Mortar Geyser's.

The trout also spawn here. For these reasons, Fishing Bridge was closed to fishing in the early 1970s, with the support of angler groups.</p> <p>Although there are more than 141 tributaries that enter Yellowstone Lake, its only outlet, the Yellowstone River is located here. The Yellowstone River flows north and discharges 2,000–9,000 cubic feet per second.</p> <h2>Fishing Permits</h2> <p>Although fishing is prohibited from Fishing Bridge, it is allowed in other locations. Fishing permits are required in Yellowstone, state-issued fishing permits are not valid within the park.</p> <p>Permits are available at visitor centers, ranger stations, general stores, and other locations outside of the park.</p> <p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/fishing.htm\">nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/fishing.htm</a> for more information.</p> <h2>Think Safety, Act Safely</h2> <p>From burning hot hydrothermal features, to unpredictable wildlife, to steep terrain, Yellowstone is a dangerous place. You are responsible for your safety. As such, please remember these safety tips:</p> <ul> <li>Never touch any hydrothermal waters—they can scald you.</li> <li>Observe safe distances from all wildlife.</li> <li>Stay behind fencing, guard rails, and ledges.</li> <li>Use caution when around park waters—they are cold and fast.</li> <li>Show patience and courtesy to other people.</li> </ul> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Wheelchair users may require assistance because the surface of the historic bridge is rough and narrow.</p>",

Before venturing into Yellowstone’s winter wonderland, make sure you have properly planned and are prepared for the challenges brought on by extreme cold and deep snow.</p> <ul> <li>Let friends or family know your itinerary.</li> <li>Do not travel alone.</li> <li>Evaluate your party’s and equipment's capabilities.</li> <li>Be prepared to make repairs.</li> <li>Carry and drink plenty of water, and bring high energy food.</li> <li>Be prepared to set up an emergency shelter.</li> <li>Bring a first-aid kit, space blanket, extra clothing, and headlamp.</li> <li>Carry and know how to use a map and compass.</li> <li>Use sunglasses or ski goggles and sunscreen.</li> </ul> <h2><b>Clothing and Gear</b></h2> <p>Even in severe winter temperatures, you can be comfortable and safe if you dress properly to prevent chilling and overheating. Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</p> <ul> <li>Windproof, hooded outer layer</li> <li>Wool or other insulated garments underneath</li> <li>Wool or synthetic trousers</li> <li>Wool or synthetic long underwear</li> <li>Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</li> <li>Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</li> <li>Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</li> </ul> <p>Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</p> <p>Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</p> <h2>Winter Hazards</h2> <p>Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</p> <p>Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</p> <ul> <li>Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</li> <li>Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</li> <li>Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Stay dry and learn how to recognize the signs of hypothermia and frostbite—they can set in quickly.</li> <li>Bears may be active at any time of year—be alert for signs of bear activity.</li> </ul> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <ul> <li>Do not walk on snowshoe or ski trails.</li> <li>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</li> <li>Yield to faster skiers or those going downhill.</li> <li>Detour around wildlife—never approach.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails and boardwalks.</li> <li>Keep children close at hand.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</li> <li>Keep your food secure—never feed wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Snowmobile Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>All snowmobilers must be led by a guide authorized by the National Park Service (NPS) to operate in Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>All snowmobiles must meet NPS sound and emission requirements.</li> <li>Snowmobile operators must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license in possession. Learner permits are not sufficient.</li> <li>Roads are open only 7 am to 9 pm. Snowmobiles are not allowed to operate in the park between 9 pm and 7 am.</li> <li>Maximum speed limit is 35 mph for snowmobiles, 25 mph for snowcoaches, or less where posted or as conditions warrant.</li> <li>Use hand signals when turning or stopping.</li> <li>Allow enough distance between snowmobiles when traveling.</li> <li>Pass only when safe.</li> <li>If you turn around, stay within the road width.</li> <li>Drive in single file, on the right side of the road even if the road is rough.</li> <li>When stopping, pull to the far right and park in single file.</li> <li>Do not idle your machine more than three minutes.</li> <li>Stay on designated roads. Side-hilling, berm-riding, or any off-road travel is prohibited and carries a fine of up to $5,000.</li> <li>Report accidents to a ranger.</li> <li>Operating a snowmobile while intoxicated is illegal. Possession of open alcoholic beverage containers, including bota bags, is illegal.</li> </ul> <p><b>Wild animals have the right of way.</b> If bison or other wildlife are on the road, stop at least 25 yards away (100 yards for wolves or bears). Pull your machine as far as possible to the opposite side of the road and give them a chance to move off the road.</p>",

Below the pines are several wetland seeps. Seeps like these can provide habitat for rare plants.</p> <h2>Lodgepole Pine</h2> <p>The lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) is by far the most common tree in Yellowstone. Early botanical explorers first encountered the species along the West Coast where it is often contorted into a twisted tree by the wind, and thus named it <i>Pinus contorta var. contorta</i>. The Rocky Mountain variety, which grows very straight, is <i>Pinus contorta var. latifolia</i>. Some American Indian tribes used this tree to make the frames of their tipis or lodges, hence the name “lodgepole” pine.</p> <p>Lodgepoles are the only pine in Yellowstone whose needles grow in groups of two. The bark is typically somewhat brown to yellowish, but a grayish-black fungus often grows on the shady parts of the bark, giving the tree a dark cast. The species is shade intolerant; any branches left in the shade below the canopy will wither and fall off the tree. Lodgepoles growing by themselves will often have branches all the way to the base of the trunk because sunlight can reach the whole tree.</p> <h2>Wetlands</h2> <p>Approximately 38% of the park’s plant species—including half of the rare plants—are associated with wetlands and 11% grow only in wetlands. Wetlands provide essential habitat for Yellowstone’s rare plants, thermal species, reptiles and amphibians, and for numerous insects, birds and fish.</p>",

To protect the park’s natural features and wildlife, the U.S. Army was dispatched to Yellowstone in 1886, establishing Camp Sheridan. After enduring five cold, harsh winters in temporary frame buildings at the foot of the Mammoth Hot Springs, Congress appropriated $50,000 for a permanent post (later known as Fort Yellowstone), which served as the headquarters for the U.S. Army until their departure in 1918. During their time in Yellowstone, through carrying out day-to-day administrative tasks, the military commanders promulgated rules and regulations that constituted a philosophy of conservation, defining the nature, characteristics, and management of national parks.<br /> <br /> In 1888, two years after the U.S. Army arrived in Yellowstone, the Fort Yellowstone Cemetery received its first burial. At least 54 people were buried in the cemetery between 1888 and 1916, most of them military personnel, civilian employees of the army, and their relatives.<br /> <br /> At the time, life in a remote and rugged place like Mammoth Hot Springs was demanding, isolating, and had its challenges. Known causes of death of the individuals buried in the cemetery included natural causes; infections like pneumonia and scarlet fever; environmental causes such as drowning, falling, avalanche, hypothermia, or exposure; and from injuries caused by animals (including horses and a grizzly bear). <br /> <br /> In 1915, the cemetery was expanded and delineated by a fence of galvanized pipe built into concrete posts and a decorative gate, all of which still stand today. In 1917, 19 individuals (soldiers and civilian employees) were disinterred by the U.S. Army and transported and reburied in the Custer National Cemetery in the Little Bighorn National Monument in south-central Montana. Civilian employees of the army and relatives of military and civilian personnel were not relocated and are still buried in the Fort Yellowstone Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Learn more about the history and other structures of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-tour-fort-yellowstone.htm\">Fort Yellowstone</a>.</p>",

The trail takes approximately 45 minutes at a leisurely pace.</p> <p>The exhibits describe life in Fort Yellowstone when the US Army administered the park from 1886 through 1918. Significant conservation policies were developed here that lead to the origin of the National Park Service.</p> <p><b>Watch for traffic. Do not approach wildlife.</b></p> <p>Many buildings along the trail are employee residences and are not open to the public. Please respect the privacy of residents by staying on the paved route and treating living areas with courtesy.</p> <p>The trail begins at the Albright Visitor Center, which was the bachelor officers' quarters, completed in 1909. It had an officer's mess or club, kitchen, sitting room, and apartments for six single officers.</p> <h2>Yellowstone's First Ten Years</h2> <p>For the first decade after Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872, the park was under serious threat from those who would exploit, rather than protect, its resources.</p> <p>Poachers killed animals. Souvenir hunters broke large pieces off the geysers and hot springs. Developers set up camps for tourists near hot springs, along with bath and laundry facilities in the hot springs.</p> <p>In response, civilian superintendents were hired to preserve and protect the new park. Their experience and intentions varied, and they were all under-funded and under-staffed.</p> <p>Word reached Congress that the park was in trouble, but legislators refused to appropriate money for the park's administration in 1886.</p> <h2>The Army Arrives</h2> <p>The Secretary of the Interior, under the authority given by Congress, called on the Secretary of War for assistance. In 1886, men from Company M, First United States Cavalry, Fort Custer, Montana Territory, came to Yellowstone under the command of Captain Moses Harris.</p> <p>Over the next 32 years, the Army strengthened, posted, and enforced regulations in the park. Troops guarded the major attractions and evicted troublemakers, and cavalry patrolled the vast interior.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>The route has some potential hazards where the concrete sidewalk has buckled (up to 1.5\" high) or has large gaps at expansion joints.</p> <p>The concrete sidewalk is cracked or deteriorated in some places.</p> <p>Side slope may be up to 6% in places along Officer's Row. The sidewalks between the Albright Visitor Center and the Administration Building (originally double cavalry barracks) have 10-12% slopes.</p> <p>The audio description describes the wayside exhibit.</p>",

This geyser gives little warning of its pending eruption, but when it does blow, it is one of the most beautiful geysers in the park. It erupts 10–50 feet (3–15 m) into the air for 20 minutes or more, with an eruption interval in the 3.5–11 hour range. Many other geysers in the area appear to be linked to Fountain Geyser, with activity that occurs before or after an eruption of Fountain Geyser.

The limited amount of water flashes into steam before reaching the surface. The result is a loud hissing of steam and gases.</p> <h2>Mudpots</h2> <p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Designated-accessible parking, but there is no curb cut at the first space.</p> <p>The first part of the trail is wheelchair accessible and perfectly level. It is easily accessible to Silex Spring. Other areas of the boardwalk have steep portions and stairs. Check the map in the Fountain Paint Pot Trail Guide.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Thin, solidified sinter lines the edge of the clear pool and the runoff channel is full of bright orange thermophiles. Giantess Geyser eruptions are highly infrequent—none to 41 per year—but impressive in size, reaching 200 feet (61 m). From these eruptions, Giantess Geyser has been observed to be directly connected to many of the surrounding features.</p> <p>Giantess Geyser has an average temperate of 196°F (91.1°C), an average pH of 8.1, and an average conductivity of 1984 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Langford, 1870</span></strong></p> <p>Early writing and art about Yellowstone aroused the interest of the world and resulted in its designation as a the world’s first national park. Thomas Moran’s sketches and paintings of the Yellowstone region, including the Grand Canyon, captured the imagination of the public and Congress.</p> <p>In 1872, Congress paid Thomas Moran $10,000 for an oil painting of Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone but allocated $0 for the new park’s budget that year.</p> <h2>Geology</h2> <p>Scientists continue to develop theories about the formation of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. After the Yellowstone Caldera eruption, 640,000 years ago, lava flows and volcanic tuffs buried the canyon area; but hydrothermal gases and hot water weakened the rock.

This canyon was not as deep, wide, or long as today’s canyon.</p> <p>Past and current hydrothermal activity altered and weakened the rhyolite, making the rocks softer. The Yellowstone River eroded these weakened rocks to deepen and widen the canyon, a process that continues today.

A trail guide with map and information is available.</p> <h2>The Role of Erosion</h2> <p>The Lower Falls may have formed because the river flows over volcanic rock more resistant to erosion than the downstream rocks, which are hydrothermally altered.</p> <p>The Upper Falls flows over similar rocks. The large rocks upstream from the Upper Falls are remnants of a lava flow resistant to erosion.</p> <p>Puffs of steam mark hydrothermal features in the canyon’s walls. Their activity, along with water, wind, and earthquakes, continue to sculpt the canyon.</p> <p>Scientists continue to develop theories about the formation of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.</p> <h2>Colors</h2> <p>The colors are caused by oxidation of iron compounds in the rhyolite rock, which has been hydrothermally altered (\"cooked\").</p> <p>The colors indicate the presence or absence of water in the individual iron compounds and hydration of minerals in the rock.</p> <p>Most of the <b>yellows</b> in the canyon result from iron and sulfur in the rock.</p> <p><b>Dark orange, brown, and green</b> areas near the river are still active hydrothermal features.</p> <h2>Think Safety, Act Safely</h2> <p>From burning hot hydrothermal features, to unpredictable wildlife, to steep terrain, Yellowstone is a dangerous place.

You might get to see the tallest predictable geyser in the world erupt. A classic fountain geyser, Grand Geyser erupts with powerful bursts rather than a steady column like Old Faithful. An average eruption lasts 9-12 minutes and consists of 1 to 4 bursts, sometimes reaching 200 feet (60 m).</p> <p>Grand Geyser has an average temperate of 163°F (72.8°C), an average pH of 8.8, and an average conductivity of 2200 uS/cm.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/geyser-activity.htm\">##View all geyser predictions</a></p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system.

Eruptions last 45-60 minutes in a series of bursts. Great Fountain Geyser takes 10-14 hours to rebuild to an eruption. The pool slowly fills, then begins to overflow 70-100 minutes before the eruption.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/geyser-activity.htm\">View all geyser predictions</a></p> <p>Like most geysers, Great Fountain Geyser experiences periods of irregularity. For the most part, it is dependable. While waiting for its display, watch for the eruptions of White Dome Geyser.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Situated on the bank of the Firehole River, Riverside Geyser is one of the most picturesque and predictable geysers in the park.</p> <p>During its 20-minute eruptions, a 75-foot (23 m) column of water arches gracefully over the river. Eruptions are about six hours apart. Watch for water flowing over the edge of the cone beginning 90-120 minutes before an eruption. Grotto Geyser has an average temperate of 200.1°F (93.4°C), an average pH of 9.1, and an average conductivity of 2300 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape.

It could hold 15 prisoners and 10 guards. Every visitor had to check in at the building after entering the park from Gardiner, Montana. A new guardhouse was built in 1911.</p> <p>The most persistent menace to Yellowstone came from poachers, whose activities threatened to exterminate animals such as bison.</p> <p>Any poachers or tourists caught committing a serious violation were marched to Fort Yellowstone on foot, escorted by mounted soldiers. Their possessions were often left at a different entrance so that the criminal had to travel around the outside of the park to retrieve their belongings.</p> <h2>New Laws</h2> <p>In 1894, soldiers arrested a man named Ed Howell for slaughtering bison in Pelican Valley. The maximum sentence possible was banishment from the park.</p> <p>Emerson Hough, a well-known journalist, was present and wired his report to Forest & Stream, a popular magazine of the time. Its editor, renowned naturalist George Bird Grinnell, helped create a national outcry.</p> <p>Within two months, Congress passed the National Park Protection Act, which increased the Army's authority for protecting park treasures. This law is known as the Lacey Act, and is the first of two laws with this name. Ed Howell was the first person arrested and punished under the new act.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-tour-fort-yellowstone.htm\">Explore the Fort Yellowstone Historic District</a></li> </ul>",

Winters are often severe, with deep snows and temperatures reaching -44 degrees F (-42 degrees C).</p> <p>Bison from the central herd congregate in the Hayden Valley for breeding. As of July 2015, the Hayden Valley subpopulation consisted of 1,300 bison.</p> <p>Wolves and grizzly bears are the only large predators of adult bison. Dead bison provide an important source of food for scavengers and other carnivores.</p> <h2>Yellowstone Bison</h2> <p>Yellowstone bison are exceptional because they make up the nation’s largest bison population on public land and are among the few bison herds that have not been hybridized through interbreeding with cattle.</p> <p>Unlike most other herds, this population has thousands of individuals that are allowed to roam relatively freely over the expansive landscape of Yellowstone National Park and some nearby areas of Montana.</p> <p>They also exhibit wild behavior like their ancient ancestors, congregating during the breeding season to compete for mates, as well as migration and exploration that result in the use of new habitat areas.</p> <p>These behaviors have enabled the successful restoration of a population that was on the brink of extinction just over a century ago.</p> <h2>Hayden Valley Herd</h2> <p>Most of the Hayden Valley bison move between the Madison, Firehole, Hayden, and Pelican valleys during the rest of the year. However, some bison travel to the northern portion of the park and mix with the northern herd before most return to the Hayden Valley for the subsequent breeding season.</p> <p>Counts of the central herd increased from about 1,900 bison in 2000 to 3,500 in 2005, and then decreased to 1,400 in 2013 due primarily to large culls of about 1,000 and 1,560 bison at the park boundary during 2006 and 2008, respectively.</p> <h2>Animals are Dangerous</h2> <ul> <li>Do not approach or feed any animal.</li> <li>Bison and elk have injured people.</li> <li>Stay 100 yards (91 m) from bears and wolves.</li> <li>Stay 25 yards (23 m) from all other animals.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think Safety, Act Safely.

        "notes": "Heart Spring\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/heart-spring.htm\n\n<p>Heart Spring was named by park geologist George Marler around 1959, apparently because its shape resembles a human heart. It is 7-1/2 feet (2.3 m) by 10 feet (3 m) at the surface and 15 feet (1.5 m) deep. Heart Spring is a deep, clear, blue pool with colorful orange and yellow thermophiles in the outwash channel. Hard sinter lines the edge of the pool just at the ground surface.</p> <p>Heart Spring has an average temperate of 184.8°F (84.9°C), an average pH of 8.6, and an average conductivity of 2021 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Before venturing into Yellowstone’s winter wonderland, make sure you have properly planned and are prepared for the challenges brought on by extreme cold and deep snow.</p> <ul> <li>Let friends or family know your itinerary.</li> <li>Do not travel alone.</li> <li>Evaluate your party’s and equipment's capabilities.</li> <li>Be prepared to make repairs.</li> <li>Carry and drink plenty of water, and bring high energy food.</li> <li>Be prepared to set up an emergency shelter.</li> <li>Bring a first-aid kit, space blanket, extra clothing, and headlamp.</li> <li>Carry and know how to use a map and compass.</li> <li>Use sunglasses or ski goggles and sunscreen.</li> </ul> <p><b>Clothing and Gear</b></p> <p>Even in severe winter temperatures, you can be comfortable and safe if you dress properly to prevent chilling and overheating. Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</p> <ul> <li>Windproof, hooded outer layer</li> <li>Wool or other insulated garments underneath</li> <li>Wool or synthetic trousers</li> <li>Wool or synthetic long underwear</li> <li>Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</li> <li>Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</li> <li>Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</li> </ul> <p>Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</p> <p>Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</p> <h2>Winter Hazards</h2> <p>Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</p> <p>Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</p> <ul> <li>Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</li> <li>Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</li> <li>Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Stay dry and learn how to recognize the signs of hypothermia and frostbite—they can set in quickly.</li> <li>Bears may be active at any time of year—be alert for signs of bear activity.</li> </ul> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <ul> <li>Do not walk on snowshoe or ski trails.</li> <li>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</li> <li>Yield to faster skiers or those going downhill.</li> <li>Detour around wildlife—never approach.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails and boardwalks.</li> <li>Keep children close at hand.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</li> <li>Keep your food secure—never feed wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Snowmobile Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>All snowmobilers must be led by a guide authorized by the National Park Service (NPS) to operate in Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>All snowmobiles must meet NPS sound and emission requirements.</li> <li>Snowmobile operators must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license in possession. Learner permits are not sufficient.</li> <li>Roads are open only 7 am to 9 pm. Snowmobiles are not allowed to operate in the park between 9 pm and 7 am.</li> <li>Maximum speed limit is 35 mph for snowmobiles, 25 mph for snowcoaches, or less where posted or as conditions warrant.</li> <li>Use hand signals when turning or stopping.</li> <li>Allow enough distance between snowmobiles when traveling.</li> <li>Pass only when safe.</li> <li>If you turn around, stay within the road width.</li> <li>Drive in single file, on the right side of the road even if the road is rough.</li> <li>When stopping, pull to the far right and park in single file.</li> <li>Do not idle your machine more than three minutes.</li> <li>Stay on designated roads. Side-hilling, berm-riding, or any off-road travel is prohibited and carries a fine of up to $5,000.</li> <li>Report accidents to a ranger.</li> <li>Operating a snowmobile while intoxicated is illegal. Possession of open alcoholic beverage containers, including bota bags, is illegal.</li> </ul> <p><b>Wild animals have the right of way.</b> If bison or other wildlife are on the road, stop at least 25 yards away (100 yards for wolves or bears). Pull your machine as far as possible to the opposite side of the road and give them a chance to move off the road.</p>",

        "notes": "Lamar Buffalo Ranch: Birthplace of Wildlife Conservation\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/lamar-buffalo-ranch.htm\n\n<p>The Lamar Buffalo Ranch occupies a significant place in the history of American wildlife conservation and management. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>The extermination of bison throughout the west in the 1800s nearly eliminated them from Yellowstone. Even after the park was established in 1872, poachers faced few deterrents. With only 25 bison counted in the park in 1901, Congress appropriated $15,000 to augment the herd by purchasing 21 bison from private owners. As part of the first effort to preserve a wild species through intensive management, these bison were fed and bred in Lamar Valley at what became known as the Lamar Buffalo Ranch.</p> <p>As the herd grew in size, bison were released to breed with the park’s free-roaming population. Bison from the ranch were also used to start and supplement herds on other public and tribal land. Today the Yellowstone bison population numbers in the thousands. It’s one the largest populations in North America and among the few that is genetically pure because it has not been interbred with cattle.</p> <p>A program to raise bison like domestic cattle in Yellowstone may seem incongruous and unnecessary in retrospect, but the buffalo ranch stands as a reminder that today’s well-intended wildlife management policies may have unintended consequences and be overturned by changing values and advances in ecological knowledge.</p> <p>As listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Lamar Buffalo Ranch Historic District includes five buildings: a ranger station, constructed in 1915 as the buffalo keeper’s residence; a pole fenced corral built and rebuilt from 1915 to the 1930s; a log barn for hay and horses (1927); a bunkhouse (1929); and a residence used for the assistant buffalo keeper that was moved to the ranch in 1938 from Soda Butte (where it had probably been a ranger station). The vegetation around the ranch is mostly sagebrush and nonnative grasses that were planted during the period of hay cultivation. Remnants of irrigation ditches, fencing, and water troughs remain throughout the ranch.</p> <h2>Education & Sustainability</h2> <p>Today <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/expeditionyell.htm\">Expedition Yellowstone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.yellowstone.org/\">Yellowstone Forever Institute</a> use the Lamar Buffalo Ranch as a base camp for educational field classes and seminars. In keeping with its rustic character, the Lamar Buffalo Ranch remains off-the-grid. Thanks to partnerships with <a href=\"https://www.yellowstone.org/\">Yellowstone Forever</a>, Sharp, and Toyota, a 44 kw photovoltaic array provides power to the ranch. The solar panels are tucked out of site so as not to affect Lamar Valley’s panoramic views. As a pilot project, Toyota provided 208 used hybrid car batteries to store power on site. It's hoped this technology will provide a new alternative for delivering power to remote locations throughout the world.</p> <p>These partnerships enable the National Park Service to use the buffalo ranch as a model for environmental stewardship. Future plans call improving the energy efficiency of the historic buildings with things like low-flow water fixtures, on-demand hot water, and more energy-efficient windows (all while preserving the integrity of the original structures). Eventually, we hope to remove all propane appliances so the ranch can operate entirely free of fossil fuels.</p> <h2>The Future of Bison Management</h2> <p>The protection and recovery of bison in Yellowstone is one of the great triumphs of American conservation. Efforts centered at the Lamar Buffalo Ranch succeeded in bringing this species back from the brink of extinction. Today we face the challenge of maintaining a wild, migratory population of bison in a modern landscape. Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/management/bison-management.htm\"> success and controversy </a>surrounding these efforts.</p>",

This series of effects is called a “trophic cascade.”</p> <p>It is too soon to know for sure if this trophic cascade is actually happening, and how extensive it might be—or if it is just one of many factors at work. Ongoing, long-term scientific research will continue to examine the complex fabric of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.</p> <h2>Effects of Wolves</h2> <p>Accumulated studies show that the loss of wolves from the food web on the northern range in the 1930s led to a loss of willows and other woody plants by allowing excessive grazing by elk.</p> <p>Most researchers agree that reintroduced wolves have caused elk to change their behavior and many studies have shown a correlation between the presence of wolves and increased growth in willows. However, not all scientists agree that this relationship is causal.</p> <p>For example, some researchers say elk don’t linger in willow or aspen areas where visibility is poor and that this behavioral change prevents them from eating as much willow or aspen. Other scientists argue that fluctuations in the availability of groundwater explain the growth patterns in woody vegetation.</p> <p>Ecologists have documented a substantial rise in temperature in the northern range: from 1995 to 2005, the number of days above freezing increased from 90 to 110. Changes in precipitation and effects of global climate change are also affecting vegetation growth.</p> <h2>Wildlife Watching</h2> <p>The northern range of Yellowstone is one of the best places in the world to watch wolves.</p> <h2>Animals are Dangerous</h2> <ul> <li>Do not approach or feed any animal.</li> <li>Bison and elk have injured people.</li> <li>Stay 100 yards (91 m) from bears and wolves.</li> <li>Stay 25 yards (23 m) from all other animals.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think Safety, Act Safely.

In fact, some of the largest wild herds of bison and elk in North America are found here.</p> <p>The northern range is critical winter habitat for these large animals, which in turn provide food for several packs of wolves. Coyotes are also common, and occasional bobcat, cougar, or red fox are reported.</p> <p><b>Leave antlers, wildflowers, rocks, and arrowheads where you find them.</b></p> <h2>Wild Yellowstone</h2> <p>The reintroduction of the wolf to Yellowstone restored an important element of ecological completeness in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.</p> <p>This region now contains every large wild mammal, predator or prey, that inhabited it when Europeans first arrived in North America, though not necessarily in the same numbers or distribution. But the wolf is only one factor in the extremely complex and dynamic community of wild Yellowstone.</p> <h2>Life in a Carcass</h2> <p>Since wolves were restored, scientists have discovered layers of complexity reaching far beyond the large mammals. For example, the carcasses of elk, bison, and other large mammals each become ecosystems of their own. Researchers have identified at least 57 species of beetle associated with these ungulate carcasses on the northern range. Only one of those species eats ungulate meat. The rest prey on other small scavengers, especially the larvae of flies and beetles.</p> <p>Others consume carcass by-products such as microscopic fungal spores.

Much of the wolves’ prey and habitat was destroyed as agriculture flourished. With the prey base removed, wolves began to prey on domestic stock.</p> <p>Although wolf packs once roamed from the Arctic tundra to Mexico, loss of habitat and extermination programs led to their demise throughout most of the United States by early in the 1900s.</p> <p>Predator control, including poisoning, was practiced here in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Other predators such as bears, cougars, and coyotes were also killed to protect livestock and “more desirable” wildlife species, such as deer and elk.</p> <h2>Restoration</h2> <p>In 1973, the US Fish and Wildlife Service listed the northern Rocky Mountain wolf as an endangered species. From 1995 to 1997, 41 wild wolves from Canada and northwest Montana were released in Yellowstone National Park.</p> <p>As expected, wolves from the growing population dispersed to establish territories outside the park where they are less protected from human-caused mortalities.

After the 1959 Hebgen Lake Earthquake, water temperatures rose and killed the bacteria and it was noted to have erupted. Now, it has cooled and once again supports the brown bacteria. It has an average pH of 6.9 and an average conductivity of 1600 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins.

Its internal pressure was sufficient to raise the water to a great height, allowing mineral deposits to build slowly and continuously for perhaps hundreds of years.</p> <p>Liberty Cap was named in 1871 by the Hayden Survey because it resembled the peaked knit caps symbolizing freedom and liberty during the French Revolution.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Today, it looks less like a hot spring, with algae mats growing across the top and grass growing right up to the sides. While cooler than most other features in the Upper Geyser Basin, this is still a hot spring.

Though, even the hot springs have a history of erupting. The largest geyser in the group is Lion Geyser, which naturally comes from the largest cone. Lion Geyser actually has a series of eruptions within a single eruption cycle.</p> <p>Little Cub Geyser was the most frequent erupter of the group, and comes out of the cone on the southern side of the mound. Since 2004, however, the frequency has increased in variety, from anywhere from every hour up to nearly two days later.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the center of the group are Lioness Geyser and Big Cub Geyser. Both rarely erupt, but when they do, they reach up to 50 feet (46 m) into the air. Goggles Spring, North Goggles Geyser (no eruptions since 2004), and the unofficially named \"Kitten Geyser\" round out the major thermal features of the Lion Geyser Complex.</p> <p>Lion Geyser Complex has an average temperate of 197.1°F (91.7°C), an average pH of 8.8, and an average conductivity of 1979.33 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape.

The log walls of the Old Faithful Inn are made with lodgepole pine.</p> <p>The volcanic rocks beneath much of Yellowstone form nutrient-poor soils. These areas generally have extensive stands of lodgepole pine, which are drought tolerant and have shallow roots that take advantage of the nutrients in the soil.</p> <p>Lodgepoles are the only pine in Yellowstone whose needles grow in groups of two. They can be up to 75 feet tall. Lodgepole pine trees have very thin bark and can be killed by ground fires.</p> <h2>Fire Rejuvenates Forests</h2> <p>Wildland fire is an integral, dynamic process. Fires rejuvenate forests on a grand scale. Some species of plants survive the intense burning to re-sprout. Some cones of lodgepole pines pop open only in heat generated by fires, spreading millions of seeds on the forest floor.</p> <p>After fire sweeps through an area, mammals, birds, and insects quickly take advantage of the newly created habitats. Fires recycle and release nutrients and create dead trees or snags that serve a number of ecological functions, such as the addition of organic matter to the soil when the trees decompose.</p>",

        "notes": "Madison Junction\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/madison-junction.htm\n\n<p>At Madison Junction, the Gibbon River joins the Firehole River to form the Madison River.</p> <p>The Gibbon River flows from Grebe Lake through the Norris area to Madison Junction. The Firehole River starts south of Old Faithful and flows through the park’s major hydrothermal basins north to Madison Junction. The Madison joins the Jefferson and the Gallatin rivers at Three Forks, Montana, to form the Missouri River.</p> <p>The cliffs you see are the rim of the Yellowstone Caldera, plus lava flows. National Park Mountain is actually part of the lava flows. Some of these lava flows come down to the road through Firehole Canyon, approximately one mile south of Madison Junction. Gibbon Falls, four miles north of the junction, drops 84 feet (0.3 m) over a remnant of the caldera rim.</p> <h2>Swimming in Yellowstone</h2> <p>South of Madison Junction is the entrance to the Firehole Canyon Drive, a one-way route that follows the Firehole River. Along this route are views of the Firehole Falls and a swimming area where the water is influenced by thermal activity below the surface.</p> <p>Swimming is undertaken at your own risk. Please note that climbing the cliffs around the swimming area erodes the thin topsoil and damages area habitat. Jumping from the cliffs is very dangerous and is forbidden.</p> <h2>Seven Mile Bridge</h2> <p>Seven Mile Bridge is located midway between (and seven miles from both) the West Entrance and Madison Junction. This landmark serves as a convenient reference point and separates the rugged lava-lined Madison Canyon east of the bridge from gentle hills to the west.</p> <h2>National Park Mountain</h2> <p>The legend, which you can read about at the Madison Information Station, tells of explorers camping here in 1870 and deciding Yellowstone should be set aside as a national park. It is a wonderful story, but it isn’t true. Explorers did camp at the junction in 1870, but they apparently did not discuss the national park idea.</p> <p>They camped in a location where people have camped for centuries. Archeologists have found campfire remnants, obsidian flakes, and bone fragments dating back at least 10,000 years.</p> <h2>Think Safety, Act Safely</h2> <p>From burning hot hydrothermal features, to unpredictable wildlife, to steep terrain, Yellowstone is a dangerous place. You are responsible for your safety. As such, please remember these safety tips:</p> <ul> <li>Never touch any hydrothermal waters—they can scald you.</li> <li>Observe safe distances from all wildlife.</li> <li>Stay behind fencing, guard rails, and ledges.</li> <li>Use caution when around park waters—they are cold and fast.</li> <li>Show patience and courtesy to other people.</li> </ul>",

Before venturing into Yellowstone’s winter wonderland, make sure you have properly planned and are prepared for the challenges brought on by extreme cold and deep snow.</p> <ul> <li>Let friends or family know your itinerary.</li> <li>Do not travel alone.</li> <li>Evaluate your party’s and equipment's capabilities.</li> <li>Be prepared to make repairs.</li> <li>Carry and drink plenty of water, and bring high energy food.</li> <li>Be prepared to set up an emergency shelter.</li> <li>Bring a first-aid kit, space blanket, extra clothing, and headlamp.</li> <li>Carry and know how to use a map and compass.</li> <li>Use sunglasses or ski goggles and sunscreen.</li> </ul> <p><b>Clothing and Gear</b></p> <p>Even in severe winter temperatures, you can be comfortable and safe if you dress properly to prevent chilling and overheating. Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</p> <ul> <li>Windproof, hooded outer layer</li> <li>Wool or other insulated garments underneath</li> <li>Wool or synthetic trousers</li> <li>Wool or synthetic long underwear</li> <li>Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</li> <li>Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</li> <li>Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</li> </ul> <p>Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</p> <p>Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</p> <h2>Winter Hazards</h2> <p>Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</p> <p>Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</p> <ul> <li>Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</li> <li>Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</li> <li>Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Stay dry and learn how to recognize the signs of hypothermia and frostbite—they can set in quickly.</li> <li>Bears may be active at any time of year—be alert for signs of bear activity.</li> </ul> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <ul> <li>Do not walk on snowshoe or ski trails.</li> <li>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</li> <li>Yield to faster skiers or those going downhill.</li> <li>Detour around wildlife—never approach.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails and boardwalks.</li> <li>Keep children close at hand.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</li> <li>Keep your food secure—never feed wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Snowmobile Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>All snowmobilers must be led by a guide authorized by the National Park Service (NPS) to operate in Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>All snowmobiles must meet NPS sound and emission requirements.</li> <li>Snowmobile operators must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license in possession. Learner permits are not sufficient.</li> <li>Roads are open only 7 am to 9 pm. Snowmobiles are not allowed to operate in the park between 9 pm and 7 am.</li> <li>Maximum speed limit is 35 mph for snowmobiles, 25 mph for snowcoaches, or less where posted or as conditions warrant.</li> <li>Use hand signals when turning or stopping.</li> <li>Allow enough distance between snowmobiles when traveling.</li> <li>Pass only when safe.</li> <li>If you turn around, stay within the road width.</li> <li>Drive in single file, on the right side of the road even if the road is rough.</li> <li>When stopping, pull to the far right and park in single file.</li> <li>Do not idle your machine more than three minutes.</li> <li>Stay on designated roads. Side-hilling, berm-riding, or any off-road travel is prohibited and carries a fine of up to $5,000.</li> <li>Report accidents to a ranger.</li> <li>Operating a snowmobile while intoxicated is illegal. Possession of open alcoholic beverage containers, including bota bags, is illegal.</li> </ul> <p><b>Wild animals have the right of way.</b> If bison or other wildlife are on the road, stop at least 25 yards away (100 yards for wolves or bears). Pull your machine as far as possible to the opposite side of the road and give them a chance to move off the road.</p>",

Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Transitions from asphalt walkways to boardwalks may require assistance. Some sections of boardwalk are wheelchair-accessible. See the Mammoth Hot Springs Trail Guide map. The rest of the area has stairs or steep grades due to terrain.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Some years, they are dry.</p> <p>In dry areas, you can clearly see the many layers and the varying depths.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive.

It is outside of the most recent Yellowstone caldera, but inside the first and largest caldera. It sits on the intersection of three major faults and is a very active earthquake area.</p> <p>Each year, new hot springs and geysers appear while others become dormant. Geologic events trigger many of these changes. Even small earthquakes can alter hydrothermal behavior. This sudden activity is known as a “thermal disturbance” and can last a few days, or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to “normal.”</p> <p>No one fully understands why this happens. Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. The water chemistry changes as the water levels of underground hot water reservoirs fluctuates.</p> <p>Although Norris is known for its acid features, it also have alkaline hot springs and geysers. As underground water and chemistry shift suddenly, they could contribute to dramatic changes in minerals and pH.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

It last erupted in 2013. When it does erupt, it sends water 150–200 feet (46–61 m) up into the air and out 60–100 feet (18–31 m) around its vent. It has an average temperate of 167.8°F (75.5°C), an average pH of 7.7, and an average conductivity of 1833.33 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Over the years people have thrown in thousands of pounds of coins, trash, rocks, and logs into the pool. Much of this debris became embedded in the sides and vent of the spring, which reduced the water circulation and thus the water temperature. Vandalism has decreased, but remains a problem.</p> <p>Natural changes may be cooling the water, too. Cooler temperatures allow orange- and yellow-colored bacteria to thrive.

In the early history of the park, Fan and Mortar were separate geysers but at some point the plumbing of the features changed and no their activity match each other most of the time. Recently new vents have been formed by Mortar eruptions, breaking apart the old cone structure. Three actively boiling vents exist in the large cone, with run off spilling into the river. Eruption intervals can range from days to months.</p> <p>Mortar Geyser has an average temperate of 169.3°F (76.3°C), an average pH of 5.5, and an average conductivity of 1800 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground.

Mound Terrace was inactive for decades but began flowing again recently.</p> <p>Its weathered travertine shows new patterns where chunks of the soft rock have broken or fallen.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Jupiter Terrace flowed heavily and overtook boardwalks several times.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing.

Its peak elevation is 10,219 feet (3,115 m) and panoramic views for about 20 to 50 miles (32 to 80 km). At the top, check out interpretive exhibits inside the base of a fire lookout and enjoy the view.</p> <p>Hike to the top via two trails that ascend Mount Washburn on a wide path with spectacular views. The trails start at the Dunraven Pass Trailhead and at the Chittenden Road parking area. Bicycles may use the trail from the Chittenden Road parking area.</p> <p>During July, wildflowers carpet the slopes. Visitors often see bighorn sheep near the trail.</p> <h2>Fire Lookout</h2> <p>Mount Washburn is one of three fire lookout stations in Yellowstone. It is continuously staffed from mid-June until the fire season ends. Fire lookouts are staffed by firefighters trained to detect and locate fires, monitor fire activity, and report significant changes. They spend the summer living alone, watching for signs of fire.</p> <h2>Forming a Mountain</h2> <p>This peak can be seen from many locations in the park. It is a remnant of an extinct volcano from the Absaroka Volcanics of about 50 million years ago. The volcano was literally cut in half by a volcanic eruption 631,000 years ago. Only the northern part of the original volcano is still visible.</p> <h2>Bighorn Sheep</h2> <p>Bighorn sheep are often seen along the slopes of Mount Washburn near Dunraven Pass.</p> <p>All bighorn sheep have horns. The rings on horns can be used to determine age, though it is easier to count the rings on a ram.</p> <p>Ram skulls have two layers of bone above the brain that work as a shock absorber. This is an adaptation for the collision of head-on fighting that is used to establish dominance between rams of equal horn size, especially during mating.</p> <h2>Animals are Dangerous</h2> <ul> <li>Do not approach or feed any animal.</li> <li>Bison and elk have injured people.</li> <li>Stay 100 yards (91 m) from bears and wolves.</li> <li>Stay 25 yards (23 m) from all other animals.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think Safety, Act Safely.

Currently, East Mustard Spring is an active geyser with 2–3 minute intervals between eruptions. Water levels in West Mustard Spring sit lower. Both pools are similar in size, but East Mustard Spring is surrounded by small mounds of geyserite deposits and a thin surrounding layer of runoff water outside the geyserite. West Mustard Spring, due to being shallower, has vegetation growing right up to the pool. Yellow and orange thermophiles fill the shallow runoff pools of East Mustard Spring and the pool of West Mustard Spring.</p> <p>Mustard Spring has an average temperate of 183.3°F (84.1°C), an average pH of 8, and an average conductivity of 2174 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

        "notes": "Nez Perce National Historic Trail\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/nez-perce-national-historic-trail.htm\n\n<h3>The Corps of Discovery and the Nez Perce</h3> <p>Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and their Corps of Discovery traveled through Nez Perce country in the fall of 1805. After some initial apprehension, the Nez Perce embraced the expedition and provided help when the party was nearing starvation. After journeying further west, Lewis and Clark returned in the spring of 1806. They spent more time with the Nez Perce than any other tribe encountered during their expedition.</p> <p>Lewis and Clark engaged in a diplomatic exchange with Nez Perce chiefs. The captains sought to establish trading posts and intertribal peace in the region. The Nez Perce were willing to cooperate as long as guns and other weaponry were provided to the tribe.</p> <p>Like their Shoshone neighbors, the Nez Perce were without guns or ammunition. This left them vulnerable to their enemies who could obtain weapons from Canadian traders and also hampered their ability to hunt buffalo. The Nez Perce were known for their horsemanship and breeding, especially the Appaloosa horses, which provided a great advantage in traversing long distances in order to hunt and fish.</p> <h3>The Flight of 1877</h3> <p>Chief Joseph’s father refused to sign the 1863 Treaty. On June 15, 1877, The Wallowa Band of  Nez Perce (Nimíipuu) fled their homelands in Wallowa Valley in northeastern Oregon to escape being forced to move to the reservation in Idaho. They hoped to evade violent engagements with settlers and the United States Army and find a more peaceful existence living according to their traditions. An estimated 750 to 800 men, women and children and 250 warriors were pursued by military which included the 7th Infantry and 7th Calvary of the U.S. Army. They set off near Wallowa Lake in eastern Oregon and traveled a circuitous 1,170 miles over five months through Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. The Tribe planned to ally with the Crow for security, but when the Crow refused aid, the Tribe headed toward the Canadian border.</p> <h3>Route through Yellowstone National Park</h3> <p>They entered Yellowstone National Park on August 23. Only a small part of the route taken by the Nez Perce who fled from the US Army in 1877 went through Yellowstone (established in 1872), and they largely eluded their pursuers while there.</p> <p>During their time here, the Nez Perce encountered about 25 visitors in the young park, some more than once. Warriors took hostage or attacked several of these tourists, killing two. The group continued traveling through the park and over the Absaroka Mountains into Montana. </p> <h3>Nez Perce Commemorative Sites in Yellowstone</h3> <p>Although none of the officially designated historic sites associated with the Nez Perce are located in Yellowstone, the historic trail goes through the park, and it is considered a sacred place by many Nez Perce who have continued to honor their ancestors and carry on their memories through ceremonies conducted in the park.</p> <h3>End of the Flight</h3> <p>Leaving Yellowstone, the Nez Perce continued their flight to Canada. Along the way, the Nez Perce warriors valiantly fought U.S. military and citizen volunteers across a series of battles. But starved and exhausted from the journey and persistent clashes, the brave Chief Joseph surrendered following a battle near Bears Paw Mountains in Montana, less than 40 miles from the Canadian border. It is here that it is believed the flight ended and Chief Joseph said, “From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.”<br /> <br /> Led by Chief White Bird, nearly 300 Nez Perce men, women and children managed to escape the battle at Bears Paw and make their way into Canada where they joined Sitting Bull and the Lakota near Fort Walsh. Following surrender, the Nez Perce were sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and eventually to reservations in Oklahoma, where deplorable conditions led to the death of most babies born on the Indian Territory. Today, the trail represents a sacred journey, connecting the surviving Nez Perce people to the past, present and future.</p> <h3><strong>Auto Tours:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Travelers can retrace the Nez Perce National Historical Trail by car along more than 1,500 miles of federal, state and county roads narrated by the Auto Route, with trail signs along the way.</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/maps-pubs/?cid=fsbdev3_055663\">Auto Tour Pamphlets </a>with maps, history and points of interest of all eight segments of the trail</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=45.890008,-116.828613&spn=1.911731,3.295898&hl=en&msa=0&z=8&source=embed&ie=UTF8&mid=zv7KavdVnCwU.kid9pjyMdX-c\">Google Map </a>of Nez Perce Historic Trail Auto Tour</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Hiking/Horseback Tours</strong></h3> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.discovernw.org/store_1877-nez-perce-flight-nez-perce-nee-me-poo-national-historic-trail-map_18998.html\">Trail Map </a>with modern-day travel routes and sites to visit along the trail.</li> <li>Essential Trail Companion: Following the Nez Perce Trail, A Guide to the Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trail with Eyewitness Accounts by Cheryl Wilfong</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPwhQoY6BdkOyoCAPkATlA!/?ss=110199&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=null&navid=151120000000000&pnavid=151000000000000&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&ttype=main&pname=Nez%20Perce%20National%20Historic%20Trail-%20Outdoor%20Safety%20&%20Ethics\">Outdoor Safety & Ethics </a>&<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/home/?cid=stelprdb5245913\"> FAQs</a></li> <li>Each summer, the Nez Perce Trail Foundation offers a week-long driving, hiking and camping <a href=\"http://nezpercetrail.net/summer-educational-trail-tour/\">educational tour </a>of the trail, visiting sites that include Wallowa Valley, Lolo Trail, Nez Perce National Historical Park, Big Hole Battlefield and Tamkaliks Celebration & Friendship Feast.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Quick Facts:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Bear Paw Battlefield is the site of the final conflict of the Nez Perce War and Flight of 1877.</li> <li>Beartooth All-American Road: Lush forests become alpine tundra in just a few miles on the highest elevation road in the Northern Rockies, with access to Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>The Chief <a href=\"https://travelwyoming.com/listing/yellowstone-national-park/chief-joseph-scenic-byway\">Joseph Scenic Byway in northwest Wyoming</a> links the town of Cody with the Beartooth Highway and the Northeast Gate of Yellowstone National Park.

Sawtooth-textured geyserite surrounds part of the main pool, but also forms small, shallow pools in the overflow of the main pool. Oblong Geyser is unique in that while its eruptions aren't as dramatic as other features, the volume of water flowing into the Firehole River has been estimated to be at least 10,000 gallons! Eruptions occur every 2.5–11 hours. Some yellow and orange thermophile line the edge of the hillside where the overflow from Oblong reaches the river.</p> <p>Oblong Geyser has an average temperate of 185.1°F (85°C), an average pH of 7.6, and an average conductivity of 2025 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Stay at least 100 yards (91 m) from bears. Do NOT feed bears or other animals.</p> <p><b>If a Bear Charges You:</b> Stand still, do not run. Stand your ground and use your bear spray. Spray when the bear is 60 feet (18 m) away or closer. If a bear charges, it may be a bluff charge.</p> <p><b>If a Bear Makes Contact:</b> Drop to the ground; play dead.

However, when there is activity, it takes the form of water splashing a few feet high for up to several hours.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

It is believed this regularity is in part due to no known connection with other hydrothermal features in the area.</p> <p>Its average interval between eruptions is about 90 minutes, varying from 50 to 127 minutes. An eruption lasts 1.5 to 5 minutes and expels 3,700–8,400 gallons (14,000–32,000 l) of boiling water, and reaches a height of 106–184 feet (30–55 m). Old Faithful Geyser has an average temperate of 169.7°F (76.5°C), an average pH of 9, and an average conductivity of 1972 uS/cm.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/geyser-activity.htm\">##View all geyser predictions</a></p> <p>Limited parking, especially 10 am-6 pm.</p> <h2>Name Origin</h2> <p>Members of the Washburn expedition of 1870 named this geyser for its consistent performance. Although its average interval has lengthened, Old Faithful is as spectacular as it was a century ago.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>The geyser is the centerpiece of the Old Faithful Historic District. The surrounding buildings are all set back from the geyser about the same distance: 1/8 mile (0.2 km). Only two buildings have been allowed to infringe upon this distance, established by Federal law: the Old Faithful Inn's east wing and the Old Faithful Lodge.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Wheelchair-accessible walkways lead from all parking areas to Old Faithful Geyser, and from the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center to other hydrothermal features.</p>",

        "notes": "Old Faithful Inn\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/old-faithful-inn.htm\n\n<p>A national historic landmark, Old Faithful Inn is the most requested lodging facility in the park. Designed by Robert Reamer and built in 1903-1904 with local logs and stone, the inn is considered the largest log structure in the world. The towering lobby features a massive stone fireplace and a hand-crafted clock made of copper, wood and wrought iron serving as focal points. This reservable lodging facility is operated by a park partner.</p> <h2>2024 Season</h2> <ul> <li>May 3–October 14</li> </ul> <h2>History</h2> <p>After the only hotel in the Upper Geyser Basin burned down in 1894, park officials pressured the Yellowstone Park Association, which held the lease on the property, to replace it with something more substantial. In 1902, the president of the Yellowstone Park Association obtained financing from the Northern Pacific Railroad for a new hotel. The lobby, rising six stories beneath a steeply sloped roof, was flanked by a dining room and two three-story wings containing guest rooms.</p> <p>The Old Faithful Inn opened in 1904, and was equipped with electric lighting, but architect Robert Reamer designed the light fixtures to look like candlesticks. Both the electricity and the radiators were fueled by a steam generator. Evening meals were accompanied by a string quartet, and dancing was customary six nights a week. The east wing was added in 1919 and the west wing was added in 1927—both under Reamer's supervision.</p> <p>The Old Faithful Historic District, which includes the inn and many of the surrounding buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Like the inn, the district is historically significant because of its rustic architecture and its role in the development of concessions, including restaurants, to accommodate growing tourism in the early 1900s. The Old Faithful Inn was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. A major renovation program of the Old House was launched in 2004 to meet current building codes and restore the lobby so that it more closely replicates Reamer's original design.</p> <h2>Design</h2> <p>The Old Faithful Inn, named for the geyser, exemplifies the use of rustic architecture at a large scale to complement a natural landscape. The rhyolite that formed Yellowstone's caldera during volcanic upheavals provided the stone for the building's foundation, and local lodgepole pine the logs for its walls. Skilled craftsmen embellished the windows and stairways with gnarled wood selected for its inherent beauty. As designed by architect Robert Reamer, the inn combines rugged materials and organic motifs in a way that expresses both frontier sensibilities and elegance.</p> <h2>Dining</h2> <ul> <li>Dining Room: Breakfast and lunch as first-come, first-seated; dinner reservations recommended</li> <li>Lounge: Light food and beverages are available first-come, first-seated</li> <li>Bear Paw Deli: First-come, first-served snacks and ice cream</li> <li>Coffee Bar: Located on the second floor</li> <li>Bar: Located on the second floor</li> </ul> <h2>Suite</h2> <ul> <li>2 queen beds in bedroom</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower/tub combo, sink and toilet</li> <li>Well-appointed sitting room with refrigerator</li> </ul> <h2>Junior Suite</h2> <ul> <li>2 queen beds</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower/tub combo, sink and toilet</li> <li>Sitting area</li> </ul> <h2>Superior Hotel Room and Premium West-Wing Hotel Room</h2> <p>Face the geyser basin, but views can be interrupted by tree</p> <ul> <li>1 or 2 queen beds</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower or shower/tub combo, sink and toilet</li> </ul> <h2>Premium Hotel Room, Standard Hotel Room, & Old House Standard Room with Bath</h2> <ul> <li>1 or 2 queen beds</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower or shower/tub combo, sink, and toilet</li> <li>Modern furnishings</li> </ul> <h2>Old House Room without Bath</h2> <ul> <li>1, 2, or 3 queen beds</li> <li>Shared bathrooms with private showers located down the hall</li> <li>Vanity sink</li> </ul> <h2>Additional Details</h2> <ul> <li>No televisions, radios, and air conditioning available in any park lodging</li> <li>Gift shop and bike rental at entrance</li> </ul> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <ul> <li>8 ADA rooms available with bathroom grab bars, portable shower hose, and accessible toilet and sink</li> <li>Wheelchairs available for loan at the inn for guests or for rent at the Old Faithful Medical Clinic for $15 per day with a $300 deposit</li> <li>Wheelchair users may require assistance (no curb cut) to access lodge and cafeteria</li> <li>Designated accessible parking in front and rear of building</li> </ul> <h2>Reservations</h2> <ul> <li>307-344-7311</li> <li>307-344-5395 for TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) service</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.YellowstoneNationalParkLodges.com\">online</a></li> </ul>",

Before venturing into Yellowstone’s winter wonderland, make sure you have properly planned and are prepared for the challenges brought on by extreme cold and deep snow.</p> <ul> <li>Let friends or family know your itinerary.</li> <li>Do not travel alone.</li> <li>Evaluate your party’s and equipment's capabilities.</li> <li>Be prepared to make repairs.</li> <li>Carry and drink plenty of water, and bring high energy food.</li> <li>Be prepared to set up an emergency shelter.</li> <li>Bring a first-aid kit, space blanket, extra clothing, and headlamp.</li> <li>Carry and know how to use a map and compass.</li> <li>Use sunglasses or ski goggles and sunscreen.</li> </ul> <p><b>Clothing and Gear</b></p> <p>Even in severe winter temperatures, you can be comfortable and safe if you dress properly to prevent chilling and overheating. Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</p> <ul> <li>Windproof, hooded outer layer</li> <li>Wool or other insulated garments underneath</li> <li>Wool or synthetic trousers</li> <li>Wool or synthetic long underwear</li> <li>Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</li> <li>Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</li> <li>Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</li> </ul> <p>Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</p> <p>Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</p> <h2>Winter Hazards</h2> <p>Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</p> <p>Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</p> <ul> <li>Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</li> <li>Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</li> <li>Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Stay dry and learn how to recognize the signs of hypothermia and frostbite—they can set in quickly.</li> <li>Bears may be active at any time of year—be alert for signs of bear activity.</li> </ul> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <ul> <li>Do not walk on snowshoe or ski trails.</li> <li>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</li> <li>Yield to faster skiers or those going downhill.</li> <li>Detour around wildlife—never approach.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails and boardwalks.</li> <li>Keep children close at hand.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</li> <li>Keep your food secure—never feed wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Snowmobile Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>All snowmobilers must be led by a guide authorized by the National Park Service (NPS) to operate in Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>All snowmobiles must meet NPS sound and emission requirements.</li> <li>Snowmobile operators must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license in possession. Learner permits are not sufficient.</li> <li>Roads are open only 7 am to 9 pm. Snowmobiles are not allowed to operate in the park between 9 pm and 7 am.</li> <li>Maximum speed limit is 35 mph for snowmobiles, 25 mph for snowcoaches, or less where posted or as conditions warrant.</li> <li>Use hand signals when turning or stopping.</li> <li>Allow enough distance between snowmobiles when traveling.</li> <li>Pass only when safe.</li> <li>If you turn around, stay within the road width.</li> <li>Drive in single file, on the right side of the road even if the road is rough.</li> <li>When stopping, pull to the far right and park in single file.</li> <li>Do not idle your machine more than three minutes.</li> <li>Stay on designated roads. Side-hilling, berm-riding, or any off-road travel is prohibited and carries a fine of up to $5,000.</li> <li>Report accidents to a ranger.</li> <li>Operating a snowmobile while intoxicated is illegal. Possession of open alcoholic beverage containers, including bota bags, is illegal.</li> </ul> <p><b>Wild animals have the right of way.</b> If bison or other wildlife are on the road, stop at least 25 yards away (100 yards for wolves or bears). Pull your machine as far as possible to the opposite side of the road and give them a chance to move off the road.</p>",

Some sidewalks were shoveled, but skis were crucial to leaving the house. The porches of the officers' quarters were lined with skis—from long to short.

It is not so much sport riding when the snow is so deep that your horse has to work all the time. Stayed at the Post for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a beaut. The cook more than threw himself. Turkey, roast pork, sweet spuds, cranberry sauce, oyster stew, chocolate, three kinds of cake, pie, pickles, nuts and apples--how's that for soldiers? ... There is something about this life in the wilderness that fascinates me. I saddle my beast, and go off on long rides through the forest where everything is so quiet that one can almost hear the solitude....

When in the 'Penta-Churn mode' of activity, Penta eruptions can be daily, but in years that the Sawmill Complex is in the more common 'Sawmill mode,' eruptions are rare. Penta Geyser has a main vent with a small, built up sinter cone, with several smaller vents in the surrounding solidified sinter. Water level changes with activity of other connected geysers in the complex.</p> <p>Penta Geyser has an average temperate of 185°F (85°C), an average pH of 8.7, and an average conductivity of 2176 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape.

Eggnog and refreshments were enjoyed.... The Post Exchange is open again for basketball and [roller] skating. A railing has been built around the gymnasium, protecting the heaters and lending assurance to the skaters.... To celebrate the holidays, the soldiers gave a dance at the Post Exchange, which was attractively decorated with Christmas trees and flags.</em></p> <h2>Getting Supplies</h2> <p>One of the challenges of fort life was keeping supplies on hand. Clothing and household items were usually ordered by catalog and some things were purchased through the Post Exchange.</p> <p>Whittaker's store near the Mammoth Hotel had novelties and many smaller items, and the Post Office had sundries as well.</p> <p>Troops acquired their rations from the Commissary. Both commissioned and non-commissioned officer's families were authorized to buy groceries there.</p> <p>The wife of Captain F. J. Arnold wrote:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>We ordered staples, meats, canned goods, breads, etc. from the Commissary and the order would be delivered and put in the kitchen. For special occasions in the winter, we would put in a special order for turkey and then hang it outside and keep it frozen as we only had a large icebox on the back porch.... The four-horse freight wagons hauled hay and coal up from Gardiner, and many other supplies came on the market wagon. There were some fresh foods available at Hall's Grocery store and the Van Dyke's Meat Market....</em></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-tour-fort-yellowstone.htm\">Explore the Fort Yellowstone Historic District</a></li> </ul>",

The pool is contained by the rim, but could splash out over the rim. The area surrounding the feature is covered in fractured and solidified sinter. Early park accounts indicate Punch Bowl Spring may have been a geyser, but no exact dates are recorded and no mention of an eruption has occurred since the early 1900s. Punch Bowl Spring’s activity has remained relatively constant for the last 100 years.</p> <p>Punch Bowl Spring has an average temperate of 197.8°F (92.1°C), an average pH of 7.5, and an average conductivity of 2164 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

        "notes": "Red Spouter\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/red-spouter.htm\n\n<p>Red Spouter formed as a direct result of the 1959 Hebgen Lake Earthquake. A vent opened up in this spot, which then turned into a mudpot. This hydrothermal feature does change seasonally, depending on the height of the water table beneath the surface. When the water table is high, it bubbles as a mudpot. When the water table drops, it reverts back to its origins as a fumarole.</p> <h2>Mudpots</h2> <p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

The rustic cabins and family-style dining are a favorite of families and anglers alike, and the front porch rocking chairs give guests an opportunity to rock their stress to sleep and awaken their “Old West spirit.” A large corral operation offers horseback trail rides, stagecoach adventures, and a popular cookout. This reservable lodging facility is operated by a park partner.</p> <h2>Campsites to Lodges</h2> <p>Indians, fur trappers, and explorers on the Bannock Trail camped in this area where a sagebrush meadow was encircled by Douglas fir, quaking aspen, and a mountain stream tumbled toward the Yellowstone River. President Chester Arthur camped here in 1883. In 1906, the Wylie Permanent Camping Company built a tent camp that became known as \"Camp Roosevelt,\" though Theodore Roosevelt never camped there. The tents were replaced by a lodge and cabins in the 1920s. Park lodges and cabins were built to accommodate the increasing number of visitors arriving in their own automobiles who wanted something more than a tent, but less expensive and formal than the park's hotels. During the 1920s and 1930s, the old hotels often stood empty while the new lodges overflowed with visitors.</p> <h2>Dudes & Scientists</h2> <p>Camp Roosevelt provided the atmosphere of a dude ranch and was a base for fishing parties and saddle-horse trips. It also served as a field laboratory where teachers and their students could conduct research at minimum expense, a purpose that the first director of the National Park Service was promoting for the parks. In what was a forerunner to the educational programs found in the parks today, the National Park Service hired a naturalist at Grinnell College to present lectures and conduct daily field trips for Camp Roosevelt visitors and collect botanical specimens for the park museum. Scientists based near conducted studies on the park's wildlife. From 1921 to 1923, the lodge was the headquarters for a boy's summer camp run by Alvin Whitney of the New York State School of Forestry at Syracuse University.</p> <h2>National Historic District</h2> <p>The Roosevelt Lodge Historic District, which includes 130 buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, with a period of significance from 1906 to 1948. The lodge, constructed of un-peeled logs and completed in 1920, was originally surrounded by 43 small log cabins, the first of which were completed in 1922. Over the years, the Roosevelt Lodge area became a repository for guest cabins brought from areas in the park where they were no longer wanted. By 1982, the corral had been moved farther from the cabins, of which there were now 110 of four main types.</p> <p>The area has undergone intermittent expansion and changes as visitor use has changed and facilities have aged over the years. The architectural appearance of the original lodge is retained only in the interior and exterior of the front portion (the lounge and dining room); the other sections of the building have been modified. The accommodations are still rustic, with unpaved roads into and around the lodge and cabins. Although the Grand Loop Road can be seen from the corral, which is not part of the historic district, it is obscured from view of the lodge and most of the cabins by a stand of mature trees.</p> <h2>Dining</h2> <ul> <li>Dining Room: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner as first-come, first-seated</li> <li>Cookout: Ride to dinner and songs by horseback or in a wagon, with reservations required (June 7–September 2)</li> </ul> <h2>Frontier Cabins</h2> <ul> <li>2 double beds</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower, toilet and sink</li> </ul> <h2>Roughrider Cabins</h2> <ul> <li>Sparsely furnished rustic cabins</li> <li>1 or 2 double beds</li> <li>Heat with wood-burning stove (2 “presto” logs are provided for use)</li> <li>Communal showers and bathrooms are located nearby</li> </ul> <h2>Additional Details</h2> <ul> <li>No televisions, radios, and air conditioning available in any park lodging</li> <li>Trail rides available June 2–September 10</li> <li>Stagecoach rides available June 2–September 10</li> </ul> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <ul> <li>2 ADA cabins available</li> <li>Wheelchair-accessible services in lodge building</li> <li>Designated accessible parking in front</li> <li>Wheelchair-accessible entrance is on the west (left) side of the lodge</li> </ul> <h2>Reservations:</h2> <ul> <li>307-344-7311</li> <li>307-344-5395 for TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) service</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.YellowstoneNationalParkLodges.com\">online</a></li> </ul>",

        "notes": "Sawmill Geyser\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/sawmill-geyser.htm\n\n<p>Sawmill Geyser is an example of the dynamic nature of these hydrothermal systems. While previously an active geyser, Sawmill Geyser stopped erupting in 2017 with no noticeable change at the surface. The pool is surrounded in geyserite from the previous high levels of geyser activity, with a dry outwash channel indicating a previously higher water level. Thermophiles are visible in the vent at the bottom of the clear pool. Part of the Sawmill Complex, Sawmill activity follows periods of 'Sawmill mode' and grows quiet during the less common 'Penta-Churn mode'.</p> <p>Sawmill Geyser has an average temperate of 138°F (58.9°C), an average pH of 7.5, and an average conductivity of 2157 uS/cm.</p> <p>Sawmill Geyser's eruptions were highly variable, some lasting only 9 minutes while others may last over 4 hours. Sawmill received its name because water spins in its crater as it erupts looking somewhat like the rotating circular blade of a lumber mill.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

        "notes": "Silex Spring\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/silex-spring.htm\n\n<p>Silex Spring is named for the large amount of silica found in and around this feature. Silex is Latin for silica. Silica comes from the underlying volcanic rocks, which the hot waters dissolve. This silica is then deposited as sinter, which lines the pool and forms terraces along the runoff channels.</p> <p>The large runoff channels the boardwalk followed from the parking lot are formed from Silex Spring. Thermophiles thrive in these hot waters, which in turn give the channels such a variety of textures and colors. Silex Spring has an average temperate of 174.7°F (79.3°C), an average pH of 8.4, and an average conductivity of 2000 uS/cm. It last erupted in 2006.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

An active geyser since the early years of the park, Solitary Geyser is a clear, blue pool with a geyserite rim.

Stay on the most obvious trail to the top ridge. Follow the ridge line to the southwest in the direction of the cliff outcrop you saw from below. Several wildlife trailscut across below the top of the ridge. Be careful not to get off track on the wildlife trails. There are magnificent view across the valley and the Absaroka Range. Descend the way you came up. <b>CAUTION:</b> Grizzly bears frequent this area. This strenuous, high elevation trail is not recommended for persons with heart and/or respiratory problems. This trail is not a part of the longer Specimen Ridge Trail. The Petrified Trees of Specimen Ridge is a separate, unmaintained and unmarked route.

Its frequent “minor phase” eruptions eject water 10 to 40 feet high.</p> <p>For hours following its rare 3 to 40 minute major eruptions, Steamboat thunders with steam. Full eruptions are unpredictable.</p> <p>Steamboat Geyser and Cistern are linked underground, confirmed in 1983 when Cistern Spring began emptying after each major eruption of Steamboat.</p> <p>Only Waimangu Geyser in New Zealand has rocketed to greater heights—but not in more than one hundred years. In Yellowstone National Park's recorded history, only two other geysers have exceeded Steamboat in size: Excelsior Geyser in Midway Geyser Basin and Sapphire Pool in Biscuit Basin.</p> <h2>Eruption History Since 2000</h2> <ul> <li>10 in 2022 ( as of November 17)</li> <li>20 in 2021</li> <li>48 in 2020</li> <li>48 in 2019</li> <li>32 in 2018</li> <li>1 in 2014 (9/3)</li> <li>1 in 2013 (7/31)</li> <li>1 in 2007 (2/21)</li> <li>1 in 2005 (5/23)</li> <li>3 in 2003 (3/26, 4/27, and 10/22)</li> <li>2 in 2002 (4/26 and 9/13)</li> <li>1 in 2000 (5/22)</li> </ul> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Norris Geyser Basin</h2> <p>Norris Geyser Basin is one of the hottest and most acidic of Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. It is outside of the most recent Yellowstone caldera, but inside the first and largest caldera. It sits on the intersection of three major faults and is a very active earthquake area.</p> <p>Each year, new hot springs and geysers appear while others become dormant. Geologic events trigger many of these changes. Even small earthquakes can alter hydrothermal behavior. This sudden activity is known as a “thermal disturbance” and can last a few days, or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to “normal.”</p> <p>No one fully understands why this happens. Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. The water chemistry changes as the water levels of underground hot water reservoirs fluctuates.</p> <p>Although Norris is known for its acid features, it also have alkaline hot springs and geysers. As underground water and chemistry shift suddenly, they could contribute to dramatic changes in minerals and pH.</p> <h2>Parking</h2> <p>Parking at Norris Geyser Basin is extremely limited, especially with the recent activity of Steamboat Geyser. Please follow all posted signs or ranger directions. Be prepared to have to come back at a different time of day. Park at your our risk. When Steamboat Geyser erupts, dissolved minerals in the spray can damage glass and paint on your vehicle.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

Sulphur Caldron's turbulent waters have a pH of approximately 1-2, which is similar to car battery acid or stomach fluids. <br /><br />Its name comes from the large amounts of free sulfur in its waters.</p><h3>Hot Springs</h3><p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions. <br /><br />Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below. <br /><br />This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p><h3>The Smell</h3><p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area's smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas. <br /><br />Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p><h3>Mud Volcano Area</h3><p>The Mud Volcano area has many mudpots and hillsides strewn with trees cooked by steam. The hydrothermal features here are some of the most acidic in the park.<br /><br />Mud Volcano is near the greatest uplift and sinking of the Yellowstone Caldera floor. Many faults converge here and earthquakes are common.<br /><br />The areas surrounding the Mud Volcano vent and the other major vent near Old Faithful are called resurgent domes. Resurgent domes are active ground deformation, where the land moves up or down with the fluctuation of the magma chamber below. Scientists monitor these domes closely for information about ongoing volcanic activity.</p><h3>Use Caution in Thermal Areas</h3><p>- Stay on boardwalks and trails.<br />- Thermal water can severely burn you.<br />- Never run, push, or shove.<br />- Supervise children at all times.<br /><br />**You are responsible for your safety.**<br /><br />**Think Safety, Act Safely.

Instead, it is a geyser that has formed since the 1959 Hebgen Lake Earthquake. It erupts every three to six hours with a jet of water reaching up to 15 feet (4.6 m) in height and lasting up to 20 minutes.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam.

Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Due to the constant, highly active boiling, the spikes in activity that shoot a large amount of water out of the pool are not considered eruptions and the feature remains a hot spring.</p> <p>Tortoise Shell Spring has an average temperate of 195.4°F (90.8°C), an average pH of 8.7, and an average conductivity of 2195 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground.

Most of what are called the “boundary lands” was purchased from willing owners; the rest was taken by eminent domain. But the town of Cinnabar had been abandoned long before. Construction of the branch line from Livingston in 1883 made Cinnabar a hub for passengers and freight until the last three miles to the park entrance were built 20 years later.</p> <p>Nothing remains of the town today except archeological evidence through which we can learn about the lives of its residents in the late 1800s.</p> <p>To prevent impacts to archeological resources during a native plant restoration project planned for the boundary lands area, it was necessary to document where such resources were located. The Montana-Yellowstone Archeological Project (MYAP), a collaboration between the University of Montana and the National Park Service, surveyed about 3,000 acres and confirmed the location of the Cinnabar depot, excavated the blacksmith shop, and a likely foundation of a hotel. Historical artifacts on site included a railroad sign and revolver bullets.</p> <p>The MYAP team also documented sites with prehistoric components, including a tipi ring cluster approximately 5,000 years old—one of the oldest known in the Northern Plains. They identified a total of 18 stone circles and salvaged five prehistoric fire pits that were eroding out of the banks of the Yellowstone River downstream from Cinnabar. These were probably last used by the Pelican Lake culture that lived there 2,000 years ago.</p>",

Swimming in park rivers is not recommended. River crossings are hazardous.</p> <p><b>Lightning Safety</b></p> <p>During thunderstorms, descend to lower elevation, avoid open areas and isolated tall trees. Assume lightning position: feet together, crouch on foam pad or sit on pack, hands over ears.</p> <p><b>Regulations</b></p> <ul> <li>Leave What You Find: Do not collect anything from the park.</li> <li>No Pets: No pets on trail. Obtain service animal regulations at backcountry offices.</li> <li>No Hunting: No hunting or discharge of firearms.</li> <li>No Motorized Vehicles: No motorized vehicles on trails.</li> <li>Wheeled Vehicles Restricted: No bicycles, strollers, or wheeled vehicles (except wheelchairs), except where specified.</li> </ul> <p><b>In an emergency, dial 9-1-1 or contact the nearest ranger station. </b></p> <h2>Animals are Dangerous</h2> <ul> <li>Do not approach or feed any animal.</li> <li>Bison and elk have injured people.</li> <li>Stay 100 yards (91 m) from bears and wolves.</li> <li>Stay 25 yards (23 m) from all other animals.</li> </ul> <h2>Be Prepared for a Bear Encounter</h2> <p>Grizzly and black bears inhabit all of Yellowstone National Park.</p> <p><b>Be Alert:</b> Watch for signs of bear activity: scratches in trees, tracks, scat, or dig sites. Avoid dead animals.</p> <p><b>Make Noise:</b> Avoid surprising a bear by calling out and clapping your hands at regular intervals to make your presence known.</p> <p><b>Carry Bear Spray:</b> Carry bear spray and know how to use it. Keep it immediately available, not inside your pack.</p> <p><b>Hike in Groups:</b> Travel in groups of 3 or more is recommended. Stay with your group at all times.</p> <h2>What to do...</h2> <p><b>If You Encounter a Bear:</b> Stay calm, do not run. Quietly detour or back away; stop if this seems to agitate the bear. Stay at least 100 yards (91 m) from bears. Do NOT feed bears or other animals.</p> <p><b>If a Bear Charges You:</b> Stand still, do not run. Stand your ground and use your bear spray. Spray when the bear is 60 feet (18 m) away or closer. If a bear charges, it may be a bluff charge.</p> <p><b>If a Bear Makes Contact:</b> Drop to the ground; play dead. Lie face down and clasp your hands over the back of your neck; stay still and silent. Wait several minutes after the bear leaves before getting up and leaving the area.</p>",

Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Right outside the thin geyserite rims, shallow pools of water are full of orange thermophiles. The runoff then joins another runoff channel and yellow thermophiles begin to grow here.

        "notes": "Upper Terrace Trailhead\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/upper-terrace-trailhead.htm\n\n<p>This trailhead leads out to the top of Mammoth Hot Springs, with close-up views of Dryad Spring, Canary Spring, Grassy Spring, and Cupid Spring along boardwalks. The boardwalks near Cupid Spring begin descending down through the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces, connecting to the Lower Terraces.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Transitions from asphalt walkways to boardwalks may require assistance. Some sections of boardwalk are wheelchair-accessible. The rest of the area has stairs or steep grades due to terrain. Distance from parking in front of Liberty Cap to the end of the boardwalk at Palette Spring is approximately 135 yards.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p> <h2>Upper Terrace Loop Ski and Snowshoe Trail</h2> <p>The Upper Terrace Loop Ski Trail is a groomed 1.5-mile (2.4-km) loop that ranges from easy to more difficult due to a steep downhill section if traveled to the right (counter-clockwise) from the trailhead.</p> <p>This loop begins at the Upper Terrace parking area. It is easiest if skied beginning to the left (clockwise). A moderate climb leads to views of hot springs, terraces, the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District, and the surrounding mountains. At the top of the climb, a trail veers off to the southwest, which connects with the Snow Pass Trail. The Terrace Loop Trail descends past more hot springs before completing the circuit. Since snow depths here are less than in the mountains above, wintering elk and deer are occasionally sighted.</p> <p><b>Notes:</b></p> <ul> <li>Bison and elk frequent this trail. Federal regulations require you to stay at least 100 yards (91 m) away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards (23 m) away from bison and all other wild animals.</li> <li>There are thermal areas along this trail and some areas do not hold snow. Stay on boardwalks and designated ski trails. The ground is unstable in hydrothermal areas.</li> </ul>",

Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Windproof, hooded outer layer</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool or other insulated garments underneath</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool or synthetic trousers</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool or synthetic long underwear</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</span></p> <h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winter Hazards</span></h2> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Check weather and avalanche forecasts.

The site was excavated because it was at high risk of erosion, and that work revealed evidence of a 9,350-year-old camp likely occupied by several families. People used this area while hunting a wide variety of game, including bison, sheep, bear, elk, deer, felines, rabbits, birds, and other small game, gathering plants for food and medicine, and making tools and clothes.</p> <p>Artifacts dating to 3,000 years ago have also been discovered on islands in the lake, leading some archeologists to speculate that indigenous peoples used watercraft to travel on the lake, or crossed over on the frozen lake.</p>",

Its deepest spot is about 410 feet; its average depth is 140 feet. The lake’s basin has an estimated capacity of 12,095,264 acre-feet of water. Because its annual outflow is about 1,100,000 acre-feet, the lake’s water is completely replaced only about every eight to ten years. Since 1952, the annual water level fluctuation has been less than six feet.</p> <h2>Swimming and Soaking</h2> <p>Swimming is not recommended in Yellowstone, and is occasionally prohibited, because most lakes and streams are dangerously cold. Firehole Canyon, near Madison Junction, has a swimming area popular in summer.</p> <p>During late summer, Yellowstone Lake becomes thermally stratified with several water layers having different temperatures. The topmost layer rarely exceeds 66°F, and the lower layers are much colder.</p> <p>Because of the extremely cold water, survival time for anyone in the lake is estimated to be only 20 to 30 minutes. In winter, ice thickness on Yellowstone Lake varies from a few inches to more than two feet with many feet of snow on top of the ice.</p> <h2>Anticipate Potential Hazards</h2> <ul> <li>Observe safe distances and settings for selfies.</li> <li>Stay behind fencing, guard rails, and ledges.</li> <li>Use caution; park waters are cold and fast.</li> <li>Show patience and courtesy to other people.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think Safety, Act Safely.

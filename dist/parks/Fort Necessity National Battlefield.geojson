This location is open seasonally and includes a ¼ mile walking trail and interpretive signs.</p> <p>The battle on July 9, 1755 did not go well for the British under General Braddock’s command. After a four-hour fight Braddock was shot in the lung and he called a retreat. The army had taken heavy casualties and limped back along the road they had just built. Four nights later the demoralized general died.</p> <p>Fearing that their enemies, the French and their American Indian allies, might take Braddock’s body if they could find it, they buried him in the middle of the earthen road to hide his grave.</p> <p>About fifty years later, workers fixing the road found his remains and moved them a short distance to a new burial spot. </p> <p>Today visitors can see both the original burial location and his final resting spot.

It is the story of the industrialists and the workers who pushed an infant industry to it ultimate limits and in doing so pushed the world into the Age of Steel. Rivers of Steel NHA celebrates the region's industrial history, the landscape that fueled it, and the hardworking people who made it possible, linking the communities of the region through their shared cultural and industrial heritage. <br /> <br /> Created over eons, as water carved away layers of the Allegheny Plateau, southwestern Pennsylvania’s hilly topography set the stage for entrepreneurs. Over time, this land and the local economy continued to transform. Colonial agriculture gave way to boat building and river trade. Business shifted from commerce to industry, making use of the region’s natural resources for glassmaking, coal mining, and small scale iron production, which laid the groundwork for the “Big Steel” era of the 20th century. Industries waxed and waned – each innovating and building upon the one that preceded it – before evolving into today’s dynamic landscape.<br /> <br /> The eight-county region of Rivers of Steel NHA is a National Heritage Area and one of 12 state-desigated Heritage Areas in Pennsylvania. It is managed by the <a href=\"https://riversofsteel.com/about/\">Rivers of Steel Heritage Corporation</a>, a nonprofit that works in partnership with the National Park Service and the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Through public-private partnerships, Rivers of Steel supports heritage conservation, heritage tourism, and outdoor recreation as a means to foster economic redevelopment and enhance cultural engagement.<br /> <br /> <strong>Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area includes the following historic sites:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://riversofsteel.com/attractions/carrie-furnaces/\">Carrie Blast Furnaces National Historic Landmark,</a> Rankin & Swissvale, PA</li> <li><a href=\"https://riversofsteel.com/attractions/bost-building/\">The Bost Building National Historic Landmark</a>, Homestead, PA</li> <li><a href=\"https://riversofsteel.com/attractions/pump-house/\">The Pump House</a>, site of the 1892 Battle of Homestead, Munhall, PA</li> <li><a href=\"https://riversofsteel.com/attractions/w-a-young-sons-foundry-and-machine-shop/\">W.A.

Due to the high water table, the meadow is clear of large trees, which are unable to be supported in the wet soil.<br /> <br /> In 1754 George Washington selected The Great Meadows for the location of a supply stockade because of it's location being half way between Cumberland, MD and the Forks of the Ohio, but also because it was a place where cattle could graze. Tactically, it was well placed because due to the weapons of the time, if the attackers were to move on the location, they would need to come into the Meadow and expose themselves to defender fire.<br /> <br /> This supply stockade would be later reinforced when George Washington and his forces could no longer retreat from the French advances after The Jumonville Affair. A large redoubt, or breastworks were built for the men to stand behind and fire, creating what would become \"a fort of necessity\", the Fort Necessity we know of today.",

All the travelers waited for the dinner bell before entering the dining room. They eat together at one big long table with the food being placed on platters in the center of the table.

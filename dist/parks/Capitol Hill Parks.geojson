A campaign among freed slaves raised $18,000 for the memorial. Frederick Douglass delivered the keynote speech at the monument's dedication on April 14, 1876, which was attended by President Ulysses S. Grant and other political figures. The Emancipation Monument served as the primary national memorial to Lincoln until 1922, when the Lincoln Memorial was dedicated in West Potomac Park. Sculptor Thomas Ball depicted a life-size figure of Abraham Lincoln, extending one hand over a kneeling African American man while holding a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation in the other hand. The former slave is depicted as rising, with broken shackles on his wrists. The figure was modeled after Archer Alexander, the last Missouri enslaved man captured under the Fugitive Slave Law.</p> <h4>Inscriptions</h4> <h4>Front</h4> <p>FREEDOM's MEMORIAL<br /> In Grateful Memory of<br /> ABRAHAM LINCOLN<br /> This monument was erected<br /> by the western sanitary commission<br /> of Saint Louis MO:<br /> With funds contributed solely by<br /> emancipated citizens of the United States<br /> Declared free by his proclamation<br /> January 1st A.D. 1863.<br /> The first contribution of five dollars was made by Charlotte Scott a freed woman of Virginia<br /> Being her first earnings in freedom<br /> And consecrated<br /> By her suggestion and request<br /> On the day she heard of President Lincoln's death<br /> To build a monument to his memory</p> <h4>Back</h4> <p>And upon this Act<br /> Sincerely believed to be an act of justice<br /> Warranted by the constitution<br /> Upon military necessity<br /> I invoke<br /> The considerate judgement of mankind<br /> And<br /> The gracious favor of almighty God<br /> A.

In 1885, the park was memorialized and named after Charles J. Folger, Secretary of the Treasury in the presidential administration of Chester A. Arthur. Folger had died while still in office in 1884 .<br /> <br /> The land that became Folger Park was acquired in 1791 by the Federal Government from Daniel Carroll of Duddington to be used as street rights-of-way. Surveyor Andrew Ellicott modified Pierre L'Enfant's 1791 \"Historic Plan of Washington, District of Columbia\" and reserved it as open space.<br /> <br /> In 1871, nuns established Providence Hospital in a house on the square south of the park site, at 2nd and D Streets. Folger Park for years was referred to as The Square North of Providence Hospital.<br /> <br /> The park contains much of the city's rich architectural history. A cast iron fence was added in 1881 in the form of fasces, and three years later the planting of 1000 ornamental trees gave the site beautiful scenery. Paved asphalt walkways replaced old gravel in the early 1900's. You can have lunch on one of the unique \"fountain benches\" fashioned after the 1935 \"Drinking Fountain and Bench\" plan.</p>",

        "notes": "Lincoln Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/lincoln-park.htm\n\n<p>One of the oldest public parks in Washington, DC, the land was designated as a public park on the original 1791 L'Enfant plan for the city. During the Civil War, a temporary hospital, known as \"Lincoln Hospital\" was constructed on the site for wounded Union soldiers. Following the war, the army removed the hospital and Congress appropriated funds to improve the park with flowers, trees and pathways. Then as now, it remains one of the most popular city parks on Capitol Hill.</p> <p><br /> Lincoln Park is the largest of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cahi/index.htm\">Capitol Hill Parks</a> in Washington, D.C., and features monuments to two leaders: <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">President Abraham Lincoln</a> and educator and civil rights leader <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/mamc/index.htm\">Mary McLeod Bethune</a>. The square was part of Pierre L’Enfant’s original 1791 plan for the city and was intended for public use.<br /> <br /> During the Civil War, the square was used as a hospital for wounded troops, whom poet Walt Whitman visited on occasion. When Congress officially named the park Lincoln Square in 1867, it was the first site to bear the name of the assassinated president.<br /> <br /> To honor Lincoln's memory, Charlotte Scott, a formerly enslaved woman living in Virginia, used the first $5 she earned as a freedperson to start a fundraising campaign to build a statue in Lincoln Park. Donations were only accepted from formerly enslaved persons, primarily <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/afam/index.htm\">African American veterans</a>, though a white-run war relief organization called the Western Sanitary Commission coordinated the effort Ms. Scott started. </p> <p>Designed by Thomas Ball, the statue features President Lincoln in his characteristic frock coat, holding the Emancipation Proclamation before a kneeling black man. Modeled after Archer Alexander, the last person captured under the Fugitive Slave Act, the black man’s arm is extended to show his shackles have been broken.<br /> <br /> The memorial statue, known as the Emancipation Memorial, was placed in the park in 1876 and dedicated on April 14<sup>th</sup>, the 11<sup>th</sup> anniversary of President Lincoln’s death, with over 25,000 people in attendance. <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a> delivered the keynote address before <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/people/ulysses-s-grant.htm\">President Ulysses S. Grant</a>, his cabinet, and members of Congress.<br /> <br /> While Lincoln Park became a major tourist attraction through the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, the statue of Lincoln has not been met with universal acclaim. For many people, including Frederick Douglass, the monument perpetuated negative stereotypes about African Americans.<br /> <br /> In 1959, Congress authorized the National Council of Negro Women, Inc. (NCNW) to build a memorial the organization's founder and first president, Mary McLeod Bethune. Originally conceived to be dedicated in 1963, on the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, the urgency of the Civil Rights Movement sidelined the statue project. When it was unveiled in 1974 on the 99th anniversary of Bethune's birth, the Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial was the first statue of a woman and the first statue of an African American, on public park land in Washington, D.C. The Emancipation Memorial originally faced west toward the U.S. Capitol until it was rotated east in 1974 to face Bethune's Memorial.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Content used with permission from Eastern National’s <a href=\"http://generalstore.eparks.com/store/product/92424/Guidebook-to-African-American-History-in-the-National-Parks/\">Guidebook to African American History in National Parks.</a></strong></p>",

This is a fitting address for a park memorializing distinguished soldier Francis Marion who hailed from South Carolina and bravely fought during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/americanrevolution/index.htm\">American Revolution</a>. With its interesting walkways and beautiful vegetation, it's the perfect place to take the kids for a stroll to the playground, or enjoy a snack in the grass under any of many ornamental trees.<br /> <br /> Marion Park was first established as open ground, dating back to the original plans for the city created by Pierre L'Enfant in 1791. Also included in updated plans from Andrew Ellicott, this reservation has served continuously as a park since its first improvements in 1885. One of the larger parks in the Capitol Hill area, dating back to 1764 the tract of land was known as Houp's Addition, was originally owned by Jonathan Slater. In 1791, Mr. Slater sold the tract to William Prout, who then had to turn over the land to the federal government soon after. Improvements that were made by 1886 gave the park an ornamental elegance in the vastly developing neighborhood. In the center of the park used to stand a large vase that was filled with tropical flowers every summer. The \"Large Hilton Iron Vase\" was used to direct the flow of traffic through the park due to the carriage paths that created beautiful patterns from a bird's eye view. In 1963, the vase was removed, and the traffic patterns were redirected outside of the boundaries of Marion Park. Today, the site provides hours of serenity with the variety of trees and other vegetation. There is a play area available in one quadrant of the park that is easily accessible for toddlers.</p>",

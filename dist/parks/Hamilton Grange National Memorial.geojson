Purchased by Samuel Fraunces in 1762, it operated as boarding house with a bar until the 1840s.In August 1775, Alexander Hamilton began to dismantle British cannons at the battery. In response The British ship HNS Asia fired a cannon ball blasted through the roof of the Tavern. The sons of Liberty convened here as they secretly planned and plotted against the British government. In 1783 Washington chose the Tavern's Long Room as the site to bid farewell to his officers. After the Revolutionary War, the building held the first offices for the Departments of Foreign Affairs, War and Treasury (1785-1788). Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr both attended a dinner hosted by the Society of the Cincinnati on July 4th, 1804, a week before their famous duel.In 1900 the building was under threat of demolition, the city used its rights of eminent domain to designate the building as a city park in 1903. Since 1907, the Fraunces Tavern Museum on the second and third floors has helped to interpret the Fraunces Tavern and the collection of artifacts that it holds. The museum comprises nine galleries.</p> <h3>Fraunces Tavern Museum</h3> <p>Fraunces Tavern is a national historic landmark, museum, in New York City, situated at 54 Pearl Street at the corner of Broad Street. The location played a prominent role in pre-Revolution, American Revolution and post-Revolution history, serving as a headquarters for George Washington, a venue for peace negotiations with the British</p>",

        "notes": "Hamilton Grange Architecture\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/hamilton-grange-architecture.htm\n\n<p paraeid=\"{a74b1950-620a-492b-bc4b-5a4abea52582}{19}\" paraid=\"561638038\">Hamilton may have never imagined that in the 21st century, his home would be surrounded by tall buildings, and that you'd be visiting his home with a device in your hand, that can take something called a picture, and send that picture to anyone in the world, instantly. The world around The Grange may have changed, but this structure is a faithful call-back to the past.</p> <h3 paraeid=\"{a74b1950-620a-492b-bc4b-5a4abea52582}{19}\" paraid=\"561638038\">Federal Style</h3> <p paraeid=\"{a74b1950-620a-492b-bc4b-5a4abea52582}{19}\" paraid=\"561638038\">The Grange was designed in the Federal style by architect John McComb, Jr., which was prominent in the United States between the 1780s and c.1830s. The Grange’s design reflected themes of balance and symmetry and was less ornate than previous architectural styles.  <br /> <br /> In order to get a better grasp on the symmetry of this structure, take a walk around the house and try to answer the question, \"what elements are symmetrical on this house?\" Look for windows, doors, porches, stairways, shutters, balustrades, and more. By walking around the house, you will notice four chimneys standing above the house. You may be surprised to learn that two of these chimneys are fake! They were constructed with the house in order to maintain the symmetrical theme. </p> <h3 paraeid=\"{a74b1950-620a-492b-bc4b-5a4abea52582}{19}\" paraid=\"561638038\">What is original?</h3> <p>On this home, many of the features are original, including the siding, windowpanes, doors, chimneys, and balustrades. However, extensive renovations are required to keep the home in good condition. Therefore, the porches, stairs, roof, shutters, and many other small features have been replaced throughout the years. Because the home has also been moved twice, the foundation is also new as of 2008. </p> <h3>A Changing Neigborhood</h3> <p>Look around you. Beyond the borders of St. Nicholas park is a bustling city. Cars, trucks, trains and planes whiz by Hamilton Grange National Memorial all day. The soundscape of Hamilton Grange National Memorial is therefore changed. Standing here, you cannot deny that you are in the 21st century.</p> <br /> But, a<span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">t the time of the home’s construction, Harlem was the countryside, and the Grange was built on a hill. For a moment, imagine that the sounds of the 21st century fade away, and instead, you can hear birdsong, the babbling of brooks, the rustling of leaves, and the sound of a wagon on a dirt path. If you scanned the distance, you can see the Hudson and the Harlem rivers. Bucolic hills rolled into the distance... This is the uptown that Hamilton knew. <br /> <br /> Hamilton and his family used this home primarily in the warmer months, when the threat of transmissible illness was high in the bustling downtown of Manhattan. Hamilton's enjoyment of this home was cut short in 1804, when the fateful duel with Burr would lead Hamilton to his untimely death. However, Eliza would continue to occupy The Grange until 1833, when she sold it and moved to Washington, DC, with her daughter.</span><br />   <p paraeid=\"{a74b1950-620a-492b-bc4b-5a4abea52582}{81}\" paraid=\"1248033539\">Hamilton used the home until his untimely death in a duel in 1804. After Hamilton's passing, his friends created a secret fund that assisted Eliza in keeping The Grange. In 1833, however, Eliza moved to Washington D.C. and sold the home. In the years that followed, the building had several owners and was physically moved twice to adapt to the demands of the changing city. It has been used as a private residence, church, museum, and national memorial! </p>",

In 1889, however, the building was moved to 141st Street and Convent Avenue. If you turn towards your left at this spot and look north down Convent Ave, where you see the sign for 143rd Street, on the left-hand side of the avenue is where The Grange would have approximately stood.</p> <p paraeid=\"{d91022db-b651-4029-8966-a606e2ba0c4c}{212}\" paraid=\"1471899919\">In the nineteenth century, settlement in New York City continued to expand from the southern tip of Manhattan to the north. In 1889, The Grange had to be moved for the creation of 143rd Street. A real estate developer purchased and donated the home to St. Luke's Episcopal Church, and it was moved to this location. The front and rear porches were removed, and the house was lifted off its foundation and drawn by horses to the new site. At the time, the congregation was constructing a new church and they used The Grange to conduct services. Later in 1924, the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society purchased the home and turned it into a museum. Furniture and decorative objects associated with the family were put on display. </p> <p paraeid=\"{d91022db-b651-4029-8966-a606e2ba0c4c}{250}\" paraid=\"1916448374\">While the building was saved, the original intent of Hamilton and the architect was altered. The building was repositioned at a new angle and many changes were made including the creation of an entrance through a side window. When the National Park Service (NPS) acquired The Grange in 1962, the building had been sandwiched between St. Luke's Church and an apartment building. The NPS agreed to administer The Grange, with the stipulation that it be allowed to move the building to a place where it could be properly restored. In 2008, the building was moved to its current location at St. Nicholas Park.  </p>",

Hamilton wrote specific instructions for a circular garden in front of The Grange. The flowers included tulips, lilies, hyacinths, and roses.<br /> <br /> Reportedly, Alexander Hamilton planted 13 sweet gum trees to represent the 13 original colonies. New York City has a great climate for sweet gum trees. They thrive near swamps and springs and these features were common in the Harlem area in the early-19th century. While the original trees are gone, the current trees are a living memorial to Hamilton’s legacy.  </p>",

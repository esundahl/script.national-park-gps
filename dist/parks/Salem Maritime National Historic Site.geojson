        "notes": "Colonial Revival Garden\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/garden.htm\n\n<p>While Elizabeth and Elias Derby probably never had a garden behind the brick house that Richard Derby built them, they did have large, elaborate gardens both at their Danvers country estate “Oak Hill” and at their 1798 mansion in downtown Salem. Elias Hasket Derby loved “interesting” plants, and instructed the captains of his ships to bring him plants from their voyages around the world.</p> <p>The 18th century garden at Salem Maritime National Historic Site was designed in 1990 by Suzanne Gentiluomo, a horticultural expert specializing in historic gardens. With fellow volunteer Joel Ohringer, she created a formal garden typical of those favored by wealthy eighteenth century merchants.</p> <p>Formal gardens evolved from medieval European palace gardens. Although they were old-fashioned for the late eighteenth century, formal gardens were still common in New England, especially in towns where space was limited. The formal garden behind the Derby House is divided into beds, or parterres d’ broderie (embroidered plots), edged with germander hedges and separated by crushed gravel walkways. Within each bed, vegetables, flowers and herbs all grow together. A traditional parterre was defined by its hedges, so the arrangement of “filler” plants was less important.</p> <p>The parterres are surrounded by an orchard of fruit trees, leading to a grape arbor at the back of the garden. The entire yard is enclosed by a sturdy fence to keep out wandering livestock. A formal garden symbolized the triumph of Godly order over the diabolical chaos of Nature, which had to be kept at bay with a strong barrier.</p> <p>This Colonial Revival Garden contains more than 150 varieties of heirloom annuals, perennials and bulbs, all documented to 1798 or earlier. Some are native to North America, although many were imported. You may even recognize some roadside weeds! The 18th century merchant who owned this garden would have been an enthusiastic plant collector, rather like Elias Hasket Derby.</p>",

S. Customs Service in 1789. This Custom House was built in 1819 and housed offices for the officers of the U.S. Customs Service, as well as an attached warehouse, the Public Stores, used for the storage of bonded and impounded cargo.<br /> <br /> The Custom House symbolized the Federal Government's presence in Salem, requiring the architects to design an impressive building. High ceilings, a sweeping staircase, and beautifully carved woodwork all contribute to a feeling of strength and stability. The Salem Custom House was used by the U. S. Customs Service into the 1930s and the furnishings reflect the long use of the building.<br /> <br /> In 1826, a wooden eagle was placed on the roof. It was carved by Salem craftsman Joseph True, and its original cost was $50.00. In 2004, the original wooden eagle was replaced with a fiberglass replica. After undergoing several years of conservation work, the original wooden eagle is on display inside the Custom House.<br /> <br /> Today, the U.S. Custom House in Salem contains exhibits on the tools of the Custom Service, the work of the Customs inspectors, and the office of Nathaniel Hawthorne, the famous American author whose three-year-long stint in the Salem Custom House inspired his classic novel, <em>The Scarlet Letter.</em>",

They lived here with their seven children and at least two enslaved people of African descent.<br /> <br /> Hasket, Elizabeth, and their children lived here during most of the Revolutionary War. As part of the war effort, Hasket converted many of his family's cargo vessels to privateers. The wealth that the Derbys amassed from privateering was the foundation of the great East India trade that Hasket and others pioneered after the Revolution.</p> <p>The Derbys sold the \"little brick house\" as Hasket called it, in 1796, to Capt. Henry Prince who built the West India Goods Store next to the house in the early 1800s. The Princes lived in the house until 1827. After that time, the house had numerous owners during the remainder of the 19th century. For a while, it was used as a tenement house, and multiple families lived in the building. Many of those families were members of the Polish community who came to work in the nearby mills.</p> <p>In the early twentieth century, the Derby House was purchased by the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA), now <a href=\"http://www.historicnewengland.org/\">Historic New England</a>, who restored the home to its 18th century grandeur.

In the words of the 1870 report of the lighthouse board to the U.S. Treasury, the Derby Wharf Light, along with the Hospital Point Light in Beverly, Massachusetts, and Fort Pickering Light Station on Winter Island in Salem, were designed to “mark the main channel leading into this anchorage, with the view to it becoming a harbor of refuge which may be safely entered at any time.”<br /> <br /> Originally, the light was powered by an oil lamp shining through a Fresnel lens. Fresnel lenses are designed to focus and intensify light, and are rated by orders, from first order lenses that are used in the largest seacoast lights and are almost nine feet tall, to sixth order lights that are about 17 inches tall. For many years, Derby Wharf Light had one of only 17 sixth-order Fresnel lenses in the United States. Today, the 300-candlepower light is solar-driven and flashes red every six seconds.<br /> <br /> One of four lighthouses used to navigate Salem Sound, the Derby Wharf Light Station is the wharf's only original surviving structure. The lighthouse is located on the end of Derby Wharf. It is approximately twelve feet square and about 20 feet high from the base to the top of the cupola.</p>",

The cargo brought back to Salem consisted of pepper, silk, sugar, coffee, ale, sherry, tin, salt, cheese, candles, and other goods and merchandise.<br /> <br /> On September 5, 1812, <em>Friendship</em> was returning from Archangel, Russia, when the ship was captured by the British sloop of war HMS Rosamond. The War of 1812 between the British and the United States began while <em>Friendship</em> was in Archangel, Russia. The war had started in June, but the captain and crew were unaware of that fact and set off for Salem, only to be captured in the Atlantic Ocean and taken as a prize of war.

It is a remarkable example of a middle-class family home of the 17th and 18th centuries. The taller section of the building is the original house. It still has its original pointed, or peaked, roof and its original brick chimney. When the house was first built, it only had a single room on the first floor, called the hall, a single room on the second floor (the hall chamber), an attic, and a shallow root cellar. Later owners added a kitchen on the back of the house, and a smaller addition on the side that has a parlor on the first floor and a chamber on the second.<br /> <br /> The house is named after Sarah Narbonne, whose grandfather Jonathan Andrews purchased the house in 1780. Sarah was born in the Narbonne house, and lived there for her entire life, which stretched nearly the length of the 19th century. She died in 1895 at the age of 101, and her unmarried daughter Mary continued to live in the house until her death in 1905.<br /> <br /> In 1963, the National Park Service purchased the historic building from the family of Mary Narbonne’s nephew Frank Hale. One of the things that makes this building so special is its history of nearly 300 years of continued occupation, 200 years of which are members of one family. In keeping with modern preservation practices, the Narbonne House has not been restored to one time period. Instead, Salem Maritime is preserving it as an architectural study house to show how the structure changed over the nearly 330 years of its existence.</p>",

At that time, Marblehead was the most successful fishing port in Massachusetts, and the codfish that were caught and dried on the flakes, or drying racks, on shore were shipped from Marblehead and Salem throughout the British empire to be traded for molasses and sugar in the Caribbean Islands, wine in Madeira, and finished goods like cloth, Chinese porcelain, books, and furniture in England.<br /> <br /> A warehouse was an important part of a merchant’s property, as it was where goods and equipment for the vessels were stored, repair work could be done for vessels, and the merchant often had his “counting house” or business office. During the Revolution, Pedrick commissioned <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/privateers-in-the-american-revolution.htm\">privateers </a>to capture British merchant vessels, and probably stored captured cargo in his store house. After the war was over, Pedrick, like most of the merchants in Marblehead and Salem, began participating in international trade until his death in 1802.<br /> <br /> In 1809, the warehouse was purchased by Captain William Story, a relative of Thomas Pedrick. Story had been the captain of <em>Friendship of Salem</em> for four years, and his purchase of the warehouse was part of his entry into the ranks of the merchant community. Story replaced the wooden dock in front of the warehouse with a more durable granite and earth wharf. Unfortunately, he was not as successful in his mercantile efforts as Pedrick had been, and was forced to sell the warehouse and wharf in 1820. Story returned to sea, and in 1827 became a Weigher and Gauger at the Salem Custom House until 1853, when he turned 80.<br /> <br /> After its purchase, the second floor of the Pedrick Store House continued to be used as a sail loft until 1904, operated from 1852 by the Graves Family, while the first floor was an office for the local ferry by the end of the 19th century.<br /> <br /> In 1904, the building was purchased by the Marblehead Transportation Company, who altered the building to support their inn and ferry business. In 1993, the building and wharf, then known as Tucker’s wharf, were purchased by the town of Marblehead. After plans for restoration of the building in place were unsuccessful, the National Park Service accepted the building in 2003, and began several years of conservation on the original 18th century timbers.",

The large hall on the second floor was the site of hundreds of weddings, dances, plays, and other social events in the Polish community. On the top floor, several apartments were built to house new immigrants until they could get permanently settled.<br /> <br /> As the twentieth century moved on, the St. Joseph Society became more of a social organization, regularly hosting dances and fielding baseball and basketball teams that played other youth teams in the region.<br /> <br /> By the 1980s, the Polish community had spread out all over the region as young men and women left Salem to find jobs. St. Joseph Hall was sold to the National Park Service in 1988, and has been renovated to house administrative and maintenance facilities. The front of the building has been restored to its original appearance, and today there is an exhibit on Salem’s Polish community in the front windows of St. Joseph Hall.",

It was used as a storage facility for scales and other equipment required to weigh cargo goods on ships. <br /> <br /> The scales were never used inside the building, but were carted and moved to the wharf and assembled alongside a vessel that had just returned. The goods were removed off of the ship, weighed, measured, and then duties were assessed on the cargo. Currently, the building contains interpretive exhibits of the 19th-century U.S. Customs Service with weighing and gauging equipment original to the building.</p>",

Captain Henry Prince (1764-1846) bought the Derby House in 1796 and built this structure in the early 1800s, listed in records as a \"store.\" <br /> <br /> The first documented use of this building as a West India Goods Store was in 1836. Prince sold items from the West Indies—molasses, sugar, coffee—as well as local produce and products. Engaging in mercantilism could be profitable, but was also risky. Captain Henry Prince's financial problems led to the auction of this store and his wife's inherited property.<br /> <br /> The structure underwent numerous changes throughout its history, including two moves, before it was rehabilitated in 1928 by the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now <a href=\"http://www.historicnewengland.org/\">Historic New England</a>). ",

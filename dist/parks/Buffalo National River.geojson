He married Sarah Arbaugh and built this homestead in 1882. The cabin and a variety of outbuildings remain, built by Beaver Jim or added or changed by succeeding owners. For instance, Beaver Jim had a stone and log cellar as early as 1898 that was used to store fruits and vegetables. The concrete version in place today replaced his cellar. The concrete outhouse, built in the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) replaced an earlier version. Exhibit panels describe the buildings and life on the farm.",

Boxley Grist Mill used the power of moving water to grind corn into meal and wheat into a flour, a service that was hard to come by in the rural Ozarks in the later 19<sup>th</sup> century. The Boxley Mill was owned by three generations of the Villines Family and in operation from the 1870s until the 1950’s when a major flood washed out a large portion of the millrace.<br /> <br /> After main use of the mill ceased, Clyde Villines began to transofrm the area, by creating fishing cabins for visting tourists. Tourists were able to rent a cabin and boats and enjoy spending time on the millpond. While the cabins may be small they had everything needed for a visitor, including a bed, a table and chairs. <br /> <br /> The mill is open to the public during ranger guided tours only.",

This bluff shelter is approximately 50 feet tall, 150 feet deep, and 260 feet long from end to end, and it was formed when a soft, soluble layer of rock was undercut by Clark Creek, leaving a harder upper rock layer as the shelter's \"ceiling.\" Archeological surveys indicate that this shelter was used by Native Americans approximately 2,000 years ago. Artifacts like lithic tools, woven basketry, and small corn cobs (the shelter's namesake) were excavated by University of Arkansas archeologists in 1931.",

The Collier family homesteaded one of the last parcels available along the Buffalo River in 1932, moving from Kentucky.<br /> <br /> The Homestead Act of 1862 allowed vast amounts of the public domain to be claimed by private citizens and was an attempt to encourage westward expansion. A homesteader had only to be the head of a household and at least 21 years of age to claim a 160 acre parcel of land. The homesteader had 5 years to make improvements to make a living on the land.<br /> <br /> Solomon “Sod” Collier, his wife Ida Mae and two of their seven children built the cabin and a life here. The family succeeded in fulfilling the homsteading requirements and received the \"patent\" on 40 acres in 1937. Sod and Ida Mae stayed until 1962. A brochure about the Colliers and the homestead is available at the Tyler Bend Visitor Center. ",

Using techniques similar to the built log homes back in Tennessee, the Parker brothers utilized the local red cedar logs to construct their home. These logs date back to the 1840s, indicating that this is the oldest log structure in the Buffalo National River area. <br /> <br /> This farmstead was continuously occupied for nearly 130 years by 9 different owners, starting with the Parkers and ending with the Hickmans in the early 1980s. Through the years, additions were made to the original cabin, and several outbuildings and farming structures were built around it, arranged roughly in a rectangle. An exhibit panel on-site maps the property and explains the purpose of each building.<br /> <br /> The Parker-Hickman Farmstead, located near Erbie Campground in Buffalo National River's Upper District, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 1987. The farmstead preserves a significant cultural landscape that reflects pioneer settlement and the evolution of farming and subsistence in the Ozarks over a period of 130 years.",

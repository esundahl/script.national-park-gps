The 117-foot white cylinder-shaped lighthouse is composed of steel, concrete, and brick, with a black base and lantern. To build this lighthouse on a 50-foot by 200-foot rocky outcrop was a tribute to the engineering of the time. In 1909, a Second Order Fresnel lens replaced the first, temporary Third Order fixed red light. Today, the unmanned lighthouse features a 300 mm Tideland Signal Acrylic Optic lens that runs on solar power. You can view the stunning old Second Order Fresnel lens at the Windigo Visitor Center.</p> <p>Learn about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/rock-of-ages-lighthouse.htm\">the history of the Rock of Ages Lighthouse</a>.</p> <p>Explore the <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/isro/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">History & Culture of Isle Royale National Park</a>.</p>",

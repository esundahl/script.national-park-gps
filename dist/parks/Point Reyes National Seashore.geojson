        "notes": "Abbotts Lagoon Beach\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-abbotts-lagoon-beach.htm\n\n<p>A 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) walk through coastal scrub, across a footbridge over a stream between two lagoons, and over sand dunes brings you to this ocean beach. The lagoons attract large numbers of migrating shorebirds in the fall, followed by the wintering ducks. Occasionally, peregrine falcons are seen selecting their meals amongst these tasty morsels. The sand dunes backing the beach are home to the threatened <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/birds_snowyplover.htm\">western snowy plover</a>. The eggs and young of this ground-nesting bird are easily destroyed. Be especially careful in this area during their nesting season, March 1–September 30.</p> <h2>Beach Safety</h2> <p><strong>Never turn your back to the ocean.</strong> Due to the frequently large surf, this is not a beach at which it is safe to play close to the water's edge, much less to go for a swim. The ocean water may be as low as 50°F (10°C). Hypothermia, sneaker waves, and rip currents are just a few beach hazards of which visitors should be aware while visiting Point Reyes Beaches. Please visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/safety_beaches.htm\">Safety Issues Associated with Beaches</a> page for more information.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/parkregulations.htm\">Park Regulations</a></h2> <ul> <li><strong>Glass</strong>: Glass containers are prohibited on all Point Reyes Beaches.</li> <li><strong>Take only pictures; leave only footprints</strong>: Almost everything one finds at Point Reyes' beaches is protected by law, including shells, rocks, fossils, flowers, and artifacts.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife</strong>: Do not chase or feed the gulls (or any other birds) and keep your distance from seals and sea lions.

        "notes": "Alamere Falls at Point Reyes National Seashore\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-alamere-falls.htm\n\n<p>Alamere Falls is a beautiful waterfall deep within the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/wilderness.htm\">Phillip Burton Wilderness</a>. The falls are a dramatic sight as water cascades over a ~40-foot-tall (~12 m) cliff onto the south end of Wildcat Beach. While no easy trek—<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hike-to-alamere-falls.htm\">a 13-mile (20 km) minimum round-trip hike</a> is required—this spectacular spot is a popular—and a sometimes overcrowded—visitor draw. Take note: it is also the site of multiple search-and-rescue operations each year. Beware of getting too close to cliff edges and be mindful of coastal erosion!</p> <h2>There is NO park-sanctioned \"Alamere Falls Trail\"</h2> <p><strong><font color=\"#990000\">Please take note!</font></strong> Many social media posts, websites, and older (and some newer) guide books reference an \"Alamere Falls Trail\" (also sometimes referred to as a \"shortcut to the falls\"). The \"Alamere Falls Trail\" is NOT a maintained trail, and poses many hazards to off-trail hikers—crumbling and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/safety.htm#CP_JUMP_726515\">eroding cliffs</a>, massive <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/safety.htm#CP_JUMP_726517\">poison oak</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/safety.htm#CP_JUMP_726518\">ticks</a>, and no cell phone service. Visitors who use this unmaintained trail may endanger themselves and rescuers, and inadvertently cause resource damage, such as trampling plants, which may lead to the death of the trampled plants. On an almost weekly basis, visitors get hurt scrambling down the heavily rutted route leading to the top of the falls or sliding down the crumbly cliff-face to get to the beach, sometimes requiring search and rescue teams to be mobilized. The National Park Service strongly advises visitors against using this unmaintained route. Please use the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/alamere_falls.htm#CP_JUMP_5829865\">recommended routes</a> described on Point Reyes National Seashore's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/alamere_falls.htm\">Alamere Falls</a> page to visit the falls. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/alamere_falls.htm#CP_JUMP_5818303\">Stay on designated trails.</a></p> <h2>Help Protect Wilderness Values</h2> <p>Wilderness areas are places of refuge—protected and managed to allow for relaxation, self-reliance, opportunities for solitude, and natural quiet.

The first U.S. Life-saving Service station at Point Reyes was built in 1889 along the unprotected Point Reyes Beach to aid ships that were stranded or wrecked along the shores of this peninsula that stretches 10 miles (16 km) into the Pacific Ocean. In 1927, operations were relocated to the new lifeboat station on the more protected Drakes Bay near Chimney Rock. From 1927 to 1968, the Pacific Area U.S. Coast Guard officers and crew members used motorized lifeboats to aid ships. However, during the World Wars, with the militarization efforts of the West Coast, the primary operations of the life-saving station shifted to coastal defense and harbor patrol.</p> <p>In 1968, the property was transferred to the National Park Service and Point Reyes National Seashore, which used the lifeboat station for park housing until it was restored in 1976. As a result of further restoration to the historic district, Point Reyes possesses the only surviving lifeboat station on the Pacific Coast with an intact marine railway.</p> <p>Visit the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/historyculture/stories_maritime_lifeboatstation.htm\">Lifeboat Station History at Point Reyes</a> page for more information.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/parkregulations.htm\">Park Regulations</a></h2> <ul> <li>Vehicles over 24 feet (7.3 meters) in length and vehicles pulling trailers with a combined length in excess of 24 feet (7.3 meters) are prohibited on Chimney Rock Road.</li> <li><strong>Take only pictures; leave only footprints:</strong> Almost everything one finds at Point Reyes is protected by law, including shells, rocks, fossils, flowers, and artifacts.</li> <li>Please only travel on authorized trails, respect posted signs, and practice <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/leavenotrace.htm\">Leave No Trace principles</a> when recreating in the park.</li> <li><strong>Pets</strong> are <u>not</u> permitted on any of the paths, trails, or driveways in the Chimney Rock area.

The waves of Drakes Bay are usually much smaller than those on the west-facing beaches of Point Reyes, so it's relatively safer for people to play along the water's edge.</p> <p>Limantour Spit is a long, narrow strand of sand, bound by Drakes Bay to the south and Estero de Limantour to the north. The estuary is a bountiful wildlife area. Scores of shorebirds feed in the wetlands and along the beaches during the fall. Ducks abound in winter. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/harbor_seals.htm\">Harbor seals</a> are often seen bobbing offshore in the gentle waves or basking in the sun's warmth at the western end of the spit.

Due to their unique physical stature and calm temperament, the Morgan Horse breed made for the perfect patrol partner. The ranch was dedicated in 1970 with the help of the Northern California Morgan Horse Association. At its height, the ranch maintained a herd of approximately 35 to 40 horses. As foals were born, mature animals trained at the ranch were transferred to other parks where they helped rangers patrol both backcountry and urban environments. For many years, classes were also held at the ranch to train park rangers in horsemanship. Though the breeding program was phased out in the late 1990s as more parks started maintaining their own stables, Point Reyes National Seashore still maintains a small herd of working horses. The four horses living at the ranch (as of April 2023) are Honcho, Mira, Knight Hawk, Gentry, and Moon. Together they assist rangers with everything from Search and Rescue to harbor seal counts and the Thule elk census. They also serve as a friendly presence at special events—Honcho and Elvis (who passed on January 1, 2023) even had the distinct honor of riding in the 2016 Rose Bowl Parade to celebrate 100 Years of the National Park Service!</p> <h2>Visiting the Morgan Horse Ranch</h2> <p>If you would like to visit the horses, learn more about this amazing breed and their connection to the National Park Service, the Morgan Horse Ranch is open to the public seven days a week. Rangers or volunteers are typically present from 9 am to 4 pm, during which time you are able to view the exhibits and facilities inside the ranch buildings. Though our horses are always happy to greet visitors, for their safety and yours, please do not enter the corrals or feed the horses at the fence line. The Morgan Horse Ranch is located on a small hill to the southwest of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm\">Bear Valley Visitor Center</a>. To visit, walk up the maintenance road located at the southeastern end of the Bear Valley parking lot. With a disability parking placard or plate, you may drive your vehicle along this maintenance road to a small parking area close to the stables. Exhibit areas are accessible.</p> <p>Learn more about the history of the ranch and Morgan Horses on the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/morgan_horse_ranch.htm\">Morgan Horse Ranch</a> page.</p>",

        "notes": "North Beach at Point Reyes Beach\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-north-beach.htm\n\n<p>Point Reyes Beach—also known as Great Beach and Ten Mile Beach—is an incredible expanse of undeveloped ocean beach. It stretches over 11-miles (~18-kilometers) from Tomales Point and Kehoe Beach at its north end to the Point Reyes Headlands at its south end. \"North Beach\" (aka Point Reyes Beach North) is actually located close to the mid-point of this long sandy beach. It is named \"North Beach\" because it is the section adjacent to the northernmost parking lot for Point Reyes Beach, e.g., the Point Reyes Beach North parking lot. It is a very short walk from the parking lot down the sand dunes to the beach.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/gray_whales.htm\">Gray whales</a> may be observed from shore during the annual winter (December–January) and spring (March–April) migrations. Search for whale blows on the horizon.</p> <h2>Beach Safety</h2> <p>If you are looking to observe the drama of heavy surf and large waves, this is the place to be. However, <strong>never turn your back to the ocean and stay well away from the water's edge.</strong> Due to the frequently large surf, this is not a beach at which it is safe to play close to the water's edge, much less to go for a swim. Sneakers waves frequently hit unexpecting visitors playing at or taking photographs close to the water's edge, some of whom have then been pulled into the ocean and drowned. The ocean water may be as low as 50°F (10°C). Hypothermia, sneaker waves, and rip currents are just a few beach hazards of which visitors should be aware while visiting Point Reyes Beaches. Please visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/safety_beaches.htm\">Safety Issues Associated with Beaches</a> page for more information.</p> <h2>Seasonal Beach Closure</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/birds_snowyplover.htm\">Western snowy plovers</a> nest on the beach to the north of the parking lot during the spring and summer. To better protect the plovers, from March 1 through September 30, pets, kites, and kiteboarders are prohibited north of the parking lot.

It was the largest ranch operation on the Point Reyes peninsula in the late 1800s. Imagine what ranch life was like as you walk through the ranch complex, where interpretive signs describe the history and function of the various buildings. Historic features include the main house, a schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, barns, dairy houses, and many other structures.</p> <p>Please note: The main house currently serves as a residence for park employees. Please respect the privacy of the residents.</p> <h2>The Best Butter in the Land</h2> <p>Established in 1858, Pierce Ranch excelled in the production of the finest quality of butter, as indicated by Goldberg, Bowen, and Company—a famous San Francisco fine food purveyor—which purchased the entire butter production of Pierce Point Ranch during late 1800s. Pierce Ranch was at the top among the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/historyculture/stories_ranching.htm\">Point Reyes ranches</a> in the quality of its product. In recognition of its importance, it was written up in 1878 and again in 1880 as an outstanding example of a dairy ranch. The Pierce Ranch ceased operations in 1973.</p> <h2>Preserving the Pierce Ranch</h2> <p>Beginning in 1980, the National Park Service invested in the rehabilitation of the ranch core, citing it as the best example of a west Marin dairy ranch from the 1800s. Pierce Ranch is probably the least altered, least modernized, physical complex of ranch buildings in the area. Part of the ranch's main house dates to 1856, making it the oldest surviving ranch house in the Point Reyes region. Pierce Point Ranch was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, and was subsequently opened to the public as an interpretive site.</p>",

It stretches over 11-miles (~18-kilometers) from Tomales Point and Kehoe Beach at its north end to the Point Reyes Headlands at its south end. The section of this beach referred to as \"South Beach\" gets its name because it is adjacent to the southernmost parking lot for Point Reyes Beach, e.g., the Point Reyes Beach South parking lot, even though it is over 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) north of the south end of the beach.</p> <p>To get onto South Beach, walk to the restroom building at the south end of the parking lot, then follow the sandy pathway located just north of the restroom building that leads toward the beach. Please stay out of the dune restoration area west of the parking lot.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Beach Safety</h2> <p>If you are looking to observe the drama of heavy surf and large waves, this is the place to be. However, <strong>never turn your back to the ocean and stay well away from the water's edge.</strong> Due to the frequently large surf, this is not a beach at which it is safe to play close to the water's edge, much less to go for a swim. Sneakers waves frequently hit unexpecting visitors playing at or taking photographs close to the water's edge, some of whom have then been pulled into the ocean and drowned. The ocean water may be as low as 50°F (10°C). Hypothermia, sneaker waves, and rip currents are just a few beach hazards of which visitors should be aware while visiting Point Reyes Beaches.

Claussen lived at G Ranch, one of the first two to be completed. Hinrik's son, Captain Peter Henry Claussen, arrived at the ranch in 1871 after a short career at sea, and became an active dairyman, served on the school board, and, after 1890, was very active assisting United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) personnel during many maritime emergencies. Hinrik died at age 56 in September 1872 and was buried in a small cemetery he had set aside on a knoll east of the ranch house.</p> <p>In 1890, the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) established a station at Point Reyes with a keeper and a crew of seven surfmen on a lonely stretch of the Point Reyes Beach, which was notorious for its pounding surf and bad weather. The surfmen assigned to the Point Reyes Life-Saving Service Station patrolled the Point Reyes Beach (aka, the Great Beach and Ten-Mile Beach) and Drakes Beach with an ever-vigilant eye, looking for shipwrecks and their desperate crews. But it was dangerous work. During the first few years of operation, four surfmen died and were ultimately buried at this cemetery, where they continue their watch over Point Reyes.</p> <p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/historyculture/stories_maritime_lifeboatstation.htm\">Lifeboat Station History at Point Reyes</a> page to learn more.</p> <h2>Visiting the Cemetery</h2> <p>Park in the tiny dirt parking area on the east side of the narrow access road 0.2-miles (0.3 km) from Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.

While the Woodward Fire continued to spread after this initial phase of rapid growth, the remaining 3,000 acres that burned did so more gradually during burn-out operations. </p> <p>A burn-out operation is a method of managing or containing a wildland fire. Rather than focusing all efforts on putting out a blaze, firefighters  strategically plan containment lines in the directions a fire may spread. Firefighters choose lines where they think it will be reasonable to stop the fire, provided there is not a risk to life or property in between.  Lines may be well beyond  the fire’s present boundary, and  can be an existing natural feature like a river or a cliffside, or a man-made feature such as a road or trail–anything where  firefighters can stage resources and the flames cannot reasonably jump over. </p> <p>Once the containment line is in place, firefighters will conduct “back burns”, essentially burning the area between the containment line and the fire’s edge. They will thin out flammable materials and  set up hoses to ensure the back-burn remains controlled and does not get too hot. </p> <p>The Bear Valley Trail and adjacent creek served as a containment line for the Woodward Fire. If you are walking south on the Bear Valley Trail (away from the Visitor Center), almost the entirety of the right-side of the trail makes up the eastern perimeter of the Woodward Fire. The hillside shown in this timelapse was not burned in the initial blaze, but rather was a low-heat back-burn which also resulted in healthy outcomes for many fire-adapted native plant species along this trail.</p>",

Less frequent high intensity fires can be more damaging by harming soils and mature trees, making recovery more difficult and dramatically changing a plant community and the habitat it provides. However, some plants and animals actually thrive in burn zones, taking advantage of new access to space and resources that may have been unavailable to them before.   </p> <p>Controlled burns mimic the beneficial low-intensity fires that much of California’s vegetation is adapted to survive. It will be interesting to follow regrowth across the patchwork of fire intensities in the Woodward fire zone. The vegetation visible at this site burned at what is considered a moderate intensity.</p>",

Visitors are encouraged to take a photo from these points and follow instructions on the sign to upload it, allowing the public and park scientists to observe change over time.<br /> <br /> When most people think about wildfires, they typically think of forests, not the ocean, but the Pacific Ocean played a vital role in the Woodward Fire! Since the ignition point was so close to the coast, the beach acted as a natural boundary for the fire, and made it impossible for the fire to spread further west. Think of it this way; with the ocean right there, the firefighters only had to worry about three sides to the fire instead of four! </p> <p>While  the beach  may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of wildland fire, many of California’s coastal ecosystems are adapted to or even dependent on periodic fire! Coyote brush, part of this coastal scrub community, is the predominant species seen at this photomonitoring point, and can withstand low heat fires since it has evolved with fire-retardant compounds in its leaves. Coyote brush actually thrives in distrubed areas like a post-burn site,  since its small wind-borne seeds can land and germinate on the newly bare soil. This prolific shrub will even help protect and provide shade for other species attempting to root in its environment. That said, coyote brush is not very tolerant of that shade itself, and if an area is left unburned long enough for a tree canopy to form, it will slowly be replaced. </p>",

Visitors are encouraged to take a photo from these points and follow instructions on the sign to upload it, allowing the public and park scientists to observe change over time.<br /> <br /> Wildland fires are often named after a landmark near its origin point. The Woodward Fire was named after the Woodward Valley, seen from this photo monitoring point, and not far from where the fire originated. While much of the Woodward Fire burned with low or moderate heat, there were several tracts such as this that did burn severely and will take longer to recover. </p> <p>When a fire burns with high heat, it can burn the soil as well as the overlying vegetation. Scorched soil may become hydrophobic, forming a crust that  repels water, making it harder for new plants to root and more subject to erosion. Fires that burn with high heat don’t leave behind as much organic matter, and it will take longer for these areas to rebuild a nutrient rich soil that is ideal for new life. <br /> <br /> Many factors lead to  a fire’s heat intensity on any given day, and several of those factors are visible at this location. This area had not burned in many years, meaning it had a lot of woody fuels ready for the fire to consume. Fires like to climb uphill, and the steepness of the slopes in the Woodward Valley made it very susceptible to a hot, fast moving fire. This same steepness and density of the brush also made it hard to access for firefighters. Additionally gusty winds, common in Point Reyes, helped breathe oxygen into the fire and made it spread faster during its first few days. <br /> <br /> Since the vast majority of the Woodward Fire burned at a low severity, it stands in stark contrast to many of the destructive fires that have occurred across California in the last decade. Less frequent burns due to many years of fire suppression, and hotter, drier, longer summers driven by climate change, means that this trend will likely continue. Hopefully watching how this tract of land recovers over the next several years will help us understand how these ecosystems might be able to bounce back.</p>",

Most of the Woodward Fire burned within the 33,373 acres of designated Wilderness within Point Reyes National Seashore. The Phillip Burton Wilderness was designated in 1976, to provide an extra layer of protection for the most remote areas of the seashore, to forever preserve its wild characteristics. </p> <p>For many years, managers for public lands such as National Parks, National Forests and designated Wilderness Areas chose to suppress all wildland fires, fearing their destructive capacity and looking only at the losses rather than the gains. Left unburned for decades, many areas of California are now subject to extremely hot, fast-spreading fires that devastate natural and man-made environments, rather than the more frequent, low-heat fires that occurred regularly before Western settlement, and which were often set intentionally as part of indigenous land management practices to promote a healthy environment. </p> <p><br /> Thanks to years of research and wisdom shared by  California’s many indigenous peoples, public lands agencies now attempt to manage fires in a similar  way that is best for the ecosystem. While many Wilderness areas across the country choose not to suppress naturally (lightning) ignited fires, due to their many benefits, the Fire Management plan in Point Reyes states that all fires must be managed and controlled because of the Seashore’s relative proximity to nearby communities. It took a lot of work and many resources to control the blaze, but the outcomes of the Woodward Fire were largely positive! According to a <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7hg7j88v\"><u>report by National Park employees</u></a>, “The Woodward Fire burned with mixed severity across a matrix of coastal habitat types that have seldom burned in recent decades but are largely fire tolerant or fire adapted. The result of the return of fire as an ecological process to the Point Reyes landscape could be a mosaic of vegetation communities more heterogenous, resilient, and diverse than before.” </p>",

This was the site where Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led the 7th US Cavalry in a surprise dawn attack against Black Kettle's Cheyenne village along the Washita River on November 27, 1868.</p> <h2>The Attack</h2> <p>Black Kettle's village was located on the south bank of the Washita River which runs through the line of trees in the middle of the valley. During the night before the attack, Custer led his troops in from the north following the trail of a Cheyenne war party. Upon reaching the far hills in the dark, the scouts determined that a village was in the valley from a dog's bark and a baby's cry. Custer decided to split his forces into four battalions to surround the village and launched a surprise attack at first light. The village fell quickly as they were caught off guard by the surprise attack, allowing the cavalry to quickly secure the village. Skirmishes continued throughout the day as villagers fled to the downstream camps, ultimately leading to the deaths of Custer's second in command, Maj. Joel Elliott, along with 17 soldiers as they chased after fleeing Cheyenne.<br /> <br /> As the downstream camps got word of the attack, their warriors began gathering on the hills to the north and east. However, Custer had already taken captives from the village, so the responding warriors did not launch a counter attack against the cavalry in fear that the captives would be killed. Upon seeing that he was quickly becoming outnumbered by the responding warriors, Custer ordered the majority of the Cheyenne horse herd that couldn't be taken with him killed. Then he feinted to the east towards the downstream villages like he was attacking before doubling back under the cover of darkness to begin the return trek to the north.<br /> <br /> In the end, more than 50 Cheyenne were killed and 53 taken captive while the 7th US Cavalry lost 22 soldiers in the attack.</p> <h2>Preserving the Story</h2> <p>Prior to the creation of Washita Battlefield National Historic Site, a 3.5 acre overlook was first created and maintained by the Oklahoma Historical Society to preserve the story of the attack. Then in 1996, Washita Battlefield National Historic Site was formed, ultimately leading to the National Park Service protecting the site of Black Kettle's village along the Washita as well as the overlook.</p>",

At the time, Chief Black Kettle of the Cheyenne had been pursuing peace with whites and believed his village to be under US Army protection. Approximately 230 Cheyenne and Arapaho women, children and elderly were killed and horribly mutilated. This attack came to be known as the Sand Creek Massacre and resulted in a massive public outcry as well as months of retaliatory raids by Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Lakota warriors.<br /> <br /> In the months and years that followed, treaties and attempts to move the tribes to reservations would fail.

Starting in Texas, the Washita runs for over 580 miles through Oklahoma to the Red River in south central Oklahoma. This crucial water allows this valley to support a wide range of plants and animals, which in turn made this valley such an appealing sanctuary for the Cheyenne to winter in. Along the south side of this part of the river is where Black Kettle's village made their camp when they were attacked by the 7th US Cavalry on November 27, 1868.<br /> <br /> The river is located about 3/4 miles along the park trail, reachable from either the paved or unpaved sides of the trail.",

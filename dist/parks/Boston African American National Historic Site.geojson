        "notes": "Beacon Hill\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/beacon-hill.htm\n\n<p>When the first European colonists settled in Boston in the 1620s, the area of the city we now know as Beacon Hill comprised of three peaks. The colonists referred to this area as the Tri-mountain, or Tra-mount or Tre-mount. They also called it Sentry Hill.<sup>1</sup> In 1635, these early English settlers erected a tall wooden beacon atop the hill to warn the countryside of any danger, attack, or outbreak. From that day forth, the area became known as Beacon Hill.</p> <p>Thomas Hancock, a wealthy merchant, built the first home on Beacon Hill in 1737.<sup>2</sup> Following his death, and that of his widow, this mansion became the home of his nephew, the merchant and patriot leader <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-hancock.htm\">John Hancock</a>. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a>, 1775-1776, the British military took over this house and used it as their headquarters.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>At this time, British commander General Gage removed the beacon from Beacon Hill. According to historian William W. Wheildon:</p> <blockquote>After the discomfiture of the 19th of April, and on account of the gathering of Provincial troops at Cambridge, he found it necessary to increase and, extend his defences; and among other things a small fort was built on Beacon Hill and the Beacon removed.<sup>4</sup></blockquote> <p>Following the British evacuation in March 1776, Bostonians quickly replaced the beacon. It remained there until a storm blew it down in 1789. The Beacon Hill Eagle Memorial, designed by Charles Bulfinch, now stands in its place as a lasting reminder of Boston's revolutionary legacy.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Bulfinch also played a prominent role in the transformation of Beacon Hill into an enclave for wealthy and powerful Bostonians, who became known as the Boston Brahmins. Bulfinch designed the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/massachusetts-state-house.htm\">Massachusetts State House</a>, completed in 1798, which continues to serve as the seat of political power in the Commonwealth. He also joined with four other businessmen to form the Mount Vernon Proprietors. This real estate syndicate purchased land from the artist John Singleton Copley and began developing the southern slope of Beacon Hill, overlooking <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-common-ma.htm\">Boston Common</a>, with lavish homes for Boston‚Äôs elite.</p> <p>The north and western slopes of Beacon Hill, on the other hand, served as the home of a working and middle class community, including many free African Americans. This area became a hotbed of abolitionist and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/boston-an-underground-railroad-hub.htm\">Underground Railroad</a> activity in the years leading up to the U.S. Civil War. Today, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/virtual-black-heritage-trail-tour.htm\">Black Heritage Trail<sup>¬Æ</sup></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.maah.org/\">Museum of African American History</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/index.htm\">Boston African American National Historic Site</a> commemorate this remarkable and often overlooked history of Beacon Hill.</p> <p>To fill in land around the city, Bostonians removed parts of the three hills that made up the original Tri-mountain, leaving the landscape we see today. Throughout its history, Beacon Hill has served as home for wealthy merchants and poor immigrants, industrialists and skilled artisans, social reformers and activists, political and religious leaders, writers, artists, and laborers. Its residents, their homes, and their gathering spaces played a transformational role in Boston's unique social, cultural, and political history.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>William Wheildon, <em>Sentry, or Beacon Hill; The Beacon and the Monument of 1635 and 1790</em> (Concord, MA: Author‚Äôs address, 1877) 9,¬†accessed February 2022 through archive.org,¬†<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/orbeaconhi00wheildon/page/10/mode/2up\">https://archive.org/details/orbeaconhi00wheildon/page/10/mode/2up</a>.</li> <li>Wheildon, <em>Sentry, or Beacon Hill</em>, 48.</li> <li>\"The John Hancock House, Boston, Mass.\" <em>Historic New England</em>, accessed February 2022, <a href=\"https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/103657/\">https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/103657/</a>.</li> <li>Wheildon, 58.</li> <li>\"Massachusetts Facts,\" <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts</em>, accessed February 2022, <a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cismaf/mf3.htm\">https://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cismaf/mf3.htm</a>; \"Beacon Hill Eagle Monument,\" <em>Museum without Walls, Culture Now</em>, accessed February 2022,¬†<a href=\"https://culturenow.org/entry&permalink=05702&seo=Beacon-Hill-Eagle-Monument_Charles-Bulfinch-and-Boston-Art-Commission\">https://culturenow.org/entry&permalink=05702&seo=Beacon-Hill-Eagle-Monument_Charles-Bulfinch-and-Boston-Art-Commission</a>.</li> </ol>",

        "notes": "Boston Common\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/boston-common-ma.htm\n\n<p>Considered the oldest public park in the United States, Boston Common played an important role in the history of conservation, landscape architecture, military and political history, and recreation in Massachusetts. The Common and the adjoining¬†<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e4de616-7fff-deb0-551a-3c5feb54a5da\"><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/places/boston-public-garden.htm\">Public Garden</a></b>¬†are among the greatest amenities and most visited outdoor public spaces in Boston. The history of the Common's use by the city illuminates the conservation movement in Massachusetts and mirrors similar models carried out by American conservationists throughout the nation.</p> <p>In 1634, the townspeople of Boston voted to tax each household six schillings for the purchase of William Blackstone's farm to be used as a community common. The newly established Common served a combination of public, military, agricultural, and recreational purposes. In the 1600s and 1700s, companies from Boston and surrounding communities performed military training on the Common. During the winter of 1775 and 1776, British soldiers installed artillery entrenchments on the Common, and a garrison of 1,700 soldiers remained encamped there. Other early public uses of the Common included public hangings and whippings. The Common also served agricultural purposes. The Common was a pasture for cattle from the time of its creation through the early decades of the 1800s. As an early example of \"utilitarian\" conservation, regulations protected the land from overgrazing by restricting the number of cattle each family could graze on the Common.</p> <p>There were also indications the Common was a place for recreation as early as the 1660s. John Josselyn wrote about men and women of Boston enjoying evening strolls on the Common: \"On the South there is a small, but pleasant Common where the Gallants a little before Sun-set walk with their Marmalet-Madams‚Ä¶till the nine a clock Bell rings them home to their respective habitations, when presently the Constables walk their rounds to see good orders kept, and to take up loose people.\"</p> <p>Children enjoyed the Common, too, wading in the Frog Pond in summer, and skating and sledding in the winter. Gradually recreational activities began to dominate the Common. The changes in land use mirrored changes in landscape design. The first wide, tree-lined mall added along Tremont Street in 1722 is one reflection of these changes. As the city grew, livestock grazing was further and further restricted, with cows forbidden altogether in 1830 and pasture fences removed in 1836.</p> <p>In the 1800s as the Urban Parks Movement gained momentum, the Common began to acquire monuments, fountains, and artwork. Erected in 1897, the most famous of these memorials honors <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/robert-gould-shaw-and-massachusetts-54th-regiment-memorial.htm\">Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry</a>, a celebrated regiment of free Black¬†soldiers who fought in the American Civil War. Distinguished sculptor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/augustus-saint-gaudens.htm\">Augustus St. Gaudens</a> was the designer and McKim, Mead, and White were the architects of the memorial. The 50-acre Common today is remarkably intact, due to the continued vigilance of local citizens. In the 1890s, a proposal to build a trolley line across the Common caused great public opposition that forced the examination of other transportation options, and in 1895, Boston installed the first subway in the United States. The first subway station, the Tremont Street Subway, still exists today bordering the Common along Tremont Street.</p> <p>Since its inception, activities held on the Common stretched beyond relaxation and recreation to include public assembly. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">George Washington</a>, John Adams, and General Lafayette celebrated our nation's independence in this space. In the 1800s, abolitionists strove to abolish slavery and the United States Army recruited soldiers to fight in the Civil War. During the fight for the 19th Amendment, women suffragists drew crowds at open-air meetings and rallies. In the 1900s, Charles Lindbergh spoke to crowds on the Common about the future of commercial aviation. Anti-Vietnam and Civil Rights rallies, including one led by Martin Luther King Jr., took place on the Common. Today, Bostonians still gather on the Common to protest grievances and promote new ideas.</p> <p>Used, enjoyed, and largely protected by generations, the Boston Common exemplifies the spirit of public conservation in Massachusetts and the trend in American cities to preserve nature within growing urban areas. Today visitors can enjoy ball fields, a tot lot, and the Frog Pond where the public skates in winter and children frolic in the summer. Other additions to the Common over time include a large underground parking garage and tennis courts. Despite these changes, the Common still retains its original function for the people of Boston: a relaxing open space in a congested city. Boston Common is one of the nine parks that are part of the Emerald Necklace, a 1,100-acre chain of parks linked by parkways.</p> <p>Boston Common was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1972. <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Read the full nomination at the National Archives</a>¬†(learn more about the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">National Register of Historic Places program</a>).</p> <p>It was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 27, 1987 (learn more about the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">National Historic Landmark program</a>).</p> <p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />You can learn more about Boston Common in the Teaching with Historic Places lesson plan,<b> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-emerald-necklace-boston-s-green-connection.htm\">The Emerald Necklace: Boston's Green Connection.</a></b></p> <p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />To discover more Massachusetts history and culture, visit the<b> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelmassconservation/index.htm\">Massachusetts Conservation Travel Itinerary website. </a></b></p>",

It also functioned as a federal jail cell after the Personal Liberty laws of Massachusetts barred the use of state facilities for fugitive slave cases. Protesters often gathered in and around the courthouse when authorities held freedom seekers here. In February 1851, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lewis-hayden.htm\">Lewis Hayden</a> and other Black men successfully rescued <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-rescued-from-the-fangs-of-the-slave-hunter-the-case-of-shadrach-minkins.htm\">Shadrach Minkins</a> in a brazen daytime rescue from this courthouse.

Offering a diverse array of ecosystems as well as integral shelter, the Harbor and its islands have been a vital resource for inhabitants of the area for thousands of years.</p> <p>Boston Harbor served as a major trading port for the English colonies during the 1600s and 1700s, as ships carrying commodities often made their way through Boston before traveling down the coast. Boston and its harbor served as a significant stop in Atlantic trading routes, supporting an empire that trafficked enslaved individuals and traded goods consumed and produced by enslaved labor.</p> <p>Due to its strategic location, Boston Harbor became a center of conflict during the era of the American Revolution. As punishment for the 1773 Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the Boston Port Act in 1774, which closed Boston Harbor to all ships. The first of what became known as the Coercive (or Intolerable) Acts, the Boston Port Act contributed to the organizing of the First Continental Congress later that year. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a> in 1775 and 1776, skirmishes between British forces and colonial militia occurred across the islands as both sides battled for control of the Harbor and its resources. British forces eventually left Boston Harbor in June 1776.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/a90667c2-2194-472a-84fc-a466b2f27a04?\"><img alt=\"A painting of Boston and Boston Harbor.\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/a90667c2-2194-472a-84fc-a466b2f27a04/original.jpg?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 80%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"View of the City of Boston from Dorchester Heights\" (Credit: Library of Congress)</em></p> <p>Maintaining its status as a fortified port and trading center throughout the 1800s, Boston Harbor played a significant role during abolition. Many enslaved individuals, especially those coming from states along the coast, utilized ships bound for northern ports to gain their freedom. A center of strong anti-slavery activism, Boston became a natural destination for stowaways seeking their freedom. As <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/thomas-w-higginson.htm\">Thomas Wentworth Higginson</a> wrote when reflecting on his time assisting freedom seekers, \"Fugitive Slaves commonly came by water, as stowaways on vessels‚Ä¶\"<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Boston Harbor later became the center of an ecological revolution in the 1900s. For much of the past four centuries the harbor has been indiscriminately used as a dumping spot for detritus (dead organic material) and human waste, leading to its reputation in the 1980s as the \"harbor of shame.\" That all changed in 1984 with a court‚Äìordered cleanup and the establishment of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which oversaw the Boston Harbor Cleanup and the construction and operation of the Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant, which maintains clean harbor waters today.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Thomas Wentworth Higginson to Wilbur Sibert, July 24th 1896. <a href=\"https://ohiomemory.org/digital/collection/siebert/id/14422/\">Ohiomemory.org</a>, last accessed September 2020.</li> </ol>",

Like most Boston churches at the time, Third Baptist enforced racially segregated seating. In 1836, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/timothy-gilbert.htm\">Timothy Gilbert</a>, a White abolitionist, challenged the church's policy by inviting several of his African American friends to sit in his pew. Expelled for his actions, Gilbert founded the First Free Baptist Church, also known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tremont-temple.htm\">Tremont Temple</a>, considered the first integrated church in Boston. In 1876, Third Baptist sold the building to the First African Methodist Episcopal Church. Known thereafter as the Charles Street A.M.E. Church, it became the largest of Boston's five Black churches at the time. When the church moved to Warren Street in Roxbury in 1939, Charles Street A.M.E. Church became the last Black institution to leave Beacon Hill.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Throughout its history, the Charles Street Meeting House served as a space for social¬†activism.

George Hillard worked as a law partner of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/charles-sumner.htm\">Charles Sumner</a>, until Sumner became a¬†U.S. Senator. Even though¬†Hillard acknowledged the injustices of slavery and supported racial equality, especially in education, he sided politically with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/daniel-webster.htm\">Senator Daniel Webster</a> and did not want to¬†risk the dissolution of the nation to end slavery. Hillard also worked as a federal commissioner, meaning¬†in 1850¬†he had to uphold the new Fugitive Slave Law by giving out arrest warrants to slave catchers.</p> <p>While George Hillard¬†worked as a federal commissioner, Susan Hillard identified as a staunch and active abolitionist. As early as 1850, Susan began harboring freedom seekers in their home, and George‚Äôs public reputation as a Webster Whig removed any suspicion that the house operated as a stop on the Underground Railroad.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Notably, the Hillards protected <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-a-desperate-leap-for-liberty-the-escape-of-william-and-ellen-craft.htm\">Ellen Craft</a> in their home when slave catchers sought to arrest her and her husband <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-craft.htm\">William</a> under the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fugitive-slave-laws-boston.htm\">Fugitive Slave Law</a>. Susan Hillard recalled her husband saying, ‚ÄúI am perfectly willing to meeting the penalty, should [Ellen] be found here, but will never give her up.‚Äù<sup>3</sup>¬†They continued to assist freedom seekers over the following years. Records indicate that between 1855 and 1858, Susan and George Hillard opened their home to at least five freedom seekers, including a woman, Phillis Gault, and later her nephew, Dick Page, of Norfolk, Virginia.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Years later, a 1926 <em>Boston Transcript</em> article recognized the Hillards‚Äô home as a site on the Underground Railroad and described one of the possible hiding spaces in the house. It stated:</p> <blockquote> <p>Only a few years ago, when some repairs were being made in the plastering of the ell, a well-concealed trap door in the ceiling of a closet unexpectedly dropped upon the head of a workman, revealing an unfinished space under the lean-to roof large enough to hold several human beings. This place was without windows, but it was ventilated in a measure by an opening into a shaft under a skylight. Recalling the tradition that this house had been a station on the ‚ÄòUnderground‚Äô in Mr. Hillard‚Äôs time the then owner had the place explored, with the result that two tin plates and two iron spoons were found on the floor.<sup>5</sup></p> </blockquote> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/06ac9c60-72c3-4d04-9abb-3871ee854421\"><img alt=\"1874 map with G.S.

        "name": "Long Wharf, Boston",
        "notes": "Long Wharf, Boston\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/long-wharf-boston.htm\n\n<p>Located at the base of today's¬†<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/state-street-boston.htm\">State Street</a>, Long Wharf served as the nucleus of Boston's maritime trade. By the end of the 1700s, it reigned pre-eminent amongst Boston's 80 wharves, handling both international and coastal trade. Regaining its prominence as a commercial center, Long Wharf remains one of the city's most well-known wharves today.<sup>1</sup>¬†</p> <p>Acting upon the suggestion of Henry Deering in 1707, the Selectmen of Boston granted permission to a private group of men (headed by Capt. Oliver Noyes) for the construction of a wharf at the base of King Street. Constructed around 1710-1721, the new wharf extended half a mile into the harbor and became known as \"Long Wharf.\" Early maps show that it was by far the most ambitious undertaking on Boston's waterfront.</p> <p>An immediate success, Long Wharf's¬†site at the base of King Street allowed direct access to the heart of the town‚Äîthe intersection of King and Cornhill Streets (now State and Washington Streets). Its extreme length of 1,586 feet¬†allowed up to 50 vessels¬†to dock and unload directly into warehouses without the use of lighters or boats. With its site and length, the wharf soon became central to the commercial trade of Boston.</p> <p>Supported by powerful New England merchant families, commercial trade in Boston grew substantially as the town became integrated into the Atlantic trading empire.<sup>2</sup> Due to its location, Boston served as an ideal location as a port of call for ships traveling across the Atlantic ocean.¬†Boston, and Long Wharf in particular,¬†became immersed in the Mid-Atlantic slave trade and what is known as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-middle-passage.htm\">Middle Passage</a>. Newspaper advertisements¬†in the 1700s document that some ships docked at Long Wharf held¬†enslaved Africans; merchants and captains also sold them alongside their other imports. Installed in 2020, a marker recognizes this history at the end of Long Wharf today.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In addition to its economic role in the Atlantic trading empire, Long Wharf played a part in the early military history of Boston. In 1758, victors from the pivotal¬†Battle of Louisbourg during the Seven Years' War landed here to gun salutes and cheering citizens. The arrival of British troops via Long Wharf just over a decade later¬†received a different response, as they¬†came to enforce the King's rights in 1770 (ultimately ending¬†in the Boston Massacre). As part of the Intolerable Acts, British Parliament shut down the port of Boston in 1774, therefore¬†closing Long Wharf stores and docks. According to Frothingham's¬†<em>History of the Siege of Boston</em>, some of the British forces at Bunker Hill arrived from Long Wharf.<sup>4</sup>¬†Wounded from both sides of the Battle of Bunker Hill¬†were brought back across the harbor to Long Wharf in June of 1775. At the end of the Siege of Boston, the British evacuated Boston from Long Wharf in March 1776. In July 1776, the ship that brought word of the Declaration of Independence from Philadelphia landed at Long Wharf. John Adams sailed from it to secure European financial and military support for the Revolutionary War. During this time,¬†privateers and blockade runners sailed from Long Wharf and military stores were kept in its warehouses. Decades later, during the War of 1812, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-constitution.htm\">USS¬†<em>Constitution</em> (\"Old Ironsides\")</a> docked at Long Wharf.</p> <p>After the wars, trade resumed its dominant position on the wharf. Two new buildings, the Custom House Block and the Chart House, joined¬†the Wharf's landscape. The Chart House dates¬†from the 1830s with perhaps some colonial sections. Built in 1848, the Custom House Block provides an example of the monumental granite structures that lined Boston's docks during the height of its commercial prosperity. Both of these buildings¬†help Long Wharf maintain its historic character today.</p> <p>The city of Boston achieved its acme of commercial prosperity in¬†the 1840s-1850s. While trade with Europe continued throughout this period, Boston merchant houses thrived on the China and East Indies trade‚Äîsilks, madras, and cashmere were transported to Long Wharf warehouses.</p> <p>During this time, Long Wharf also witnessed flashpoints in the city's abolitionist history. In 1851, local authorities marched captured freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-the-whole-land-is-full-of-blood-the-thomas-sims-case.htm\">Thomas Sims</a> down Long Wharf to board him on the brig <em>Acorn</em>, which took him back to slavery in Savannah, Georgia. About a hundred abolitionists protested this rendition, as result of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fugitive-slave-laws-boston.htm\">1850 Fugitive Slave Law</a>. Opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law grew rapidly three years later when another freedom seeker, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>, faced the same fate. After a short trial and a failed rescue attempt, hundreds of federal troops marched Anthony Burns down State Street to Long Wharf as 50,000 people lined the streets to protest.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>After the American Civil War, trade declined in Boston and so did the importance of Long Wharf. The primary business of the wharf shifted from international trade to coastal trade and fishing. Atlantic Avenue was built to enlarge the waterfront just at the point when Boston's great maritime era was closing. In 1914, major fish dealers moved to the completed¬†Fish Pier¬†in South Boston. Schooners and coastal steamers gradually disappeared.</p> <p>As is the nature of a utilitarian site, Long Wharf has remained in constant change, reflecting the prosperity and priorities of American shipping and trade. Although these changes have altered the shape and the use of Long Wharf, the portion that remains and the buildings on it retain a strong commemorative value.¬†</p> <p>On November 13, 1966, Boston's Long Wharf received the designation of National Historic Landmark. <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/66000768\">Read the full nomination.</a></p> <p>Learn more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1582/index.htm\">National Historic Landmark</a> program.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Original language derives from the 'Historical Background\" section of the National Historic Landmark application.

It is the present purpose, to make the new Cambridge Bridge one of the finest and most beautiful structures in the world.\"¬†The Longfellow Bridge was authorized by the same 1894 legislation which authorized the Boston Transit Commission, the Tremont Subway, and the Charlestown Bridge. Like the Tremont Street Subway, the Longfellow Bridge was in large part a result of heavy streetcar congestion brought about by the increased traffic of the new electric cars. The old West Boston Bridge, constructed in 1793 and rebuilt in 1854, had been on the very first route to carry horsecar traffic, in 1856. Originally known as the Cambridge Bridge, the present structure was begun in July 1900 and completed in 1907, named for Cambridge poet <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-wadsworth-longfellow.htm\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> in the centennial year of his birth.</p> <p>Though not the original structure, in 1855 the bridge into Cambridge played a role in the fugitive slave case of John Jackson. Escaping enslavement in Virginia, Jackson settled in Boston and found work on a coasting vessel. However, after being in Boston for a couple of weeks, Jackson‚Äôs former enslaver learned of his whereabouts and sent slave catchers to apprehend him. According to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-liberator.htm\">The Liberator</a>, while walking home from work in January of 1855 Jackson, ‚Äúwas accosted by a white man who, from the description given, answers very well for a noted slave-catcher of this city, and asked if his name was not Jackson.‚Äù<sup>1</sup> Jackson refused to give his name and, when pressed about his home address, Jackson lied, telling the slave catcher he lived in Cambridge.</p> <p>Believing this lie, Marshall Asa Butman hoped to catch Jackson on his way to work. The next day, as reported by <em>The Massachusetts Spy</em>, ‚ÄúNotorious Asa O. Butman was seen to take a position upon the bridge early on Wednesday morning where he remained for about three hours.‚Äù<sup>2</sup> Butman, the slave catcher that arrested <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>, did not get a chance to apprehend John Jackson. Jackson, with the aid of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committee</a>, left Boston and relocated to Worchester, remaining free for the rest of his life.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/486365b2-0027-4247-a314-ffc92add7123\"><img alt=\"Handwritten record listing R.F.

At high tide, the island is 119 acres, counting intertidal acres. Lovells Island is composed of three forested drumlins connected by marshes. In the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps planted a variety of trees and plants in an attempted to return vegetation to the island. Although the expansion of Fort Standish in 1939 led to the clearing of this vegetation, many species are beginning to find their way here once more.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Prior to European contact, local Indigenous people accessed the island seasonally for fishing in the summer and moved inland in the winter. In the years after European settler colonization, the people of Charlestown used Lovells for timber, with half of the timber being saved for construction of a fort on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-cast.htm\">Castle Island</a>. The first \"hut of refuge\" in the United States was put on Lovells Island in by the Massachusetts Humane Society in 1787.

In 1782, a French Man-of-war ship called the <em>Magnifique </em>wrecked off Lovells Island.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>In December 1858, Lovells Island made Boston news when the headline \"Escape of a Fugitive Slave from a Vessel in Boston Harbor\" appeared in multiple Boston newspapers. A freedom seeker named Philip Smith had been discovered as a stowaway on a ship from Wilmington, North Carolina. Once discovered, he jumped overboard and swam to nearby Lovells Island. Frostbitten, he managed to hail a passing ship and make his way to abolitionists in Boston.<sup>3</sup></p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/bab22199-d6e9-4973-924a-dc7d87c07cc1\"><img alt=\"Newspaper clipping about a fugitive slave escaping through Boston Harbor.\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/bab22199-d6e9-4973-924a-dc7d87c07cc1/original.png?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An article regarding a freedom seeker, Phillip Smith, who stowed-away on a ship and swam to Lovells Island when discovered onboard. (Credit: The Liberator, December 31, 1858.)</em></p> <p>Garrisoned during the U.S. Civil War, Lovells island became the home of a training station called Lovells Island Military Reservation. In 1887, the Board of Engineers recommended that three-gun turrets be placed to fortify Lovells Island. By 1900, the Board of Engineers ordered seven concrete batteries to be constructed at the fortification, now named Fort Standish, and transferred to the Coast Artillery when finished.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In 1903, two range lights were constructed on the island. They stood 400 feet apart, connected by a 7-foot walkway that also connected to the keeper's quarters and the oil house.<sup>5</sup> Charles Jennings, former keeper of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-light.htm\">Boston Light</a> became the keeper of the Lovells range lights. Harold Jennings, son of Charles Jennings, remembers his childhood fondly in his book <em>A Lighthouse Family</em> and recounts the years following World War I:</p> ‚ÄØ <blockquote>After World War I, they cut down on the complements and there were only caretakers. There were other families on the island besides us but they were up on the other end of the island. Their job was to keep the gun placements clean and make sure no one broke into them. Keep the different generators running on the island in case the guns had to be used; and general Maintenace...The disappearing gun emplacements had an archway to them which was as wide as a house... We would make echoes and climb the steel ladder. We would imagine we were part of the gun crew.<sup>6</sup></blockquote> <p>Harold Jennings, worked as the keeper of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lovells-island-range-lights.htm\">Lovells Range Lights</a> for more than twenty years before the lights were ordered to be extinguished in 1939 to make room for the expansion of Fort Standish.</p> <p>Fort Standish had all guns operational by 1940. The island offered a variety of training opportunities for soldiers, including a communication school, a gunnery, and a field school. Following World War II, the military declared Fort Standish excess. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts purchased the Island in 1958.<sup>7</sup> Lovells Island has since become a part of Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park. Today, visitors enjoy Lovells primarily as a camping island.‚ÄØ</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-love.htm\">Island Facts: Lovells Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>National Park Service Boston Harbor Islands, \"Lovells Island Facts,\" date accessed¬†October 2022,¬†<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-love.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-love.htm</a>‚ÄØ</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,‚ÄØ<em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 132-134.</li> <li>\"Escape of a Fugitive Slave from a Vessel in Boston Harbor,\" <em>The Liberator</em>, December 31, 1858.</li> <li>Gerald W.

Its members became activists both within and outside of the club; numerous women participated in several reform movements, including women's suffrage, temperance, and anti-lynching movements.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The club's publication, <em>The Woman's Era</em>, quickly became the leading publication for Black clubwomen across the country. While editors and writers discussed a variety of topics, the journal‚Äôs biggest achievement lay in its work for organizing Black clubwomen from across the country. Booker T.

Escaping slavery in 1842 from North Carolina, Jacobs fled to New York. Over the next couple of years, Jacobs fled to Boston several times when she feared capture in New York. During these trips, she stayed with her brother John, also a freedom seeker. John Jacobs settled in Boston years earlier and joined the abolitionist community of the city.<sup>1</sup> On one of these trips, Harriet Jacobs left her son Benjamin in the care of John to keep him safe.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Jacobs moved to Boston with her daughter, Louisa, when she received word that her enslaver had once again traveled to New York in search of her. Jacobs recalled her relief upon moving to Boston,</p> <blockquote> <p>The day after my arrival was one of the happiest of my life. I felt as if I was beyond the reach of the bloodhounds; and, for the first time during many years, I had both my children together with me. They greatly enjoyed their reunion, and laughed and chatted merrily. I watched them with a swelling heart. Their every motion delighted me.<sup>3</sup></p> </blockquote> <p>City directories document her living at 87 Charter Street and working as a dressmaker.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Jacobs temporarily left Boston for England in 1845. Upon her return, she discovered her son had left for a whaling voyage. Previously, Benjamin had worked as an apprentice, but he faced racist \"insults and abuse\" from the other apprentices.<sup>5</sup> This experience encouraged him to leave Boston. After Louisa left for boarding school, Jacobs decided to move to Rochester, New York with her brother John.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>While Jacobs did not live in Boston again, she received assistance from Massachusetts abolitionist Lydia Maria Child to publish her book in Boston.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li><em>The Liberator</em> documents his various speaking engagements, including: \"John S.

His lawyer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-morris.htm\">Robert Morris</a> ‚Äúargued that there was legally but one marriage, as slaves were not allowed to make contracts of any kind without the written consent of their masters.‚Äù<sup>3</sup> The results of this case remain unclear.</p> <p>Between 1859 and 1861, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committee</a> reimbursed Howard for boarding three freedom seekers: Edward Allen, William Seymour, and Willis Rogers. Howard also bought shoes for Rogers, according to the Committee‚Äôs records.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>During this time, Lewis Howard and his wife Nancy adopted a formerly enslaved seven-year-old girl, Ellen Starr.

During the summer of 1836, Thomas Aves's daughter, Mary Aves Slater, traveled from her home in New Orleans, Louisiana to visit Aves. Upon her departure from New Orleans, Slater made the critical decision to bring a six-year-old enslaved girl named Med with her on the journey, leaving Med‚Äôs mother behind. Slater traveled from Louisiana, a slave state, to the state of Massachusetts, which legally abolished slavery in 1783.¬†</p> <p paraeid=\"{c2a2d1da-6619-40f9-b6b8-5a019cfd87b5}{251}\" paraid=\"14410438\">In August 1836, the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society learned of Med‚Äôs presence in the home of Thomas Aves at 21 Pinckney Street. Historical records suggest that members of the Society posed as Sunday School recruiters in order to gain access to the home of Thomas Aves.

Aves</em>, ultimately ruling that enslaved people brought to Massachusetts by their enslavers could not be held against their will. Shaw‚Äôs ruling removed Med from the institution of slavery, but due to her young age, Med was placed in the care of the Samaritan Asylum for Indigent Children in Boston. <em>Commonwealth v. Aves</em> set an important legal precedent for free states and served as a landmark victory for the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. However, the newly emancipated Med never reunited with her mother and died two years later at the Asylum.¬†</p> <h2>Sources</h2> <p>Weierman, Karen Woods. <em>The Case of the Slave-Child, Med: Free Soil in Antislavery Boston</em>.

Historian Gary Collison, citing a <em>New York Daily Tribune</em> article, described how \"no one could approach within a hundred yards of the shop 'without being seen by a hundred eyes.'\"<sup>5</sup></p> <p>When the slave catchers failed to arrest the Crafts, William and Ellen departed for England, with William leaving behind his cabinet-making shop.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/46c928e4-adb7-411d-9852-0330d2b651e2?\"><img alt=\"Article announcing the arrest warrant for the Crafts.\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/46c928e4-adb7-411d-9852-0330d2b651e2/original.png?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 80%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This article announces the arrest warrant for the Crafts.

Relocating to Boston, Bearse utilized his maritime skills to assist fugitives escaping from enslavement. Bearse used his ship, <em>The Moby Dick</em>, to intercept freedom seekers that had stowed away on southern ships that came to Boston. For example, in September of 1854 Bearse received a tip that a ship called the <em>Sally Ann</em> had a stowaway on board. As Bearse recalled,</p> <blockquote> <p>I made sail for City Point, South Boston.

Located a few blocks from Beacon Hill's North Slope community, the hotel, like many spaces in Boston, served as a witness to militant abolitionism in the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fugitive-slave-laws-boston.htm\">Fugitive Slave Law</a>.</p> <p>In April of 1850 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/daniel-webster.htm\">Daniel Webster</a>, prominent senator and famous orator from Massachusetts, arrived at the Revere House Hotel. A month prior, Webster had delivered his infamous \"Seventh of March\" speech, endorsing the Compromise of 1850 which included the new Fugitive Slave Law. Facing strong backlash in Boston for his support of the Compromise, Webster decided to deliver a speech from the portico of the Revere House. Standing on the front steps, Webster called upon Massachusetts residents to enforce the new Fugitive Slave Law, despite their misgivings of the law:</p> <blockquote>It is the question respecting the delivery of fugitives from service... There are, in regard to that topic, duties absolutely incumbent on the Commonwealth- duties imposed by the Constitution...She [Massachusetts] is bound and those persons are bound to the discharge of a duty- of a disagreeable duty. We call upon her to discharge that duty as an affair of high morals and high principles.<sup>2</sup></blockquote> <p>In 1854, Webster's call for Massachusetts citizens to uphold this law by \"discharging their duty\" was severely tested with the arrest of 20-year-old freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>. Burns' enslaver, Col. Charles Suttle, stayed at the Revere House during the duration of Burns' trial and rendition back to enslavement. Abolitionists harassed Suttle from the moment he checked into the hotel. During their stay, authorities arrested Suttle and his colleague William Brent on the charge of conspiring to kidnap. Later released on bail, they remained under surveillance by the Boston Vigilance Committee and other anti-slavery groups. Suttle and Brent even had to relocate from the ground floor to an attic room with armed guards due to death threats.</p> <p>Following the rendition of Anthony Burns, the hotel remained a popular destination for visitors to Boston until its destruction in a 1912 fire.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Moses King, <em>King's Handbook of Boston</em> (Cambridge: Harvard College 1878), 58.</li> <li>\"Mr. Webster in Boston,\" <em>The Liberator</em> (Boston, Massachusetts), May 3, 1850.</li> </ol>",

Residents of Beacon Hill saw Smith Court as a community center where people came together to remember and celebrate significant events, as well as congregate for spiritual, educational, and political gatherings.</p> <p>Two historic structures in particular, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/african-meeting-house.htm\">African Meeting House</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/abiel-smith-school.htm\">Abiel Smith School</a>, played crucial roles in this community. The oldest extant Black church in the United States of America, the 1806 African Meeting House hosted meetings and gatherings that pushed for justice and equality for African Americans. The neighboring 1835 Abiel Smith School became one of the first public school buildings for African American children in the country, later serving as a meeting space for the Black community.</p> <p>Apart from the African Meeting House and Abiel Smith School, homes also line Smith Court. Several of these <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/smith-court-residences.htm\">residences</a> played a role in the Underground Railroad, providing shelter to freedom seekers.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://smithcourtstories.org/\">Smith Court Stories</a></p>",

        "notes": "Spectacle Island\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/spectacle-island.htm\n\n<p>Located four miles from downtown Boston, Spectacle Island is a true example of trash turned into treasure. Spectacle Island features five miles worth of trails, panoramic views of the harbor, and a rich history.</p> <p>Throughout its lifetime, Spectacle Island has served many purposes for many different people. Local Indigenous communities have honored and stewarded the island for thousands of years. Prior to European colonization of the area, Indigenous Peoples primarily used the island seasonally from spring to fall. One piece of evidence of this early presence includes shell middens, which are large mounds of discarded shell pieces along with other scraps.</p> <p>With the arrival of European settlers in the 1600s, so too came smallpox. The town of Boston opened a smallpox quarantine hospital on Spectacle Island in 1717. Ships coming into Boston known to have smallpox were required to stop at Spectacle to quarantine. The hospital operated for 20 years before it was moved to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/rainsford-island.htm\">Rainsford Island</a>.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Spectacle Island also housed two hotels for about ten years, between around 1846 and 1857. These hotels were later shut down after a police raid due to illegal gambling.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>During the early years of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/boston-an-underground-railroad-hub.htm\">Underground Railroad</a>, Spectacle Island served an integral role in the story of freedom seeker George's escape from slavery.</p> <p>In September 1846, the crew of the <em>Ottoman</em>, a ship from New Orleans, discovered a stowaway named George within <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>. Following this discovery, the captain of the <em>Ottoman</em>, James Hannum, took George under guard to Spectacle Island. Captain Hannum stopped in one of the island's hotels for a \"drop of consolation.\" While the captain grabbed his drink, George escaped from the guard, stole Hannum's small boat, and took off for South Boston. Captain Hannum immediately realized what happened and grabbed another boat to give chase. Describing the pursuit first by boat, then on foot, Hannum wrote: \"we took off after him, through corn-fields and over fences till finally after a chase of two miles I secured him just as he reached the bridge.\"<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Word of George's story spread quickly among Boston's abolitionist community and they obtained a warrant for Hannum's arrest under the charges of kidnapping. Knowing he had to act quickly, Hannum located the <em>Niagara</em>, a ship bound for New Orleans that would take George back to enslavement. As he transferred George to the <em>Niagara</em>, Hannum realized that abolitionists had acquired a boat and were quickly gaining on his ship. Describing the scene Hannum wrote, \"No sooner had I left the bark than I discovered a steamer making directly for us. Knowing she could chase but one, I steered a course opposite to the Niagra‚Ä¶Bayonets glistened in all parts of the boat...\"<sup>4</sup> Unfortunately, the abolitionists followed Hannum's ship instead of the <em>Niagra </em>and were not able to secure George's freedom.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/45dbafda-8842-4e2f-be48-b21516d829a4\"><img alt=\"Newspaper clipping regarding a letter from Capt.

Hannum. (Credit: The Emancipator, New York, New York, Oct. 7, 1846.)</em></p> <p>In 1857, a man named Nahum Ward purchased the island in order to build a horse-rendering plant. This plant opened shortly after the Civil War; it processed thousands of deceased horses from the city and converted hair, hides, hooves, and bones into other products.<sup><font>5</font></sup></p> <p>In the 1880s and 1890s, a fertilizer company and glue factory joined Ward's plant on Spectacle Island, with the addition of a grease-reclamation facility in 1911.<sup>6</sup> At this time, many workers lived on the island. In 1889, 30 men worked on the island and 13 families lived on the island.<sup>7</sup> By the 1920s, the community grew to more than 100 people and even included a school.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>In the 1920s, most of the existing plants and factories closed. By this time, only the grease-reclamation factory remained. This factory processed garbage, removing grease for soap before using the remaining waste as fill on the island. By the 1930s, the need for grease dwindled and so the final factory on Spectacle Island shut down.</p> <p>Bostonians still needed a place for their waste. From 1935 to 1959, Spectacle Island became the city‚Äôs dump, bringing 350 tons of waste to the island daily.<sup>9</sup> In this time, the island grew by almost 36-acres.<sup>10</sup> The dump on Spectacle Island sat exposed, with trash seeping into the harbor, until 1992 when the \"Big Dig\" began in Boston. The Central Artery/Tunnel Project brought sediment to Spectacle Island to cap off the landfill and turn the island from an abandoned garbage dump to a park.</p> <p>In 2006, after years of work and the planting of thousands of trees and shrubs, Spectacle Island opened to the public. The island now serves as a great escape from the bustling city-life of Boston with a marina, visitor center, and swimming beach.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-spec.htm\">Island Facts: Spectacle Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Emily and David Kales, <em>All About the Boston Harbor Islands</em> (Cataumet, MA: Hewitts Cove Publishing Co., Inc., 1983), 22.</li> <li>David Kales, <em>The Boston Harbor Islands: A Story of Urban Wilderness</em> (Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2007), 73.</li> <li>\"Capt.

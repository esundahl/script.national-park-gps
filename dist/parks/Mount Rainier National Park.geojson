A cloud on the summit may appear harmless from this perspective, but it is probably lashing climbers with an intense, localized blizzard. At other times the pattern may be reversed: halfway up the mountain, climbers may be emerging from dense mist into a glittering world of sunlit ice. <br /> <br /> If the mountain is temporarily hidden from this overlook, then you have simply become part of its stormy dynamics. Mount Rainier not only creates its own world of weather, but dictates the habitats around it: the dripping moss of the Carbon River rainforest, the massive glaciers, and the rain-shadow that leaves the Sunrise area to the east much drier than the rest of the park. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> This close to Puget Sound and the Pacific, Mount Rainier is a magnet for moisture-laden storm fronts. With its huge mass and elevation, the mountain forces the air to rise steeply. As it rises, it cools and percipitates heavily, often in record-breaking snowfalls on the slopes around Paradise. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo of a glaciated mountain peak rising above forested lower slopes fills the exhibit panel.

By area, it is the third largest glacier on Mount Rainier. Furthermore, it has the largest volume of any glacier on the mountain, a product of its unusual thickness. While most glaciers on the mountain have advanced and then retreated a mile or more, Carbon Glacier exposed only a half mile of deglaciated terrain between 1760 and 1966. This behavior and its thickness are the result of two factors. First, the glacier is well shaded because it is located on the north side of the mountain and surrounded by steep valley walls. Second, the lower end of the glacier is well insulated by rock covering. Both factors reduce melt rates.</p> <p>During one episode in the last major ice age, Carbon Glacier probably flowed into the Puget Sound and merged with the Puget lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Carbon Glacier</strong>: You can see the glacier from several vantage points along the Carbon River trail. From the park entrance at Carbon River, hike or bike along the Carbon River Road (former road closed to vehicles) to Ipsut Creek Campground. Bicycles are not allowed past the campground.

Nestled in the remote northwest area of the park, the Carbon River area is one of the less visited destinations within the park. Since its construction in the 1920s, the Carbon River Road was repeatedly washed out by flooding. After extensive damage from the 2006 Flood, the Carbon River Road was permantely closed to vehicles starting at the park entrance and converted into a trail. <br /> <br /> The <strong>Carbon River Ranger Station</strong> is located in a remodeled historic farmhouse approximately two miles outside of the Carbon River Entrance and 5.5 miles east of the Mowich Lake (SR165) junction. Its location is strategic-- in an area prone to washouts and floods, the ranger station is far enough away from the river that it is not in danger of destruction. Hours can vary depending on the season. Talk with a ranger, pick up a map, or register for a backcountry permit. There are digital information displays inside the ranger station so visitors can learn more about the history of the area. There are no public facilities at the ranger station, but restrooms and picnic tables can be found at the Carbon River Entrance, just a few miles down the road. <br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking & Bicycling</strong><br /> There are a variety of recreation opportunities at Carbon River, whether you want to take a short walk to stretch your legs or go for a bike ride. Bicycles are allowed only on the <strong>Carbon River Trail</strong> (former road) to Ipsut Creek Campground. Several hiking trails begin from along the former road, including the popular day-hiking destinations of <strong>Chenuis Falls</strong> and <strong>Green Lake</strong>. Bike racks are available at all trailheads. Backpackers can continue past Ipsut Creek to connect to the Wonderland Trail or to view the Carbon Glacier. Trail bridges often wash out during the fall and winter. Always check conditions before proceeding.<br /> <br /> Carbon River does not provide direct driving access to any other area of the park. <strong>Mowich Lake</strong> is located nearby via State Route 165. </p>",

Most rainforests occur in tropical areas around the equator. They are steamy jungles full of hanging vines where colorful birds and chattering monkeys live in the forest canopy. Temperate rainforests are very different. They occur in cooler climates, usually nestled between the ocean and coastal mountain ranges. Only a few can be found inland, like the rainforest here at Mount Rainier. Temperate rainforests are dominated by evergreen conifers carpeted with an abundance of mosses and ferns. Here, more animals live on the forest floor than in the forest canopy, including black bear, long- and short-tailed weasel, black-tailed deer, bobcat, and coyote.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel against a solid green background.

These tall trees are battered by winds and storms, which sometimes knock them to the ground.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Marbled murrelets reside at sea but raise their young in the moss-covered limbs of large rainforest trees. These birds travel from Mount Rainier to Puget Sound to fish for their families, making the 70-mile round-trip flight each day. A seabird, the marbled murrelet is not the best at forest landings. It relies on the sturdy limbs of old growth trees to provide support for hard, fast landings and sharp, drop launches.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text of the exhibit panel stretches across the top third of the panel against a solid green background. The bottom two thirds of the panel is filled with a photo of a forest canopy with interlocking tree branches against a pale sky. In the upper left corner of the photo against a black band, a caption reads: \"The crowns of the tall trees overlap, forming the upper canopy and shielding the rest of the rainforest from wind and rain, like an umbrella. Some of the moisture from the fog and rain remains trapped beneath this green ceiling.\" On the right side of the exhibit panel, two smaller photos overlap each other and the background photo at slight angles. The top photo shows a small bird with a dark grey back and head with white on the cheeks, throat, and sides floating on still water. The second small photo, located beneath the first small photo, shows a similar bird nesting on a moss-covered tree branch. The secondary text is to the left of the small photos.

Many different mosses, lichens and ferns also thrive here, absorbing water and nutrients from rain and fog.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Since all plants depend on sunlight to some degree, shrubs and other understory plants are most abundant along river and stream banks where the sunlight shines through or in areas where trees have fallen.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel against a solid green background. The bottom two-thirds of the panel is divided between two photos. The photo on the left is of devil's club, a plant with large palmate leaves radiating around a cluster of small red berries at the top of the center stalk. A caption in a black bar at the top of the photo reads: \"Devil's club can grow up to six feet tall in the low light of the understory. Its large, spiny, maple-shaped leaves collect light and moisture. Devil's club requires the boggy, saturated soils of this area to grow.\" The photo on the right is of skunk cabbage, a plant with a flower spike and large green leaves growing directly from a stream bed. The flower is sheltered by a modified leaf that forms a bright yellow hood around the flower spike. A caption in a black bar at the top of the photo reads: \"Named for the strong odor it gives off in the spring, especially when flowering, skunk cabbage attracts many kinds of insects that help pollinate it.

Surrounded by mountains high enough to trap rainfall coming from the Puget Sound and low enough for mild temperatures, it receives about 70 to 90 inches of rain per year. Most of the rain falls in one long wet season during winter and spring. Summers are fairly dry, with fog providing most of the moisture.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> During the long rainy season, water falls on the tree canopy, trickles to the understory, and seeps into the ground. It then fills rivers, which return water to the ocean. Some of the moisture received by the temperate rainforests is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation. Moist air rises, forms clouds, and falls again as rain in an ongoing process. Big rainforest trees can store a large amount of water, which helps them get through the dry summer season. A single Douglas-fir can hold as much as 5,000 gallons of water.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo fills the exhibit panel, fading towards the top into a solid green background.

Because their skin must stay moist, these amphibians need water or wet surfaces to survive. They also need water to reproduce. The Pacific tree frog breeds in temporary pools of water, wetlands, and ponds, where there are fewer predators. The tailed frog breeds in fast-flowing streams, laying eggs on long, bead-like strings attached to the undersides of rocks.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> In the spring, the distinct \"rib-bit\" of the Pacific tree frog can be heard above the ever-present sound of dripping and rushing water. Sticky toe pads allow this frog to climb nearly-vertical surfaces as it hunts spiders and insects.<br /> <br /> The Pacific giant salamander is the largest terrestrial salamander in North America, growing up to 14 inches long. It lays eggs in hidden underwater chambers in the gravel of a spring, stream, or mountain lake.

The arch was designed as both an entrance portal and an equestrian overpass, to convey hikers and riders on the Pacific Crest Trail. Designed in the NPS Rustic Architecture style using natural materials, the arch is 90 feet long and the deck of the \"bridge\" rests on two cedar logs, 36 inches in diameter. Two more logs, 30 inches in diameter, serve as guardwalls. The stone abutments are masonry, consisting of irregular, mostly five-sided stones gathered from the roadsides. Built in 1936 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the rustic-style arch became deteriorated by the elements and nearly eight decades of use, prompting Mount Rainier National Park to undertake a massive <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/photosmultimedia/chinook-entrance-arch.htm\">restoration project</a> to preserve this historic structure in 2011 and 2012.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> The Chinook Entrance Arch is located near Tipsoo Lake. The area experiences heavy snowfall in winter, with snow lingering well into June or even July. A network of easy trails, suitable for all ages, leads through the subalpine meadows and around the lake. <strong>Naches Peak Loop Trail</strong> is a popular hike. Starting from Tipsoo Lake, the 3.4 mi (5.5 km) trail connects to the Pacific Crest Trail on the eastern edge of the park, crosses over the Chinook Entrance Arch, then returns to Tipsoo Lake. This trail features superb wildflower displays in midsummer, huckleberries in early fall, and brilliant autumn colors. Note that while <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">pets</a> are allowed on the Pacific Crest Trail, they are not permitted on the portion of the loop trail within the park or around Tipsoo Lake. Swimming or wading is not permitted in the lake. Please <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/meadow-preservation.htm\">stay on the trails</a> at all times to avoid damaging the delicate meadow plants. Picnic tables are available near the parking area.<br /> <br /> Tipsoo Lake can experience heavy visitation and parking can be limited.

From the 1920s to the early 2000s, park concessioners operating out of the Guide House led guided climbs up the mountain. Today the building houses the park’s Climbing Information Center. While the building’s stone and timber construction is typical of the alpine rustic architecture of the 1920s and the 1930s, the gambrel roof is unusual. In the 1927 photograph, professional guides with ropes and ice axes line up in front of the Guide House.<br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> The text fills the top half of the exhibit panel against a grey background that crossfades into a black and white photo of the front of a wood building filling the lower half of the panel. The building has at least two stories with three large windows on the second story and a large window and a white door on the first story. A ladder from the second story is pulled up and tied against the building. Above the first story window and door is a large sign reading “Guides – Equipment – Auditorium”. Lined up in front of the building is a row of men, with one woman on the far left. All the men wear a matching outfit of pants tucked into tall boots, a dark shirt with sleeves rolled to the elbow, a handkerchief tied around the neck, and a coil of rope slung across the chest. Each holds an ice axe with the handle resting on the ground in front. The woman wears a similar dark shirt and handkerchief with a knee length skirt and does not have the rope or ice axe.

        "notes": "Columbia Crest Glacier\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/columbia-crest-glacier.htm\n\n<p>Columbia Crest is the name of the summit of Mount Rainier and the Columbia Crest Glacier occupies the summit crater. This name was suggested by H.E. Holmes of the E.S. Ingraham climbing party of 1891. The party spent two nights on the summit and before leaving jointly chose the name for it. It was believed at the time that the summit was the highest point in the United States. It was called Crater Peak by Hazard Stevens and PB Van Trump, who climbed the mountain in 1870. A report published in the Seattle Telegraph July 28, 1894, notes that Frank W. Hawkins named it Columbia Crest while he was a member of Ingraham's July 18, 1894, climb of the peak.</p> <p>Though most ice in the summit region flows to large glaciers below, some is confined to the crater at the mountain's summit. Distinct from other glaciers on Mount Rainier, the Columbia Crest Glacier is situated in and between the east and west rims of the volcano, which restricts outward flow.</p> <p>The crater, produced by volcanic eruptions, is a depression into which snow falls and is converted to ice. Since the crater tilts to the east, some ice and meltwater does flow into the Cowlitz-Ingraham watershed. However, much of the ice loss is caused by high ground temperatures that melt the ice, producing a maze of steam-riddled snow caverns.</p> <p>Climbers have often taken refuge from storms by descending into the caves from entrances along the crater rim. Geologist Eugene Kiver and Martin Mumma mapped over a mile (1.2 km) of passageways and found a network of tunnels at slopes of 30 to 40 degrees. Geologist Paul Kennard used radar to determine the thickness of the glacier and found it to be about 200 feet (60 m) thick.</p> <p><strong>Viewing the Columbia Crest Glacier</strong>: Because of its location, access to the Columbia Crest Glacier is limited to experienced climbers. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/climbing.htm\">Learn more about climbing at Mount Rainier</a>.</p> <p><strong>Columbia Crest Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 0.067 ± 0.005 square miles (0.172 ± 0.012 km2) (Rank: 27 of 29 glaciers on Mount Rainier)</li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 14,393 feet (4,387 m)</li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 14,146 feet (4,312 m)</li> <li>Elevation Range: 248 feet (76 m)</li> <li>Length: 0.43 miles (0.68 km)</li> <li>Average Slope: 9.99°</li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): East (96°)</li> <li>Glacier Type: S - Glacier Head Near Summit</li> </ul>",

Part of this plan was to provide more accommodations for daytime use and relocate overnight camping out of sensitive meadow areas, resulting in a proposal for 1,200 new camp and picnic sites in the park. Originally, one of these proposed areas would be at Klickitat Creek on the east side of the park, but officials chose Cougar Rock instead.

Trash cans are located near each of the restrooms for you to clean up and dispose of all waste. Never feed any wildlife or leave food unattended to avoid wild animals getting food that could make them sick or cause them to act aggressively. Please empty wastewater in sinks and deposit any solid food waste into trash cans. Potable water is located at each of the restrooms. While there are grills throughout the picnic area, open fires are not allowed outside of the grills, and you must follow any fire restrictions in place. Pets must be on a leash, not more than six feet (1.8 meters) in length or in a crate/cage at all times. Pets are allowed along the road and paved sidewalks and may join you at your picnic at tables. <strong>Pets are not allowed on any trails</strong> in Mount Rainier National Park. There are many small, maintained paths to get to and between picnic tables.

Separated by a rocky ridge named Cathedral Rock, the two glaciers merge at the 6,700 foot (2,200 meter) elevation to create a single stream of ice that flows down into the Middle Fork Cowlitz River valley. Below the ridge, a ribbon of rocky debris called a medial moraine produces a dark streak in the middle of the glacier. Further down the glacier are a series of concentric debris-covered ridges called ogives.</p> <p>More than 35,000 years ago, the ancestral Cowlitz Glacier merged with several other glaciers to become a single stream of ice that flowed nearly 62 miles (100 km) from the mountain's summit. By the end of the Little Ice Age, a little over a 100 years ago, the glacier had retreated to within 5.9 miles (9.5 km) of the summit. By 1994, the longest segment of the glacier was less than 4.4 miles (7 km) long.</p> <p>Cowlitz is the name of many geographical features in the State of Washington including those within Mount Rainier National Park. The Cowlitz people are one of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/historyculture/associated-tribes-of-mount-rainier.htm\">associated tribes</a> of Mount Rainier. The name appears in print as early as the Lewis and Clark journals of 1805 where it was written as 'Cowliskee.' The word is said to mean '...capturing the medicine spirit.' Locations named Cowlitz begin on the Cowlitz Glacier on the southeast side of Mount Rainier and continue in the Cowlitz River, which flows south into Cowlitz County.</p> <p>Ingraham Glacier was named by Professor I.C. Russell in 1896 for Edward Sturgis Ingraham of Seattle, an early mountaineer. He climbed Mount Rainier eleven times often serving as a guide.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Cowlitz and Ingraham Glaciers: </strong>These glaciers can be viewed from the top of Panorama Point or from along the Skyline Trail in the Paradise Area.

If entering Longmire from the Nisqually Entrance, drive past the National Park Inn, and turn right at the two-story building with the flagpole. Continue straight through the employee housing area and across the historic Longmire Suspension Bridge over the Nisqually River. The trailhead is located 300 feet past the suspension bridge. There is a small pullout for parking near the trailhead or continue a short distance down the road to park in front of the Longmire Community Building.<br /> <br /> Eagle Peak Trail is 7.2 miles roundtrip with 2,955 feet of elevation gain. For the first two miles the trail ascends steeply through dense forest to a small stream, then continues another mile to a meadow. Beyond the meadow the trail is much steeper and rocky as it climbs the final 0.5 mile to the 5,700 feet saddle where the trail ends. Use extreme caution when you reach the saddle. This area is exposed and a fall could be deadly. Snow can also linger well into June, with dangerous snow cornices possibly hiding the edges of the cliffs.<br /> <br /> This peak was originally known as Sim-layshe, a Native American word for eagle. When the Longmire family settled nearby, George Longmire anglicized the name to Eagle Peak. From the Eagle Peak Saddle look north for views of Mount Rainier and the buildings in the Paradise Area. Look south for panoramic views of the Nisqually River Valley and surrounding Cascade Range, with Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams in the distance. Subalpine meadows along the trail on the final approach to the saddle can have excellent wildflower displays in summer, with peak bloom typically in late July/early August.<br /> <br /> While Longmire is open year-round, snow can make this trail hazardous in winter. Winter hikers and snowshoers must have experience with navigation and avalanche terrain. <br /> <br /> <b>Backpacking</b><br /> There is no designated camp along this trail nor atop the Tatoosh Range.

Instead of the smooth sweep of the Emmons Glacier from the summit down to the valley floor, the northeast face of the volcano would have been broken up with craggy buttresses and ridges, much as the other sides of the volcano appear today. However, 5,600 years ago the summit and northeast flank of Mount Rainier collapsed in a gigantic avalanche during an eruption, forming a fast-moving slurry ofmud and debris called the Osceola Mudflow, which washed up as high as the present site of the Sunrise Visitor Center. You may remember seeing some of the loose Osceola sediment in the hillside road cuts as you drove up the road. The eruption that created the Osceola Mudflow left a large horseshoe-shaped crater in the northeast flank of the volcano, much like the crater left on the north flank of Mount St. Helens after the 1980 eruption. The enormous Osceola Mudflow had a total volume of about a cubic mile. The mudflow filled the valleys of theWhite River system to depths of 300 feet or more and flowed more than sixty miles to the Puget Sound. Carolyn Driedger, with the United States Geologic Survey:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Mount Rainier has an east-west fracture zone across its summit and that’s where magma has risen in the past and as it has risen in there it has baked the surrounding rocks... The surrounding rocks were bathed in a weakly acidic solution of sulfuric acid and that actually transformed the chemistry of the rocks, transforming the rocks from a hard rock to a soft clay... The fact that it was hydrothermally altered made the slide much more extensive than it would have been otherwise, and it slid much further down valley. Most of the hydrothermally altered rock on the east side of Mount Rainier was carried down in that mighty Osceola mudflow. The west side of the mountain and the summit still contain a fair amount of hydrothermally altered rock and that creates a hazard for people who live on the Puyallup river valley on the west side of the volcano because the rock remains and will fall someday.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Subsequent lava eruptions filled-in the horseshoe-shaped crater left by the Osceola mudflow, forming the smooth summit cone of the volcano that you see today. Glaciers reformed on the peak, but have not yet had time to carve the volcano into the craggy forms visible on other sides of the mountain. Instead, the expanse of the Emmons Glacier smoothly wraps around the northeast side of Mount Rainier.<br /> <br /> A <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/emmons-vista-overlook-1-wayside.htm\">wayside exhibit panel</a> provides additional information about Mount Rainier.

Can you see the terminus of the glacier? It's almost hidden beneath rocks and debris, so it can be hard to spot. In 1963, a rockfall from Little Tahoma Peak covered the lower glacier with debris, which continues to insulate the ice from melting. As a result of decreased melting, the glacier advanced rapidly in the mid-1960s and repeatedly in the following decades. <br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> A glacier advances when more snow accumulates than is lost. Snow compresses to ice, and debris collects on the glacier. When the terminus and the sides of the glacier recede due to melting, they leave behind piles of rubble called terminal and lateral moraines. <br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A single photo of Mount Rainier and the White River Valley fills the bottom two thirds of the exhibit panel, with the text stretching across the top third against a green background. From the summit, the Emmons Glacier descends the mountain, filling the whole width of the valley, before ending in a rock-covered terminus where a river emerges.

A large rocky peak on the left flank of the mountain, above the Emmons Glacier, is labeled \"Little Tahoma\". A smaller image overlays the right side of the photo. It shows a side-profile graphic of a glacier on a mountain slope, with a dotted white line marking a point halfway down the glacier. The section above the dotted line (uphill side) is labeled \"accumulation zone\", while the section below the line (downhill side) is labeled \"ablation (melting) zone\".

It covers 4.3 square miles and is the largest glacier by area not only on Mount Rainier but also in the contiguous United States. The present terminus of the Emmons Glacier is not where the white snow and ice ends, but rather is where the river becomes visible emerging from the dark colored, rock-covered ice front. From here you can see the uppermost Winthrop Glacier, which flows northward from the triangular-shaped Steamboat Prow to form the headwaters of the West Fork of the White River. Carolyn Driedger, U.S. Geologic Survey:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>“Much of the appearance of the glacier that we see today has been determined by an event that happened in 1963... Rock fell off Little Tahoma peak on the left side of the glacier, rolled down onto the surface, completely covered the lower glacier, and came part way down the valley... Because of that 1963 rock fall that brought so much rock onto the lower portion of the Emmons glacier, the Emmons glacier has a lot more rock on it, a lot more rock within it, and so the moraines here are a little bit higher than they might have been otherwise.”</em></p> <p>Moraines are piles of rock, sand, and silt left behind by glaciers as they carve the landscape. There are several different types of moraines visible from the Emmons overlooks. The terminal moraine forms at the end, or terminus, of the glacier where rocks and other materials picked up by the glacier during times of glacier advance are left behind when the glacier ice melts away, or retreats. Lateral moraines accumulate similarly along the sides of glaciers. A few hundred years ago, the Emmons Glacier extended much farther down the White River Valley than it does today. As it melted and retreated up valley, it left terminal and lateral moraines that you can see below. The small milky-green ponds visible at the bottom of the valley are formed from melt water from ice that broke off from the retreating glacier and was left behind in the core of older terminal moraines. The large, steep lateral moraines skirting the edges of the White River valley were actually left by Little Ice Age glaciers 200–500 years ago. Carolyn Driedger:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>“I like to say to people that the Mount Rainier your grandparents see is a little bit different from what you will see and what your grandchildren will see because we have rock fall and changes in the glaciers and sometimes we have volcanic eruptions.”</em></p> <p>These modern-day moraines will eventually erode away or perhaps be buried by lavas or other volcanic deposits from Mount Rainier, just like the moraine layers left behind by ancestral glaciers. Future volcanic eruptions and lahars will reshape the mountain and its surrounding valleys. For thousands of years, the mountain has been built up and torn down by volcanic forces, and sculpted and molded by glaciers. These processes leave a mark, and the evidence is visible on a grand scale throughout Mount Rainier National Park.<br /> <br /> A <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/emmons-vista-overlook-2-wayside.htm\">wayside exhibit panel</a> provides additional information about Mount Rainier.

Called the Osceola Mudflow, it was the largest mudflow originating from Mount Rainier in the last 10,000 years. <br /> <br /> The towering wall of mud and rock thundered down the valley at up to 50 miles per hour, temporarily filling the White River Valley with up to 600 feet of rock, clay, water, and ice. As the mudflow left the mountains, it spread out to form the Enumclaw Plain and plunged into Puget Sound. <br /> <br /> The Osceola Mudflow destroyed the top of Mount Rainier, lowering it by as much as 1,000 feet. Since that time, at least five immense landslides have sent massive mudflows down Mount Rainier, while eruptions of lava quickly filled the huge crater left by the Osceola collapse. <br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> Powerful mudflows have swept down Mount Rainier repeatedly, perhaps without warning.

Park in the day hiking and climbing parking area. Do not park in a campsite or block any campsites. Parking is limited and can fill early on sunny summer days. Have an alternate destination in mind. There is a restroom and water fountain located near the day parking area. The trail begins in the D loop of the campground. The White River Road to access the campground is open to vehicles during the summer only.<br /> <br /> This route was once an old mining road which was rehabilitated for trail use. Although an effort was made to mine copper ore in this area in the late 1800s, nothing of commercial value was ever extracted and mining efforts were eventually suspended. The trail follows the White River for 3.5 miles. One mile beyond the trailhead is a junction with the <strong>Emmons Moraine Trail</strong>. This one-mile round-trip spur trail leads to a viewpoint which overlooks the Emmons Glacier, the largest glacier in the 48 contiguous United States. At first the ascent is gradual but becomes steeper on the final section before entering <strong>Glacier Basin</strong>. A climber's track continues past Glacier Basin camp, passing through an area of fragile wetland plants to the base of the Inter Glacier. A trail also connects the Glacier Basin Trail to Sunrise via the Burroughs Mountain Trail. From Glacier Basin, look for mountain goats on the surrounding slopes and climbers ascending the Inter Glacier to Steamboat Prow. Please stay on the trail to protect the vegetation. Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wilderness Camping</strong><br /> Campsites at Glacier Basin are popular with climbers who are beginning their ascent of Mount Rainier.

Built in 1918, the lodge mirrored the Paradise Inn's rustic design, with a steeply pitched roof for shedding snow and shingle siding with log facade. It overlooked the Paradise Valley and the Tatoosh Range and provided a commanding view of Mount Rainier. <br /> <br /> Services offered here were an economical alternative to meals and accommodations at the nearby Paradise Inn. The lodge was demolished in the mid-1950's to make way for additional parking. <br /> <br /> In 2006, prior to construction of the visitor center, archeologists explored this site for remains of the lodge. Along with sections of the original building's foundation they found flooring and structural basement components, plus articles left behind by early visitors and employees including ski pole baskets, glass, dinnerware, a partially full whiskey bottle, and other personal items. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Marking History: Four pieces of the original foundation mark the corners of the lodge in the landscaping before you. On either side of you, in the plaza surface, rock continues the outline with the remaining outline buried beneath the visitor center behind you. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The whole exhibit panel is filled with a single historic, sepia-tinted photo of the Paradise Camp Lodge. On the right side of the photo is a three story, \"L\"-shaped wood building with a steeply-pitched shingle roof. Numerous old-fashioned cars are parked in rows in front of the building, with platform tents set up to the left side of the building. The Tatoosh Range, a ridge of rocky mountain peaks, rises above the area in the background of the photo. Overlaying the background photo, the main text stretches across the top third of the panel on the left side, with the secondary text on the right side. Just below the secondary text is a small diagram map showing the rectangular outline of the current Henry M. Jackson Visitor Center. An outline of the Paradise Camp Lodge footprint overlaps the visitor center footprint on the left side at a diagonal. The four corners of the lodge footprint not obscured by the visitor center are marked by red dots. Below the diagram, text reads: \"Diagram of the footprint of the new visitor center overlying the footprint of the former Paradise Camp Lodge Building.\" On the left side of the panel under the main text, a second small photo shows three people excavating a trench in a construction area.

Between 1933 and 1934, the CCC built a cabin in the Carbon River District at the mouth of Ipsut Creek. They were also probably involved in the construction of the Three Lakes Patrol Cabin in 1934.</p> <p>The Huckleberry Creek cabin measures 13 feet 8 inches by 21 feet 10 inches and was built similarly to the \"Standard Plan for Patrol Cabins\" designed by the NPS Western Division, Branch of Plans and Design. The major difference between the Huckleberry Creek cabin and the standard plan is the full-length open porch extending across its front facade. Containing simply a dirt floor, the porch measures 7 feet by 21 feet 10 inches.</p> <p>A plan to construct ranger cabins and trail shelters around the mountain evolved during the brief superintendency of Roger W. Toll (1919-1920.) This plan was carried out between 1922 and 1934 largely during the administration of Superintendent Major O.A. Tomlinson. Acting Chief Architect W. G.

The meadows of Indian Henry's Hunting Ground were visited often by the Nisqually and Cowlitz tribes in the mid-19th century. A mountain guide named Indian Henry, or Soo-Too-Lick, hunted a great deal in the meadow that bear his name. From there he guided James Longmire and other explorers in their search for routes through the Cascades.  </p> <p>By the turn of the century, tourist visitation to Indian Henry's had increased. This resulted in the construction of a tent \"hotel\" known as Wigwam Camp. Built in 1908 by George Hall and Sue Longmire, the camp was the third tourist facility established in the park after the Longmire Hotel and Reese’s Camp of the Clouds at Paradise. However, the camp was abandoned in 1918 as were other plans for developing tourist facilities at Indian Henry’s. Nevertheless, there was still a need for the presence of backcountry patrols which resulted in the construction in 1915-16 of a ranger station at Indian Henry’s.  </p> <p>Major alterations to the cabin occurred between 1970-79, when the rear shed was removed, a new front porch constructed, new base logs installed, roof re-shingled, new window frames and doors installed, and the log and wood post foundation was replaced with stone infill and concrete piers. The cabin is elevated off the ground which allows for ventilation during spring snow melt that deters log deterioration.</p>",

The road crosses the former Kautz Creek immediately to the west of the parking lot. The creek jumped to a new channel in the floods of 2006 and now crosses the road to the east of the parking lot. Restroom facilities (vault toilets), picnic tables, and a short interpretive trail leading to an overlook of the mountain are available at Kautz. The trail is also an access point for the 97-mile round-the-mountain Wonderland Trail, Indian Henrys, and Devils Dream backcountry camp. A wilderness camping permit is required for overnight stays in the backcountry.<br /> <br /> The interpretive trail tells of the influence of dynamic glacier-covered Mount Rainier on the landscape at Kautz. Follow the trail to learn about how mudflows and floods have scarred the area, and how vegetation heals the scar after each major event. Staying on trails allows forests to recover naturally. This forest will continue to recover until the next disturbance occurs. The boardwalk is approximately 0.10-mile-long, 5.5 feet wide, and starts by crossing the road at the crosswalk. It has a flat surface with two sloped sections.<br /> <br /> When visiting this area be aware that debris flows, and glacial outburst floods can occur at any time and without warning, eroding stream banks and scouring everything in their path, including rocks and trees. If an earthquake occurs or you hear a prolonged rumbling, move quickly uphill, at least 100 feet above the riverbed.</p>",

Today only a small clear stream flows here. Kautz Creek has moved.<br /> <br /> In early November 2006, record rainfall caused debris flows in several areas of the park. Just upstream from here, one of these flows rerouted Kautz Creek. Coming to a stop at a high and narrow point in the creek bed, the debris flow dammed the creek. Diverted by this barrier, the rain-swollen creek carved a new course to the east through the forest.<br /> <br /> Do the changes at Kautz Creek hint at the future of Mount Rainier's landscape? Since 2001, park scientists have recorded an increased number of debris flows from small, south-facing glaciers. Scientists suggest this increase may be linked to climate change- when changing weather patterns cause glaciers to melt, debris flows become more common. As climate change reconfigures the glaciers and restructures weather patterns, the landscape of Mount Rainier will continue to be reshaped.</p> <p><strong>Secondary Text</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"Glacier-generated debris flows at Mount Rainier travel downstream at speeds of 10 to 20 miles per hour or more... These flows typically have steep, bouldery snouts-- up to 30 to 60 feet high in the most constricted parts of a stream valley-- followed by a churning mass of mud, rock, and vegetation. Their deafening noise is often accompanied by strong local wind, thick dust clouds, and violent ground shaking.\"</em><br /> - Joseph Walder and Carolyn Driedger, United States Geologic Survey (USGS)</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> The exhibit panel has a green background, with the main text in a column on the left third of the panel.

A caption in the lower right corner of the photo reads: \"Kautz Creek before the flood and rechanneling.\" A secondary caption below the photo reads: \"Kautz Creek is made up of glacial melt water.

It is long and fairly narrow as it leads from the top of Mount Rainier to its snout at Mildred Point.</p> <p>On July 8, 1857, Wapowety of the Nisqually people, led a group of soldiers out of Fort Steilacoom bound for the summit of Mount Rainier. Over the course of eight days the party, consisting of Wapowety, Augustine V. Kautz, Dr. O. R. Craig and four other soldiers, made their way up the Nisqually River Valley to an elevation near 6,000 feet. There they set up camp in preparation for a summit attempt.</p> <p>The next morning the party set out for the summit. They made their way up the ridge now known as Wapowety Cleaver and then onto the ice of the Kautz Glacier. One by one the party began to falter due to a mix of snow blindness, fatigue, and altitude issues. Finally, at approximately 6:00 pm, the last team members turned around somewhere near 12,000 feet.</p> <p>In Kautz’s words, “Finally we reached what may be called the top, for although there were points higher yet, the mountain spread out comparatively flat and it was much easier to get along... It was after 6 o’clock and the ice was forming in my canteen and to stay on the mountain at such a temperature was to freeze to death as we brought no blankets with us.”</p> <p>While that party did not reach the summit first, that honor goes to P.B. Van Trump and Hazard B. Stevens, they climbed fairly high on the volcano and have features on Mount Rainier named after them.</p> <p>Although the Kautz Glacier is one of the smallest on the mountain, it is a significant player in the recent geologic history of the park. Twice during the last century the Kautz Glacier was the cause of major debris flows. In October 1947, water abruptly drained from underneath the glacier, ripping away a section of glacier over 1 mile (1.2 km) in length and gouging a 320 feet (100 m) deep canyon into the valley once occupied by the ice. Downstream the water mixed with rock, trees, and other debris to form a fast- moving slurry that flowed across the park road almost 6.2 miles (10 km) away. In August 2001, water bursting from Kautz glacier produced a debris flow that flowed over a ridge and into Van Trump Creek.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Kautz Glacier</strong>: The best views of Kautz Glacier can be found at Mildred Point. To reach the point, take the Comet Falls Trail, which starts from the small parking lot along the Nisqually-Paradise Road just west of Christine Falls. Follow the trail past Comet Falls to reach the junction with the trail to Mildred Point.</p> <p><strong>Kautz Glacier Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>): </strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 0.603 ± 0.034 square miles (1.561 ± 0.088 km2) (Rank: 16 of 29 glaciers on Mount Rainier) </li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 14,131 feet (4,307 m) </li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 6,917 feet (2,108 m) </li> <li>Elevation Range: 7,213 feet (2,199 m) </li> <li>Length: 2.59 miles (4.17 km) </li> <li>Average Slope: 29.39° </li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): South southwest (193°)  </li> <li>Glacier Type: S - Glacier Head Near Summit </li> </ul>",

The cabin that stands in the location today was constructed in 1982, adjacent to the original. Windows, doors, decking, and interior fixtures and furniture were salvaged for use in the new cabin. The original cabin was dismantled and removed shortly thereafter. Since it has been re-built, the cabin does not contribute to the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District.</p>",

Volcanic mineral springs create a rare low elevation meadow surrounded by forest, tucked in a valley between lava ridges. Stumbling across the meadow in the late 1800s, the area around the meadow became James Longmire's homestead. The Longmire family later developed lodging and a mineral springs resort. With the establishment of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, the Longmire area became the park headquarters. Although park headquarters are no longer at Longmire (current park administration offices are located at Tahoma Woods outside of the park along SR 706), the original 1916 headquarters building houses a museum that tells the story of the early days of the park. Across the street from the museum, the \"newer\" Longmire Administration Building, completed in 1930, still holds offices for park staff and is home to the <strong>Longmire Wilderness Information Center</strong>.

Along the trail view bubbling mineral springs and learn about the Longmire family and early park settlers. The Trail of the Shadows is located across the main road from the National Park Inn. The portion of the loop trail closest to the road is dirt and gravel and suitable for wheelchair users with help, including a short spur trail into the meadow with a view of Mount Rainier. The far side of the loop trail is broken by tree roots and and includes a short section of boardwalk. <br /> <br /> Explore Longmire's developed area by following the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/longmire-historic-district-walking-tour.htm\">Longmire Historic District Walking Tour</a>, viewing examples of National Park Service Rustic Architecture, including the picturesque Longmire Administration Building.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/eagle-peak.htm\">Eagle Peak Trail</a> (7 miles roundtrip) is a steep climb through old-growth forest with great views of Mount Rainier, Nisqually Glacier, and the Tatoosh Range.

The Rampart Ridge lava flow appears as a forested hillside to the lower left of the mountain.<br /> <br /> The historic Longmire Community Building is visible on the opposite side of the parking area. Closed to the public, the community building served as the social activity center at Longmire for many years. Constructed in 1927, the architect Thomas Vint used materials from inside the park whenever possible to achieve the famous \"NPS rustic\" style of architecture. Standing in front of the Longmire Community Building, you can clearly see how the rock foundations of the historic building match the rounded boulders of the Nisqually River. National Park Service buildings are designed to integrate into the scenery. Keep an eye out for NPS rustic construction elsewhere at Longmire and throughout Mount Rainier National Park.<br /> <br /> The Mount Rainier Valor Memorial is located a 50-foot walk south past the Longmire Community building across the gravel road. This cluster of stone pillars memorializes the park employees who have given their lives to save others at Mount Rainier National Park.<br /> <br /> The Longmire Community Building is still used by federal employees for meetings, lectures, and training classes at Mount Rainier National Park.

As distinctive as the surrounding landscape, these structures were designed and situated to blend into their natural setting. Inspired by frontier buildings of the Pacific Northwest, the structures incorporate local materials - massive logs, glacial boulders, and native plant landscaping. <br /> <br /> \"<em>In an area in which the preservation of the beauty of Nature is a primary purpose, always design buildings that are not only attractive to look upon, but also appear to belong to, and be a part of, their settings.</em>\" - Stephen T.

Pick up a tour map at the museum for this one-hour stroll. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main exhibit text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel against a green background. Underneath the main text on the left side, a map titled \"Historic Longmire Walking Tour\" takes up most of the panel. Two smaller photographs, slightly overlapping, are stacked on the right side of the panel. The map has simplified 3D renderings of the main buildings along the walking tour. The main road is oriented roughly vertical on the right side of the map with a side road extending horizontally to the left. Next to the main road and above the side road, buildings are labeled General Store, National Park Inn, Former Gas Station, and Museum. A point in front of the gas station is labeled \"You are here\". Next to the museum along the side road is the Library, with the Administration Building across the side road. The side road cuts between two clusters of buildings: several large buildings labeled \"maintenance area\" and a patch of small houses labeled \"residential area\". The side road crosses the Nisqually River Suspension Bridge and curves to parallel the river to the Community Building. A green line, marking the path of the tour, starts from the General Store and follows the side road through Longmire to the Community Building. The secondary text is tucked into the upper left corner of the map. The top photo on the right side of the panel shows the side of Administration Building, with the bottom story built out of large boulders and the top floor built out of large logs. A caption above the photo reads \"Log-framing, rough-lapped wood siding, and cedar shake roofs are important elements of the National Park Service rustic style.\" The bottom photo shows a detail of the stone wall, constructed of rounded boulders of various sizes. A caption above the photo reads \"Boulder foundations and stone chimneys are also key characteristics.\" A small box in the lower right corner of the exhibit panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work. Entrance fees were used to produce this exhibit\".<br /> <br /> <strong>Visit This Exhibit Panel</strong><br /> This introductionary exhibit panel to the Longmire Historic District Walking Tour is located at three locations in Longmire: in front of the former gas station (as described here), next to the Longmire Museum, and next to the parking lot behind the National Park Inn. The panels are identical, except for different \"you are here\" markers in the map as appropriate. Longmire is open year-round, but the exhibit panels are removed during the winter.

Early visitors reached the park by horse or carriage over rough, often muddy, roads. Improved roads and the arrival of the first automobile in 1907 simplified access to the mountain experience. In fact, Mount Rainer was selected as the first national park to experiment with automobile access. <br /> <br /> This building, constructed in 1929, was essential to those ealy motorists. It had gas pumps styled in the manner of the time period, with a sheltered bay connecting to a sales and information office. The second floor contains an apartment reached by a rear staircase. <br /> <br /> Today, the service station portrays the history of travel in the park, and serves as an example of the National Park Service's rustic style of architecture. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text against a green background fills the top half of the small, vertically-oriented exhibit panel. The bottom half of the exhibit panel is filled with a black-and-white historic photo of the service station. The service station is a small wood log building with a gabled roof extending over the front of the building to cover a narrow drive through and two tall cylindrical gas pumps set into a stone base. In the photo, a man is pumping gas into an early model automobile parked under the roof of the service station. <br /> <br /> <strong>Visit This Exhibit Panel</strong><br /> The Longmire Service Station exhibit panel is part of the Longmire Historic District Walking Tour. It is located at the junction of the path that leads from the Longmire Museum and the side road that leads to the front of the service station. Longmire is open year-round, but the exhibit panels are removed during the winter. However, you can still pick up a Longmire Historic District Walking Tour map at the Longmire Museum and view the buildings in winter. </p>",

Since time immemorial American Indians have traveled to and from the mountain seasonally to pick huckleberries, hunt, and collect native plants for food and medicinal uses. Prior to the establishment of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, American Indians used the ridges separating major streams as transportation routes to these resource rich parklands.After Mount Rainier’s designation as a national park, it drew visitors looking for recreational activities. As the park’s popularity grew with white settlers in the area, park architects and engineers designed roads, bridges, and buildings that blended with the natural scenery. This type of architecture became known as National Park Service rustic style. Today, our challenge is to accommodate millions of visitors while continuing to preserve park values and resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 1 Secondary Text</b><br /> The Longmire Service Station, built in 1929 along the edge of wilderness. The building was designed with its natural setting in mind; whole logs frame the front porch and the pumps are mounted on an island of glacial stones.As the few remaining NPS rustic style service stations in the United States are altered to accommodate modern vehicles and machinery, this near-original building is a unique example of early national park architecture.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 1 Description</b><br /> The main text fills the top left quadrant of the panel against a pale blue background.

Early travelers surmounted these obstacles using foot and horse trails, which eventually led to the sophistication and ease of railroad travel in the early 1900s. The spectacular mountain landscape that justified Mount Rainier’s designation as a national park—and continues to draw visitors—was a hindrance to early motor travel.<br /> <br /> Trails: Trade Routes and Subsistence - For millennia trails led from the lowlands, up the major river valleys, around the lower slopes of Mount Rainier, over the Cascade Mountains to the east, into the Puget Sound region, and south to the Columbia River. The trails were created and used by ancestors of the Nisqually, Cowlitz, Squaxin Island, Yakama, Puyallup, and Muckleshoot tribes for gathering food, hunting, and trade.<br /> <br /> Horse and Wagon Routes: Access to a Mountain Resort - In 1884, James Longmire constructed a rough trail to a series of mineral springs near here. The Longmire family, the first non-native settlers in what is now Mount Rainier National Park, promoted the medicinal values of the mineral springs and by 1889, had developed a primitive resort that led to the present park community of Longmire. In 1893, the family, aided by five Nisqually Indians, opened the first wagon toll road to Longmire Springs.<br /> <br /> Railways: Comfort and Convenience - In 1904, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad completed a rail line to Ashford, six miles west of the park entrance. Visitors traveled by rail from Tacoma, then boarded the waiting horse drawn carriages for the final leg of the journey to the five-year-old Mount Rainier National Park. The railroad also built and operated the National Park Inn at Longmire in 1906. Mount Rainier quickly became an increasingly popular destination.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 2 Description</b><br /> The text fills the top two-thirds of the panel in two columns against a pale blue background. At the top of the right-side column is a small black and white photo of two horse-drawn wagons in a subalpine meadow in front of a glaciated mountain peak partly hidden by clouds. Rows of people sit in the wagons. A caption below the photo reads “Horses and wagons at Paradise, 1900s.” Further down the column is a historic map of Mount Rainier filled with numerous faint lines of topographic layers and sketched out trails and roads. A caption below the map reads “A 1907 park map showing long used American Indian trails as well as the planned Nisqually Road”. The bottom third of the panel is filled with a historic sepia-toned photo that fades into the blue background of the rest of the panel at the top. The photo, labeled “Longmire Springs 1904” shows a meadow in a forest with Mount Rainier rising in the background over the forest. A wood fence frames the meadow, with a spring with a low stone wall in the middle of the meadow. On the right side of the image is a large, two-story wood building.</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-1.htm\">Panel 1: The Route to Resource Stewardship</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-3.htm\">Panel 3: Roads and Bridges</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-4.htm\">Panel 4: Motoring on the Mountain</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-5.htm\">Panel 5: Transportation Today: Challenge and Opportunity</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-timeline.htm\">Transportation Timeline</a></p>",

The legislation that created the park “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people” also mandated that the land be retained in its natural condition, protected from “injury and spoliation”.<br /> <br /> A provision for the construction of roads and bridle paths allowed Americans to enjoy the new park, but park officials had to determine how to provide access without marring the spectacular scenery. Park architects and engineers developed a design aesthetic that blended roads and structures with the natural landscape, which was delightfully effective.<br /> <br /> Roads and bridges in the park require regular maintenance. Mount Rainier National Park’s road crews clear the road to Paradise year-round and when spring comes, they begin plowing the snowy roads to White River, Sunrise, Ohanapecosh, and Mowich.<br /> <br /> The Road to Paradise: Ricksecker’s Legacy - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was assignedthe task of constructing a park access road in 1903. A route survey along the Nisqually River to Longmire Springs and Paradise was selected, close to the path of Longmire’s original wagon road, which was determined to be unsuitable due to its proximity to the river. Civilian engineer Eugene Ricksecker envisioned a “pleasure road” and designed gentle grades, graceful curves, and a route that followed the natural contours of the terrain.<br /> <br /> Bridges and Buildings: In Harmony with the Landscape - The parkwide road and bridge system was built between 1920 and 1957, featuring natural materials such as local stone and wood. This became the design standard for the National Park Service known as the National Park Service rustic style of architecture. In 1997, Mount Rainier’s historic developed areas, including roads, bridges, buildings, and the Wonderland Trail, were collectively designated a National Historic Landmark District.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 3 Description</b><br /> The text fills the top two-thirds of the panel in two columns against a pale blue background. At the top of the right-side column is a small black and white photo of a dirt road under construction. Several vehicles work on the road, including some tractors, while men stand on the side of the road. At the front of the photo is a vehicle that is an early version of a road grader. It is about the size of a standard car with a metal frame without any siding and has a grading blade attached to the underside between the wheels. A person sits towards the back of the vehicle where the steering wheel is attached. A caption below the photo reads “Surfacing the Nisqually Road, 1929. Originally built using picks and shovels, the road was later resurfaced and widened by the Bureau of Public Roads.” Further down the right-side column is a second photo of a historic drawing of an arched stone road bridge over a waterfall. Text drawn over the bridge reads “Christine Falls Bridge 1928”. A caption below the drawing reads “The Christine Falls Bridge, completed in 1928 to replace a wooden bridge built in 1908, is an excellent example of rustic styling employed to harmonize a structure with its natural setting.” The bottom third of the panel is filled with a historic sepia-toned photo that fades into the blue background of the rest of the panel at the top. The photo shows a river valley with forest covering the left side slopes and rocky cliffs topped in forest on the right side. The cliffs are hand-labeled “Granite Cliffs”. A dotted line drawn on the photo shows a route that crosses the river then climbs up the forested hillside on the left side of the river. It is labeled “proposed road” and terminates at “gap point” at the top of the valley. A caption reads “The Army Corps of Engineers superimposed routes, under the direction of Eugene Ricksecker, onto photographs.”</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-1.htm\">Panel 1: The Route to Resource Stewardship</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-2.htm\">Panel 2: Trails Paved the Way for “Modern” Transportation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-4.htm\">Panel 4: Motoring on the Mountain</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-5.htm\">Panel 5: Transportation Today: Challenge and Opportunity</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-timeline.htm\">Transportation Timeline</a></p>",

Should motor vehicles, which might eventually offer greater access to more Americans, be allowed in national parks? Would their noise, exhaust, and unpredictable drivers spoil the park experience for other visitors? With no easy solution at hand, an experiment was tried in 1907: allowing cars into two national parks on a temporary basis. Mount Rainier, as well as Hot Springs National Park, were chosen for the experiment and the results had a lasting impact throughout America’s national park system.<br /> <br /> Automobiles: An Experiment that Set a Precedent - The decision to experimentally admit automobiles was a response to pressure from Puget Sound area auto clubs and civic boosters for automobile access to the park. The popularity of car travel soon made the automobile policy permanent. Beginning in 1908, drivers were required to register their vehicles, read the automobile regulations, and pay a $5 entrance fee. Within seven years, all national parks were open to vehicle travel.<br /> <br /> The Motor Stage: Camaraderie and Open Roads - A new mode of transportation, the motor stage became available in 1910. Visitors could travel by stage from Tacoma, Seattle, or Ashford to Longmire and Paradise. Sharing the crowded confines of the coaches often created a special camaraderie among passengers. Travel by auto stage declined during the gas and rubber rationing of World War II and by the 1950s had ceased entirely.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 4 Description</b><br /> The text fills the top two-thirds of the panel in two columns against a pale blue background. Towards the top of the left-side column is an image of a historic map of Mount Rainier National Park. The park border is highlighted in green with roads bolded in red. The roads include the road from Nisqually Entrance to Paradise and Westside Road in the southwest corner of the park, and the road to White River and Sunrise in the northeast corner of the park. Other routes and trails are marked with fainter red lines. A caption below the map reads “The regulations in this 1933 guide reminded motorists that, ‘Teams, saddle and pack animals, and ascending motor vehicles have the right-of-way.’” Below the map are two smaller images. A copy of a faded document on the left is captioned “The first automobile permit was issued in Mount Rainier National Park in 1908.” On the right is faded blue image of a deer in front of a mountain within a border shaped like an octagon. Stylized text on the image reads “Mt Rainier National Park 1939.” A caption reads “A Mount Rainier vehicle pass for the 1939 season\". At the bottom of the right-side column is black and white photo of a vehicle passing under a large log archway on a muddy road. The “archway” consists of three large logs supported by a frame of large logs. A caption under the photo reads “Visitors have long been greeted by various entrance arches throughout the park.” The bottom third of the panel is filled with a historic sepia-toned photo that fades into the blue background of the rest of the panel at the top. The photo shows the angled shingle roof of the Paradise Inn, the bottom story hidden by a large snowbank with a tunnel cut into the snow to reach the entrance. On top of the snowbank next to the entrance is posed a dog sled with a team of dogs, while an old-fashioned black bus is parked in front of the inn. The photo is captioned “Concessionaire buses at the Paradise Inn, late 1920s”.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-1.htm\">Panel 1: The Route to Resource Stewardship</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-2.htm\">Panel 2: Trails Paved the Way for “Modern” Transportation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-3.htm\">Panel 3: Roads and Bridges</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-5.htm\">Panel 5: Transportation Today: Challenge and Opportunity</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-timeline.htm\">Transportation Timeline</a></p>",

On summer days, the convenience of private car travel has given way to the frustration of congestion: Visitors often find roads crowded and parking lots full. Balancing the continual growth in visitation with the park’s mission to preserve and protect resources invites problem-solving and innovation.<br /> <br /> Climate Change and Environmental Impacts on Transportation - Climate change affects all aspects of society. Flooding due to weather events has caused washouts and road damage.<br /> <br /> On November 6-7, 2006, heavy rains hammered the park, causing the Nisqually River to rise. Subsequent flooding destroyed part of the road to Paradise, caused parkwide damage to campgrounds, including complete destruction of Sunshine Point Campground, and led to the permanent closure of Carbon River Road.<br /> <br /> Aggradation is a continuing concern for many of the roads in the park. Aggradation is a geologic process where riverbeds rise in elevation due to sediment being deposited by flowing water. Since most of Mount Rainier's large rivers and streams are glacially-fed, roads in the park may be in danger of flooding as the global temperature warms and glaciers recede, which increases sediment availability into the system.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 5 Highlighted Text</b><br /> What kind of experience would you like future visitors to Mount Rainier to have? What can you do now to ensure that future?Overcrowding and pollution combined with the effects of climate change have to potential to cause significant damage to the park’s resources. How do we ensure access for all while protecting those resources?<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 5 Description</b><br /> The text fills the top two-thirds of the panel in two columns against a pale blue background. The highlighted text is in a brown box at the top of the right-side column. Towards the top of the left-side column is a black and white photo of a parking lot filled with cars, surrounded by hillsides covered in patches of meadow and subalpine fir trees. A wood building with a steeply angled roof stands next to the parking lot. A caption below the photo reads “The Paradise area, shown here in 1963, has always been challenged by a shortage of parking. Annual park visitation has grown from an estimated 300 in 1899 to approximately two million. Automobile use has increased at an even greater rate.” Below the black and white photo are two colored photos both showing road damage. The top photo shows a paved road that ends abruptly at a steep bank that is falling into a muddy, raging river. The bottom photo shows a paved road with one edge crumbling off down a steep rocky hillside. The top photo is captioned “The Nisqually Road washed out in the flood of November 2006. Widespread damage caused the park to close for six months.” The bottom photo is captioned “Every area of the park was affected by the 2006 storms. Stevens Canyon Road washed out in three places and required extensive repairs.” The bottom third of the panel is filled with a color photo that fades into the blue background of the rest of the panel at the top. The photo shows a curved road bordered by a low rock wall interspersed by rock crenellations that mimic the roughly triangle-shaped peak of Mount Rainier visible from the road. A woman sits on the rock wall next to the road. A caption reads “A visitor sits at Sunrise Point, a popular stop along the road to Sunrise. In summer, an increase in visitors causes traffic and congestion, a common frustration shared with travelers to the park.”</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-1.htm\">Panel 1: The Route to Resource Stewardship</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-2.htm\">Panel 2: Trails Paved the Way for “Modern” Transportation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-3.htm\">Panel 3: Roads and Bridges</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-panel-4.htm\">Panel 4: Motoring on the Mountain</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longmire-transportation-exhibit-timeline.htm\">Transportation Timeline</a></p>",

Due to the hazardous conditions of the crash location, their remains were never recovered. In 1946, it was the worst accident, in numbers killed aboard an aircraft, in United States aviation history and remains Mount Rainier’s greatest tragedy. The bronze plaque bears the names of the Marines. In the mid 1990s, the road to Round Pass washed out, making the area inaccessible to vehicles.

One of four lookouts remaining in the park, it helped protect the park and surrounding national forests from fire. Located at 7,181 feet in elevation, it is the highest fire lookout in the park.  </p> <p>With their exposed locations, fire lookouts are vulnerable to lightning and windstorms. Shortly after its completion, a windstorm blew off the roof of the Mount Fremont Fire Lookout. </p> <p>This historic lookout was used by firewatchers to spot smoke and lightning strikes and report them by telephone. After World War II, aerial surveillance became the primary mode of fire-spotting. These lookouts, fully equipped for fire detection, are still used occasionally.  </p> <p>The hike along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/mount-fremont-lookout.htm\">Mount Fremont Lookout Trail</a> starts at 6,400 feet elevation at Sunrise and climbs moderately a short distance to the top of Sourdough Ridge.

After completing the road to Paradise in 1915, park officials set plans for a road around the mountain, which included a section named the Westside Road that would connect Carbon River to the Longmire area. The Mowich Lake area was intended as a separate junction and point of attraction along that road. In 1921, the Carbon River Road was constructed, followed by the start of constructing the southern section of the Westside Road in 1926. In 1933, the northern portion of the road via Mowich Lake was completed. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fa98fc2b-7d06-461c-bde9-612f2611dc19}{162}\" paraid=\"584302986\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Within the first few years after being built, all sections of completed road were damaged due to flooding. By 1934, park officials decided against extending Westside Road all the way to Carbon due to the immense cost and potential negative impacts to the landscape. As a result, the Mowich Lake Road wasn’t opened to the public until 1955 and has undergone very little improvement since then. To this day, Mowich Lake is one of the more isolated areas of the park thanks to heavy winters and a rough drive on the unpaved road. Although more difficult to reach, this entrance provides access to remarkable hiking, backpacking, and camping, as well as fishing and boating at Mowich Lake. In the winter, the unplowed road makes a relatively easy snowshoeing route. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{be7ec947-eb55-4cb8-8bf7-67f73e263790}{242}\" paraid=\"1236579311\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"> </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{be7ec947-eb55-4cb8-8bf7-67f73e263790}{252}\" paraid=\"1962867435\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Hiking </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{595fc64d-eb29-44c4-9301-22af3676dbf9}{48}\" paraid=\"1233480145\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Immediately near the national park boundary is the Paul Peak Trailhead. This trail ventures south for 3.1 miles to a junction with the Wonderland Trail. While the trail does not reach the summit of Paul Peak, it features old growth forest, unique views of Mount Rainier, and ample amounts of solitude. Take a right at the Wonderland Trail junction to continue for less than a mile to Mowich River Camp. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{43346001-954c-4487-8a85-c24d4278bd87}{102}\" paraid=\"1160555662\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Continue along the Mowich Lake Road to reach Mowich Lake, which includes trailheads for more popular hikes like the Tolmie Peak Trail and Spray Park Trail. Stream crossings can be particularly hazardous in spring and fall with higher water levels and it is not uncommon for log bridges to be washed out during heavy rain events. Check updates on the conditions of bridges and crossings before your trip, and practice techniques for safe stream crossing. Snow will linger on the trails late into the season, requiring navigation and snow travel knowledge. In the winter, the road itself becomes a popular snowshoeing route. Because this area is so remote, there is no cell service or other connectivity, and help may be difficult to reach in the event of an emergency. Be sure to plan and prepare appropriately for your own safety. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{229bc0ca-b6af-4e9d-a40f-6171fd9e9f5a}{128}\" paraid=\"2020055037\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"> </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{229bc0ca-b6af-4e9d-a40f-6171fd9e9f5a}{148}\" paraid=\"849701340\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Camping </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{229bc0ca-b6af-4e9d-a40f-6171fd9e9f5a}{150}\" paraid=\"77454981\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Five miles up the road is the Mowich Lake Campground, which is the smallest campground in Mount Rainier National Park with only 13 sites. This campground is drive in and first-come, first-served with self-registration. There are no other car camping options nearby within the park. All backcountry camping within park boundaries requires a permit. The closest backcountry camps are Mowich River Camp, Eagle Peak Camp, and Ipsut Creek Camp. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. The nearest ranger station is the Carbon River Ranger Station. Due to high demand during the summer season, it is strongly recommended to make a wilderness permit reservation if you are planning to hike the Wonderland Trail. Hikers doing the complete Wonderland Trail are limited to camping in designated camps only - the use of cross-country zones is not permitted. Treat water before drinking. Fires are prohibited. Pets on a leash are allowed along the Mowich Lake Road and in the developed campground. Pets are not permitted on any trails, including the lakeshore trails.</p>",

It was intended as a temporary headquarters for rangers on patrol of the park 's western boundary and the Wonderland Trail. Aspects of the cabin's log frame, rectangular design with its steeply pitched cedar shake gable roof, saddle notch cornering, and post and beam frame front porch, were incorporated into the construction of future patrol cabins in the park.</p> <p>Prior to 1920, there were very few shelters for backcountry rangers and hikers. In 1919-20, Superintendent Roger Toll reported the need for backcountry shelters to be placed ten to fifteen miles apart along the Wonderland Trail. Toll's system evolved into the construction of both patrol cabins and trail shelters under Superintendent O.A. Tomlinson's administration (1923-41).</p> <p>The Superintendent's annual report for fiscal year 1922 reported the construction by the National Park Service of three patrol cabins on the west side of the park at Mowich Lake, St. Andrews Creek, and at Sunset Park. The Mowich Lake Patrol Cabin is located 0.1 miles east of the junction with the Wonderland Trail after the Mowich Lake Campground.

At only 150 feet from the road to Paradise, Narada Falls is the largest waterfall accessible by car in the park, and one of the most impressive. The area is composed of a parking area with a viewpoint, a stone-faced bridge across the top of the Narada Falls, picnic tables, restrooms, and a trail to a scenic overlook.

The current inn has 25 guestrooms. In addition to overnight guests, the National Park Inn has a restaurant that serves many day users to the park. A general store adjacent to the main inn building provides gifts, basic groceries, firewood sales in the summer, and snowshoe rentals in the winter.<br /> <br /> Part of a National Historic Landmark District, the National Park Inn has a long history of providing shelter to visitors to Mount Rainier National Park. The Longmire area was first developed by Longmire family in the late 1880s, which included the construction of the rustic Longmire Springs Hotel. Originally marketed as a health resort, the hotel invited visitors to partake of the natural volcanic mineral springs found in the Longmire Meadow. Over time the hotel was expanded and rebuilt, including a two-story annex. When the national park was created in 1899, interest in the Longmire area shifted from the mineral springs to using Longmire as a base for exploring Mount Rainier National Park. In 1906 a competing hotel, the National Park Inn, was built by the Tacoma & Eastern Railroad Company under lease by the park. In 1916, the newly formed Rainier National Park Company purchased the Longmire Springs Hotel and Annex, along with the National Park Inn. They dismantled the old Longmire Springs Hotel and moved the annex across the road from its original location and next to the National Park Inn. In 1926, the original National Park Inn burned down, leaving behind the annex and clubhouse. The annex soon became known as the National Park Inn that exists today. The club house is now the general store and gift shop next to the Inn.

        "notes": "Nisqually Glacier\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/nisqually-glacier.htm\n\n<p>Nisqually Glacier is perhaps the most visited and best surveyed glacier on Mount Rainier. Due to easy access and its prominent location on the southwest side of Mount Rainier near Paradise, the glacier has been studied since the mid-1850s.</p> <p>In 1857, Lt. August Kautz crossed Nisqually Glacier during an attempt to climb the summit. In 1884, Allen Mason photographed the glacier for the first time, laying the foundation for a photographic record of the Nisqually Glacier that spans over a century.</p> <p>During the 1930s, Tacoma City Light Department and the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) began a series of measurements of glacial surface elevation to determine the impact of the Nisqually Glacier's retreat on water supplies for hydroelectric power production. USGS and park scientists continue to regularly survey the glacier today.</p> <p>The product of this research is a record of Nisqually Glacier change spanning nearly 150 years. During this time the glacier has retreated and advanced several times, though the general trend has been retreat.</p> <p>In 1857, Kautz wrote in his journal that the terminus reached a narrow rock channel located underneath the present Glacier Bridge on the road to Paradise. By the time Mason began photographing the glacier, the terminus had retreated up the valley 0.2 miles (0.3 km). Photographs taken early in the 1900s show national park visitors posing near the bridge with the glacier clearly visible over their shoulders. By the 1950s, such photographs were not possible since the glacier had retreated nearly 1.2 miles (2 km) up past a curve in the valley and was lost from view to anyone on the road. An advance in the glacier a few years later made it once again visible from the bridge for a short time. However, by the 1970s the glacier had resumed its retreat and again disappeared from view. Since that time the glacier has gone through a series of minor advances and retreats.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Nisqually Glacier</strong>: The best views of the glacier are from the Nisqually Vista Trail in Paradise, which starts from the lower parking lot. It can also be viewed from Glacier Vista, a short spur off the Skyline Trail.</p> <p><strong>Nisqually Glacier Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 1.584 ± 0.086 square miles (4.102 ± 0.222 km2) (Rank: 6 of 29 glaciers on Mount Rainier)</li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 14,371 feet (4,380 m)</li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 5,347 feet (1,630 m)</li> <li>Elevation Range: 9,024 feet (2,751 m)</li> <li>Length: 3.57 miles (5.74 km)</li> <li>Average Slope: 27.00°</li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): South southeast (166°)</li> <li>Glacier Type: S - Glacier Head Near Summit</li> </ul>",

        "notes": "Nisqually Historic Suspension Bridge\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/nisqually-bridge.htm\n\n<b>Season: Year-Round</b><br /> <br /> The Nisqually Suspension Bridge is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the national park system and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Longmire Historic District. Like other structures in the Longmire Historic District, it is an example of “NPS rustic” architecture, a design philosophy that attempts to make park buildings appear as if they belong in the natural spaces where they were built.<br /> <br /> The first light weight suspension bridge was installed across the Nisqually River at this site in 1911. This “pony bridge” quickly became outdated as more of the visitors to the park began to travel by automobile. When superintendent O. A. Tomlinson decided to build a new car-friendly campground on the south bank of the river in the 1920s, a new bridge was needed to support the increased traffic and weight.<br /> <br /> The Longmire location was so remote, the National Park Service received only one bid for the construction of the new Nisqually Bridge. Monson-Trierweiler Co. out of Portland, Oregon, proposed a design that used massive locally sourced vertical logs as suspension supports. A hard winter stretched the construction time to over seven months. Once the bridge was finally completed in 1924 it took over a year to build the Longmire Campground on the opposite bank. The new bridge was first open to public in August 1925 and praised as an example of “NPS rustic” architecture.<br /> <br /> The original logs were pretty but precarious and the log supports were carefully updated with dimensional timber towers in 1952. This work was necessary because of heavier vehicles, increasing use, and changing bridge safety standards across the country. The Nisqually Suspension Bridge is considered the oldest vehicle suspension bridge in the National Park Service because most of its original form has been retained. The majority of the bridge’s timber and hardware was sorted, saved, and reintegrated during the construction in 1952. The only other major change to the bridge design is the addition of a second, lower safety railing.<br /> <br /> The Nisqually Suspension Bridge remains in use but doesn’t see as much traffic as it once did. The road continues to provide access to the Longmire Community Building and the renamed Longmire Stewardship Campground, but these facilities are closed to the public and used only by park volunteers and researchers who contribute to the mission of the National Park Service. With this gentle usage and rigorous upkeep, the bridge can be expected to be in service for decades to come.<br /> <br /> To visit this bridge first go to the Longmire Historic district 12 miles from the southwest Nisqually Entrance. There is no parking at the Nisqually Suspension Bridge, so it is best to find parking at Longmire and continue on foot. The bridge is located less than a quarter of a mile past the Longmire Administrative Building. There is an “S” bend in the road and a small incline before the bridge. Use caution while walking as vehicles share the road. It is also possible to view the Nisqually Suspension Bridge by driving across it. The road is a dead-end but there is space to turn a vehicle around at the Longmire Community Building one-half mile past the bridge.",

In its short (geological) history, Mount Rainier has undergone many changes – sometimes drastic and destructive, sometimes small and barely noticeable. In our even shorter history, humans have interacted with, influenced, and left our marks upon the mountain. Seismic measurements and other data tell us that the mountain is still an active volcano. Warning systems help us manage the risks of volcanic activity and lahars. Continuous monitoring indicates that our climate is warming with impacts to the glaciers and the ecosystems on the mountain. We know that the mountain will continue to change, but the question is, “How?” As we learn from its history and study is ongoing processes, we get a better understanding of what is possible in the future, and the role that we play in the evolution of the mountain. As you conclude your tour, enjoy one more moment with the mountain and its meadows on this trail and consider: What is something you enjoyed today that you hope others will appreciate many years from now?

Life forms in the pool race with the weather to grow, reproduce, and store food in the short snow-free season between June and September. Soils around the pool are composed of fine particles of volcanic ash and mudflow materials. Tiny fragments of pumice, called ash, are so small and light that they can drift long distances through the air when ejected from a volcano. Many layers of ash from Mount Rainier coat Paradise meadows, but some ash layers were carried from Mount St. Helens and even from Mount Mazama in Oregon, which erupted and collapsed, forming Crater Lake. While ashy soil is nutrient-rich and provides fertile ground for the meadows, it is also quite fragile. Pocket gophers and meadow voles, members of the rodent family, dig small holes and tunnel trails year-round, which helps to stir and aerate the soil. Their activity is important because the fine soil is very easily compacted and eroded. In fact, as few as 12 footsteps in the same spot can compress the soil enough that plants will not be able to grow.",

Throughout its history, Mount Rainier has erupted a series of lava flows which piled atop one another like layers (or strata), giving Mount Rainier the classification of \"stratovolcano\". At one point, these layers built the mountain up to a height of about 16,000 feet. Due to its height and periods of colder climates, ice covered the mountain, causing erosion and redirecting lava flows.<br /> <br /> Mount Rainier erupted thick lava which flowed repeatedly like hot tar, filling the deep canyons around the vent. When glaciers were present during eruptions, the massive bodies of ice influenced the path of lava flows. Where in direct contact with lava, glaciers could cause the molten liquid to cool so quickly that it sometimes formed fragmented columns (an example of these columnar joints can be found just below this overlook). In turn, the lava would melt snow and ice in its path, causing floods and mudflows to course down the flanks of the mountain. Lava flows that resisted erosion now form ridge tops extending from the mountain summit. The ground beneath you here is one of these ancient lava flows.</p> <p>During the last 10,000 years, huge masses of rock have repeatedly slid from the volcano, reducing the cone height by more than 1,000 feet and reducing its bulk by one third. This left a gaping depression in the east face of the mountain top. In the last 2,000 years, Mount Rainier has partially rebuilt itself by repeated eruptions. A new cone of andesite lava now tops the summit depression. Steam vents in the craters still melt caves under the summit ice cap.</p> <br /> With internet access, dive deeper into the volcanic history of Mount Rainier here:<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/nature/volcanoes.htm\">Volcanoes</a>.",

Long before Mount Rainier formed, volcanoes 26-28 million years ago spread great blankets of hot pumice and ash over the landscape. Some flows were 350 feet thick. Heat trapped in the flows remelted the particles, forming the hard rock, known as welded tuff, of the Stevens Ridge Formation, which forms the peaks of the Tatoosh Range visible to the south. From beneath these rocks a large blob of magma many miles across pushed upward about 18-14 million years ago. Before it reached the surface, the molten rock cooled and hardened into a \"salt and pepper\" crystalline rock, known as granodiorite – a relative of granite. Grano­diorite forms the base rocks under both the Tatoosh Range and Mount Rainier. As the entire Cascade Mountain Range rose, severe erosion carved rocks of the Tatoosh into the rugged ridges and deep valleys we see. In the last million years, repeated glaciation shaped the range into a series of horns and cirques.",

It is also the best surveyed and monitored glaciers on the mountain. Due to easy access and its prominent location near Paradise, the glacier has been studied since the mid-1850s. The product of this research is a record of Nisqually Glacier change spanning nearly 150 years. Although the glacier has had some small advances in that time, these records indicate that the Nisqually Glacier – and most other glaciers on Mount Rainier – has retreated significantly in the last century.<br /> <br /> The upper zone of the glacier, where snowfall exceeds melting, is called the accumulation zone. The lower area where melting exceeds snowfall is termed the ablation zone. An equilibrium line, where ice accumulation equals ice loss, separates these zones. A rising equilibrium line indicates a glacial retreat, while a lowering equilibrium line signals that the glacier may advance down-valley. Changes in glacier size (advance and retreat) depend on the climate including air temperature and snowfall.<br /> <br /> While the response of each glacier depends on its local conditions, the two main factors driving glacier change are precipitation with low temperatures in winter, and rate of melt due to higher temperatures in summer. The current trend of glacier loss seems to be largely the result of a regional tendency toward warmer weather, resulting in less snowfall and higher melting. During the Ice Ages, the Nisqually Glacier terminated 30 miles down-valley, beyond Ashford and Elbe. Photographs from the early 1900s show park visitors posing at the Nisqually Bridge on the way to Paradise with the glacier clearly visible over their shoulders. Today, the terminus of the glacier is almost 1.5 miles up-valley from the bridge.<br /> <br /> To learn more, read the exhibit panel here as the next stop on this tour, and visit our website with internet access here: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/nature/glaciers.htm\">Glaciers</a>.",

Glaciers form when, for many decades, more snow falls in winter than melts in summer. As succeeding snows accumulate, their weight compresses the air space out of the snowpack, and the individual crystals bond together into glacial ice. Mount Rainier currently is encircled by 25 glaciers and has been significantly shaped by their presence.<br /> <br /> As we have discovered, glaciers are capable of powerful erosion and transporting large amounts of material. Over the last 6,000 years, this erosion has reduced the height of the mountain by an estimated 1,000 feet (300 meters) and carved features into the face of the mountain. Deep U-shaped valleys are typical in the lower regions of some of the largest glaciers, while steep-walled bowls known as cirques and sharp peaks called horns are characteristic of glacial erosion on the upper mountain.<br /> <br /> The glaciers transport eroded rocks into the riverbed below, and much of the rock accumulates at the edges of the glacier, forming ridges called moraines. If the ridge forms on the side of a glacier it’s called a lateral moraine; if it forms at the end of the glacier, it’s a terminal moraine. The occurrence of moraines is important because they are used to determine the size of glaciers during earlier, colder times. The lateral moraine on the far side of the valley was formed during the glacier's last major advance, around 1840. The sharp edge at the top of the moraine marks the upper surface of the glacier during that time.",

Mount Rainier is a volcano that has been active for less than 700,000 years, and this rock was once part of a lava flow that erupted. When extremely hot magma encounters water deep under the Earth’s surface, it can create steam. This steam will dissolve gases into the magma. As these gases expand, they create pressure sometimes high enough to cause an eruption. Opening a carbonated beverage has a similar effect, where gases are dissolved into the liquid and can create an explosive event when opened. Often, the gasses escape as the lava cools like a soda going “flat”. Sometimes, however, the lava cools so quicky that gas gets trapped, leaving holes in the rock of various sizes. If the lava has many tiny bubbles that become encased in the cooled lava, the rock may become pumice. In the case of this rock, a very large gas bubble was unable to escape before the lava hardened. Later the rock broke open, exposing its hollow center. ",

One way to manage this is by growing in clusters. The original trees in each group become established in longer periods of warm growing seasons and provide shelter and warmth required for the survival of nearby seedlings. Extreme winters limit the growth potential of trees when they stand individually, which is why the biggest trees at this elevation are those growing in clusters. As you continue uphill on the switchback, you'll be surrounded by many trees with crooked trunks. Both the mountain hemlock and subalpine fir are quite flexible. Under heavy snow loads, small trees may bend to the ground. If a tree is held in this position for a long time, the trunk adjusts to the strain and becomes permanently bent.",

Both glaciers and rivers are responsible for redistributing rocks of all sizes down the mountain from their origins. Glaciers are masses of ice that flow very slowly under their own weight. As glaciers flow, they grind and pluck rocks from the bedrock below, and carry rocks distributed from avalanches and rockfall above. Eventually, the glacier gets to a low enough point that the ice will melt, depositing its load of rocks into the riverbed below.<br /> <br /> Pulverized rock, called glacial flour, is suspended in the river flowing from the glacier, giving the water its muddy appearance. Rocks and boulders transported by the glacier can build upon themselves and raise the riverbed higher and higher – a process called aggradation. Flowing water will continue to push around and rearrange these rocks, creating a wide and rocky riverbed while the river itself is braided in constantly changing channels.<br /> <br /> Occasionally, there are larger flooding events that carry vast loads of material. Heavy rain fall, glacial outburst floods, and even volcanic activity can cause the sudden release of water. If a massive amount of water gains enough momentum, it can pick up large boulders and other materials, becoming a debris flow. The largest of these flows is known as a lahar, a destructive slurry of water and debris that can extend for many miles. Mount Rainier has experienced many of these events throughout its history.</p>",

The volcano had steamed intensely for many centuries as hot gases dissolved rocks into clay. Then the weak mass of rock and clay was jostled or shoved by a small eruption so that a huge block avalanched down across Paradise. The lahar, known as the Osceola Mudflow, flowed like wet cement and spread out into a sheet over ridges and valleys. It may have been 600 feet thick when the wet mass extended nearly 20 miles down the Paradise and Nisqually valleys. Remnants almost 15 feet thick remain in Paradise Meadow. When large boulders are carried far from their origins, they are called erratics.

It is just minutes from the Stevens Canyon Entrance, which provides access to Paradise, and it is 13 miles from SR410, which connects to the White River, Sunrise, and Tipsoo Lake areas, as well as the towns of Enumclaw and Yakima, WA. The area is home to the <strong>Ohanapecosh Visitor Center</strong> and campground. The <strong>Ohanapecosh Campground</strong> has 188 sites for RV or tent camping. Each site has a bear box for campers to secure food, as well as a designated fire ring. There is a bathroom in each campground loop. There are no electrical hookups at the Ohanapecosh Campground. <br /> <br /> The <strong>Ohanapecosh Visitor Center</strong> is a large building with a pitched roof, designed in the classic Mission 66 style. Upon approaching the building, there is a double doored entrance and to the left a covered outdoor hallway leads to restrooms, a pay phone, and a water fountain. <br /> <br /> Ohanapecosh has a long history of human use. The area is still used by members of the Cowlitz and Yakama tribes. Due to sampling done in the Ohanapecosh Campground in 2014, archaeologists were able to find the first ever, low elevation, pre-contact sites within the park. More field work followed in the summer of 2015, yielding artifacts like chipped stone tool remains and hearth features dating to between 3,700 and 6,400 years ago. It is believed that Ohanapecosh served as a way-stop to and from high elevation summer sites used for hunting and resource-gathering. Please remember that all historic and archaeological artifacts you might find must be left in place. This allows archaeologists to learn much more about our cherished history. Report anything you notice to the nearest visitor center or park ranger. <br /> <br /> Volcanic hot springs still bubble near the campground. These hot springs were developed into a Hot Springs Resort in the early 1900s, but the resort fell into disrepair in the 1950s and was closed in 1960. The National Park Service had several stages of development, from the construction of the campground and trails by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, to the development of the visitor center and employee housing during the Mission 66 era in the 1950s-60s. The hot spring area was also restored to a more natural state and the resort buildings were removed. <br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Tucked amongst low-elevation forest next to the Ohanapecosh River, hiking access abounds. Most hikes are family friendly and short in length, including the popular <strong>Silver Falls Trail</strong>. The Silver Falls Trail connects to the <strong>Eastside Trail</strong>, with access to the Grove of the Patriarchs. The hot springs can be viewed along the <strong>Hot Springs Nature Trail</strong>, which starts behind the visitor center. <br /> <br /> <b>NOTE: The Grove of the Patriarchs is CLOSED </b>to all public entry due to flooding in November 2021 which caused significant damage to the suspension bridge that provides the only safe access to the area (<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/news/mount-rainier-national-park-announces-temporary-closure-of-grove-of-the-patriarchs.htm\">News Release, 11/17/21</a>).

During the closure, the Grove of the Patriarchs parking lot and restrooms have normal seasonal access, along with the Eastside and Silver Falls Trails. Construction to replace the bridge is scheduled to begin summer 2027. Summers represent the only viable construction season in the park due to the heavy snow that blankets the park from roughly November through May.</p>",

This picnic area provides eight tables divided into three clusters designed to accommodate groups of up to 18 people. Each cluster of tables has a grill and is situated on a path extending from the parking area to the restroom about 200 feet away.

More field work in the summer of 2015 yielded artifacts dating to between 3,700 and 6,400 years ago, presumably from the Taidnapam people, whose descendants are part of the Upper Cowlitz and Yakama tribes. In the early 1900s, as the area became more popular for settlers, a series of resorts based around the natural hot springs were built. When Mount Rainier National Park was established in 1899, the Ohanapecosh area remained in private use and wasn’t included in park boundaries until 1933. The resort existing at the time remained in use until 1961 when the contract was ended, and the associated buildings were torn down. Since then, the picnic area, campground, and visitor center have become the primary amenities for modern day visitors, continuing a tradition of recreation and human interaction with the river and surrounding old-growth forest. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e438f768-278a-4911-98f5-a14a3efc446e}{243}\" paraid=\"1871109469\">As you enjoy a picnic here, please be mindful of your impact to the landscape, wildlife, and other visitors. Trash cans are located near the parking lot for you to clean up and dispose of all waste. Additional trash and recycling bins are 200 feet. down the road past the picnic area near campsite A54. Potable water is located at restrooms and at the faucet near campsite A54. Never feed any wildlife or leave food unattended to avoid wild animals getting food that could make them sick or cause them to act aggressively.

The Ohanapecosh River, flows nearby. Ohanapecosh is the Taidnapam word for \"standing at the edge\" and this stop might evoke a bit of that feeling. You can catch a glimpse of the river down the hill to your right, through the trees. The Ohanapecosh River is a vibrant turquoise. Other rivers on the mountain are impacted by glaciers and are characterized by their milky color. As glacial ice grinds down the rocky slopes of Mount Rainier, Takhoma (Cowlitz tribal word for Mount Rainier), it accumulates silt. But unlike these rivers, the Ohanapecosh flows fairly clear due to the recession of the Ohanapecosh Glacier, which has retreated far enough into the high country to effectively eliminate the glacial sediment seen in larger, glacier-fed rivers. ",

Surrounded by mountains high enough to trap rainfall coming from the Puget Sound and low enough for mild temperatures, it receives about 70 to 90 inches of rain per year. Most of the rain falls in one long wet season during winter and spring. Summers are fairly dry, with fog providing most of the moisture.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{69ca8c74-53a6-4a9a-87c0-1a077dd78ef6}{217}\" paraid=\"1750002515\">During the long rainy season, water falls on the tree canopy, trickles to the understory, and seeps into the ground. It then fills rivers, which return water to the ocean. Some of the moisture received by the temperate rainforests is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation. Moist air rises, forms clouds, and falls again as rain in an ongoing process. Big rainforest trees can store a large amount of water, which helps them get through the dry summer season. A single Douglas-fir, like this one on the left side of the Carbon River Trail, can hold as much as 5,000 gallons of water!  </p> <p paraeid=\"{69ca8c74-53a6-4a9a-87c0-1a077dd78ef6}{241}\" paraid=\"392750981\">Douglas-fir (<em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>) is a dominate species in Pacific Northwest forests. Mature trees can be as large as 13 ft (4 m) in diameter and reach heights of 300 ft (90 m). Some Douglas-fir in the park are believed to be over 1,000 years old. The bark of older trees becomes very thick with reddish-brown, deeply-furrowed ridges. Older trees also lose their lower branches, leaving behind straight trunks. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4a622c9e-c5c6-4c5f-a853-55895cdd0cc4}{16}\" paraid=\"200936876\"> </p>",

This plan was only partially accomplished by other roads in the park, including SR410/123 on the east side of the park and Stevens Canyon Road on the south side of the park. Carbon River Road was meant to stretch along the north side of the park. However, from the beginning maintenance of the road was challenging and the road was frequently damaged by flooding due to the dynamic glacier-fed Carbon River. Historically, the Carbon River Road once reached as far as Cataract Creek, an additional three miles past its current length, which spans five miles to Ipsut Creek.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{903e6f31-d2c0-4a25-bce0-0946a3385929}{116}\" paraid=\"1271423015\">The Carbon River Road has always been a primitive road, winding through old growth temperate rainforest along the Carbon River Valley. It was constructed using wagon road technology, rather than modern engineering. In an attempt to design the road to blend with the landscape, it was routed close to the river, instead of further away on a valley bench. As a result, the road is in a floodplain and numerous floods have damaged or destroyed sections of the road. Eventually extreme damage from the November 2006 Flood closed the road to vehicles permanently, and the road now operates as the Carbon River Trail. </p>",

A tree is an essential contributor to the life cycle of a forest – not only when it is alive, but also after it has fallen to the ground. Resting upon the forest floor, a tree absorbs rain and holds it like a sponge, whereupon mosses and other plants can colonize. The dead tree, called a nurse log, provides water and nutrients for new growth. Young trees sprout on the log, competing for sun and enough space to grow roots that will eventually anchor in the ground. While supporting the growing trees, the log slowly deteriorates. Many types of fungi, often seen as mushrooms growing out of the wood, help break down the decomposing log. Ants, beetles, and other invertebrates tunnel through the moist wood and feed upon it. The decaying matter enriches the soil by recycling nutrients. A tree constantly contributes to the forest until nothing remains of the tree.<br /> <br /> What can you see growing on the nurse logs along the Old Mine Trail?

Nearly every bit of space is taken up by living plants. The thick understory of skunk cabbage and devil's club make passage difficult. Some plants adapt to the wet soil by developing shallow root systems. Others have air pockets that allow oxygen to travel from leaves to roots.

Each thorny stem supports large maple-shaped leaves, also with thorns, and topped with a pyramidal stalk of numerous small, greenish-white flowers in spring that turn into red berries.

What birds can you hear? Woodpeckers, ravens, flocks of chickadees, and other birds are common, and the forest can be home to deer, squirrels, coyotes, and other wildlife. Most of the animals in a rainforest are tiny creatures like beetles, ants, spiders, and other invertebrates like banana slugs. These small but important animals help break down organic matter.<br /> <br /> Banana slugs (<i>Ariolimax columbianus</i>) are one of the largest terrestrial slugs in the world. They can grow to be 7-10 inches (185-260 mm) long. While they can be yellow, they also come in green, brown, or white colors and can have dark spots. Their color changes according to their diet and moisture in the environment. Because they have no shell, which provides them with needed moisture, banana slugs prefer wet and shady environments like the forests of Carbon River. They love humidity so much that they use nearby water to make their very own slime. This slime allows them to stay hydrated and alive, navigate the forest floor, and protects them against predators who might want to take a bite out of them.</p>",

Most of the claims were filed in 1906, with the company’s peak activity in 1908-1909. However, the locations of many of these claims are not well known and it is believed that some were excuses to get access to illegal timber, instead of being used for mining.<br /> <br /> Between 1910-1912, the Government Land Office directed adverse proceedings against twenty-four of the mining claims for lack of assessment work or filed charges of abandonment against the other remaining mining claims owned by the Washington Mining and Milling Company. As a result, the company began relinquished the claims. While some mines did have activity, by at least 1913, all company operations had ceased or been declared invalid for lack of assessment.<br /> <br /> The “Old Mine” here is believed to be one of the mines operated by the Washington Mining and Milling Company. A local visitor told Ranger Aubrey Haines in 1950 of working in a nearby mine over 40 years before belonging to the Washington Mining and Milling Company. The company was engaged in taking out a white ore which was found in a clay strata which hardened rapidly on exposure to the air. A notable feature of the mine was an incline railway which was used to lower ore from the mine to the river bottom or possibly a road three hundred feet below. Ranger Haines went out and located the remains of the mine 1951. At the time, the ranger found the remains of a shake building with a cast iron stone and other equipment near the mine entrance. The mine tunnel was six feet by six feet neatly cut into gray crystalline rock. About fifty feet inside the tunnel it took a turn to the right. The ore tracks were still in place. Today the mine entrance remains remarkedly similar to this description from the 1950s, though the entrance has been blocked off for safety (do not attempt to enter the mine further than the closure).</p>",

Here, plants must be able to tolerate shade or reach the canopy to thrive. When a fallen tree creates a gap in the canopy, nearby trees grow rapidly, racing to fill it. This stop along the Carbon River Trail is at a gap in the forest where several trees fell during past storms along the right side of the trail. Note the small tree in the center of the gap – a Western hemlock. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4a622c9e-c5c6-4c5f-a853-55895cdd0cc4}{146}\" paraid=\"1261853113\">Western hemlocks (<em>Tsuga heterophylla</em>) are well-adapted to low light conditions and can thrive for years in the shade of taller trees like Western red cedar and Douglas-fir. Mature trees are commonly about 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter but can grow as large as 8 feet (2.4 m) in diameter and 200 feet (60 m) tall if they get enough space.

But emerging from the protection of the canopy can be risky. These tall trees are battered by winds and storms, which sometimes knock them to the ground. At this stop, the Carbon River Trail cuts through an old growth Douglas-fir tree (its uprooted stump is on the left side of the trail with the main trunk on the right side of the trail) and the remains of a large Western red cedar (<em>Thuja plicata</em>) that fell along the left side of the trail just past the fallen Douglas-fir tree.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{69ca8c74-53a6-4a9a-87c0-1a077dd78ef6}{29}\" paraid=\"1565520526\">Notice the bright red color of the Western red cedar wood and its distinctive scent. Due to oils in the wood, Western red cedar is naturally resistant to water, rot, and insect decay. Cedar has been used by native people for generations and continues to be used for traditional purposes today. The wood is easy to carve to create canoes or tools and can be split to form cedar shakes and boards. The bark is collected and used as a fiber in making baskets and clothing. At Mount Rainier National Park, many of the park buildings use cedar shakes for roofing materials, and many trail bridges are built out of cedar boards.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{69ca8c74-53a6-4a9a-87c0-1a077dd78ef6}{71}\" paraid=\"217470127\">NOTE: It is illegal to collect or remove any cedar wood from the park.  </p>",

Have an alternate destination in mind. <br /> <br /> The trail climbs steadily for 3.5 miles through the forest on a series of switchbacks to reach the lakes. According to legend, these lakes were named after Yakama Chief \"Owhi,\" who loaned horses to Theodore Winthrop (after whom the Winthrop Glacier was named), when Winthrop was on a trek across the cascades in the mid-1850s. Although this hike offers no views of Mount Rainier, it does offer an array of secluded mountain lakes and meadows aglow with wildflowers in mid-summer. The jagged cliffs of Governors Ridge rise high above the lakes to the east while Tamanos Mountain lies directly west.<br /> <br /> Return back to White River, or the trail continues and descends down into the Ohanapecosh River Valley where it connects to the Eastside Trail at Deer Creek, an additional 4.9 miles. From Deer Creek, a trail (0.4 miles) connects to SR123 where a second vehicle can be parked. If returning to White River, the trail is 7 miles round trip with 1,350 feet of elevation gain.<br /> <br /> Tamanos Creek Camp is located among the trees three miles from the trailhead, 0.5 miles short of the lakes. Although the creek is often dry by late summer, Owyhigh Lakes provide a reliable source of water. Treat water before drinking. A <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm\">wilderness permit</a> is required to camp. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails.</p>",

In the spring and summer enjoy the many wildflowers that decorate the mountainside. In winter Paradise offers a winter wonderland, receiving on average 643 inches (53.6 feet/16.3 meters) of snow in a year. Winter activities include snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and sledding. The road between Longmire and Paradise is plowed but closes at night during the winter. <br /> <br /> Paradise is located just south of Mount Rainier and is 19 miles (30 kilometers) east of the Nisqually Entrance. The park's main visitor center, the <strong>Henry M.

The Inn's architecture provides a clue - the steep roof is designed to shed heavy snow. On a larger scale, extreme annual snowfalls have created enormous glaciers that radiate from the summit of Mount Rainier. <br /> <br /> <em>\"Living under a mountainous snowdrift we could not hear the wind. The huge wooden building would creak and groan every night as the snow settled and bore down upon it... It often happened that our first evidence of a storm outside was to wake up at eight o'clock in the morning in midnight darkness. The tunnels had all been snowed over or drifted full in the night.\"</em> - Floyd Schmoe, early Park Naturalist, who wintered at Paradise Inn, 1920.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Annual snowfall is recorded at the Paradise Weather Station in the Paradise meadows, July 1 - June 30. <br /> <br /> During a year of extreme snowfall, Paradise Inn gets almost completely buried. <br /> <br /> This close to the coast, Mount Rainier is a magnet for storms. At moisture-laden Pacific air is forced to rise steeply, it cools and percipitates heavily on these slopes.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo of the Paradise Inn in winter fills the exhibit panel. Of the building, only the outline of the angled roof, fireplaces, and a row of window gabled dormers along the roof are visible under a deep layer of snow. Behind the building, a hillside is covered in patchy forest beneath a ridge of snow-covered peaks. The main text stretches across the top third of the photo, with the secondary text is along the bottom of the photo. In the upper right corner of the panel is a simplified bar graph with three columns. The tallest column is labeled \"1,122 inches, Record high (1971-72)\". The middle column to the right is about half as tall as the first column and is labeled \"640 inches, Average\". The third column on the far right is again as half as tall as the middle column, and labeled \"313 inches, Record low, 1939-40\". A small box in the lower left corner of the panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work.

This historic building, which opened in 1917, allows people to take photos of historic architecture, enjoy a meal in the dining room, or just relax and enjoy the stately lobby. The inn features 121 rooms for overnight guests. Rooms do not include modern amenities such as internet, telephone, and television. A gift shop, café, and dining room are all located within the Paradise Inn. Guests are invited to imagine an earlier time when life was simple without the distractions of today’s modern world.</p> <p>The lure of Paradise has drawn people to the slopes of Mount Rainier for millennia. Local tribes like the Nisqually, Yakama, Puyallup, Cowlitz, and others, traveled to the Paradise meadows to hunt and gather. Early mountain climbers scaling the glaciers, used Paradise as a way stop. Paradise’s wildflower meadows also became a destination for some of the first tourists to the mountain. Before the creation of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, people recognized a need for accommodations at Paradise. Construction of the Paradise Inn began the summer of 1916. Ground was broken on July 20, and most of the lobby, dining room, and rooms above the dining room, were completed that first summer. Opening on July 1, 1917, the inn had thirty-seven guest rooms and a dining room that could accommodate 400. Distinctive furnishing enhanced the lobby, including woodwork of the registration desk, two massive cedar tables and chairs, a mail drop “stump”, and cases for the 14 foot tall clock and the piano.</p> <p>After World War I, enough guests were staying at the lodge that the company could start building again. The Paradise Inn Annex, once completed, more than doubled the size of the inn, providing 104 more guest rooms. Structural braces were added to the timbers to help with the extra stress of long winters. Time and weather have not been kind to the Paradise Inn. Mount Rainier National Park has worked to renovate the structure while maintaining the historical aspects that make the Paradise Inn a unique place to visit. With this work, the National Park Service hopes that future visitors will continue to see and enjoy the historic, rustic beauty of the Paradise Inn.</p> <p>For audio description of the exhibit panel in this location, refer to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/paradise-inn-exhibit-panel.htm\">Paradise Inn Exhibit Panel</a>.</p>",

Ski races and even Olympic tryouts were held in Paradise. The first tow rope at Paradise was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. It was installed in 1938 and went to the top of Alta Vista.</p> <p>After World War II, returning soldiers with wartime ski training made downhill skiing very popular in the U.S. As demand for downhill skiing grew in the 1940s and 1950s, demand also grew to install more lifts and ski jumps at Paradise. Park managers had one firm rule; whatever was put up for the ski season had to be brought down before summer. After all, who wants to see a line of chairlift supports and cables running through their favorite meadow?</p> <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, downhill skiing grew in popularity in the U.S. and more folks from the Puget Sound wanted to drive up to Paradise to ski. As their demand for ski opportunities at Paradise peaked, a new answer arrived. The U.S. Forest Service began leasing land to downhill ski groups outside the park at Crystal Mountain and White Pass. There developers could build all the lifts, jumps and gondolas that downhill skiers demanded. Other winter activities replaced downhill skiing at Paradise. Cross-country and back-country skiing replaced downhill skiing. Instead of needing lifts and gondolas, these skiers would “skin up” hills under their own power and then ski down. The rope tow operated until the 1970s. Today the building that powered the rope tow remains. The interior is closed to visitors.</p> <p>For decades, rangers, volunteers, and staff have worked to balance the needs of visitors and the protection of the meadows and other natural resources. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/harmonizing-paradise.htm\">Bringing harmony to Paradise</a> is still a work in progress today.</p>",

        "notes": "Paradise Historic Tour: Ski Tow-Powerhouse\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/paradise-historic-tour-ski-tow-powerhouse.htm\n\n<p>In the 1930s, winter-time access to Paradise brought more opportunities for winter recreation. Ski races and even Olympic tryouts were held in Paradise. The first tow rope at Paradise was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. It was installed in 1938 and went to the top of Alta Vista.</p> <p>After World War II, returning soldiers with wartime ski training made downhill skiing very popular in the U.S. As demand for downhill skiing grew in the 1940s and 1950s, demand also grew to install more lifts and ski jumps at Paradise. Park managers had one firm rule; whatever was put up for the ski season had to be brought down before summer. After all, who wants to see a line of chairlift supports and cables running through their favorite meadow?</p> <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, downhill skiing grew in popularity in the U.S. and more folks from the Puget Sound wanted to drive up to Paradise to ski. As their demand for ski opportunities at Paradise peaked, a new answer arrived. The U.S. Forest Service began leasing land to downhill ski groups outside the park at Crystal Mountain and White Pass. There developers could build all the lifts, jumps and gondolas that downhill skiers demanded. Other winter activities replaced downhill skiing at Paradise. Cross-country and back-country skiing replaced downhill skiing. Instead of needing lifts and gondolas, these skiers would “skin up” hills under their own power and then ski down. The rope tow operated until the 1970s. Today the building that powered the rope tow remains. The interior is closed to visitors.</p> <p>For decades, rangers, volunteers, and staff have worked to balance the needs of visitors and the protection of the meadows and other natural resources. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/harmonizing-paradise.htm\">Bringing harmony to Paradise</a> is still a work in progress today.</p>",

Using the trail that James Longmire built from Ashford to Longmire and then up to Paradise, people found a rustic campground awaiting them as early 1895. John Reese started developing his Camp of the Clouds in 1898 with tents for guests and a dining tent on the shoulder of Alta Vista, just above where the Jackson Visitor Center stands today. Working with the U.S. Forest Service and then the National Park Service (NPS), Reese ran his camp in the summers, gradually expanding its size until 1916. The government constructed a rough road that reached Camp of the Clouds in 1910. Visitors were driving their cars up by 1912, creating a big increase in the number of people at Paradise.</p> <p>By 1927, about 50,000 cars entered the park, bringing many visitors, guests, and campers to Paradise throughout the summer. More people required more facilities. Where the lower parking lot is today, a community building was constructed for campground ranger programs and activities. Camp of the Clouds closed in 1930, replaced by 275 cabins near the community building and then a new Paradise Lodge in 1931 in between the community building and cabins.</p> <p>While the tent camps no longer exist, the meadows themselves are included within the historic district because they have been an inextricable part of the patterns of human activity in the area over the last 100 years.</p>",

Paradise Inn reservations provide <strong>access to the Paradise Corridor only</strong>; they do not provide access to the Sunrise Corridor.</i></p> <p>The Paradise Inn is open generally from late May through September. This historic building, which opened in 1917, allows people to take photos of historic architecture, enjoy a meal in the dining room, or just relax and enjoy the stately lobby. The inn features 121 rooms for overnight guests. Rooms do not include modern amenities such as internet, telephone, and television. A gift shop, café, and dining room are all located within the Paradise Inn. Guests are invited to imagine an earlier time when life was simple without the distractions of today’s modern world.</p> <p>The lure of Paradise has drawn people to the slopes of Mount Rainier for millennia. Local tribes like the Nisqually, Yakama, Puyallup, Cowlitz, and others, traveled to the Paradise meadows to hunt and gather. Early mountain climbers scaling the glaciers, used Paradise as a way stop. Paradise’s wildflower meadows also became a destination for some of the first tourists to the mountain. Before the creation of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, people recognized a need for accommodations at Paradise. Construction of the Paradise Inn began the summer of 1916. Ground was broken on July 20, and most of the lobby, dining room, and rooms above the dining room, were completed that first summer. Opening on July 1, 1917, the inn had thirty-seven guest rooms and a dining room that could accommodate 400. Distinctive furnishing enhanced the lobby, including woodwork of the registration desk, two massive cedar tables and chairs, a mail drop “stump”, and cases for the 14 foot tall clock and the piano. After World War I, enough guests were staying at the lodge that the company could start building again. The Paradise Inn Annex, once completed, more than doubled the size of the inn, providing 104 more guest rooms. Structural braces were added to the timbers to help with the extra stress of long winters. Time and weather have not been kind to the Paradise Inn. Mount Rainier National Park has worked to renovate the structure while maintaining the historical aspects that make the Paradise Inn a unique place to visit. With this work, the National Park Service hopes that future visitors will continue to see and enjoy the historic, rustic beauty of the Paradise Inn.</p>",

To avoid congestion, visit earlier or later in the day or on a weekday.  <br /> <i>Winter/Spring (October - June)</i>: The Paradise Meadows are covered in deep snow in winter, but the area remains open for snowshoeing and other winter recreation. The road to Paradise closes nightly at the gate at Longmire typically from November to mid-April depending on weather; always check road status before starting your trip. Snow can linger well into June or even July.  <br /> <br /> Starting from the Muir Steps, a set of steps inscribed with a quote by John Muir, a network of trails weave through the famous subalpine meadows of Paradise. There is a ramp to access the trails to the right of the Muir Steps. Views along the trails include Mount Rainier as well as the Tatoosh Range, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and the Cascade Range. Look for wildlife, including black-tailed deer, marmots, and birds, in the meadows. The meadows fill with a wide variety of flowers, with peak bloom in late July or early August, and can have colorful fall foliage starting in September. During the winter, trails in Paradise are covered by a deep layer of snow and are mostly unmarked. Snowshoers should have experience with route finding and avalanche terrain. Always check current conditions before heading out and be prepared with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/hiking-safety.htm\">Ten Essentials</a>.<br /> <br /> Please do not feed any wildlife.

The ranger station still serves this purpose, although it is no longer open to the public. Historically, the first floor was an information center and the second floor served as living quarters.<br /> <br /> The stone and timber construction and steeply pitched roof are typical of the alpine rustic architecture at Paradise. As you walk the area, look for this rustic style reflected in other historic structures of the era. Floyd Schmoe, first park naturalist, stands on the front steps of the Paradise Ranger Station, 1928.<br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> The text fills the top half of the exhibit panel against a grey background that crossfades into a black and white photo filling the lower half of the panel. In the photo, a ranger in uniform with his hands in his pockets stands on the stone steps of a small building with a steeply angled wood roof. A sign on the front of the building hanging above the ranger reads “Office of Park Naturalist – Information – Nature Guide Service.” A small box in the lower left corner of the exhibit panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work. Entrance fees were used to produce this exhibit\".<br /> <br /> <b>Visit This Exhibit Panel</b><br /> This exhibit panel is located in front of the Paradise Ranger Station on the north side of the upper Paradise parking lot. The exhibit panel is only installed during the summer. While the Paradise area is open year-round, the area around the ranger station is covered in deep snow during the winter.</p> <p> </p>",

At this middle elevation, the trees are smaller than the lush old growth near Nisqually Entrance and Ohanapecosh. Here the vegetation must adapt to fierce winters, heavy snow, intense cold, and a shorter growing season. <br /> <br /> Higher still, at Paradise, the adaptions are even more extreme. Subalpine fir grows in island-like clusters in response to almost perpetual snow. Throughout the park the look of the forest gives clues to climate and elevation - a sense of where you are on the mountain. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Pacific silver fir is abundant at this elevation. Here seedlings must be able to survive heavy snow. In areas where fire or blowdown has occured, noble fir may dominate. A mix of forest might also indicate recovery from mudslide or avalanche. <br /> <br /> Some forest adaptions are subtle. Look for the \"skirting\" effect on trees with stunted upper branches and longer, denser branches near the ground. Harsh winds stunt the higher branches, while snow protects the lower growth. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel in a band with a green background. The bottom two-thirds of the panel on the left side is filled with a large photo showing a snow-covered, forested hillside against a blue sky. A label in the upper left corner of the photo reads \"Elevation 4,000 ft\". Stacked on the right side of the panel are two smaller, slightly overlapping photos, with the secondary text above them. The top photo shows a snowy hillside scattered with clumps of small fir trees. A label in the upper left corner of the photo reads \"Elevation 5,400 ft\". The bottom photo shows a woman in a red jacket standing next to a huge tree trunk in a dense forest. A label in the upper left corner of the photo reads \"Elevation 2,200 ft\". A small box in the lower left corner of the exhibit panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work. Entrance fees were used to produce this exhibit\".<br /> <br /> <strong>Visit This Exhibit Panel</strong><br /> This exhibit panel is located in a pullout along the road to Paradise, about a mile uphill from the Ricksecker Point Road, overlooking the Nisqually River valley. The Paradise Road is open year-round, but closes nightly during the winter. </p>",

But the scene is full of evidence that the ice is constantly moving. Like rapids in a stream, crevasses form where the glacier flows over uneven ground - a knob or ridge in the bedrock. <br /> <br /> Moraines, dark rubble along the sides of the glacier that often disguise the glacier's full extent, and surface debris are fragments of the mountain. Quarrying the slopes with ice hundreds of feet thick, and filled the lower valleys with loose rock and rivers of meltwater, the Nisqually and other glaciers are continually altering the face of Mount Rainier. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Glaciers are different from other fields of ice and snow because they flow downhill like a river in slow-motion. Buried beneath many winters of heavy blizzards, the snow becomes compressed and aligned for motion.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo of Mount Rainier with the Nisqually Glacier curving down its slopes fills the exhibit panel. The main text stretches across the top third of the photo, over the summit of the mountain and against a blue sky. A small photo overlaps the main photo to the right of the main text with the secondary text tucked above the photo in the upper right corner of the panel. The photo shows a detail of a glacier broken by large crevasses. Several climbers, no bigger than tiny black dots, skirt one of the crevases. A caption at the top of the photo reads \"Crevasses dwarf a group of climbers.\" A second small photo overlaps the main photo in the lower left side of the panel. In the photo, two people stand next to the terminus of a glacier, a wall of dirty ice with a river flowing out from underneath the ice. A caption at the top of the photo reads \"Nisqually River originates from the terminus of the Nisqually Glacier. A small box in the lower right corner of the exhibit panel reads \"User Fee Project.

Ski races and even Olympic tryouts were held in Paradise. The first tow rope at Paradise was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. It was installed in 1938 and went to the top of Alta Vista.</p> <p>After World War II, returning soldiers with wartime ski training made downhill skiing very popular in the U.S. As demand for downhill skiing grew in the 1940s and 1950s, demand also grew to install more lifts and ski jumps at Paradise. Park managers had one firm rule; whatever was put up for the ski season had to be brought down before summer. After all, who wants to see a line of chairlift supports and cables running through their favorite meadow?</p> <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, downhill skiing grew in popularity in the U.S. and more folks from the Puget Sound wanted to drive up to Paradise to ski. As their demand for ski opportunities at Paradise peaked, a new answer arrived. The U.S. Forest Service began leasing land to downhill ski groups outside the park at Crystal Mountain and White Pass. There developers could build all the lifts, jumps and gondolas that downhill skiers demanded. Other winter activities replaced downhill skiing at Paradise. Cross-country and back-country skiing replaced downhill skiing. Instead of needing lifts and gondolas, these skiers would “skin up” hills under their own power and then ski down. The rope tow operated until the 1970s. Today the building that powered the rope tow remains. The interior is closed to visitors.</p> <p>For decades, rangers, volunteers, and staff have worked to balance the needs of visitors and the protection of the meadows and other natural resources. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/harmonizing-paradise.htm\">Bringing harmony to Paradise</a> is still a work in progress today.</p>",

At that time, Paradise-Stevens Glacier was riddled with ice caves and crevasses and was within easy walking distance of major roads. An 1896 map of the glacier places its terminus within 0.6 mile (1 km) of Sluiskin Falls. However, by the 1970s the glacier area had decreased to less than 50% of its 1896 area and separated into two small segments of stagnant ice (glacier ice no longer in motion). The rapid melting of the ice left behind a large area strewn with boulders and rubble carried by the glacier and its meltwater streams, providing visitors with an uncommon opportunity to observe the rock features at the bed of a glacier.</p> <p>In 2023, the Stevens Glacier was officially removed from the Park’s inventory, due to its lack of features indicating flow, and therefore is no longer a glacier but instead a perennial snowfield.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Paradise-Stevens Glacier</strong>: From Paradise, take the Skyline Trail counter-clockwise for 1.8 miles to the junction with the Paradise Glacier Trail.

Puyallup is the name of an Indian tribe whose traditional lands include the area around the Puyallup River and Commencement Bay and is one of the park’s associated tribes. The word is said to mean '...shadow from the dense shade of the forest...' (Reese, 2009).</p> <p>Currently the glacier ends in a hanging valley at the head of the North Puyallup River valley. During seasons of above normal snow accumulation in the Amphitheater, a large ice bulge forms and begins moving down the glacier. When it does so, the terminus advances to the edge of the hanging valley. One such wave in 1960 produced numerous crevasses in the upper part of the glacier. By 1962, the ice in the upper glacier was smooth again while the terminus had advanced, covering rocks that had previously been exposed.</p> <p>Fifteen thousand years ago, Puyallup Glacier was joined to South and North Mowich Glaciers forming a single ice mass. The farthest advance of the Puyallup Glacier in recent history occurred around 1840, when it flowed well over the edge of the hanging valley.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Puyallup Glacier</strong>: One of the most impressive views of the terminus of Puyallup Glacier is from Klapatche Park.

A boat concession which began in 1927 and the stocking of non-native fish had unintended consequences: the lakeshore and surrounding meadows were damaged by increased recreational activity. Eventually the lakes were closed to fishing, boating, and swimming due to their negative impact on the lake ecosystem. Fish stocking was stopped in 1973. <br /> <br /> Now the National Park Service is taking steps to restore the area's beauty by clearly delineating trails and revegetating the spiderweb of informal paths and bare ground.

The Nisqually River valley lies to the northwest of the ridge and the Paradise River valley is to the southeast. A one-way scenic loop drive traces the edge of Ricksecker Point. The third of a mile-long road has two main pullouts featuring views of Mount Rainier, the Nisqually and Paradise river valleys, and the Tatoosh Range.

The road closes during the winter, typically from early November through mid-May.<br /> <br /> Ricksecker Point is a contributing component to the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District. Ricksecker Point is named for Eugene Ricksecker, an Army Corps of Engineers supervisor who surveyed the route to Paradise in 1904. The survey team originally named the feature “Gap Point”, but it was renamed after a road was constructed in 1909. Part of the original road to Paradise, the section around Ricksecker Point was considered one of the most dangerous stretches. It was narrow, bordered by steep cliffs, and prone to rockfall. Over the years the road was widened, resurfaced, and parking was included at viewpoints. A detour constructed in 1930 replaced the original route and became the main Paradise Road, while Ricksecker Point Road was left as a scenic bypass. In addition to providing excellent views, Ricksecker Point is an example of rustic style architecture that sought to blend with the natural environment. The road follows the curve of the ridge and guardwalls along the road use roughly cut, native stone. The stone guardwalls were constructed during the 1930s in part by the Civilian Conservation Corps.</p>",

During the past 500,000 years lava from thousands of eruptions flowed and cooled, building the present volcano. Those lava flows are visible as gray and reddish rock.<br /> <br /> Glaciers far larger than today's enveloped Mount Rainier during those eruptions. They worked in concert with volcanic forces to shape the terrain. Present day ridges result from molten material building up between glaciers, with lava flows channeled to either side of the thick ice. You are standing at the toe of a lava flow that, while still hot, ponded against the edges of converging glaciers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Mount Rainier has repeatedly undergone sudden and drastic change. As eruptions of lava and ash built the cone, other geologic forces acted to destroy it - landslides, glaciers, rivers, and lahars (volcanic mudflows). Similiar activity is certain to occur in the future and is likely to dramatically affect the people and land of the Pacific Northwest.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo of Mount Rainier fills the entire frame of the exhibit panel. The text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel against a clear blue sky over the summit of the mountain. The view of the mountain in the photo is from the same location and perspective of the view from the exhibit panel location. The mountain peak is labeled \"Crater Rim\", with rocky ridges descending to either side. Below the summit on the front-face of the mountain, a glacier labeled \"Kautz Glacier\" descends between broken, rocky ridges. To the left of Kautz Glacier, two more glaciers fills shallow bowls between rocky ridges. \"Success Glacier\" is labeled in the middle, with \"Pyramid Glacier\" on the far left. To the right of Kautz Glacier a patchwork of glacial ice is labeled \"Van Trump Glaciers\". From the Crater Rim, a glacier descends the far right ridge of the mountain, cascading over a rocky promintory labeled \"Lava Layers\". The ice cascade is labeled \"Nisqually Icefall\", with the glacier below labeled \"Nisqually Glacier\". A small inset photo below the Nisqually Glacier is captioned \"Lava layers vary from 50 to 100 feet thick\" and shows a close-up view of a section of the rocky lava layers on the mountain's slope. A small box in the lower left corner of the exhibit panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work. Entrance fees were used to produce this exhibit\".<br /> <br /> <strong>Visit This Exhibit Panel</strong><br /> Ricksecker Point is located approximately 6.5 miles from Longmire and 5 miles from Paradise along the road to Paradise. A one-way scenic loop drive traces the edge of Ricksecker Point. The second exhibit panel is located in pullout approximately 0.27 miles along the road, overlooking the Nisqually and Paradise River Valleys. Ricksecker Point Road is open to vehicles during the summer, typically from May-October. </p>",

This area was not included in the original boundaries when Mount Rainier National Park was established in 1899. After completing the road to Paradise in 1915, park officials saw a need for increasing vehicle access to the park and sought to construct a road “round-the-mountain\". Extending the national park boundaries to include Ohanapecosh in 1931 offered the opportunity for a better route in the southeastern section than previously available. This allowed for officials to proceed with the previously proposed East Side Highway, which would extend from Ohanapecosh to Cayuse Pass, and construction began the same year. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{eed42275-1f97-4eec-9734-9dd9cfa51f83}{220}\" paraid=\"680033770\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The East Side Highway was completed in 1940 and is now known as State Route 123. The archway for the entrance to the park was not included with the original construction of the road and was added in 1976 to give consistency with the look and feel of the historic Nisqually Entrance. The arch was constructed with peeled cedar logs and is in keeping with the signature rustic style seen throughout the park.</p>",

This was the last entrance arch to be built in the park and was constructed with peeled cedar logs. While it is not considered to be a contribution to the period of significance for the Mather Memorial Parkway, the arch was constructed in the rustic style similar to the other entrance arches and is compatible with the historic architecture of the park. </p>",

Today the two glaciers are separated by Glacier Island. Tahoma Glacier is south of the Puyallup Glacier and is separated from it by the Puyallup Cleaver. The South Tahoma Glacier is south of the Tahoma Glacier and separated from the Pyramid Glacier on the southeast by Success Cleaver.</p> <p>South Tahoma Glacier flows from a cirque into the Tahoma Creek Valley. Near its terminus the glacier becomes a stagnating mass of ice covered by rock that is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding moraine. Tahoma Glacier flows from the summit as a single stream of ice before splitting into two lobes that empty into Tahoma Creek and Puyallup River valleys.</p> <p>Between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago the Tahoma and South Tahoma Glaciers were connected, forming a tributary to the ancient Nisqually Glacier. The two smaller glaciers were again connected during the Little Ice Age about 100 years ago and remained so until nearly the middle of the 1900s.</p> <p>Like other glaciers on Mount Rainier, South Tahoma produces periodic and sudden catastrophic floods. In August 1967, water stored within the glacier burst from the glacier surface at the 7,000 feet (2,133 m) level. This sudden flood severed the lower glacier into two halves and then mixed with rocks, mud, and trees, forming a debris flow that destroyed the former Tahoma Creek Campground.

Sitting in colorful subalpine meadows that turn bright reds and oranges in fall, Sunrise offers spectacular views of the mountain and glaciers. The area offers a visitor center with exhibits and a bookstore, ranger-led activities, a day lodge with a gift shop and restaurant, restrooms, and miles of trails. Arrive mid-week or early or late in the day to avoid the crowds.<br /> <br /> Sunrise is perched on top of the earliest lava flow from modern Mount Rainier. Numerous layers of ash sit upon this ancient flow and catalog a variety of more recent geologic events. Popcorn sized pieces of ash from an eruption that occurred 2,200 years ago litter the meadows surrounding the visitor center.<br /> <br /> One can clearly see the scar of a massive collapse of the northeastern side of the mountain that occurred 5,600 years ago. The Emmons Glacier covers part of what remains of this wound like a giant bandage. The long ridges that radiate out from the volcano were formed by their interaction with much larger ice-age glaciers. Fire on the mountain has always had to contend with ice. Rock from a 1963 rockslide off Little Tahoma insulates Emmons Glacier and slows the melting of the largest glacier in the contiguous United States.<br /> <br /> A thin soil layer has developed from volcanic deposits. This volcanic soil drains quickly, erodes easily, and retains little moisture. The mountain intercepts moisture-laden ocean air flowing inland. This air cools as it rises over the mountain, dropping most of its moisture as rain or snow on the western slope. These factors have led to the development of subalpine meadows interspersed with clumps of trees. The annual wildflower display here is very beautiful, but the drier conditions prevent the growth of the lush flower displays that one can see at Paradise. On the other hand, the dry side generally offers clearer views of the mountain. The beauty and tranquility of the meadow’s disguises the constant effort of plants struggling to survive in this subalpine ecosystem’s short growing season. Please stay on trails. Plants in this environment are easily damaged.<br /> <br /> The area’s buildings evoke a sense of the past with their log sidings, stone foundations, and cedar shakes. These buildings in the Sunrise National Historic Landmark District were intended to blend harmoniously with their environment.<br /> <br /> For thousands of years before development of the area, Native American people recognized the meadows as a productive place to hunt and gather a variety of animal and plant resources. Aside from hunting and gathering, it is reasonable to believe that these early visitors enjoyed and gained a sense of spiritual renewal from the mountain. These values continue to be important to Native American people to the present day.</p>",

But returning these areas to their original condition takes a great deal of effort. Old roads must be removed and the ground reshaped to match the original topography before native vegetation can be planted. <br /> <br /> As part of the restoration, the National Park Service is researching the effects of blister rust, a disease introduced in the 1920s, on whitebark pine. The whitebark pine plays an important role in subalpine environments. A pioneer species, it is often the first tree species to establish itself after a fire, providing shelter for other trees. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> The Clark's nutcracker helps the whitebark pine reproduce. Its beak has evolved to fit perfectly between the scales of the whitebark pine cone. It pries out the seeds and buries them for later use. Those that aren't eaten during the winter germinate and grow in the spring. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the panel on the left side against a green background.

Here flowing lava met glacial ice. Unable to melt through the thickest part of the glacier, the lava flowed along its side and against a ridge, where the ice was thinnest. The lava then cooled and hardened into rock. When the glaciers retreated, they left behind high ridges of resistant rock like the one you are standing on now. <br /> <br /> The struggle between fire and ice has shaped Mount Rainier for hundreds of thousands of years. Today's glaciers are tiny remnants of those that once filled Mount Rainier's deep canyons. During the ice age, the White River Valley to your left was filled with glacial ice a thousand feet thick. <br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> The interaction of fire and ice also created unusual rock formations. Half a million years ago, adesite lava, the most common type on Mount Rainier, flowed along the margin of a large glacier that filled the White River Valley. The ice cooled the lava quickly, causing it to shrink and crack into narrow hexagonal columns that pointed toward the cool glacial ice. <br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the panel on the left side, with a large photo underneath it. The photo shows a detail of the columnar lava formation, an exposed section of rock with numerous hexagonal column fractures. The secondary text is located in the upper left corner of the photo. A series of three simplified graphics forms a column on the right side of the exhibit panel. The top graphic shows a mountain covered with glaciers that descend into valleys around the mountain and divided by thin ridges. Text under the graphic reads: \"During the ice age, glaciers filled the valleys\". The middle graphic shows the same glacier-covered mountain with lava flowing from the summit and being channeled between the valley glaciers along the top of the ridges. Text reads: \"When lava erupted, it flowed along the edges of glaciers where the ice was thinnest.\" The bottom graphic shows the mountain with the glaciers retreated up-valley. An arrow, labeled \"Ridge-capping lava flow\" points out the cooled lava flow left behind along the original ridge line. Text under the graphic reads: \"The glaciers slowly melted away at the end of the ice age, exposing high ridges of resistant rock that separate deep valleys.\" A small box in the lower right corner of the panel reads \"User Fee Project.

They are set amid colorful subalpine meadows with Mount Rainier and Emmons Glacier as a stunning backdrop.<br /> <br /> Opened in 1931, this wood shingled rustic lodge with a steeply pitched roof was built by the Rainier National Park Company. The building was intended to be the first wing of a resort hotel. However, the project didn’t come to complete fruition leaving just the one wing to service hungry visitors, offer gifts and supplies, and provide lodging to concessionaire employees.

As you walk along this 1.5 mile loop trail, you will be treated to views of Mount Adams, Mount Baker, and Mount Rainier, a geologic landscape that has been shaped by fire and ice, and the world renowned subalpine meadows that are found here. These plants that live in the subalpine, situated on the higher slopes of the mountain live by thin margins, face fierce competition for resources, and endure long winters with harsh conditions. The lingering snow and short summers leave little time for plants to grow, flower, and seed. After surviving all this, their greatest threat may be the millions of visitors coming to appreciate them. As you enjoy the views today, do your part to preserve this subalpine environment by staying on trails.",

In addition to its volcanic and glacial activity, the mountain intercepts moisture-laden ocean air flowing inland.

The northeast side receives less precipitation, resulting in more clear, dry days at Sunrise than at on the southwest side at Paradise.

The snowpack lingers here, holding back the forest, and allowing meadows to grow. Subalpine meadow plants have adapted to the high winds, late snowmelt and short growing season. Extensive root systems and mat-like growth help stabilize plants against high winds. Thick, waxy leaves and leaves with tiny hairs help retain heat and moisture. In this environment, trees have adapted unique strategies to survive. They clump together in dense islands that provide mutural physical support as well as shelter from the wind and cold. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo of a ridge with two rocky peaks fills the width of the exhibit panel. The slopes of the ridge are covered in subalpine meadows dotted with patches of conifer trees. The main text stretches across the top third of the photo against a blue sky. In the upper right corner of the panel is a small illustration in a red circle of a boot stepping on a wildflower crossed out by a red slash. Text next to the illustration reads: \"Protect Fragile Meadows, Stay on Trails\". Below this illustration on the right side of the panel is a small, black and white historic photo of a smiling Native American woman collecting berries from bushes. She has two woven baskets attached to her waist. Text below the image reads: \"For thousands of years Native American people traveled to subalpine meadows to hunt and gather berries and other plants.

Construction on the road started in 1927 and the road opened to the public in 1931. During the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) improved the road, including work at Sunrise Point.<br /> <br /> <b>Hiking</b><br /> Two trails can be accessed from Sunrise Point. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/palisades-lake.htm\">Palisades Lakes Trail</a> begins on the eastern side of Sunrise Point, while the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/day-hiking-at-mount-rainier.htm\">Sourdough Ridge Trail</a> heads to the west, following the ridgeline in parallel to the road towards the Sunrise developed area with a spur trail to Dege Peak along the way.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunrise Road Geology – Sunrise Point</b><br /> The Cascade Range consists of volcanic and metamorphic rocks established over millions of years. Prominent volcanoes like Mount Rainier and Mount Adams are much younger. They have grown on a basement of older uplifted rocks that formed the Cascade Range. Modern Mount Rainier began growing about half a million years ago but it is not the first volcano to be located here. An ancestral volcano grew at about this same site between one and two million years ago. The ancestral volcano has almost entirely eroded away during the past million years, so that only a few remnants of it exist today.</p>",

Along with Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, and Mount Baker, it is part of a chain of volcanoes that extends from northern California to southern British Columbia. The Cascade volcanoes arise from the collision of enormous sheets of the planet's surface. These large slabs of rock, called tectonic plates, float atop the Earth's mantle. Here in the Pacific Northwest, the Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the North American Plate, a process called subduction. The high temperatures and pressures of the subduction zone melt solid rock. Some of the newly-formed magma rises to the surface to erupt, forming volcanoes such as Mount Rainier above the subduction zone. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> On a clear day, you can see three other Cascade volcanoes: Mount Adams to the south; Glacier Peak and Mount Baker behind you looking north. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel on the left side against a green background. To the right of the main text is a small illustration of a subduction zone. In the illustration, a cross-section of the earth shows how the Juan De Fuca Plate is pushed under the North American Plate, where it melts into magma under the earth's surface. The magma bubbles up a magma conduit under the Cascade Range and Mount Rainier. Stretching across the bottom two-thirds of the panel is a photo of the Cascade Range as viewed from the panel's location at Sunrise Point. Numerous mountain peaks are visible above deep, forested valleys. From left to right the peaks are labeled: Seymour Peak, Governors Ridge, Mount Adams, Tamanos Mountain, and Cowlitz Chimneys. Glaciers below the Cowlitz Chimneys are labeled the Sarvant Glaciers. The secondary text is in the center of the photo. A semi-transparent map of the west coast of North America overlays the left side of the photo with triangles representing the locations of volcanoes along the Cascade Range. From north (top) to south (bottom), the volcanic peaks are labeled: Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters, Newberry Caldera, Crater Lake, Mount McLoughlin, Medicine Lake, Mount Shasta, and Lassen Peak.

The pullout is located 2.3 miles up from the gate along the Sunrise Road. A wayside exhibit panel next to the pullout provides additional information about the rock formation. <br /> <br /> <b>Sunrise Road Geology – Columnar Rock Formations</b><br /> The lava that formed the columnar rock formations you see at this stop flowed here during an eruption approximately 496 thousand years ago, making it one of the oldest lava flows from Mount Rainier. Carolyn Driedger, a hydrologist from the United States Geologic Survey:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We’re very high up here and you have to ask the question, how did the lava flow get here? Why did it perch up here so high? And the reason is because... when the eruption occurred, the valley of the White River was filled with a thousand feet or so of glacier ice at least to the surface that we are at today.”</p> </blockquote> <p>These lava columns are evidence that the valley was once filled with glacial ice. As the lava cools it crystallizes into columns pointing in the direction of cooling. Normally, one would expect them to be vertical, assuming that the coldest direction would be the air above the lava flow. These columns however lay horizontally, indicating that the cooling surface was to the edge of the lava flow. Geologists think that this lava flow actually erupted while the White River valley was filled with a very thick Ice Age glacier. The lava flow skirted the edges of the glacier, cooling as it came into contact with the ice along its flank. When the glacier eventually melted away, it left behind the lava ridge Sunrise is built on.<br /> <br /> While we encourage you to enjoy the impressive views while traveling up the Sunrise Road, please stay aware of the road and drive safely.

These pullouts provide a good place to stop and view the exposed hillsides on the left side of the road created by the road cut. A particularly good example of an exposed hillside is at the pullout 1.6 miles from Sunrise Road gate. These exposed hillsides reveal the geologic layers that built the Sunrise ridge.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunrise Geology – Hillside Road Cuts</b><br /> Mount Rainier is an active volcano formed by the accumulation of many layers of lava, volcanic debris, ash, and pumice during thousands of years of volcanism and glaciation. Some of these events, such as the Osceola Mudflow, form visible layers of different types of material in the hillside road cuts. Here’s a description of what to look for along the road from Carolyn Driedger, a hydrologist from the United States Geologic Survey:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“As you’re traveling up the road, especially in the lower part of the valley, you’re going to see some outcrops of very loose rock unsorted. It has big boulders set into a fine matrix and much of that is from the Osceola Mudflow, the big mudflow that formed 5600 years ago when we had an eruption of Mount Rainier... So we’re looking at this landslide from just the base of the mountain, and you’ll see as you travel that it did travel a fair ways up the valley wall... It hardened here in place and you can see it’s a very unstable slope and we get a lot of small rock falls off this slope over the years.”</i><i></i><i></i></p> </blockquote> <p>While we encourage you to enjoy the impressive views while traveling up the Sunrise Road, please stay aware of the road and drive safely.

With blasting winds and more than eight months of snow, the Chinook Pass area would not seem hospitable to plant life. Yet, in a compressed growing season, wildflowers transform the scene. Walk the trail around the lakes and look for meadow plants' adaptions to the short growing season in the subalpine environment. Thick leaves with tiny hairs are designed to retain heat and moisture. By growing in clusters, some plants create their own windbreaks.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top fourth of the exhibit panel against a plain green background. To the right of the text, a circular graphic crossed with a black slash shows a boot stepping on a wildflower. Text next to the graphic reads \"Protect Fragile Meadows. Stay on Trails.\" Underneath the main text, the main photo takes up the left side of the exhibit panel. A caption in the upper left corner of the photo reads \"Tipsoo Lake and subalpine wildflowers in bloom\". The photo shows lush green meadows wrapping around a shallow lake. In the foreground, the meadow is filled with blooming yellow wildflowers, and wildflowers bloom throughout the meadows. On the far side of the lake, the meadows give way to forested hillsides and a rocky peak rising above the lake. On the right side of the exhibit panel, two photos overlap slightly at an angle. The top photo, captioned \"Western Anemone\", shows a patch of wildflowers with fuzzy leaves and large cream-colored blooms.

The trailhead is located across the main road from the National Park Inn in Longmire. Along its 0.7 mile-length, view bubbling mineral springs and explore a replica of an early homestead cabin. Discover the plants and animals that call this area their home, including deer, birds, and beavers.<br /> <br /> <b>Rampart Ridge Loop Trail</b><br /> This moderate loop trail passes through forests with glimpses of the surrounding mountain vistas. Also known as \"The Ramparts,\" this ridge is the remnant of an ancient lava flow which originated at the summit of Mount Rainier.<br /> <br /> Rampart Ridge Loop Trail is 4.6 miles long with 1339 feet of elevation gain. The trail begins at the west end of the Trail of the Shadows, approximately 0.2 miles from the trailhead if heading clockwise. The loop can be hiked in either direction, but going clockwise keeps Mount Rainier in front more of the time and is thus recommended. Walk up through an old growth forest as you make your way to the top of Rampart Ridge. At 1.8 miles, there is a viewpoint looking up the Nisqually River Valley. As you hike along the relatively level ridge, listen for the tapping of the woodpeckers or the booming of the grouse. Keep an eye out for deer and other wildlife. Notice the various mosses and lichen clinging to the trees. On a clear day, hikers are also rewarded with excellent views of Mount Rainier and the Nisqually River Valley from two viewpoints atop the ridge. At 2.9 miles, join the Wonderland Trail for the return to Longmire.<br /> <br /> While Longmire is open year-round, snow can make this trail hazardous in winter. Winter hikers and snowshoers must have experience with navigation. <br /> <br /> <b>Backpacking</b><br /> There is no designated camp along this trail nor atop Rampart Ridge. Permits are required for camping. Permits and current trail conditions are available at park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers.

Because their skin must stay moist, these amphibians need water or wet surfaces to survive. They also need water to reproduce. The Pacific tree frog breeds in wetlands, ponds, and temporary pools, where there are fewer predators. The Coastal tailed frog breeds in fast-flowing streams, laying eggs in long, bead-like strings attached to undersides of rocks. <br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> Pacific tree frogs (<i>Pseudacris regilla</i>), also known as chorus frogs, are masked, two-inch-long frogs that change color to blend into their environment. “Ribbit”, “robbit”, “rabbit” are the loud synchronized, competing calls of the males. A loud “kreck-eck” is an advertisement call.<br /> <br /> The Pacific giant salamander (<i>Dicamptodon tenebrosus</i>) is another amphibian that only lives in the Pacific Northwest. This salamander might metamorphose (change) into a terrestrial adult, living primarily on land and returning to the stream to breed. Others retain their youthful aquatic adaptions and live only in water.<br /> <br /> Nowhere else in the world can boast of having Coastal tailed frogs (<i>Ascaphus truei</i>). They are only found in the Pacific Northwest. Living cryptic lives in this rocky stream, these frogs are seldom seen and never heard. Adapting to noisy streams, tailed frogs lack a vocal sac for calling and do not have external ears or a middle ear bone for hearing. Because they live in fast moving water, the male, unlike any other frog, has a tail for internal fertilization. Hardened fingertips assist with crawling along the rocky bottom. Small lungs decrease buoyancy, so the tailed frogs breathe mostly through their skin.<br /> <br /> Red-legged frogs (<i>Rana aurora</i>) occupy meadow ponds during breeding season and then move to a moist forest habitat. The red-legged frog is twice the size of the vociferous chorus frog but it is seldom heard. Their quiet, grunt-like call is often made underwater.<br /> <br /> Listen for the chorus frog, especially in evenings, spring to fall.  <br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A photo of rushing water in a creek, the out-of-focus ripples creating an abstract pattern, fills the exhibit panel.

Resting upon the forest floor, a tree absorbs rain and holds it like a sponge, whereupon mosses and other plants can colonize. The dead tree, called a nurse log, provides water and nutrients for new growth. Young trees sprout on the log, competing for sun and enough space to grow roots that will eventually anchor in the ground. While supporting the growing trees, the log slowly deteriorates. Many types of fungi, often seen as mushrooms growing out of the wood, help break down the decomposing log. Ants, beetles, and other invertebrates tunnel through the moist wood and feed upon it. The decaying matter enriches the soil by recycling nutrients. A tree constantly contributes to the forest until nothing remains of the tree.<br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> “Trees receive a most beautiful burial. Nature takes fallen trees gently into her bosom – at rest from storms.” – John Muir<br /> <br /> Count the number of trees competing for space on the nurse log behind this sign.<br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel against a green background. Below the main text in the center of the panel is a large photo of a fallen tree log with numerous smaller trees, plants, and moss growing out of the top of the log. Arrows mark the different components entering and leaving the log. A yellow arrow in the upper left of the photo labeled “Sunlight” points down at the log. In the center of the log, a curved white arrow labeled “Oxygen” points away from the small plants on top of the log. In the upper right corner of the photo, a white arrow labeled “Carbon Dioxide” goes into the small plants. On the bottom side of the log, a blue arrow labeled “Water and Nutrients” enters the log while a brown arrow labeled “Decaying Matter” leaves the log and enters the ground. On the right side of the exhibit panel, a smaller photo shows a log covered in moss and a scattering of mushrooms.

In the foreground of the photo, bubbles from underground mineral springs disturb a pool of standing water surrounded by green reeds and grasses. Further into the meadow the grasses shift colors, turning yellow-brown around a section of whiteish-tan travertine ground. Dense forest surrounds the meadow, beneath a steep ridge topped in snow-dusted cliffs. The main text stretches across the upper left side of the panel. Three small photos overlap the background photo on the right side of the panel. The first photo is of a fox with silver-black fur standing in a patch of tall grass. A caption under the photo reads \"Cascade red fox, <em>Vulpes vulpes cascadensis</em>\". The middle photo, positioned to the right and slightly lower than the fox photo, is of two geese standing next the edge of a pond. A caption under the photo reads \"Canada goose, <em>Branta canadensis</em>\". Above the goose photo against the right edge of the exhibit panel, is a photo of a brown deer with short, fuzzy antlers. Beneath the photo a caption reads \"Columbia black-tailed deer, <em>Odocoileus hemionus columbianus</em>.\" The secondary text is set into a small grey oval in the bottom left corner of the panel. Above the text is a small graphic of a historic gas lantern lit with a soft yellow light. <br /> <br /> <b>Visit This Exhibit Panel</b><br /> This exhibit panel is located in Longmire along the Trail of the Shadows, a short trail that starts across the street from the National Park Inn.

Western hemlock and western red-cedar, some as old as 850 years, are the dominant trees in Mount Rainier's old-growth lowland forests. These large, old trees live together with others of different ages. This diversity creates a rich understory and canopy of vegetation, which provides habitat for a variety of animals.<br /> <br /> Some of the last extensive stands of old-growth forest left in the United States are the lowland forests of Mount Rainier. Old-growth lowland forests can be found in many areas of the park including Ohanapecosh, Longmire, and Carbon River.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Old-growth forests also contain snags - standing dead trees - and \"nurse\" logs that provide shelter for a variety of plant and animal life. Nurse logs provide ideal places for young plants to sprout. Eventually, the snags and nurse logs decompose and become new soil.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A large photo fills up the right two-thirds of the exhibit panel. The photo shows several large evergreen trees reaching up towards the sky, branches interlocking in a dense canopy with a few glimpses of blue sky. The text forms a column on the left third of the panel. Underneath the text and half overlapping the larger photo, a smaller photo shows a log with several small evergreen saplings and other plants growing out of it. The secondary text is inset into the upper left corner of the photo. A small box in the lower right corner of the panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work. Entrance fees were used to produce this exhibit\".<br /> <br /> <strong>Visit This Exhibit Panel</strong><br /> Twin Firs exhibit panel is located next to the Twin Firs trailhead, which is along the road to Paradise between Kautz Creek and Longmire. The Paradise Road is open year-round. <em>NOTE:</em> <em>The Twin Firs exhibit panel was damaged by a fallen tree and has been temporarily removed. </em></p>",

The original “twin firs” that gave the trail its name no longer exist, but look for the “big three” conifer species of the forest: Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar. Forest wildflowers like western trillium, vanilla leaf, and bunchberry bloom along the trail during summer. In fall, the orange-red foliage of vine maples creates pops of color among the tall conifer trees. While short, a section of the trail is steep, climbing up a hillside before crossing a creek on a narrow log footbridge and descending back to the trailhead. The trail is dirt, softened by forest duff or debris, and often broken by large tree roots. In winter the trail can be snow-covered. Pair this hike with the Trail of the Shadows in Longmire to further experience Mount Rainier’s low elevation forests.</p>",

During the winter, snowshoers and crosscountry skiers can still use the closed road. NOTE: From May 24 - September 2, 2024, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/timed-entry-reservations.htm\">timed entry reservations</a> are required to enter the Paradise Corridor, which includes Westside Road, between 7:00 am and 3:00 pm. <br /> <br /> Westside Road is one mile from the Nisqually Entrance, in the southwest corner of the park. Westside Road was originally envisioned as part of an “around-the-mountain” network of roads encircling Mount Rainier but was never completed. Frequent flooding and debris flows by Tahoma Creek closed all but the first three miles of the road to vehicles. There is a small parking area at Dry Creek at the end of this three-mile section. From Dry Creek, the gravel road climbs to Round Pass, descends into the South Puyallup River Valley, then climbs to Klapatche Point, where the road terminates. From Dry Creek to Klapatche Pass, the road is 9.25 miles long with an elevation change of approximately 2,100 feet. Please note that due to danger from rock fall, vehicles must park south of the barricade at Dry Creek. Hikers and bicyclists should travel through the area with caution and avoid lingering in the hazard zone. There are no restroom facilities along Westside Road. The closest comfort station is at Kautz Creek, approximately 5.5 miles from the Dry Creek parking lot on route to Longmire. Westside Road closes during the winter at the Nisqually to Longmire road junction.<br /> <br /> <b>Bicycling</b><br /> Westside Road is one of only two roads closed to vehicles that remains open to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/bicycling.htm\">bicycling</a>. The other former road open to bicycling is the Carbon River Trail, in the northwest corner of the park. Many mountain bikers park at Dry Creek and bike to various trailheads along the road, or to the road’s terminus at Klapatche Point. Only E-bikes possessing a motor of less than 750 watts (1 h.p) on which the motor only assists with pedal propulsion are permitted. Bicycles are not allowed on any trails. All trailheads along the road have bicycle racks.<br /> <br /> <b>Hiking</b><br /> Several trails branch off of Westside Road. <br /> <br /> <b>Lake George & Gobbler’s Knob Trail</b> begins at <b>Round Pass</b>, 3.8 miles from Dry Creek. The trailhead is to the west side of the pass next to a wide pullout. The hike to Lake George is easy with a gradual incline over 0.8 miles through the forest. Lake George is a pristine mountain lake nestled in the northwest shoulder of Mount Wow. There is a backcountry campsite and restroom facility. Lake George Cabin is one of the park’s historic patrol cabins. Continue an additional one mile to reach Gobblers Knob Fire Lookout, one the park’s four historic fire lookouts. The final stretch of the trail is very steep, with rocky switchbacks to reach the lookout, which has spectacular views of Mount Rainier’s southwestern slopes and the Tahoma and Puyallup Glaciers. Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, and the Olympic Mountains can be spotted on clear days.<br /> <br /> Round Pass is also the location of the <b>Marine Memorial</b>, which remembers the death of 32 U.S. Marines that died when their plane crashed into the South Tahoma glacier on Mount Rainier on December 10, 1946.<br /> <br /> On the north side of Round Pass a 0.5-mile trail provides a short cut down to the <b>South Puyallup Trailhead</b>, or continue following Westside Road 1.2 miles (approximately 4.2 miles from Dry Creek). The <b>South Puyallup Trail</b> follows the South Puyallup River valley through forest to a backcountry campsite, then connects to the Wonderland Trail after 1.6 miles.<br /> <br /> Continue about three miles on Westside Road from the South Puyallup River trailhead, or approximately 7.2 miles from the Dry Creek parking area, to the <b>St. Andrews Creek Trailhead</b>. The trail starts on the right just past a rock bridge over St. Andrews Creek. On the left side of the bridge a short 0.3 mile loop trail leads to <b>Denman Falls</b> viewpoint. The historic St. Andrews Cabin is near the start of the St. Andrews Trail, before the trail climbs 2.6 miles up a ridge with long switchbacks up to the subalpine meadows of Klapatche Park and connects to the Wonderland Trail.<br /> <br /> Climb the final 1.2 miles (9.2 miles from Westside Road) to the road’s terminus at <b>Klapatche Point</b>, which is on the western border of the park. Look south back towards Round Pass or over the rolling hills to the west. <b>North Puyallup Trail</b> starts from Klapatche Point and follows a forested ridgeline east to connect to the Wonderland Trail at the North Puyallup River camp.</p>",

Evidence indicates that native peoples have been visiting and using areas like this for at least 7,000 years. About 200 years ago, European Americans began coming to White River to mine for copper, gold, and silver. With unsuccessful mining prospects, the area became more suitable for recreation and in 1921, the concession Rainer National Park Company developed a campground at White River. Two years later, the park opened a smaller campground nearby, and by 1925 decided to expand and take over all operations of camping in the park. This meant that in the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps was able to redevelop the now-public campground along with a designated picnic area. Today, the picnic area remains in use as a stopping point on the way to Sunrise, a destination for campers and hikers, and a gathering place for climbers and Wonderland Trail hikers. </p> <p paraeid=\"{329cd6cf-4f00-464b-89d5-ee26ff2bb8cc}{9}\" paraid=\"1871109469\">As you enjoy a picnic here, please be mindful of your impact to the landscape, wildlife, and other visitors. Trash cans are located near the west end of the parking lot for you to clean up and dispose of all waste. Never feed any wildlife or leave food unattended to avoid wild animals getting food that could make them sick or cause them to act aggressively. Please empty wastewater in sinks and deposit any solid food waste into trash cans. While there are grills throughout the picnic area, open fires are not allowed outside of the grills, and you must follow any fire restrictions in place. Pets must be on a leash, not more than six feet (1.8 meters) in length or in a crate/cage at all times. Pets are allowed along the road and paved sidewalks and may join you at your picnic at tables. Pets are not allowed on any trails in Mount Rainier National Park. Potable water is located near the restrooms. There are maintained paths to get to and between picnic tables. Stay within the established pathways to reduce impact on the forest floor. If you choose to play music, please be aware of volume out of respect for other visitors and wildlife. </p>",

It is the second largest glacier on the mountain, extending from the summit to the 4,700 foot (1,400 m) level of the West Fork of the White River. Its terminus is obscured by a thick coating of rock. Further up the glacier are a series of ice domes formed by ice breaking over bedrock, creating numerous crevasses. </p> <p>During the Evans Creek glaciation of the Pleistocene epoch (22-15 thousand years ago), Winthrop Glacier extended 14 miles (22 km) north of the summit, where it merged with several small glaciers from tributary valleys north of the mountain. By the late 1800s, the glacier had retreated nearly 3.7 miles (6 km) to its current position. </p> <p>The Winthrop Glacier was named for Theodore Winthrop who traveled by the mountain in 1853 as the region's first 'tourist.' Winthrop popularized the Pacific Northwest in his book The Canoe and The Saddle. </p> <p><strong>Viewing Winthrop Glacier</strong>: You can see Winthrop Glacier from the Sunrise area of the park. From Sunrise, you can hike to the glacier along the Wonderland Trail. You can also see it from 3rd Burroughs Mountain and Skyscraper Mountain.  </p> <p><strong>Winthrop Glacier Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>): </strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 3.354 ± 0.177 square miles (8.688 ± 0.459 km2) (Rank: 2 of 29 of glaciers on Mount Rainier)</li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 14,305 feet (4,360 m) </li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 4,852 feet (1,479 m)</li> <li>Elevation Range: 9,454 feet (2,882 m) </li> <li>Length: 4.86 miles (7.83 km) </li> <li>Average Slope: 24.48° </li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): North northeast (20°) </li> <li>Glacier Type: S - Glacier Head Near Summit </li> </ul>",

        "notes": "Wonderland Trail: Longmire Trailhead\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/wonderland-trail-longmire-trailhead.htm\n\n<p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{5}\" paraid=\"803418416\"><strong>Season: Summer</strong> <em>(May - October)</em><br /> Longmire is open year-round, but this trail can be hazardous in winter. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{15}\" paraid=\"1018423059\">This popular trailhead in Longmire serves as the primary starting point for the Wonderland Trail. The Wonderland Trail is a 93-mile loop trail that encircles Mount Rainier and has several trailheads throughout the park. Since its original construction in 1915, thousands of visitors make the trip to Mount Rainier to hike this trail every summer. </p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{25}\" paraid=\"1475230750\">Starting from the stone steps across from the lawn in front of the Longmire Wilderness Information Center, a moderately steep 0.1-mile trail spur ascends to a junction where the Wonderland Trail loop begins. </p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{45}\" paraid=\"1201596638\">To the north, the Wonderland Trail makes a short descent to cross the Paradise Road, and then ascends sharply. About 1.9 miles along this section, the trail meets the junction for Rampart Ridge, a moderate trail that connects back to Longmire through the Trail of the Shadows. Past this junction, the Wonderland Trail continues to Indian Henry’s Hunting Ground and eventually to Golden Lakes. </p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{63}\" paraid=\"2034725488\">To the east, the Wonderland Trail meanders parallel to the Nisqually River with a gentle incline. This section leads to Cougar Rock Campground in 1.4 miles, which is the primary campground in the southwestern region of the park. Reservations are advised for camping at Cougar Rock Campground. </p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{75}\" paraid=\"131587401\">Because Longmire and the immediate area are at a lower elevation on the mountain, the trail can be clear enough of snow to easily navigate in May and June. However, there may be lingering patches of snow due to shading from the trees and winter storms may have caused fallen trees and other early-season hazards.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{99}\" paraid=\"1729106607\">The trail is dirt, broken at times by tree roots and rocks. Shortly after snow has melted and any time after rainfall, these trails can be very muddy. Please stay on trail to reduce impact to the forest floor, and practice Leave No Trace principles at all times.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{109}\" paraid=\"581891442\">While Longmire is open year-round, snow can make this trail hazardous in winter. Winter hikers and snowshoers must have experience with navigation.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{119}\" paraid=\"1607718065\"><strong>Backpacking  </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{125}\" paraid=\"518623576\">Permits are required for camping. Due to high demand during the summer season, it is strongly recommended to make a wilderness permit reservation if you are planning to hike the Wonderland Trail. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Hikers doing the complete Wonderland Trail are limited to camping in designated camps only - the use of cross-country zones is not permitted. The closest camps for the Wonderland Trail traveling clockwise are Pyramid Creek, followed by Devil’s Dream. Traveling counterclockwise, the closest camps are Cougar Rock Campground followed by Paradise River Camp. Treat water before drinking. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails. </p>",

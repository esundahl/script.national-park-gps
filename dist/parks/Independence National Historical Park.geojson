        "notes": "Assembly Room of Independence Hall\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/independencehall-assemblyroom.htm\n\nThe Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution were both signed in this room. Later, the room became a shrine to the founding of the nation, proudly displaying the Liberty Bell and original paintings of the Founding Fathers. That was the scene when President-elect Abraham Lincoln visited the Assembly Room and praised the ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Following his assassination, Lincoln's body lay in repose here for two days. Visitors today can ponder their own role in the on-going experiment in self-government.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Second Continental Congress</strong><br /> The Pennsylvania legislature loaned the Assembly Room of the Pennsylvania State House out to the men of the Second Continental Congress in May 1775. Meeting just a month after shots had been fired at Lexington and Concord, the men prepared for war. They approved the nomination of George Washington as Commander in Chief of the newly created army, and they approved the resolution creating the Marine Corps. They also pursued peace, drafting the Olive Branch Petition. King George III never responded to that petition and talk began to grow of seeking independence. On July 2, 1776, the men voted to approve the resolution for independence. On July 4, 1776, they voted to approve their document, the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence was signed in this room on August 2, 1776.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Constitutional Convention</strong><br /> The Pennsylvania legislature loaned their room out again in May 1787 to the men of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/stories.htm\">Constitutional Convention</a>. The nation's first framework of government, the Articles of Confederation, had proven unsatisfactory. In a climate of great concern, delegates arrived in Philadelphia to address the inadequacies of the Articles. In four months, they created the U.S. Constitution, a feat George Washington called \"little short of a miracle\". The debates of the Constitutional or Federal Convention were heated at times, over issues like the power balance between large states and small states as well as the slave trade. During the debates, Pennsylvania delegate and elder statesman Benjamin Franklin looked at the chair where Washington was seated as the presiding officer. Carved into that chair is a sun. As the men signed the Constitution, Franklin said that he had the great happiness to know it was a rising and not a setting sun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Transition to Shrine</strong><br /> The state capital left Philadelphia in 1799, moving on to Lancaster and then Harrisburg. In 1818, the state sold this building to the city of Philadelphia. Philadelphians welcomed the war hero Marquis de Lafayette to the Assembly Room in 1824 during his triumphant return visit to America. The committee preparing for his visit first referred to the Assembly Room as \"the hall of Independence\". It would be decades before the entire building became known by that name. The room took on the appearance of a shrine with the 1854-55 redecoration. The Nativists rose to power at that time, a political party that used Revolutionary era rhetoric and symbols in their campaign to exclude immigrants from holding public office. President-elect Abraham Lincoln stepped into this shrine-like room in 1861 as he journeyed to Washington D.C. for his inauguration. Standing in the Assembly Room, he said that he would rather be \"assassinated on the spot\" than give up the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. After his assassination in the nation's capital in 1865, his body returned to the Assembly Room for two days. Upwards of 85,000 mourners passed by the casket.",

Generations since have gathered in this building to test the meaning of the words \"We the People\" and explore the documents' relevance to their own lives.

        "notes": "Independence National Historical Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/independence-national-historical-park.htm\n\n<p>Established in 1948, Independence National Historical Park covers more than 51 acres in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and beyond. As an administrative unit of the National Park Service, Independence National Historic Park also manages and operates three other legislated national park units in and around the city of Philadelphia. The site includes Independence National Historical Park, Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site, Gloria Dei Church National Historic Site, and Thaddeus Kosciusko National Memorial.<br /> <br /> Established in 1948, Independence National Historical Park was created to protect the historic places associated with the birth of the American republic, standing as icons of freedom and democratic ideals for people around the world. The park spans more than 51 acres within the City of Philadelphia, preserving and interpreting a rich collection of the United States of America’s Colonial, Revolutionary, and Federal period heritage. The park’s designers were strongly influenced by the City Beautiful Movement as well as the trend toward colonial revival in design introduced at Williamsburg, Virginia. While the urban renewal movement in Philadelphia was underway, the National Park Service was working collaboratively with local preservationists and stakeholders in developing Independence National Historical Park. Pioneering historic structure restoration in the 1950s and 1960s, with architects, engineers, archeologists, curators, and historians working on Independence Hall as well as other park structures, landscapes, and collections, led to development of a modern methodology and rigorous standards for restoration and reconstruction that are still a model for the National Park Service and private sector professionals. Most of the park’s historic structures are located in the vicinity of the four landscaped blocks between Philadelphia’s Chestnut, Walnut, 2nd, and 6th Streets. Here, along these streets, amid these venerable houses and public buildings, colonists began their quest for freedom and independence. Here too, the United States of America was born and its ideals enacted in the Constitution.<br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the park is Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution were debated and adopted in the late 18th century. Independence Hall and nearby Congress Hall were the principal meetinghouses of the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 1783 and the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. In Independence Square, the Declaration of Independence was read publicly for the first time on July 8, 1776. The legacy of the nation’s founding documents—universal principles of freedom and democracy—has influenced lawmakers around the world and distinguished Independence Hall as a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site.<br /> <br /> Across the street from Independence Square, the Liberty Bell, an iconic symbol of independence and an international symbol of freedom, is displayed in the Liberty Bell Center. Hung in the State House in 1753, it summoned the Pennsylvania Assembly to work. In the 1830s anti-slavery groups named it the Liberty Bell. The bell cracked sometime around 1846, but its message still rings out. Surrounding the Liberty Bell Center is the park’s Independence Mall, one of Philadelphia’s great outdoor public spaces, which runs between 5th and 6th Streets, from Chestnut Street to Race Street.<br /> <br /> Independence National Historical Park is much more than Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. The park preserves and interprets many of our country’s most important resources associated with the establishment of the government of the United States of America. Carpenters’ Hall is the site of the First Continental Congress held in September 1774. The Supreme Court of the United States first met at Philadelphia’s Old City Hall. The site of the President’s House, where George Washington and John Adams and their households lived and worked during their terms as the first and second presidents of the United States, prior to Adams’ move to the White House in 1800, is interpreted by the park, especially in the paradox of the Washingtons bringing their enslaved people to work and live there. Franklin Court preserves the site of Benjamin Franklin’s house and businesses, providing a window into the life and times of this founding father. Washington Square, one of William Penn’s five original squares, is home to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the American Revolution.<br /> <br /> The park also protects the First and Second Bank buildings of the United States; the Merchants Exchange Building; and the faithfully reconstructed social, cultural, and political center of Philadelphia during the park’s period of significance, the City Tavern. These are just a few of the many historic buildings and landscapes managed and protected by Independence National Historical Park.<br /> <br /> With so many important places under its care, Independence National Historical Park works collaboratively with many partners and stakeholders in the stewardship of our national heritage. The park works closely with the city of Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania, and with the Independence Visitor Center Corporation jointly managing the Independence Visitor Center located on 6th and Market Streets. Some of the historic buildings in the park are still owned by private organizations such as the American Philosophical Society and the Carpenters’ Company of the City and County of Philadelphia, so the park must work closely with these groups on the protection and interpretation of these properties. The park is also involved with numerous houses of worship and congregations, whose churches and cemeteries are an integral part of the historic significance of the park. Congress created the National Constitution Center as a private nonprofit organization in the park, located in a federally owned building on the mall, to be a nonpartisan interpreter of the history of the Constitution and its current relevance. There are numerous civic organizations, nonprofit groups, corporations, and countless stakeholders locally, nationally, and internationally that the park engages with on a regular basis. The diverse interests and passion of the park’s many partners and stakeholders reflect the importance of buildings and resources protected by Independence National Historical Park.</p>",

Designed by William Strickland in 1828, this steeple replaced an earlier steeple that was demolished in 1781.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Original Tower and Steeple (1750-1871)</strong><br /> As originally designed and built, Independence Hall had no tower or steeple. The first steeple was constructed between 1750-1753 under the supervision of chief carpenter and builder Edmund Woolley. Woolley may have consulted architectural pattern books like <em>The Architecture of A. Palladio</em> and James Gibbs' <em>Book of Architecture Containing Designs of Buildings and Ornaments </em>for design inspiration. <br /> <br /> This original steeple - described as 120 feet - housed the Pass and Stow bell (now known as the Liberty Bell) but no clocks. By 1774, the steeple had fallen into disrepair and in 1781, it was demolished.<br /> <br /> <strong>Strickland Steeple (1828-present)</strong><br /> In 1828, architect William Strickland designed a new steeple. Although not an exact reproduction of the original one, Strickland's design evoked the original 18th century design.<br /> <br /> Strickland's steeple differed in that it incorporated a clock with faces on four sides. To accommodate the weights for the Isaiah Lukens clockworks inside, the steeple rose to greater heights than the earlier 1750s tower. The Strickland steeple originally housed the Wilbank bell and Lukens clock. Both were replaced in 1876.

Before that, the clocks were wound by hand.<br /> <br /> The 1828 weathervane still sits atop the steeple today.<br /> <br /> <strong>See </strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/places-independencehall-architecture-changeovertime.htm\">images</a><strong> and learn more about the architectural changes over time.  </strong><strong>Check out these </strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/tower-faqs.htm\">FAQs</a><strong> about the Independence Hall steeple. </strong>",

By the 18th century, it had become a burial ground for poor Philadelphians, American and British soldiers during the British occupation of Philadelphia (1777-78), and victims of yellow fever. The square served the living as well; enslaved and free African Americans socialized here, and the city later landscaped the grounds as a public park. In 1825, the square was renamed in honor of George Washington.<br /> <br /> Located within the park is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the American Revolution. This memorial, erected in 1954, contains the remains of an unknown Revolutionary War soldier who perished in the fight for independence. An eternal flame honors the high price paid by soldiers in the name of freedom.</p>",

He carefully recorded their names, age, gender, as well as family members left behind. He also detailed their lives in slavery, including their enslaver’s name, their treatment while enslaved, and their reason for running. At times, he kept his journal hidden in a nearby cemetery out of fear of being caught and charged for violating the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.</p> <p>Still lived in many locations throughout Philadelphia while living here. (1844-1902). For example, from 1850-1855 he lived on Ronaldson Court (today 625 South Delhi Street), where he met and assisted freedom seekers and their allies—including Harriet Tubman.</p> <p>This marker highlights the location of where Still lived when he published the stories that he had carefully collected and preserved. Still saw firsthand that “all over this wide and extended country thousands of mothers and children, separated by Slavery, were…living without the slightest knowledge of each other’s whereabouts, praying and weeping without ceasing…” Still knew that these collected stories could help to reunite those mercilessly separated by slavery.</p> <p>Still published <i>The Underground Railroad, A Record of Facts, Authentic Narratives, Letters, &C, </i>in 1872. The book’s 780 pages listed the names and traumatic experiences of 846 freedom seekers. Still included the accounts of famous and daring escapes by people such as Henry “Box” Brown, William and Ellen Craft, and several accounts of the most famous Underground Railroad conductor, Harriet Tubman.</p> <p>The number of broken families reunited because of the publication of Still’s accounts remains unknown. The book, however, serves as Still’s legacy and more importantly a definitive record of the secret operations of the Underground Railroad.</p> <p><i>Please note that 244 S. 12<sup>th</sup> Street and 625 S.

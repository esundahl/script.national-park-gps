The properties are managed in a collaborative effort to provide an interconnected and seamless experience for park visitors. Ideal for hiking, biking or horseback riding, the 7 Creeks Recreation Area offers 30+ miles of natural-surface trails that pass seamlessly from one park to the next while winding through more than 20 diverse natural communities where you can observe native plants and abundant wildlife. From short hikes to an all-day excursion, riverfront trails and winding pine flatwood journeys, looking to exercise or just seeking serenity—there are many types of trail experiences waiting for you. The bridge ahead is just one of the collaborations from this partnership. This bridge connects the National Park Service’s Cedar Point to City of Jacksonville’s Cedar Point Preserve. By adding this bridge and working together we essentially more than double the trail lengths, we add another social media worthy photo spot, and we invite our visitors to check out more of what our partner parks have to offer. As the northside of Jacksonville grows and more development takes place the value of large stretches of uninterrupted habitat becomes more obvious. Animals move safety from park to park, native plants thrive, and people find respite from the hustle and bustle of a city. With so much changing in the world around Cedar Point, this partnership helps to ensure that the plants, animals, waterways and landforms that made this region so attractive to people for generations, remain.",

        "notes": "American Beach Nana Sand Dune\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/american-beach-nana-sand-dune.htm\n\n<p>Today the quiet little community of American Beach on Florida’s Amelia Island is in transition. Modest vacation homes dating from the 1930s share space with vacant lots, abandoned buildings, and newer, more elegant structures. High-rise condos and beachfront mansions have risen to the north and south in adjacent resorts. Though small in area, American Beach has played a significant role in recent African American history. After the Civil War, and extending well into the 20th century, laws barring African Americans from public facilities were common throughout the American south. Not until passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did these so-called Jim Crow laws begin to disappear. Until they did, blacks simply could not claim the same rights and privileges that white Americans enjoyed. All along Florida’s spectacular shoreline, for example, African Americans were denied entry to most public beaches. American Beach was created to address that situation. Commercial establishments – motels, guest houses, restaurants, nightclubs – sprang up along with new summer homes, and American Beach became a magnet for vacationing African Americans from across the country. Visitors could find rooms at the A. L. Lewis Motel, Williams’s Guest Lodge, and Cowart’s Motel and Restaurant. Homeowners took in additional vacationers or rented out their homes for part of the summer. For day visitors, excursion buses ran between nearby minority communities and the beach. Out on the beach, there were surf fishing and shell gathering, beauty contests and automobile races, and the warmth of friendly faces. A number of small shops sold snacks and ice cream. The Rendezvous and Ocean-Vu-Inn offered dining and dancing. After dark, there was live entertainment.</p> <p>American Beach is located on the south end of Amelia Island, along A1A between Jacksonville and Fernandina Beach.</p> <p>The National Park Services owns the 8.5 acre sand dune. The \"Evans Rendevous\" building (not available for touring) was acquired by the Trust for Public Land. A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/civilrightsgrant\">African American Civil Rights Grant Program</a>, which works to document, interpret, and preserve the sites and stories related to the African American struggle to gain equal rights, is funding ongoing rehabilitation work at Evans’ Rendezvous. The majority of other land at American Beach is held by private landholders - please respect their privacy.</p> <p>Restrooms can be found at Burney Beachfront Park. There are no other visitor services or facilities for the public at American Beach.</p>",

Fish camps were one stop shops for fishing, area workers including migrants who may not have all the needed supplies, could come to a Fish Camp, rent a boat, pay to launch, bring back their catch and have it cleaned and cooked up, all while trading stories and tips with their fellow anglers. Today many fish camps have morphed into bait shops or restaurants scattered around the St. Johns River. Buddy’s Fish Camp was in operation until the 1990s.

Enslaved people farmed and hunted the land, tended the household, and boiled tons of salt from seawater. Follow the markers on the blue trail to visit the site today, but keep your distance, the ruins are fragile and could collapse. Stay behind the marked area and enjoy the posted exhibits. <br /> <br /> Though it seems remote today, Cedar Point was heavily farmed as early as 1783, when the King of Spain granted it to the Samuel Mills family. The Fitzpatrick family acquired it in 1795 and started salt operations, followed by the Browards around 1848. Due to the rich surrounding salt marsh, the land’s heritage of sustaining coastal people goes back thousands of years.<br /> <br /> Archaeologists are systematically searching the area to find artifacts that evoke the daily lives of enslaved people who toiled on coastal plantations. At least fifteen skilled workers, held as slaves, constructed the plantation's main house, kitchen house, and outbuildings of tabby, a concrete like mixture made of oyster shells. Our understanding of the site is fairly limited, but by using thorough investigative and preservation practices we can bring its story back into the light.<br /> <br /> Once visible from the St. Johns River, the plantation owners house and outbuildings were shelled during the Civil War.<br /> <br /> These ruins are a great example of how we can reconstruct our understanding of the past through historic research and archaeological investigation.</p>",

        "notes": "Firebreaks at Cedar Point\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/firebreak.htm\n\n<p>You may have noticed what appears to be a roped off trail over there. Is it a maintenance path to a ranger station? Maybe a flooded trail? An amazing view rangers are hogging all to themselves? No, that is a fire break. Firebreaks, also called fireguards or fuel breaks, usually define the perimeter of a prescribed fire or controlled burn and help contain the fire. Firebreaks are areas that lack combustible fuels along the perimeter of a burn area. Firebreaks are important considerations during planning, preparation, and implementation of prescribed fires. Although many firebreaks are capable of stopping back fires or other low intensity fires, most firebreaks are not designed to stop head fires by themselves. Several types of firebreaks exist, some natural like streams or gullies, others made by people like roads or the cleared path you see today. Most prescribed fires utilize more than one type of firebreak. You have already learned how fire is essential to the pine flatwood habitat, but did you know that the importance of fire is a lesson the National park Service had to learn? From 1872 when Yellowstone became the world’s first national park until the mid-twentieth century, land managers were dedicated to stopping what they saw as destruction of forests by fire. While some scientists and land managers had recognized the value of fire on the land and advocated its use, it was not until the 1960s that this view resulted in a change of National Park Service policy. Fire is part of a cycle in most ecosystems. It reduces dead vegetation, stimulates new growth, and improves habitat for wildlife, many of the details park visitors imagine when they think of a national park. With fire suppression, fire was removed from the cycle and ecosystems began to get out of balance. After nearly a century of no fires, fuels, such as dead trees, pine needles, leaf litter, and shrubs built up to unnatural levels in forests. In these cases, restoring fire is no easy task; sometimes it takes additional work such as manual removal of the debris before the fire cycle can begin again. During your park visit do you hope to see healthy wildlife, open panoramic vistas, forests penetrated by sunlight, or verdant grasslands? If so, then wildland fire was also likely part of that picture whether you knew it or not.</p>",

This location offered a great refuge with enough local resources, land, waterways, and proximity to other missions, to support the growing mission. Nearly 300 people, all from the Native American tribes of Mocama, Colones, and Yamasee, lived here on this point under Spanish rule. Nothing stands today, as in 1696 Guadalquini moved to San Juan del Puerto, on Fort George Island, home to Kingsley Plantation, and in 1702 both mission sites were burned by Carolinian James Moore.  <br /> <br /> As such, archeologists have only found a few buildings, one of which once stood before you. Imagine a structure built with wooden walls and thatched roofing, which is just vegetation, with 2 rooms, each around 15x25 feet. The room on the right has an open side, and the left room is closed. On the right hand room Native Americans would be cooking meals, largely seafood dishes, and the occasional pig.

        "notes": "Kingsley Plantation\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/kingsley-plantation.htm\n\n<p>During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many people came to Florida. Some, like Zephaniah Kingsley, sought to make their fortunes by obtaining land and establishing plantations. Others were forced to come to Florida to work on those plantations, their labor providing wealth to the people who owned them. Some of the enslaved would later become free landowners, struggling to keep their footing in a dangerous time of shifting alliances and politics. All of these people played a part in the history of Kingsley Plantation.<br /> <br /> The Planters Home in the midst of Kingsley Plantation was once the home of Zephaniah Kingsley, a wealthy slave trader and merchant. He purchased the property in 1817 in what was then Spanish Florida. Kingsley owned several plantations around the lower St. Johns River. Two of them may have been managed part-time by his wife, a former slave named Anna Madgigine Jai. Kingsley married Anna in 1806 when she was 13 years old, after she arrived in Cuba from West Africa. He freed her in 1811 and charged her with running his Laurel Grove plantation at Doctors Lake in modern-day Orange Park.<br /> <br /> Marriages between white plantation owners and African women were common in East Florida at that time. The Spanish government provided for a separate class of free people of color, and encouraged enslaved people to purchase their freedom. Slavery under Spain in Florida was not considered a lifelong condition, and free blacks were involved in the economic development of the region, some of them owning their own enslaved people.<br /> <br /> After the United States acquired Florida in 1821, the Florida Territorial Council passed laws forbidding interracial marriage and the right of free blacks or mixed race descendants to inherit property. To avoid difficulties with the new government in what he termed its \"spirit of intolerant prejudice,\" Kingsley sent his wives, children, and a few formerly enslaved people to Haiti, by that time a free black republic. His two daughters had already each married white planters and remained in Florida. He sold the plantation to his nephew, Kingsley Beatty Gibbs in 1839, and transferred some of the enslaved people to his plantation in San Jose.<br /> <br /> Kingsley then established a new farm in Haiti that was worked by former Fort George Island slaves, who had become indentured servants. Slavery was illegal in Haiti. They were to earn their freedom in nine years.<br /> <br /> The Kingsley family's experience in 19th century Florida underscores the arbitrary nature of slavery. While American slaveholders believed that color should be the basis of condition, and that that condition was fixed and eternal, men like Kingsley believed otherwise. As Kingsley himself put it, \"Few, I think will deny that color and condition, if properly considered, are two very separate qualities ... our [American] legislators ... have mistaken the shadow for the substance, and confounded together two very different things; thereby substantiating by law a dangerous and inconvenient antipathy, which can have no better foundation than prejudice.\"</p>",

The building was used not just as a residence and later office but also as a working kitchen providing meals for the plantation owners and their guests. Enslaved people, primarily women labored over hot fires and cast iron in the building. It was filled the the scents of food. Today the kitchen house has a covered porch.

These mighty live oaks can easily reach heights of 80 feet with branches spreading out from the trunk over 100 feet. Root systems can tunnel nearly 90 feet to keep live oaks just that, alive. Because of this, if you're outside and rain moves in, winds pick up, or if the sun is just too hot, all of which are common Florida conditions on any afternoon, the live oak provides ample protection. If you find yourself in this predicament, live oaks have a few distinguishing characteristics. The trunk is short and stout while the branches tend to twist and twirl, and Spanish moss likes to grow all over. Growing along the coast, live oaks have become well-adapted to sandy soils, seabreezes, and salt spray. On coastal live oaks, it is common to see something called salt pruning, where leaves facing the salt spray die while winds force branches to curve away from the shore. Salt pruned live oaks are often smaller than inland live oaks. Shoreline erosion also threatens coastal live oaks, felling trees over time. A popular spot in the Jacksonville area to see these fallen live oaks is the shore of Big Talbot Island State Park, called \"Boneyard Beach.\"</p>",

        "notes": "Pine Flatwoods at Cedar Point\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/pineflats.htm\n\n<p>You have entered the perfectly named habitat of the pine flatwoods, and as you might have guessed this environment is characterized by its canopy of pines and its flat topography. The pine flatwoods are considered a monoculture, or an area dominated by a single type of plant, in this case pines. While it may be considered a monoculture it is far from boring or lacking in biodiversity! Pine flatwood habitats are woodlands with widely spaced pine trees, a sparse to moderate shrub layer, along with a dense, species-rich groundcover of grasses and herbs. The canopy is made of longleaf pines and slash pines but other plants commonly occurring in this community are saw palmetto, wax myrtle, blueberries, and a high diversity of grasses; as many as 40-50 species.  Animals include green treefrog, gopher tortoise, bobcat, red-bellied woodpecker, cotton mouse, and fox squirrel. The flat topography, soils, and seasonal rain of the pine flatwoods strongly influence its hydrology. Some hydrological characteristics of flatwoods in the rainy season include minimal water runoff resulting in waterlogged and poorly aerated soils. During the rainy season and there may be standing water. Translation: MUD. But in the dry season - high evaporation draws water from upper soil layers, droughty conditions result.</p> <p>The pine flatwood is a habitat dramatically shaped by the forces of nature, not just water but fire as well. Fire is a natural and dominant factor in the ecology here. In the past, prior to human influence, frequent lightning-ignited fires maintained the rich diversity of these communities. Without the presence of fire, the groundcover will slowly degrade and transition overtime into oak dominated hammocks. Prior to human influence, it is generally thought that lightning-ignited fires would have occurred on a frequency of every 1 to 5 years in North Florida. Lightning-ignited fires would have also predominately occurred during the late-spring to early summer months in this area due to frequently dry conditions and the increasing presence of scattered thunderstorms during this season. Plant adaptations to fire are widely present including the thick bark of longleaf pines, which protects adult trees from fire damage. Even seedling trees, with their buds protected by a thick mass of needles, are capable of surviving frequent, light ground fires. Today, much of this habitat has been converted to other uses such as residential and commercial development, as well as agricultural operations. In the late 1800s turpentine production took over areas like this exploiting both the land and people in oppressive camps. Remaining portions of this habitat often suffer from historical fire suppression policies as well. Animals have similarly adapted to fires in pine flatwoods. Many species can detect and outrun wildfires, but others hide. Gopher Tortoises are commensal, they share their homes with many other creatures but when fire sweeps through even more animals use the occupied and abandoned burrows for safety. The pine flatwoods are home to threated or engendered wildlife including Florida black bears, Southeastern kestrels, red-cockaded woodpeckers, Florida sandhill cranes, and eastern indigo snakes. Natural forces of water and fire shape the land, creatures, including endangered species call pine flatwoods home, although the name maybe a little on the nose, these is nothing boring about this environment. </p>",

These salt marshes are crucial to the health and wealth of northeast Florida, and our park protects nearly 35,000 acres of one of the last unspoiled coastal wetlands. One of the most important factors of salt marsh ecosystems are ocean tides, acting as the marshes lungs, bringing in fresh water, nutrients, and animals, and expelling waste during low tide. You'll know low tide is approaching when you start to get whiffs of rotten eggs, don't worry it wasn't a bad lunch. What you're actually smelling is the hydrogen sulfide emitting from layers of decaying plant matter called peat. These peat layers act as carbon sinks, soaking in carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, helping to prevent climate change. Because of this, salt marshes contain low oxygen levels. Couple this with the brackish waters, and you get a surprisingly harsh environment.

The poorly named Spanish Moss hanging from the trees around you is neither Spanish nor a moss. It’s actually a native air plant or epiphyte, more closely related to pineapple than to moss. Spanish Moss gets water and sunlight by hanging off of high branches in trees. It does not directly harm the tree, although an abundance can block some sunlight from reaching leaves. This plant loves humid, moist environments. People have used Spanish moss for everything from clothing, to packing material, tea, to seat stuffing. Animals use it for a nesting material.  Spanish Moss hanging from Southern Live Oaks has been featured in movies and media making it a very recognizable plant and visitors have even tried to take a piece of the south back home. Beyond our Leave No Trace policies, this is a very bad idea as chiggers or Spanish Moss lice is commonly found in the plant and causes itchy red bumps.

        "notes": "Timucuan Ecological and Historical Preserve\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/timucuan-ecological-and-historical-preserve.htm\n\n<p>Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve was named in honor of the Timucua who inhabited the St. Johns River valley for thousands of years and were settled in the area at the time of first contact with Europeans. The modern-day history of Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve begins with Fort Caroline National Memorial, authorized as a national park unit in 1950 to commemorate the 16th-century French effort to establish a permanent colony in present-day Florida. In 1988, legislation was enacted to establish Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve to be administered jointly with Fort Caroline National Memorial, which is within the boundary of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve.<br /> <br /> By enacting the 1988 legislation, Congress established protection for one of the remaining unspoiled Atlantic coastal wetlands and prehistoric and historic sites in the area. Today, the Preserve encompasses 46,000 acres of diverse biological systems within the city limits of Jacksonville, the largest city in area in the continental United States. The St. Johns River, which passes through the Preserve, has been recognized as both an American Heritage River and as an America’s Great Water. With over 200 archeological sites providing evidence of over 6,000 years of human habitation, as well as numerous historic structures, the park offers a rich visitor experience in the natural and cultural history of the area.<br /> <br /> Much of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve is an estuary. Estuaries form transition zones between ocean environments and river environments and are subject to marine influences, such as tides, and waves, and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The inflow of both seawater and freshwater makes estuaries some of the most productive natural habitats in the world. The diverse biological systems within the park consist primarily of estuarine ecosystems, including salt marshes, coastal dunes, and upland hardwood hammocks, and salt, fresh, and brackish waters. The Preserve is also designated as an Outstanding Florida Water. The ecological zones in the Preserve serve as habitat for pods of dolphins, flocks of migratory birds, and a number of rare or sensitive species such as the Atlantic loggerhead sea turtle, the West Indian manatee, the wood stork, and the bald eagle. Visitors experience these natural areas through walking trails and fishing and boating areas.<br /> <br /> Inhabited for over 6,000 years, the area contains archeological sites that illustrate one of the oldest and longest periods of human habitation in the Southeast region of the United States. Shell middens and ceremonial shell rings serve as archeological evidence of early American Indian occupation of the region and provide insight into the lives of the Timucua and other pre-European contact civilizations. The history of French, Spanish, English, Union, and Confederate control of the area has also been documented and interpreted for visitors. The history of human interaction with the estuarine environment as told by the prehistoric and historic sites serves as a background for interpreting the modern day uses and management of the local area. <br /> <br /> Throughout its expanse, the Preserve encompasses a diverse variety of sites and structures that tell a number of unique stories. The Ribault Monument consists of a stone column memorial commemorating the landing of Jean Ribault near the mouth of the St. Johns River in 1562. Ribault erected a stone column bearing the coat of arms of King Charles IX to claim the land for France<br /> <br /> The 600-acre Theodore Roosevelt Area was opened for public use in 1990 and is experienced through hiking and bicycle trails. In 1997, the Cedar Point boat ramp area was added to the park. This area is a launch site for private boats and provides fishing and bird-watching opportunities.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Kingsley Plantation is a 60-acre National park Service site nestled alongside the Fort George River in the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve. It is home to one of the most extensive collections of tabby slave quarters in the nation. Twenty-five out of an original 32 slave cabins are available for visitors to examine. The historic site also boasts a ban, kitchen house, and planation house- all dating from Spanish Florida’s period of slavery and planation agriculture. Kingsley Planation represents a microcosm of both Spanish and American slave systems, as illsutrated by the lives of Zephaniah Kinsley and Anna, his Senegalese wife.</span></p> <p>Archeological finds at the site have revealed clues into the lives of the enslaved people, from their religious beliefs to their daily routines. Unlike other southern plantations, Kinglsey Plantation operated under a “task system” in which enslaved workers were given daily tasks to complete. Once finished, they spend the rest of their day working in personal gardens, patching clothes, hunting or fishing. In 1821, Florida changed hands and became an American territory. Zephaniah Kingsley, a slave owner himself, protested against the restrictive racial laws of the United States in1828, accusing the American laws of a spirit of intolerant prejudice. Kingsley Plantation is representative of the interactions between European, African, and Native American cultures, as well as the evolution of those relationships through time. Its buildings and landscape stand as a testament to the perseverance and strength of the human spirit.<br /> <br /> The Kingsley Plantation was operated as a Florida state park until 1991, when it was brought under management of the Preserve. The historic district includes a 1798 plantation house, tabby cabin ruins, and slave cemetery. American Beach on Amelia Island preserves and protects one of the last remaining examples of a beach resort established by and for African Americans during the Jim Crow era of segregation. American Beach is home to Nana, one of the tallest coastal sand dunes on the Southeast Atlantic Coast. In order to better tell the diverse stories, the Preserve works in partnership with the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor and the Network to Freedom organization. Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve owns a number of uninhabited islands and other remote areas that are mostly unused by visitors.<br /> <br /> Federal ownership amounts to 8,430 acres, just 18% of the Preserve. Other landowners include state and city parks, as well as over 300 private land and homeowners.</p>",

The Timucua all spoke dialects of the same language, although they were not united politically, living in different tribes with their own territory and dialects. They would not have seen themselves as one people. When Europeans first arrived in Florida in the 1500s, the Timucua occupied over 19,000 square miles of land and their population was likely about 200,000. However, by 1800, there were no more Timucua left as an organized tribe. They had been desimated by disease, and scattered becoming incorporated into other tribes such as the Seminole and Muscogee Creek Nation, or were removed to Spanish missions in Cuba. It is one of the goals of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve to remember how the Timucua lived and to tell their stories.<br /> <br /> These stories are often told at the Timucuan Town exhibit located at Fort Caroline National Memorial. This exhibit is located along the Huguenot Memorial Trail. It contains an amphitheater style benches for large presentations, a recreated Timucua hut, outbuilding, ethnobotanical garden, shell midden, canoe making demonstration and more. Here volunteers and rangers will present on the Timucua people and give demonstrations of crafts, skills, and lifeways. </p>",

        "notes": "Beaver Creek Ruins\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/beaver-creek-ruins.htm\n\n<b>Note: Be aware that the ruins are too dangerous to enter and should be observed at a safe distance while remaining on the trail.</b><br /> <br /> The ruins along Beaver Creek offer a glimpse into the storied history of the Brandywine Valley. With the establishment of Pennsylvania as a British colony under the proprietorship of William Penn in the late 1600s, English, Welsh, and Irish Quakers began to settle in the Brandywine Valley in large numbers. While the area had been home to groups of the Lenni-Lenape people for thousands of years, and had seen small scale settlement by earlier waves of European colonizers, primarily Swedes and Finns, these newcomers had the largest impact, shaping the landscape into the Valley we see today. While most of the farms, mills, and other buildings that these settlers built from the late 1600’s-mid 1800’s are lost to history, some examples remain, including the ruins of a house, a mill race, and the foundation of a saw mill along the northern bank of Beaver creek. The ruins of a two-story house, built in the late 1700s by the Green family, are the most prominent.<br /> <br /> The Green family were typical of these largely Quaker settlers, building up a combined farming and milling operation through the 1700s and early 1800s. Beaver Creek provided the power source for the saw mill, the foundations of which are visible in colder months when vegetation dies back. The water of the creek was channeled through a mill race, the remains of which can be seen to the south from the trail. There are also the remains of several small dams along Beaver Creek, which when active kept water pooled up in mill ponds, ensuring a steady flow to power the mills. By the mid-1800’s, due to rapidly advancing technological breakthroughs, the once cutting-edge mills that had lined Beaver Creek were outdated and entered into a steep decline. Many were torn down or left to rot, leaving us with only a few physical reminders that the Industrial Revolution in the United States had begun in places like the Brandywine Valley.",

        "name": "Delaware-Pennsylvania Border Marker",
        "notes": "Delaware-Pennsylvania Border Marker\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/delaware-pennsylvania-border-marker.htm\n\nDelaware’s borders with its neighbors have been the subject of much dispute and confusion, including up into the present era. A disagreement with New Jersey over a planned natural gas terminal on the Jersey side of the Delaware river in 2007 for example, which the First State saw as an encroachment on Delaware’s land, led to the Delaware state legislature (half-jokingly) considering a bill to call up the Delaware National Guard to defend the border.<br /> <br /> The section of the border with Pennsylvania is probably the source of some of the most confounding problems when it came to determining where exactly the First State began. Starting with the establishment of the proprietary colony of Pennsylvania in 1681, disagreements over borders were born. In 1682, to solve part of the dispute, a 12-mile radius from New Castle was to delineate the northern border of Delaware. However, this seemingly simple solution proved to be anything but. The center point of this circle was not clearly set, and it wasn’t until 1750 that the cupola of the Court House in New Castle was designated as the official center. Further, surveying technology in the Colonial era was lacking in sophistication, and the “Twelve-mile circle” as the arc became known was usually more of an approximation during the 1700s than a hard reality. Given that Delaware was administratively a part of the Province of Pennsylvania, albeit with its own colonial legislature, the unclear border did not cause significant problems, for the time being. The biggest snag was the intersection of the Twelve-mile circle with the border of Maryland. With Colonial surveyors not up to the task, this issue was one of the factors that led to the hiring of the English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, who established the famed “Mason-Dixon” line between Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, commonly seen as the line demarcating the North from the South.  <br /> <br /> Following Delaware’s declaration of independence from both the British Empire and Pennsylvania in 1776, the disputed border issue became a hotter topic. Several attempts to definitively survey the Twelve-mile circle took place throughout the 1800s, with the last and most conclusive being that of Captain W. C. Hodgkins of the Office of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1892. Hodgkins’ survey produced the stone boundary marker you are looking at. His surveyed arc has larger terminal markers at the points where the circle intersects the current border with Maryland and at the shore of the Delaware river. Every mile there is a marker with a “P” on the Pennsylvania side, and a “D” on the opposite, with a mile count from the initial point. In addition, there are markers every half-mile, with a “1/2” inscribed on the West facing side. The marker in front of you is one of these ½ mile markers from Hodgkins’ survey.<br /> <br /> Hodgkins’ work firmly established the arc of the Twelve-mile circle and is now the official demarcation for most of the border between the First State and the Keystone State. Delaware’s strange borders continue to be a source of dispute, as well as interesting historical stories. Think about where you live. How where the borders of your hometown, state, or country formed? How might they have been drawn differently? What does this tell us about the nature of human-made borders? These are questions we may not think about very often, but which can have a huge impact on our lives.",

The wharf of rocks is all that remains of the first landing.<br /> <br /> After the Swedes purchased land from the Lenape Indians, they built Fort Christina and established the colony of New Sweden, a thriving community based on fur-trading and farming.  Fort Christina was the first permanent European settlement in the Delaware Valley and the first in what would become Delaware – the future First State of the United State of America. In 1655, the Dutch, looking to strengthen their control of the fur trade, attacked and captured Fort Christina, forcing the capitulation of New Sweden. However, when Delaware fell to the English in 1664, it was the Swedish settlement that remained the heart of the village spreading along the banks of the Christina and becoming, in the next century, Wilmington.<br /> <br /> In 1938, the State of Delaware created Fort Christina Park which contained The Rocks of the first landing and a new Swedish Tercentenary Monument to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Swedish colonization of the area. <br /> <br /> The monument was a gift of the people of Sweden to the people of the United States and depicts the Swedish colonial vessel, Kalmar Nyckel, surmounting a column of Swedish black granite. It was crafted in 1938 by renowned Swedish-American sculptor Carl Milles, containing several bas relief's that  provide insight into the unique history surrounding the Fort. President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated the park and the monument in a ceremony on June 27, 1938. A crowd of 20,000 attended the opening, despite heavy rains, and distinguished guests included U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull, Swedish Crown Princess Louise, Swedish Royal Prince Gustaf Bertil, as well as a large delegation from Finland. </p>",

Dating back to the midpoint of the 18th century, it represents a lovely example of early Chesapeake and Delaware architecture and is the oldest wooden-frame structure in Dover. Even more significant, it was originally constructed as a workshop and tavern complex outbuilding, one of a bare handful of its kind still surviving in America. <br /> <br /> The building has borne witness to the shaping of a nation, from its birth amidst the fires of Revolution, its great strides towards Constitution and self-government, the growing pains of the early United States, its sundering in terrible Civil War, and a country’s mighty efforts to come back together again as it faced the triumphs and tragedies of a turbulent 20th century. The building itself served generations of Delawareans, seeing service as a workshop, a post office and print shop, lawyers’ offices, and private residences, just to name a few. Now, as we forge ahead in the 21st century, the John Bell House has a new lease on life as the interpretive center of First State Heritage Park, a place to share the stories of remarkable Delawareans and innovative government in the Delaware State. <br /> <br /> The John Bell House truly exemplifies the idea that the size of a place does not necessarily represent the scale of the story it has to tell.</span></p>",

Mica, kaolin, and feldspar were all mined at various locations, with the product then shipped out to ceramic factories in Philadelphia and Wilmington. Feldspar and kaolin were used in the production of porcelain glazes, while mica was used as an insulation agent in the ceramic production process, as well as later on in the production of spark plugs. Usually all three minerals would be mined side by side or within successive waves at the same site. <br /> <br /> This pit in particular was active from approximately 1850-1910. You can still see large amounts of mica flakes spread around the ground surrounding the pit and the remaining spoil piles. It was the production of mica and other minerals from this pit and others like it that served to elevate the Brandywine Valley into one of the first centers of the American industrial revolution. Combined with the mills of various types that dotted the banks of the Brandywine River, this area of northern Delaware was able to position itself as a major producer of both raw materials and finished products.",

This town served as the capital of Delaware until 1777 when it was moved to Dover in fear of being easily captured due to its proximity to the Delaware River. This building continued to operate as a court on the State and Federal level until 1881 when the courts moved to Wilmington. Over the years, it has been expanded to allow for more record storage and offices. Similar to most other historic buildings, it has seen a variety of uses such as a store, police station, jail, mayor’s office, restaurant, school rooms and much more.

While there has been no evidence of wooden crosses and field stones which were typically used as grave markers, there has been evidence of remains found throughout the grounds. This site remains an active burial ground with approximately 1,200 gravestones standing and it is estimated that there are more than 8,000 people buried on site.

It played witness to the American Revolution and, on December 7, 1787, thirty delegates (ten from each county) met on The Green at the Golden Fleece Tavern and ratified the United States Constitution, giving Delaware a place of honor as \"The First State.\"<br /> <br /> While The Green is most known for ratifying the United States Constitution, other significant events have taken place on it and around its margins since then. As the looming question of chattel slavery in America threatened the unity of the nation, headlines were consumed with the trial of Samuel Burris, a free Black man and Conductor on the Underground Railroad, who was arrested in 1847 for helping a woman escape slavery. He was immediately imprisoned in Dover and forced to await trial for 14 months. Eventually, he was found guilty and sentenced to be sold into slavery for seven years. Luckily for Burris, word of his plight reached abolitionists in the north and he was rescued on the auction block by an anti-slavery man posing as a buyer who, in a whisper, reassured Burris that his freedom had been purchased with abolitionist gold.<br /> <br /> The Green captured national attention again in 1920 when Delaware had the opportunity to be the 36th (and final) state to ratify the 19th amendment, which would grant women the right to vote. Determined women like Mabel Lloyd Ridgely, Florence Bayard Hilles, and others advocated tirelessly in Delaware for the amendment’s passage. Reporters from across the country arrived to find that the “war of the roses” had come to The Green: yellow flowers were given to those in favor of the vote – known as suffragists; red roses were the symbol of chivalry and the opposing anti-suffrage movement. A fierce legislative debate was waged at The Old State House, but Delaware legislators declined to vote – leaving the deciding vote to Tennessee. <br /> <br /> Today, The Green appears as a quiet city park, giving little hint to the depth of history shaded by its towering trees.</p>",

It is said that architecture is to make us know and remember who we are. As you take in the exterior of this Georgian-style structure and move among its majestic chambers it is almost possible to hear the echo of patriotic debate, the pleas for justice, the cries for freedom, governors, ordinary citizens, the enslaved and the freeman all made history here in the over two hundred years of the building’s continuous governmental use.<br /> <br /> The Old State House is the focal point of Dover’s historic Green. A stone’s throw from the Golden Fleece Tavern where delegates met in 1787 to ratify the new U.S. Constitution making Delaware the First State.<br /> <br /> Over the years modifications were made to the Old State House that altered its original appearance. Changes involved the addition of wings and a Victorian-style remodeling of the exterior in 1874. The building was restored to its original colonial appearance in 1912 and refurbished again as part of the national bicentennial celebrating the signing of the Declaration of Independence.<br /> <br /> Similar to the New Castle Court House Museum, Delaware’s first state house in New Castle, this structure features a courtroom on the first floor and two legislative chambers on the second.<br /> <br /> The two levels are connected by a graceful freestanding geometrical staircase. In addition to its unique architectural elements the Old State House holds a number of significant artifacts including an imposing portrait of George Washington and notable portraits by Thomas Sully of commodores Jacob Jones and Thomas Macdonough, Delawareans and heroes of the War of 1812. While inside the recorder of deeds office, you can follow the stories of African American enslavement to manumission including the celebrated ordeal of Samuel Burris, his work on the Underground Railroad and the saga of the Summers family from 1794 to the present.<br /> <br /> From its completion in 1791 through the 1930s the Old State House served as the seat and center of Delaware’s General Assembly. Now fully restored this silent sentinel continues to stand watch over the state capital, a commanding reminder of the founding and purpose of this democracy.</p>",

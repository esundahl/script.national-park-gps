His greatest satisfaction, however, was his service to his country as an economic advisor during World War I and World War II and as a confidante to six presidents. The story is told that Mr. Baruch disliked being driven to the White House to confer. He preferred to sit on a bench and wait for a signal light from the White House indicating that the president was ready to meet with him. He was so well-known in this role that he was dubbed \"the Park Bench Statesman,\" and once received a letter addressed simply, \"Bernard Baruch, Lafayette Park, Washington, D.C.\" A commemorative bench with a bronze plaque set in granite block was dedicated on August 16, 1960, Baruch's ninetieth birthday. The bench is located just northwest of the Jackson statue.<br /> <br /> Inscriptions<br /> The Bernard Baruch Bench of Inspiration<br /> Dedicated in Honor of<br /> Mr. Baruch's 90th Birthday - August 19, 1960<br /> For His Inspiring Devotion to Country<br /> And Distinguished Service to Boyhood<br /> By Both The<br /> National Capital Area Council and the Boy Scouts of America<br /> The Boy Scout Motto - Mr. Baruch's Philosophy<br /> \"BE PREPARED\"<br /> Set in the center of the plaque is a circular plate inscribed to read:<br /> For God and Country<br /> Fifty Years of Service<br /> 1910 1960<br /> Boy Scouts of America</p>",

It is one of the few memorials in Washington, D.C. commemorating a living cause. The funds to build this memorial were raised by Scout units throughout the United States, and each donor signed one of several scrolls that were placed in the pedestal of the statue. The memorial was unveiled in a ceremony on November 7, 1964. The statue was accepted for the country by Associate Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who noted that the day marked his fiftieth anniversary as an Eagle Scout.<br /> <br /> The bronze statue consists of three figures. The Boy Scout represents the aspirations of all past, present, and future Scouts throughout the world. The male figure exemplifies physical, mental, and moral fitness, love of country, good citizenship, loyalty, honor, and courage. He carries a helmet, a symbol of masculine attire. The female figure symbolizes enlightenment with the love of God and fellow man, justice, freedom, and democracy.

Believed to be the only officials of the United States who perished aboard the ship, Congress passed a joint resolution soon after their death authorizing the construction of a memorial in their honor.</p> <p>Sculpted by Daniel Chester French, the Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain was the first memorial built on the Ellipse. Both the design and location of the memorial fountain were carefully chosen to represent the two close friends.</p> <p>Both men were widely known in Washington's cultural, social, and political circles. Millet was a painter and a member of the Fine Arts Commission. He also directed the American Academy in Rome, Italy. Major Butt had been a military aide to both President Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. The fountain is not far from where Major Butt's White House office was located. The military figure with sword and shield represents Major Butt, and the artist with palette and brush represents Mr. Millet. Besides being a memorial, the fountain was designed to double as a water fountain for the horses ridden by U.S. Park Police while on patrol.</p> <p>Some historians have asserted that Butt and Millet were involved in a romantic relationship. Millet and Butt were close friends and housemates, often attending social gatherings and parties together. The two had vacationed in Europe together and were returning home to the United States aboard the <em>Titanic</em>. Butt’s eulogy in the <em>Washington Times</em> recalled that, “the two men had a sympathy of mind which was most unusual.” Noting that Butt was, “mourned by Washingtonians of all walks of life,” the article claimed, “None could help admiring either man.”<br /> <br /> Memorial authorized 1912 (37 Stat. 644), dedicated 1913<br /> <br /> Sculptor: Daniel Chester French<br /> <br /> Inscriptions<br /> In memory of Francis Davis Millet 1846-1912 and Archibald Willingham Butt 1865-1912.

        "notes": "Commodore Stephen Decatur House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/commodore-stephen-decatur-house.htm\n\n<p paraeid=\"{ef683079-f1c0-4188-8c23-11728d05dbf8}{179}\" paraid=\"598011376\">Designed by Architect of the Capital, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, the Commodore Stephen Decatur House was the home of the famous naval captain from 1818 until Decatur’s death in 1820. Located near the White House at the northwestern corner of Lafayette Square, Decatur commissioned the house as his family’s Washington residence where he entertained friends and dignitaries. After Decatur’s death in a duel in 1820, the property temporarily housed several prominent Washington statesmen including Senator Henry Clay and future-president Martin Van Buren. During the 19th century, the Decatur House served as a social center for Washington’s elite and as a residence for many prominent Washington politicians and foreign envoys.  <br /> <br /> Born in 1779 on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in a small fishing town, Stephen Decatur was the son of a merchant seaman who fought the British and French Navies during the Revolutionary War. As a teenager, Decatur joined the fledgling American Navy and distinguished himself as an able fighter and skilled seaman in the Quasi-War (1798-1800) with the French Republic. After being promoted to the rank of lieutenant, Decatur battled the Barbary Pirates in North Africa and successfully raided Tripoli Harbor in 1804. His actions in the southern Mediterranean won Decatur international fame and earned him the captaincy of the USS <em>Philadelphia</em> at the age of twenty-five. During the War of 1812, Decatur was further promoted to the rank of Commodore and won glory after the capture of the British Warship HMS<em> Macedonian</em> off the coast of the Azores.  <br /> <br /> With money acquired from his capture of the British frigate <em>Macedonian</em>, Decatur and his wife, Susan Wheeler Decatur, commissioned famed architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe to design an elegant three-story, Federal-style brick mansion at the northwest corner of Lafayette Square near the White House in Washington D.C. Latrobe, who designed nearby St. John’s Episcopal Church and the White House portico, was instructed by the Decatur’s to create a luxurious private residence “fit for entertaining.” Latrobe’s design included spacious double-drawing rooms that allowed the family to host balls and other social gatherings attended by Washington’s political elite and European dignitaries. Commodore Decatur had lived in the house for only fourteen months when he was killed in a duel with Commodore James Barron in March of 1820 after Decatur publicly criticized Barron’s capture by British forces in 1807. <br /> <br /> After her husband’s death, Sarah Decatur relocated to Georgetown and rented the house to a series of foreign diplomats. During this period, Decatur House became the unofficial residence of the U.S. Secretaries of State including Henry Clay, Martin Van Buren, and Edward Livingston who successively occupied the property between 1827 and 1833. After becoming heavily indebted, Susan Decatur sold Decatur House to John Gadsby in 1836, a prominent Washington area hotelier. Gadsby purchased the Decatur House as a retirement home for him and his family and moved ten enslaved individuals from his National Hotel to reside and work at the property. After Gadsby’s death in 1844, his wife, Providence, leased the property for twelve years during which time it was occupied by Vice President George M. Dallas and Senator Judah P. Benjamin. In 1871, the Decatur House was purchased by California statesman Edward Beale whose family owned the property until 1952 when it was donated to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Decatur House served as one of the first headquarters of the National Trust and as the Trust’s first house museum property. In 1967, the property was designated a National Historic Landmark and became a public museum. The property is currently leased to the White House Historical Association.<br /> <br /> Generations of enslaved families lived and worked at the Decatur House prior to Emancipation. The quarters where the enslaved workers lived still stands today as a rare example of an extant urban slave dwelling in the nation’s capital. Many of the prominent American politicians living at Decatur House enslaved people who resided and worked at the property. One enslaved resident, Charlotte Dupuy sued her owner, noted politician and statesman Henry Clay, for her freedom triggering a lengthy legal battle that eventually resulted in her emancipation in 1840. Throughout his ownership of the Decatur House, John Gadsby purchased and sold many slaves, often from outside of Washington D.C. with the explicit intent to sever family connections. Gadsby owned several enslaved individuals that worked at the Decatur House and were housed in the two-story structure facing H Street.<br /> <br /> The Decatur House is both an architectural landmark and a historical landmark as the first private residence in the neighborhood of the White House and as one of the few remaining residential designs of renowned Architect of the Capital Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Throughout its two-hundred years of existence, the Decatur House has been the residence of many influential American politicians and military figures of the 19th century and a site of enslavement for generations of African Americans. Through the legacy of the individuals that resided and worked there and through its architectural expression, the Decatur House remains a symbol of the United States’ growing political and cultural ambitions during the 19th century. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3a9e30b2-99e3-4ffe-800a-df461f381c0b}{248}\" paraid=\"2013037136\"><br /> <u>Sources:</u> </p> <p paraeid=\"{3a9e30b2-99e3-4ffe-800a-df461f381c0b}{254}\" paraid=\"1195789854\">Allison, Robert J.  <br /> 2005 Stephen Decatur: American Naval Hero, 1779-1820, University of Massachusetts Press, Boston, MA </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{19}\" paraid=\"558016836\">De Kay, James T.  <br /> 2004 A Rage for Glory: The Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur, Free Press Publishers, New York, NY </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{39}\" paraid=\"480689417\">Long, David F.  <br /> 1979 William Bainbridge and the Barron-Decatur Duel: Mere Participant or Active Plotter?, The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 103, No. 1 </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{59}\" paraid=\"214562037\">National Park Service, <br /> American Federation of Labor Building National Register of Historic Places Inventory- Nomination Form, National Park Service, Department of Labor  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{79}\" paraid=\"1203683834\">White House Historical Association <br /> The Historic Decatur House, White House Association Website, <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-historic-decatur-house\">https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-historic-decatur-house</a></p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{116}\" paraid=\"1655579538\">White House Historical Association <br /> Commodore Stephen Decatur: An Early American Naval War Hero, White House Association Website, <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/commodore-stephen-decatur-an-early-american-naval-war-hero\">https://www.whitehousehistory.org/commodore-stephen-decatur-an-early-american-naval-war-hero</a></p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{143}\" paraid=\"1539173108\">White House Historical Association  <br /> Slavery in the President’s Neighborhood Press Collection, White House Historical Association Press Collection, <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-collections/slavery-in-the-presidents-neighborhood-press-collection\">https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-collections/slavery-in-the-presidents-neighborhood-press-collection</a><br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{166}\" paraid=\"1746462312\"><a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/117691809\">NHL Nomination</a>  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{175}\" paraid=\"508302343\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</a> are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

        "notes": "First Division Monument\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/first-division-monument.htm\n\nThis memorial proclaims the heroism of the soldiers of the First Division of the American Expeditionary Forces who gave their lives during World War I. The monument was dedicated by President Calvin Coolidge on October 4, 1924. Additions to the memorial were made in 1957 to honor the dead from World War II and in 1977 to honor those who died in the Vietnam War. The most recent addition, dedicated in 1995, commemorates those who died during Desert Storm in 1991. The symbol of the First Division is \"the Big Red One.\" A bed of red flowers in front of the memorial spells out a huge numeral one from spring to fall. The symbol is modeled after the \"big red one\" in the center of the division's patch. This pink Milford granite column from Massachusetts is one of the largest pieces ever taken from a quarry in the United States. Standing atop the sphere is a 15-foot-tall, gilded bronze figure of Victory. She is supported by wings, suggesting the perfection of body and soul. In her right hand she carries a flag, while her left extends in a blessing of the dead.<br /> <br /> General John Pershing, commander of U.S. troops in WWI, was particularly proud of the First Division, which came to be known as \"Pershing's Own.\"The soldiers of the First Division were the first American troops to arrive in France in 1917 and the last to leave Europe in September 1919. When the war was over, many wanted to honor the service and sacrifice of these men with the First Division Monument, an impressive pedestal listing the names of 5,516 First Division soldiers who gave their lives. Pershing said of the division that it had \"a special pride of service and a high state of morale never broken by hardship nor battle,\" a quote inscribed on the pedestal of the monument.<br /> <br /> More than 6,000 veterans and guests gathered to dedicate the First Division Monument on October 4, 1924. Major General Summerall served as grand marshal and spoke movingly of the spirit of the First Division. President Coolidge gave the dedication address and the ceremonies concluded with a benediction followed by the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" played by the massed bands of the First Division.<br /> <br /> The First Division Monument was highly praised for both its design and its mission. For many years it was the only memorial in Washington dedicated to the soldiers of World War I. The Commission of Fine Arts described it as \"the chief symbol of American valor in that war, a position borne out by the universal character of its design and location.”<br /> <br /> Located adjacent to the White House and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the First Division Monument is auspiciously located.

Thirteen years later he became the seventh president of the United States.<br /> <br /> The bronze statue faces west, while Jackson and his charger look slightly south toward the White House. The sculptor Clark Mills erected a studio and furnace near the proposed site in 1849. He had to make six castings of the horse before the final casting was completed in December, 1852. The entire statue was cast in ten pieces, four of the horse and six of Jackson, for a total weight of 15 tons. The statue, the first in the park, was dedicated on January 8, 1853, on the thirty-eighth anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans.<br /> <br /> Prior to 2020, four of the cannons Jackson captured in Pensacola, Florida, were arrayed around the statue. The cannons' carriages were damaged during protests in the summer of 2020. The cannon tubes were removed for conservation and have not been reinstalled.

Some believe the bronze statue portrays the Marquis de Lafayette (1757-1834) petitioning the French National Assembly for assistance to the Americans in their fight for independence. He stands on a marble pedestal facing south, wearing a military uniform and carrying a sword. On the south pedestal face, a bronze female figure, symbolizing America, turns toward him and imploringly lifts a sword.<br /> <br /> Lafayette was a wealthy nineteen-year-old nobleman when he sailed his own vessel, la Victoire, to America in 1777. He sought glory as a soldier and contributed a large sum of his own money to the Americans. He was appointed a major general in the Continental army and served under General George Washington. He was wounded at Brandywine, shared the winter hardships at Valley Forge, and was a key strategist in the Yorktown campaign that led to the British surrender. Lafayette was the first foreign dignitary to address Congress in 1824, and on his death in 1834, both the House and Senate draped their chambers in black.

His experiences as a General staff member in the Prussian army gave him a wealth of knowledge unheard of in the British and French armies of the period. This training eventually brought to the American soldiers the technical knowledge necessary to create an army. During the winter of 1778-9, von Steuben prepared the \"Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States.\" He also established a standard of sanitation and camp layouts that would remain a standard a century and a half later. Today he is known as the \"Father of Military Instruction.\" After his discharge from the army on March 24, 1784, he became an American citizen and was granted sixteen thousand acres of land by the state of New York. Today, this land, including the town of Steubenville, is located in central New York.

President George Washington worked with French engineer Peter (Pierre) Charles L'Enfant to select the sites for federal buildings, including the White House and the United States Capitol.<br /> <br /> In 1792, an encampment was built on this land for American, English, Scottish, and Irish wage laborers and craftsmen, along with barracks for enslaved African Americans who were hired out by their owners. These workers - free and enslaved, skilled and unskilled - labored alongside each other for the next eight years to build the White House.<br /> <br /> During that time, hundreds of enslaved people were involved in nearly every aspect of construction including quarrying and transporting stone, cutting timber, producing bricks, and building the walls and roof. Throughout each phase of construction, enslaved and free African Americans worked as axe men, stone cutters, carpenters, brick makers, sawyers, and laborers. The use of enslaved labor to build the home of the President of the United States - often seen as a symbol of democracy - illuminates our country's conflicted relationship with the institution of slavery and the ideals of freedom and equality promised in America's founding documents.",

From 1812 to 1815 Americans fought to protect their rights and economic independence. They faced superior enemy forces on the homefront and the high seas.The strategically important Chesapeake Bay region felt the brunt of the war, choked by shipping blockades and ravaged by enemy raids. The events in this region were crucial to the outcome of the war.<br /> <br /> Though there was no clear victor at the end of the war, the United States protected its democracy and emerged with heightened stature on the world stage.<br /> <br /> Explore this pivotal time in American history along the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail. To learn more, visit www.starspangledtrail.net and www.nps.gov/stsp. <h3>\"O! say can you see...\"</h3> After a 25-hour bombardment, soldiers at Fort McHenry raised a large American flag early on September 14, 1814.

The land that comprises Lafayette Park had been used as a race track, a showplace for caged animals, a graveyard, a slave market, and an encampment for soldiers, as well as for many political protests and celebrations that continue today. The park was planned by architect Charles Bulfinch in 1821, and upon completion several years later, it was named for the first foreign guest of state to stay at the White House, General Marquis de Lafayette.<br /> <br /> Originally named Lafayette Square, it was once a prime residential address. Many important residents included Vice Presidents, members of Congress, and foreign ambassadors. Naval hero Stephen Decatur's and former first lady Dolly Madison's houses still stand. The park has a rich history with St. John's Church, often referred to as the \"Church of the Presidents.\" Where the Treasury Annex stands was once of the Freedman's Bank, of which Frederick Douglass was a director.<br /> <br /> By the 20th century the park was known as Lafayette Park. The present park design was created by John Carl Warneke in the 1960s. The historic efforts of President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy, in the 1960s, led to the preservation of the park and the buildings surrounding it. The area was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970.</p>",

The organizers named the tree the \"National Christmas Tree.\" That Christmas Eve, at 5 p.m., President Calvin Coolidge walked from the White House to the Ellipse and \"pushed the button\" to light the cut 48-foot Balsam fir, as 3,000 enthusiastic spectators looked on. The tree, donated by Middlebury College, was from the President's native state of Vermont.<br /> <br /> From 1924 to 1953 live trees, in various locations around and on the White House grounds, were lit on Christmas Eve. In 1954 the ceremony returned to the Ellipse and expanded its focus. Local civic and business groups created the \"Christmas Pageant of Peace.\" Smaller live trees representing the 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia, formed a \"Pathway of Peace.\" On December 17, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower lit the cut tree donated by the people of Michigan.<br /> <br /> Cut trees continued to be used until 1973. Center to the season's celebration is the living National Christmas Tree, a Colorado blue spruce from York, Pennsylvania, planted on the Ellipse October 20, 1978.

This unique Federalist-style home was completed in 1800, and was one of the grandest townhouses in the nation at the time. Although the Madisons were offered use of several homes, the Octagon House was nearby and met their needs, becoming the temporary White House when they moved in on September 8, 1814.</p> <p>Presidential life quickly resumed a normal pace, although wartime anxieties cast a pall over social gatherings. The Madisons maintained their living quarters on the second floor, in the southeast suite, which consisted of a small vestibule, a large bedroom with a fireplace, and a smaller dressing room. The President used the adjoining circular tower room as a study and at least some of the time as a meeting place for his Cabinet. This was where the Treaty of Ghent was signed on February 17, 1815 before being sent to Congress for ratification, ending the War of 1812.</p> <p>This masterpiece of late <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/wash/dc22.htm\">Federalist architecture</a> features Coade stone decorative elements imported from England, as well as local construction materials.

The park is the oldest federal reservation in the nation, and it is a nationally significant historic landscape that continues to reflect the design principles of Pierre Charles L’Enfant in 1791, Andrew Jackson Downing in 1851, and the Olmsted brothers in the 1930s—design principles that have withstood the test of time. President’s Park is integral to the historic layout of the city, which was initially designed to physically represent the functional relationships of the three branches of our government. Memorials that have been incorporated into the historic landscape design commemorate significant events and individuals in the nation’s history. The White House grounds contain commemorative plantings by presidents and first ladies.

        "notes": "White House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/white-house.htm\n\n<p>A key feature of the design of the capital city, the President has lived in a home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue since 1800. Although it didn’t bear the name we know it by today – the White House – until around 1811, President John Adams and wife Abigail were the home’s first residents, and it has been the official residence of the president ever since.</p> <p>The White House was designed by Irish architect James Hoban, whose winning design was selected by President George Washington in a competition for the honor of designing the home of the American president. With heavy influence from Georgian and neoclassical designs of Hoban’s native Ireland, the President’s Palace quickly became a focal point of French engineer Pierre Charles L’Enfant’s city.<br /> <br /> The story of the White House and President’s Park cannot be told without accounting for the enslaved people who helped construct the house and grounds. The original laborers and stonecutter constructing the White House were African American slaves hired from their owners. Many other cultures were represented at the construction site; most of the crews were comprised of immigrant skilled workers and independent laborers. As an example of this cultural diversity, the stone masons were Scots and the designer of the President’s house was Irish.  The 1795 payroll for the project lists three carpenters.</p> <p>The White House has undergone constant revisions, additions, and renovations by architects and residents throughout its history. Perhaps the most notable reconstruction came in the wake of 1814 – an invading British army torched the White House, Capitol Building and Treasury on August 24, 1814 during the War of 1812 in retaliation for an American attack on the Canadian capitol York the year prior. President James Madison and First Lady Dolley fled the attack, but not before rescuing the Gilbert Stuart portrait of President Washington.</p> <p>Although the exterior walls stood following the attack, weakened by the fire, little of the original structure would remain intact. Reconstruction of the home began in 1815 supervised by architect Benjamin Latrobe, according to Hoban’s original design. The White House re-opened to the First Family in 1817, with President James Madison and First Lady Elizabeth moving back in.</p> <p>The home would continue to evolve to meet the needs of a changing presidency and a changing nation, including adding the West Wing in 1901, a second story in the 1930s, structural renovations from 1949 to 1951, and an extensive interior redecoration from 1961 to 1963.</p> <p>Today, the White House and/or White House grounds are open periodically to the public for tours.</p>",

The garden provides locally grown vegetables, fruits, and herbs for the first family and White House guests.The garden continues a long tradition of growing vegetables and fruits on the White House Grounds. Even before President John Adams moved into the White House in November 1800, he requested that a vegetable garden be planted. During the mid-19th century, the White House produced much of its own fresh fruit and vegetables on a one-acre kitchen garden. During the Civil War, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln regularly visited local hospitals to distribute strawberries and other fresh fruits to wounded Union soldiers.   During World War II, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt planted a Victory Garden encouraging Americans to grow their own food to supplement food shortages during the war. In the late 1970s President Jimmy Carter planted a small herb garden. First Lady Jill Biden added a floral cutting garden to the north end of the current garden in 2021 in order to continue her tradition of bringing fresh cut flowers as gifts when she travels.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service cares for the White House grounds including the Kitchen Garden. Our team of dedicated professionals, many of whom have cared for the White House grounds for decades, maintains the soil, plants the crops, tends the garden, and harvests the crops with the White House kitchen staff. The best times to get a close-up view of the White House Kitchen Garden are during the Spring and Fall Garden Tours, as well as the Easter Egg Roll. Outside of these special events, you can catch a glimpse of the garden from outside the South Lawn fence. When standing within view of the White House near the Zero Milestone, look to the left to spot the garden and the apiary.</p>",

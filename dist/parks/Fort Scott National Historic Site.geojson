        "notes": "Bake House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/bake-house.htm\n\n<p>Bread was a staple of army life. General Winfield Scott emphasized its importance, when he explained that bread was one of the \"great items of a soldier's diet\" and to make it well an \"essential part of his instruction.\" Scott instructed that \"officers ... will give strict attention to this vital branch of economy.\"<br /> <br /> The bake house was part of the quartermaster complex and was closely tied to both the quartermaster and subsistence departments; the quartermaster maintained the building and furnishings, while subsistence provided the flour rations and maintained the ovens.<br /> <br /> The quality of the bread was of utmost importance to the army, but it was difficult to maintain. The army gave no recipe for bread in the 1840s, just general guidelines, so the quality of the bread varied with the baking ability of the soldier on duty. The surgeon general also required that bread sit for two days before being eaten, because it was thought that fresh bread was bad for the soldiers' health.<br /> <br /> Needless to say, the bread was sometimes found ... lacking.</p> <h3>Bakehouse Oven</h3> <p>The oven fire was kindled at about the same time that the dough was set out to raise. The oven would be ready in about an hour when the loaves had raised. However, the first time an oven was heated after a long period of time, a large fire was left burning in it for six to eight hours. This transferred heat to the bricks and unless this was done, the bread did not bake well. One means of building a hot fire in a brick oven was by burning small twigs and pieces of hard wood, which gave a very hot fire. After the fire was no longer red, the ashes were shoveled out with an iron peel. The ashes were saved, if there was an ash pit below, for soap making, Without gauges, it was hard to estimate the temperature of the fire. One test was to toss a little flour inside, then close the door for one minute. If the flour browned nicely, it was ready, but if it scorched black \"the heat was too furious.\" A too-hot oven was allowed to stand open three or four minutes to reduce the temperature. Ovens could be cooled also by wetting a broom two or three times and turning it around and around near the top of the oven until it dried.<br /> <br /> Once the bread was in the oven, judging the baking process was difficult. A sturdy wrought iron candleholder on the end of a long pole, which had also a rigid hook, if available, could be inserted inside the oven by the baker to see how things were going. It also enabled him to move his pans about within, if it was deemed desirable. By the Army standards, the bread \"ought not to be burnt, but baked to an equal brown color.\" If the oven was not hot enough during baking to brown the crust, this could be remedied by waving a salamander (a huge heavy thick iron device like a short peel) over the crust to darken it. Good bread, according to regulations, had a crust that was not detached from the crumb and upon opening it, when fresh, one smelled a sweet and balsamic odor.</p>",

        "notes": "Dragoon Barracks\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/dragoon-barracks.htm\n\n<p>Each room of the dragoon barracks in front of you provided the soldier with necessities that enabled him to do his duty. The squad room gave him a place to sleep, the mess hall a place to eat, and the laundress quarters a place to get his clothes clean. Duty rosters generated at the company office kept him busy during the day. In the evening, soldiers could spend free time in the barracks playing cards or checkers, engaging in the sport of boxing, reading books, or writing letters home, although the latter two activities were limited to those soldiers who were literate.<br /> <br /> Take a Virtual Tour of the Dragoon Barracks<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fosc/learn/photosmultimedia/virtualbarracks.htm\">Dragoon Barracks - Fort Scott National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <h3>Mess Hall</h3> <p>A company of soldiers ate in the mess hall. The company was divided into four squads of 12 privates each. One source reveals that each squad sat at its own table; hence, there were four tables in the mess hall. By regulation, the tables and the mess hall had to be maintained to the utmost neatness. By design and upkeep, mess halls were not only efficient but also relatively sanitary places to serve the soldiers their meals.<br /> <br /> One soldier's description of the mess hall is as follows: <strong>I was directed to follow, and found the mess room large enough to hold the entire company of boys at one sitting. There were a long pine tables and benches without backs, all scrubbed clean. At each boy's place was a tin plate, containing a small portion of stewed dried apples, a large stone china bowl filled with black coffee (sweetened but without milk) and a slice of bread about four ounces in weight. There were iron spoons, knives and forks, and a few dishes on the table containing pepper and salt.</strong></p> <h3>Kitchen</h3> <p>There is an old axiom that an army travels on its stomach. The activity that went on in the kitchen and mess hall was critical to the soldier's health and survival. Lack of food would obviously lead to starvation, but also important was the quality of the cooking and the variety of the food. The cast iron kettles and skillets used in open hearth and Dutch oven cooking helped assure that the food was evenly heated and cooked. In theory, the rations of salt beef, salt pork, beans, rice, and vegetables from the garden should have made a palatable soup or stew. However, the quality of the food also depended on the soldier doing the cooking. As this was a rotated duty, the quality varied with the cooking skills of the private on duty that day.</p> <h3>Company Office</h3> <p>Many offices and businesses post daily work schedules as a means of guidance and organization. At Fort Scott, company officers (captain and two lieutenants) assisted by a first sergeant kept records in this office. They posted daily duty rosters, kept records of roll calls, musters, work details and other paperwork necessary to run the company efficiently and to track the daily activities of the soldiers in their command.</p> <h3>Laundress Quarters</h3> <p>Called the, \"red armed women of the west,\" laundresses scrubbed their way into history as they took on the task of keeping the army their whitest and their brightest. The laundresses were the only offically recognized women on the post. Laundresses received fifty cents per month from each soldier she washed clothes for. Since a laundress at Fort Scott typically washed clothes for 15 men, her salary averaged $7.50 per month. She also received free medical services and rations from the commisary. Laundresses could get extra pay for mending, caring for officers' children and other non-specified services.<br /> At Fort Scott, evidence indicates that the laundresses had rooms in the barracks.Those who were married might have stayed in tents with their husbands close to the riverbank, a situation which made their job easier. These rows of tents were often referred to as \"soap suds row.\"</p> <h3>Married NCO Quarters</h3> <p>A married sergeant might occupy this room with his wife and children, if they were so endowed. While rather crowded, it at least afforded them some privacy. If more than one sergeant of the company were married, this room would likely be occupied by the one with the most seniority.</p> <h3>Squad Room</h3> <p>Two squad rooms or sleeping quarters occupied the upper floor of each barracks. Up to twenty-six soldiers (two corporals and twenty-four privates) could sleep in each squad room. Corporals slept in the small beds while the privates slept in the bunks, two per bunk. They slept head to toe. Soldiers were required to bathe weekly and wash their feet twice per week,<br /> In addition to using it for sleeping, the squad room was used for leisure purposes. Soldiers played cards and checkers, read books, and wrote letters home, if they were literate. While the atmosphere could promote camaraderie, the crowded conditions often led to conflict.</p> <h3>Sergeants' Room</h3> <p>Rank had privileges, even among non-commissioned officers. Sergeants, who were responsible for training and discipline, had their own room and some amenities not afforded to the enlisted men. Those amenities included their own washbasins and privacy. Each company had four sergeants: while they potentially could all stay in this room, many often did not, either because they were married or were off on other assignments. Frequently, a sergeant could get this room to himself.</p>",

Designed to shelter 80 horses, the stables included a hayloft and granaries that stored the horses' daily ration of 14 lbs of hay, 6 qts. of oats, and 4 qts. of corn. A window above each stall provided the horses with ventilation, giving the horse relief and comfort during the often blistering summers. Tack rooms stored the equipment that enabled the horse and soldier to function as one. Here soldiers groomed their horses for the task of patrolling and protecting the frontier.</p> <h3>Tack Room</h3> <p>The care and safe storage of saddles, bridles and other horse gear helped assure they were in good operating condition, which would increase the likelihood of a safe, comfortable ride for both horse and soldier while out on patrol.<br /> <br /> The Saddle or Tack rooms were the responsibility of the stable sergeant and here all the saddles and riding equipment were kept when not in use. Each trooper had his own peg on which he placed his saddle, with the sweat-damp blanket on top to dry, the bridle hanging from the pommel, and the other equipment laying on top of the saddle and blanket.<br /> <br /> Equipment, probably, was cleaned, oiled, and polished in the tack room, necessitating tables or sawhorses on which to spread and suspend the items being cleaned. Soap, linseed oil, turpentine, rags, etc. probably were kept here in cabinets or on shelves.<br /> <br /> The saddles currently on display range from 1833-1847 and include two 1833 dragoon saddles, a Ringgold, and a Grimsley.<br /> Â </p>",

This flag is not the familiar fifty-star flag in use since 1960; our flag has only thirty-stars. The thirty-star flag was in use from 1848, when Wisconsin achieved statehood, until 1851 after California became a state. California was actually admitted in September of 1850, but new flags are always introduced on the Fourth of July, so the 31-star flag was not used until July 5, 1851. Another thirty-star flag is displayed on the back wall of the hospital ward exhibit in the Visitor Center.<br /> <br /> Since this is a reproduction of a historic flag and is considered part of the historical scene, it is not flown at half mast. To preserve the flag, it is also not flown in inclement weather,, which includes periods of high wind, rain, and snow.<br /> <br /> The original flagpole was constructed sometime around 1850, and was made of two large fir poles joined with a cross arm. In addition to holding the two sections together, the cross arm would give workers a place to stand if work was required on the upper section of the pole. In 1855 when the contents of the fort were auctioned off, the flag pole, along with the lightning rod, were sold to John Herford for $1.00.</p>",

A grassroots network of willing partners, volunteers, and locations serve as the Freedomâs Frontier Board of Trustees, the coordinating entity for the heritage area.Â Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{245}\" paraid=\"8\">Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area has a distinct landscape of rivers, hills, valleys, soils, and vegetation. In the 1800s, before the nation expanded across the continent, the western border of Missouri was the American frontier. To its west, Kansas was known as a permanent Indian Territory for both the Plains Indians and other tribes who were forcibly sent to the region following decades of land disputes. Since river travel ended at the Kansas border, this area became a major jumping-off point for pioneers heading west on extensive networks of trails. Traders, miners, and emigrants secured necessities and purchased provisions, and prepared for long overland treks.Â Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{251}\" paraid=\"9\">In 1854, political tensions betweenÂ MissouriÂ and Kansas resulted in a violent border war as the Kansas territory sought statehood and debated the legality of slavery. At the time, MissouriÂ was aÂ slave state, and the issue of Kansas entering the Union as a potential âfree stateâ ignited years of turmoil.Â The violent conflict between slavery proponents and abolitionists in the war known as âBleeding Kansasâ (or âBorder Warâ) focused national attention on Kansas sovereignty and territorial law. This was one of the nation's most widely debated political crises in the years leading up to the Civil War.Â The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed in 1854 left the territory's future status in the hands of settlers. The struggle for freedom was at the forefront of the Border War, and in the Civil War that followed.Â Although the Fugitive Slave Law made assisting runaway slaves a hanging offense in Kansas Territory, abolitionists continued to help slaves escaping from Missouri by the Underground Railroad.Â Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{16}\" paraid=\"10\">After the Civil War, hundreds of African Americans came to settle in Kansas as part of the \"Exoduster Movement\" in the 1870s. Through the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, African Americans in both states continued the struggle for freedom from inequality and segregation during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights eras. One of the heritage areaâs most well-known civil rights stories is found in the landmark Supreme Court case known asÂ Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas which ended legal racial segregation in public schools in 1954. Today,Â Freedomâs Frontier National Heritage AreaÂ continues to advocate for equal freedoms for all Americans.Â Â Visit, explore and learn about the nationâs enduring legacy and struggle for freedom through the shared stories of courage, conflict, and hope for reconciliation as told across their broad landscape.Â Â </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{69}\"

        "notes": "Guardhouse\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/guardhouse.htm\n\n<p>The guardhouse in front of you served two purposes. It functioned as a jail for soldiers who had violated military laws and regulations and as a shelter for the guards who played a vital role in the fort's protection and security. The duties of the guards included patrolling the fort, enforcing the rules and watching prisoners.<br /> <br /> Discipline at any post of the 1800s was strict; punishments were harsh and often cruel. Punishments ranged from reduction in rank, stoppage of pay, and confinement in the guardhouse for minor offenses, to \"bucking and gagging,\" \"spread eagle,\" standing on a barrel, confinement in a choke box or the solitary cells, mounting the wooden horse, and even wearing iron collars or balls and chains.<br /> <br /> One soldier at a different post wrote that the United States Army had \"acquired a very odious notoriety for the diabolically inhuman treatment of the enlisted men by their officers\" Men were kicked, cuffed, cursed, and even mauled without cause, as suited \"the caprice or anger\" of the officers. Although laws existed to protect the soldiers, they were loosely enforced.</p> <h3>Guard Room</h3> <p>Quarters for the guard adjoined the prison section, because one of the duties of the guard detail was to provide prison security. The chief furnishings in the guardroom would have included benches, shelves, and a platform bed for the men resting between assignments. When a soldier was assigned to guard duty, he was assigned for twenty-four hours straight. He would generally patrol for two hours then rest for four hours, patrol for two hours, then rest for four hours and so on throughout the twenty-four hour period. During the four hour rest period, if the guard wished to lay down and rest, he would have had to do so on the platform bed. But he would've had the option of laying down on the bed only during the day. At night, he could neither sleep nor lay down under any circumstances.<br /> <br /> <br /> Weapon racks probably were common also, along with tables and benches. Fireplaces or stoves would have provided heat, and generally the guard claimed extra candles because of their need for nighttime lighting. Since the guard was the first line of attack against fire, leather buckets would have been readily at hand.</p> <h3>Cells</h3> <p>Each guardhouse had an area set aside for light and dark cells, which were reserved for the worst offenders - soldiers who refused to obey orders, had delirium tremens, were riotous, or perhaps were mentally disturbed. The light cells had small openings in or above the doors admitting some light and air. Dark cells had solid doors, and ventilation was provided by openings in the rear wall or by shafts. Cells were unheated and without sanitary facilities. Buckets served the latter purpose. Since many guardhouses were built of stone, like Fort Scott's, the cell areas were cold and damp. Although the surgeons at the garrisons around the country worried about the foul air, it was not until years after the Civil War that conditions improved for those in confinement.</p> <h3>Prison Room</h3> <p>Prisoners with light sentences were placed in the prison room. This usually was a large room with adequate ventilation but unheated. There seems to have been no furnishings in the room. The men brought their blankets and slept on the floor. One soldier, during a stay in different military guardhouse , indicated he preferred the cells to sleeping in the prison room with the other inmates.</p> <h3>Officer's Room</h3> <p>The officer of the guard directed the activities of the guards on his watch. Officers rotated into this role every 24 hours along with guard mounting or the changing of the guard. His duties included frequent roll calls, being present for the relief of sentries every two hours, and oversight of the noncommissioned officers who had direct supervision of the guards. He would be responsible for delivering the countersign or password to the sentries, treatment of prisoners, and responding to the guards when they challenged someone leaving or coming on to the grounds of the fort without authorization. He used a room in the guardhouse as temporary quarters while on duty. In this room, he kept details of prisoners and sentences on his watch, and prepared a record of his tour of duty. Because of the complexity and importance of the job, only experienced officers were assigned this duty.</p>",

The War Department understood the need for vegetables in the soldiers' diets, but unable to fill this need, they eventually tasked the soldiers with growing their own gardens to supplement their rations. Here at Fort Scott, Sergeant John Hamilton, who came to the fort's future site before the first garrison to set up temporary accommodations, planted the initial gardens. Each company had a small plot for their own use, as did the hospital and the individual officers. Plants known to be grown at Fort Scott include: cabbages, carrots, eggplants, muskmelons, onions, peaches, peas, Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, radishes, and turnips. Other plants, such as cucumbers and mustard, may have been cultivated, but there is no direct evidence. <br /><br />Today Fort Scott NHS cultivates two gardens with historically accurate vegetation. These gardens are in place to help visitors visualize the soldiers' daily lives at the fort and are maintained, in large part, by our Volunteers-in-Park. One is this hospital garden in front of the fort. The other can be found behind Officers' Quarters Number 2.<br /><br />-Information from Shelby Spears essay</p>",

The army laid it out similar to the dragoon barracks across the parade ground with a mess hall and kitchen downstairs and sleeping quarters upstairs. Its designer planned it to be a second dragoon barracks with stables in the vacant area south of the barracks. However, within a year after the fort's establishment, one of the dragoon companies transferred, leaving one company of dragoons and two of infantry. The barracks thus became a home for infantry and the army never built the second stables. Today, this building is not open to the public, except for the restrooms downstairs, which are open seasonally and a meeting hall upstairs used for special events. Military reenactors use the vacant area to the south as an encampment area. At the rear of the building is a cistern, historically used to capture rainwater.</p> <h3>Cistern</h3> <p>A stone cistern, presently covered with a huge single slab of native rock, is near the infantry barracks. Cisterns are structures designed to store rainwater. Using the roof as a rain collection surface, gutters and downspouts delivered water to the cistern. The possibility exists that this cistern dates from Army days, although there is no supporting documentary evidence.</p>",

Called the \"backbone of the army,\" the infantry soldiers, marching into combat on foot, formed the core of the army's fighting forces. Many were dismayed to learn upon arrival at Fort Scott that they were to be used as a glorified labor force. Using tools such as the adze and broadax, the infantry hand hewed the beams used to build this and other fort structures. Several complained they had not joined the army to build houses.<br /> <br /> This situation was not unique to Fort Scott however. General Zachary Taylor stated, \"The ax, pick, saw, and trowel have become more the implement of the American soldier than the cannon, musket, or sword\"<br /> <br /> Today, this reconstructed infantry barracks houses a theater and museum exhibits. The 23 minute movie and the interactive exhibits inside provide a good orientation to the site's history. An elevator provides access to the second floor for the mobility impaired.</p> <h3>Site Movie</h3> <p>The 23 minute movie, Dreams and Dilemmas: Fort Scott and the Growth of a Nation, was produced in 2009. It provides an introduction to the site's history and covers events Fort Scott was involved in from 1842-1873, one of the most critical eras of our nation's history. During that era, the nation acquired vast territory, expanded rapidly westward, and was torn apart by Civil War. Soldiers and civilians at Fort Scott witnessed and participated in these events.<br /> <br /> The movie is played in the upstairs auditorium and can be started by pushing the button below the screen. The movie is captioned for the hearing impaired. Devices that provide assistive listening and audio description for the movie are available at the visitor center.</p> <h3>Exhbits</h3> <p>Exhibits about the site's history can be seen on both floors of this building. Displays on the first floor include maps, artifacts, and interpretive panels that tell the story of Fort Scott and its soldiers during the 1840s.<br /> <br /> On the second floor, visitors can view interactive exhibits addressing Bleeding Kansas and the Civil War. As visitors walk through the exhibit, they hear the stories of six different characters who provide diverse perspectives on the turbulent events of the time. Characters share their stories through a series of short video snippets, all of which are captioned for the hearing impaired.</p>",

Since a laundress at Fort Scott typically washed clothes for 15 men, her salary averaged $7.50 per month. She also received free medical services and rations from the commisary. Laundresses could get extra pay for mending, caring for officers' children and other non-specified services.<br /> At Fort Scott, evidence indicates that the laundresses had rooms in the barracks.Those who were married might have stayed in tents with their husbands close to the riverbank, a situation which made their job easier.

To protect the town, in 1863, U.S. Army Engineers built four blockhouses or lunettes called Forts Lincoln, Henning, Insley, and Blair. These blockhouses and their large cannons, along with forty miles of entrenchments protected Fort Scott from would be Confederate raids. Fresh off the heels of a military defeat at Mine Creek in October 1864, General Sterling Price's army diverted its plans to capture the town after accessing its strong defenses. <br /><br />After the Civil War, the U.S. Army sold all of the blockhouses at public auction. All but Lunette Blair were eventually torn down or disassembled. Over the course of the century after the Civil War, Lunette Blair was moved several times. It functioned as a carpenter shop for forty years before being sold in 1906. In 1924, the Western Automobile Insurance Company began using the blockhouse on its logo after it was moved to Carroll Plaza (Fort Scott's parade ground that had become a city park). By 1959, after two more moves, the blockhouse had fallen into a state of disrepair; residents of Fort Scott essentially had it reconstructed.<br /><br />Today, Lunette Blair stands on Skubitz Plaza near Fort Scott National Historic Site, a visual reminder of the protection and security it provided Fort Scott during the Civil War. Legislation has been introduced to transfer ownership of the blockhouse to the National Park Service.<br /></p><h3>Twin Trees Monument</h3><p>Just east of Lunette Blair is a monument with the likenesses of two tree stumps and a plague in front that reads. \" The blood that flowed in Kansas before and during the Civil War nourished the twin trees of Liberty and Union\" . Duplicates of this plaque can be found at other Civil War monuments in Kansas including those at Baxter Springs and Osawatomie. </p>",

By design and upkeep, mess halls were not only efficient but also relatively sanitary places to serve the soldiers their meals.<br /> <br /> One soldier's description of the mess hall is as follows:Â <strong>I was directed to follow, and found the mess room large enough to hold the entire company of boys at one sitting. There were a long pine tables and benches without backs, all scrubbed clean. At each boy's place was a tin plate, containing a small portion of stewed dried apples, a large stone china bowl filled with black coffee (sweetened but without milk) and a slice of bread about four ounces in weight.

The activity that went on in the kitchen and mess hall was critical to the soldier's health and survival. Lack of food would obviously lead to starvation, but also important was the quality of the cooking and the variety of the food. The cast iron kettles and skillets used in open hearth and Dutch oven cooking helped assure that the food was evenly heated and cooked. In theory, the rations of salt beef, salt pork, beans, rice, and vegetables from the garden should have made a palatable soup or stew. However, the quality of the food also depended on the soldier doing the cooking. As this was a rotated duty, the quality varied with the cooking skills of the private on duty that day.",

Four three-story duplexes were built along officers' row, with two sets of quarters in each building. Typically, an officer and his family occupied half of one of these buildings. If the officer was a bachelor, he might share his quarters with other bachelors. Each of these quarters had two bedrooms, a dining room, and parlor for entertainment, a morning or sitting room and a kitchen.</p> <h3>Morning or Sitting Room</h3> <p>The sitting room was an informal parlor, so to speak, where the officer and his wife would have spent private time. Breakfast and lunch would generally be served here. The officer and his wife would have used this room to pursue leisurely pursuits such as watercolor, sewing and reading. This was for private time only, guests would generally not be brought down here.</p> <h3>Kitchen</h3> <p>The kitchen is where servants prepared meals for the officers. Being from the upper class, officers and their wives had servants to perform the household chores of cooking and cleaning. Particularly in the wintertime, the servant might have slept in the kitchen adjacent to the fireplace which would have provided warmth. In the 1840s, the servants were often African American slaves. At that time, officers from the North and the South owned slaves. The pans are made of cast iron and would have been used in open hearth cooking. The metal box in front of the fireplace was called a bird oven used to roast quails, duck, pheasant or other game birds that the officers would have hunted in the area.</p> <h3>Parlor</h3> <p>The parlor was for formal entertaining and social gatherings. After dinners, the ladies would go to the parlor to socialize while the officers would meet in another room to smoke and to discuss military business and politics. Afterward they would all meet in the parlor for games and entertainment. The room is furnished with a lamp that was state of the art for it's time. It gave off 360 degrees of illumination as opposed to other lamps that just shone light in one direction.</p> <h3>Dining Room</h3> <p>The dining table and elegant \"Millennial\" china reflect the elegant lifestyle enjoyed by the officer and his wife. Officers often entertained guests here, the room was for formal dinner parties attended by other officers and their families and traveling guests, if they were of the appropriate social class, might also attend.</p> <h3>Master Bedroom</h3> <p>The master bedroom was a room of comfort. Beds with high posts and other elegant furnishings reflected an upper class Victorian lifestyle. Often several different types of mattresses (e.g. straw mattresses, hair mattresses, and feather beds) were layered to provide comfort. Yet the beds on the frontier likely would be light weight to facilitate travel, as officers were frequently reassigned to other posts. Located on the third floor, the bedroom window overlooked the parade ground, providing the officer with a commanding view of the fort.</p> <h3>Guest Bedroom</h3> <p>If an officer and his wife had children they would generally sleep in here adjacent to the master bedroom. Education of the children was a must among the officer class, tutoring/schooling of the children likely took place in this room. Sometimes a sergeant or corporal, non commissioned officer, would be hired as the tutor. If there were no children this room could be for friends or guests who came to visit.</p>",

        "notes": "Post Commander's Headquarters\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/post-headquarters-1.htm\n\n<p>The commanding officer at Fort Scott coordinated the operation of the military post from the post headquarters in front of you. He was in charge of the health, safety, cleanliness, and security of the post. He routinely dealt with housing issues, property, supplies, and personnel management. He oversaw post discipline; he could arrest other officers and he convened courts-martial in this building. In these offices, he and his adjutant prepared reports and kept records that kept his superiors informed of affairs and assured the smooth functioning of the fort. In addition to the offices and court-martial room, the ordnance storeroom and artillery shed are also attached to this building.</p> <h3>Court Martial Room</h3> <p><br /> Discipline was rigidly enforced at army posts of the Nineteenth Century, and the commandant of Fort Scott saw that infractions of the regulations were severely punished. The enlisted men were at the mercy of the superior officers. Justice was administered by a court-martial convened at the post. A general court-martial, consisted of five to eleven officers, had the power to try capital cases, officers, and to fine more than one month's pay of or imprison a soldier. Regimental court-martials were administered by three officers and were for less severe infractions. Mitigating circumstances that appeared during the trial could not be considered during sentencing but were adequate grounds for recommending mercy. All court-martial proceeding were approved by the commanding officer who could remit sentences if so inclined.</p> <h3>Commandant's Office</h3> <p>Each commandant was responsible for the discipline of his troops and the good state of everything entrusted to his charge. A commander had to see that the rules and regulations were enforced, the supplies of provisions, arms and ammunition were sufficient, and the quarters and defenses in a proper state. He had local maps drawn showing the locations of roads, rivers, hills, etc., which related to the military resources and capabilities of the country, including the defensibility of the area. The commanding officer was responsible for the monthly records of his post. He sent the guard after deserters, convened court-martials, and recommended disability discharge for soldiers unable to perform their duties. When his post was abandoned, it was his duty to see the surplus property was accounted for and turned over to the Quartermaster's Department for a Board of Survey to inspect.</p> <h3>Adjutant's Office</h3> <p>The adjutant was the commanding officer's first deputy and did most of the work requiring his approval and signature. The adjutant supervised the selection of the men for details, wrote the monthly post records and reports concerning court-martials, was the Treasurer and Librarian, and was responsible for the security and good order of the post. He was expected to pass along all orders of his commanding officer without discussion, and he made semi-annual reports of a confidential nature to the War Department, which were counter-signed by the commandant. Perhaps his biggest task was that of keeping the morale of the staff high and things running smoothly at all times.</p> <h3>Ordnance Storeroom</h3> <p>The ordnance storeroom served as a work area and storage facility of military stores for the post ordnance sergeant. By army regulation, the ordnance sergeant was to have served in the military for a minimum of eight years. General character, fidelity, sobriety, qualifications as a clerk, and fitness for duty were required for this selection. He was responsible for two storage areas, the Powder Magazine consisting of kegs of Black Powder and the Ordnance Storehouse consisting of small arms, sabers, bayonets, and ammunition. In addition he was charged with receiving and preserving all ordnance, arms, ammunition, and other military stores at his post. He would make minor repairs of arms and equipment for the troops. The ordnance sergeant spent much of his time applying coats of lacquer to guns, renewing leather, and preventing moths from destroying woolen sponges used in artillery. When a post is closed, the ordnance sergeant remained on duty in charge of the government property until proper disposal of these items could be made.</p> <h3>Gun Shed</h3> <p>Artillery consisting of two 6-pound field cannons, with carriages and equipment, were supplied to Fort Scott and used from 1845 to 1853. The evidence indicates that the cannon barrels were made of iron, and were susceptible to moisture. The gun shed served as a safe storage area to protect these pieces from the weather. Also present in the shed is a mountain howitzer, which was not present at Fort Scott, but would have been used by dragoon soldiers out on western expeditions.</p>",

Sick and wounded soldiers could be treated at the hospital, which was designed with the health and recovery of the patients in mind. However, due to the medical practices of the time, treatment here often impeded recovery, rather than aiding it. On the second floor of this building is a hospital wardroom, furnished as it might have appeared in the 1840s.<br /> <br /> <b>Safety</b><br /> <br /> This building is a two story building that has both an interior and exterior stairway. Stairs are steep so please watch your step and use handrails. Exterior stairs are slippery during inclement weather, are roped off by staff, and should not be used, except in the case of an emergency. Both floors of the building have two exterior doors that are kept unlocked during hours of operation to provide safe exit in case of emergency. On the lower floor visitors should be aware of a slight difference in elevation between the hallway and the visitor center area. Please watch your step.Should you require medical or other assistance during your visit, the visitor center is staffed continuously during hours of operation. The person on duty can assist you with your needs. First aid and lost and found services are available.<br /> <br /> <b>Accessibility</b><br /> <br /> Wheelchair ramps at both doors provide access to the first floor of this building for the mobility impaired. The visitor center desk is designed with an accessible lower portion and an accessible sales counter. The restrooms and drinking fountain in this building are also accessible Two wheelchairs are available at the checkout for those who need them during their visit. The second floor of this building is not accessible for wheelchairs due to the historic nature of the site. Photos of the second floor are available on this app.<br /> <br /> The visitor center also has services for the seeing and hearing impaired. The text of our site's brochure is available in braille. Ask at the visitor center desk if you or someone in your party requires a copy as you tour the site., The site also has assistive listening devices for people attending tours and programs. These are also available at the visitor center desk. Please let us know in advance if you wish to use this service, so we can arrange for the presenter to carry an amplifier.<br /> <br /> <b>ParkÂ Store</b><br /> Inside the visitor center is a park store operated by Western National Parks Association. The store carries several books related to military history, the Civil War, Bleeding Kansas, American Indians, African Americans, and women on the frontier. There are also postcards, T shirts, patches, magnets, pins and several historic \"souvenirs\" (jaw harps, tin cups, Civil War telescope, bonnets, etc.). The store also has a children's book section.</p>",

Hay and grain storage, a blacksmith shop, a carpenter shop, stalls, loafing/storage sheds, and possibly an ice house were located here. The quartermaster quadrangle maintained the supply wagons and the draft animals (generally mules) that pulled the draft wagons, with everything that entailed. For the wagons, there would have been carpenter, wheelwright, and blacksmith functions. The draft animals would have had feed areas, farriers for horseshoeing, and saddle shops.

One side is set up as the quartermaster's office and storeroom. As the name implies, the quartermaster was in charge of providing the army with quarters or buildings in which to live. In the quartermaster storeroom are nails, paint, and other materials used in the construction and maintenance of the buildings, supplies that ultimately provided comfort to the soldiers.<br /> <br /> <br /> The commissary or subsistence officer ran the other side of the building. He used it to store food rations and other supplies vital to the soldiers' survival. Dry goods such as flour and bacon were stored in barrels and boxes, while goods that needed a cooler environment, candles and soap, for example, were stored in the downstairs basement.<br /> <br /> <br /> Strict accountability governed the management of these supplies. Supplies were regularly inventoried. Paperwork accompanied the issuance of these supplies. Even items that were spoiled could not just be thrown out; a board of survey had to declare them unfit for consumption and order their disposal.</p> <h3>Quartermaster Office</h3> <p>The quartermaster, assisted by a sergeant, managed the affairs of his department in this office. All of the paperwork to order supplies was generated here: careful records of inventory were also maintained. Proper forms had to be filled it and quartermasters were held strictly accountable. He conducted all the inventory even down to the last nail. Nothing could be added or removed without his approval. If something went astray, that responsibility fell on to the quartermaster himself.</p> <h3>Issue Room</h3> <p>From the issue room, the army issued rations, uniforms, and tools. Soldiers would check out and return tools daily. Fatigue uniforms were issued once a year; dress uniforms were replace d every 3 years. There was a partition in the wall to separate this room from the commissary room, in order to prevent soldiers from pilfering goods as they came by.</p> <h3>Commissary and Quartermaster Storerooms</h3> <p>The largest rooms in the building were designed for the commissary and quartermaster storerooms. . Normally these rooms were in separate buildings at larger posts, but at Fort Scott, both of these were combined into the same building. Wagons would bring coffee, sugar, salt, molasses, flour, bacon, salted pork/salted beef, whiskey, vinegar, candles, and soap all to be stored in the commissary storeroom. Upon the quartermaster request, whiskey, vinegar, candles and soap were stored in the basement to keep from deteriorating, during summer heat.<br /> <br /> In the quartermaster storeroom, located behind the barrier, the army stored paint, window glass, nails and other supplies used in construction.</p>",

By October 1843 , the quartermaster reported that a 65-foot well had been hand dug \"the whole of it, with the exception of about 5 feet near the surface, having been blasted through successive strata of limestone, slate and coal.\" The well is off centered under the canopy to simplify the drawing of water when soldiers used wagons to haul the water barrels. Neither Swords nor his successors referred to the pillared canopy over the top of the well. They probably avoided mentioning it for fear that the quartermaster general would get \"exercised\" over its elaborate use of materials at a time when supplies were scarce and budgets low. The first reference to the octagonal canopy was a suggestion of its existence in the 1848 plan of the fort, wherein the well was described as being completed. The canopy consists of 8 white columns and a low domed roof that architecturally complemented the magazine on the opposite side of parade. The well canopy is an example of classical Greek architecture. Post Sutler H.T. Wilson purchased the canopy and columns for $28.00 at public auction on April 16, 1855. In 1870 the local paper reported that this well was the deepest in town.</p>",

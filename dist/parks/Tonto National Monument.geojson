I found many metates, three of which were perfect.  The manos are small, so as to work in the groove.  Many of the roofs are perfect. They are of vigas, above them are either splinters or rounds ticks of ocotillo, above it reeds, and then two-and-a-half inches of mud.  The floors, as far as visible, are black.  There is some pottery about, handsomely painted... I found an old sandal, much fragmentary basketwork, rope, twine, and many corn cobs. They are of the small variety, and I found one small piece of obsidian.... The position of the pueblo is admirable for security and observation...\"<br /> -Adolph Bandelier, May 1883 <br /> <br /> How has the Lower Cliff Dwelling changed through time?  <br /> <br /> <em>(Image taken in 1903 of tourists standing in front of the Lower Cliff Dwelling.)</em></p>",

Theodore Roosevelt Dam was constructed at the confluence of the Salt River and Tonto Creek creating a reservoir that controls flooding and stores water for Arizona residents to this day.</p> <h4>The Apache Trail</h4> <p>The Apache Trail was originally constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation to bring materials from Mesa, AZ to the Roosevelt Dam construction site. Beginning in 1916, the Southern Pacific Railroad marketed the Apache Trail as a tourist automobile trip. Visitors were driven from Globe, AZ to Apache Junction, AZ on the Apache Trail. During the overnight trip, visitors explored the Tonto Cliff Dwellings.</p> <h4>A Monument Created</h4> <p>On December 19, 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt signed Proclamation 787, creating Tonto National Monument. Tonto was the ninth national monument designated under the Antiquities Act. \"WHEREAS, two prehistoric ruins of ancient cliff dwellings situated upon public lands of the United States...are of great ethnological, scientific, and educational interest and it appears that the public interests would be promoted by reserving these relics of a vanished people as a National Monument...\" (Presidential Proclamation 787)</p> <h4>Theodore Roosevelt</h4> <p><em>(Image of Theodore Roosevelt.</em>)<br /> <br /> By the time Theodore Roosevelt left office in 1909, he had created 55 national bird sanctuaries and wildlife refuges, 150 national forests, 18 national monuments, and 5 national parks.<br /> In all, he protected approximately 230,000,000 acres of public land.

Despite its dry appearance, the Tonto Basin has many sources of water, including perennial springs and rivers. The Salado collected water from nearby sources and carried it to the community in pots, called ollas, for drinking, cooking, cliff dwelling construction, and pottery making.  Salado farmers also constructed irrigation canals along the Salt River to bring this valuable resource to their crops.<br /> <br /> <em>(Image of illustrated diagram depicting evapotranspiration.

Throughout the Cenozoic Era, plate tectonics pushed the layers upward and then pulled them apart to form mountains and basins. Weather eroded the formation and created alcoves, which provide shelter from the sun and rain.<br /> <br /> Pieces of the alcove ceiling collapsed, which formed the floor of the cliff dwelling. Caliche, or redeposited calcium carbonate, cemented these fallen rocks together. The dwelling walls were built from blocks of fallen rock, held together by caliche-rich mud.<br /> <br /> <em>(Image of hillside depicting soil, rock, and mineral layers.

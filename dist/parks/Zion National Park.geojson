You may not immediately think of the American beaver when in the Southwest, but the Virgin River provides a welcome habitat for this river specialist.

Erosion and weathering also play a role forming natural arches in the park. A natural arch is formed when deep cracks penetrate into a layer of sandstone. Erosion wears away the exposed rock layers and surface cracks expand, isolating narrow sandstone walls, called \"fins\". Water, frost, and the release of tensions in the rock cause crumbling and flaking of the porous sandstone, eventually cutting through some of these fins. The resulting holes become enlarged to arch proportions by rockfalls and weathering.<br /> Architecturally, arches are the most stable load bearing structure, but through weathering, eventually all arches collapse, leaving only buttresses that will inevitably give way to the unyielding forces of erosion. </p> <h3>Look</h3> <p>Among the arches in Zion, one of the most visible is the Crawford Arch. It can be seen from the Pa’rus Trail on Bridge Mountain, a thousand feet above the canyon floor. Bridge Mountain is located on the east side of the canyon and is one of the tallest peaks along the trail. Once you locate the peak, follow the left edge down to where it intersects with the other peak. From the intersection follow the small line of trees to the right. Can you spot the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/nature/arches.htm\">Crawford Arch?</a> </p> <h3>Connect</h3> <p>Have you wondered why Utah and the Colorado Plateau have so many natural arches? Sandstone throughout the region meets the favorable conditions for large natural arches to form. The rock is strong enough to support the weight of the arch but soft enough to be easily eroded by wind, water, and gravity.  </p>",

The lodge has a variety of accommodations and is the only place inside Zion to eat; either in the main dining room (Red Rock Grill) or at the Castle Dome Café (open seasonally). For more information about eating, visiting, or staying at the Zion Lodge, please visit their website at <a href=\"http://www.zionlodge.com/\">www.zionlodge.com</a> or call 435 772-7700.</p> <h4>Zion Lodge History</h4> <p><br /> In the early days of the National Park Service, railroad companies were often the catalyst for the creation or improvement of park accommodations. For Zion, that railroad was the Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad. With the completion of a railroad spur line to nearby Cedar City in 1923, visitors now had an easy and comfortable way to get to Zion. The next step was to provide lodging that complimented the world-class scenery.<br /> <br /> While initial designs of the lodge called for enormity and immensity, park officials ultimately determined that a lodge in the narrow canyon should better harmonize with the landscape and scale of the surroundings. Gilbert Stanley Underwood – a frequent architect of numerous national park lodges – was up to the challenge. Using 265,000 board feet of lumber brought down from the plateau by the Cable Mountain Draw Works, the Utah Parks Company designed a main lodge building that was inviting and exuded warmth. The Zion Lodge was completed in May of 1925, and was later complimented with a series of stand-alone cabins nestled nearby. These improvements signaled an important milestone in a visit to Zion National Park.<br /> <br /> The main lodge building stood for over 40 years until it was consumed by a fire on January 26, 1966. A mere 108 days after the fire, a new prefabricated building was up and operating. This quick turn-around speaks volumes about the significance that the Zion Lodge had garnered in the story of Zion National Park.<br /> <br /> Whether you're looking for a shady respite from the heat or hoping to dine among a majestic backdrop, the Zion Lodge is a beautiful place to stop. Visitors can even attend <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/ranger-led-activities.htm\">ranger-led activities</a> at the lodge, a service that started back in 1935. For many, the Zion Lodge has become a hallmark of a visit to the area, and occupies an important place in the history of Zion National Park.</p> <h4>Trails accessed from here:</h4> <ul> <li> <p>The Grotto Trail</p> </li> <li>Sand Bench Trail</li> <li>Emerald Pools Trails: Upper, Middle, and Lower Emerald Pools can all be accessed via the trailhead across the road from the Lodge</li> </ul> <h4>Shuttle Service</h4> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/zion-canyon-shuttle-system.htm\">Zion Canyon Shuttle Bus</a> is running, the Zion Lodge is shuttle stop #5 at the end of the canyon. </p>",

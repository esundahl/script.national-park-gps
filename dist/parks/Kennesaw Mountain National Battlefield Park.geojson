        "notes": "63rd Georgia Picket Line\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/63rd-georgia-picket-line.htm\n\nIn this approximate location, running North to South, was the Confederate picket line held by the 63<sup>rd</sup> GA regiment. A picket line is a forward defensive position, usually made up of several shallow depressions or ‘rifle pits’. The men in these positions were the first to be engaged in the frontal assault on Pigeon Hill. Just a few weeks prior, the 63<sup>rd</sup> GA troops had been on the relatively quiet assignment of garrison duty in Savannah, GA. Many of them were very inexperienced in the hard marching and fierce fighting that would make up much of the Atlanta Campaign. A few hundred of these green troops would attempt to defend these positions.Under Brigadier General Joseph Lightburn, 7 regiments of battle hardened Union troops made the first push here at around 8:00 am. The untested and outnumbered GA troops waited too late to fire their first volley and quickly became overrun. In their haste to retreat, they collided with another regiment trying to reinforce the position. Private Celathiel Helms describes this chaotic moment and the officer that ordered the reinforcements: “This loss wold not have been verey mutch if it had not been for the [Major]. He made them charge on the yankys and the yankys had ten men to thir one. I recon the [Major] wanted to git his wants but I think it will com [contrary] to his [expectations] or at leas the [privates] will not think any the more of him for his bravery and not so mutch the bravery as the fool”.Shortly after the Confederates had been pushed back from this spot, the Union soldiers came under heavy artillery fire from Pigeon Hill ahead. Major Thomas T. Taylor, of the 47<sup>th</sup> Ohio said that they “faced the sheeted flame filled with missiles, giving forth ten thousand shrieks and tones, intensified by the cries of agony and the torture of the wounded..”. The new Union position was extremely exposed in an open field with little to no cover. Despite pushing past the Confederate picket line, Union soldiers here were forced to seek shelter and wait for nightfall before they fell back to their main line.",

A veteran collection of seven regiments, the 1<sup>st</sup> MO Brigade had fought since the beginning of the war at battles like Corinth and Vicksburg. They were responsible for holding the position on these rocky slopes against the furious Union assaults. On the offense was Brigadier General Giles Smiths’ brigade. The terrain and defensive works of the Confederates proved to be extremely effective in holding them off. While a few Union soldiers managed to make it to the works themselves, they were quickly killed or wounded. In recounting the Confederate response to the assault, Private James Bradley of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Consolidated MO regiment writes “Suddenly as if the mountain had burst wide open from crest to base along the ridge, and poured forth all the pent-up fire of buried ages, a blaze shot out of the whole length of the Confederate line… The enemy did not reel or stagger, they were literally swept down the mountain side”. James A. Kennerly of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Consolidated MO regiment wrote “We mowed them down like hay, killing one colonel, on major, and.. several other officers.”  If you look at the wayside sign here, you may notice that the rock in the phot is just a few yards ahead of you.

He was generally well liked and respected by his men, who referred to him as ‘Colonel Dan’. Colonel Dan would be at the forefront of the assault with men from his old regiment, the 52<sup>nd</sup> Ohio infantry. In the minutes before the fateful action, Colonel Dan would recite a section from Thomas Macaulay’s 1842 poem ‘Horatius’ to his men. “Then out spake brave Horatius, the captain of the gate: To every man upon this earth, death cometh soon or late. And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, for the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods”. This brigade would suffer heavy casualties during the fighting that would follow. ",

Thought to have been made up mostly of 12 pound Napoleon cannons, this battery would have had an effective range of up to one mile. Notice the position behind and above the trenches meant for the infantry. This would allow the artillery to shoot over the heads of the soldiers defending the slope at their front. During the Confederate occupation of the Kennesaw Line, Lumsden’s Battery would actually move to this position from the peak of Kennesaw Mountain before the battle. Robert Maxwell, a gunner in this battery, describes a hellish scene from near this spot: “ Fire! All four guns belched at once… Within five minutes, the enemy’s batteries opened on us with all the guns that could be brought to bear on us. Passing over, striking the front of the works, striking the ground in our front, and ricocheting over us, knocking down our embrasures, bursting right above the top of our works.” During this barrage, one of Maxwells’ cannoneers would be decapitated by a Union artillery shell. The shell traveled through the soldier and into the ammunition chest behind the cannon, causing a large explosion. This chaotic scene is thought to be the inspiration for the painting “Thunder On Little Kennesaw” by Don Troiani. The young man who was killed during this engagement was a soldier from Georgia named ‘Gurley’. Maxwell describes him as “a country boy who never under any circumstances showed any excitement” and who “was just as cool and calm as at any other time” in the moments before his death.",

Major General Benjamin Cheatham (for whom this location is named) planned his defense very strategically. As early as June 24th, Cheatham would order the batteries \"to be closely masked with brush and under no circumstances to reply to the artillery of the enemy'. This strategy would be effective in essentially keeping the Federals in the dark as to where the Confederate artillery was and what kind of artillery they had. As a result, when the thickly amassed column of Union infantry approached during the battle on the 27th, they made it to within 60 yards of this position without knowing any cannons were there at all. Cheatham writes \"The advance was nearly all swept down by the first volley, the remainder being driven in confusion into the ranks of the assaulting mass\". Also, this and the batteries on the right and left of it created a deadly crossfire for the upcoming infantry, creating chaos. This 2 gun section was commanded by John W. Mebane, under Liutenant J. W. Phillips. The guns in this section were most likely 12 pound Napoleans, just like the ones that sit here today. ",

While there were not as many casualties here as there were at Cheatham Hill, the assault was still especially difficult. This was largely due to the steep and rocky terrain. The Confederates held the high ground, using the natural defenses to their advantage. It had been raining for nearly 3 weeks prior to the battle, so the Union forces also had the marshy, muddy ground at the foot of the hill to contend with. A portion of the force became lost and began climbing up the draw between Pigeon Hill and Little Kennesaw, right into the face of the cannon positioned there. The only Union victory happened at the foot of the hill, when they drove 7 companies of green Confederate troops from the 63<sup>rd</sup> GA out of their rifle pits during a frenzy of hand- to- hand fighting. This soon turned to disaster, however, as they tried to clamber up the hill itself. The US Army monument (in the open field) was erected to commemorate this small victory. The battered Union troops waited until nightfall and then slipped back to their camps, defeated.<br /> <br /> Pigeon Hill can most easily be accessed by parking in the Burnt Hickory Parking Lot and hiking north across the road.

Most wartime military reports simply refer to it as the Kennesaw Spur. By 1860 the New Salem community, with its several small farms, Baptist church, saw mill and small school house, stood along the Burnt Hickory Road at the base of Pigeon Hill. The Hardage, York, Wallis, and Kirk families lived, worked, studied and worshipped in this peaceful and thriving agrarian neighborhood. They grew wheat, maize, sweet potatoes, cotton, peas, beans and oats. Generally the livestock consisted of oxen to pull the wagon or plow, a milking cow, some hens to lay eggs, a sheep or two for wool and a few hogs. Most of the families had 40 to 80 acres of land cleared to farm. Wood-frame houses or log cabins provided shelter for the family while various out buildings stood conveniently near within the farm itself. Rough-hewn worm-rail fences snaked around the fields, preventing free-ranging animals from invading crops. Farm life was difficult. The constant labor was physically and mentally exhausting. Sunday, a day for attending services at New Salem Baptist Church, socializing, and resting, offered hard-working families a welcome respite from farm chores. In the summer of 1864 this peaceful way of life was disrupted by the arrival of the two competing armies. The crest and western slope of Pigeon Hill were occupied by Confederate forces under the overall command of General Joseph E. Johnston. Arrayed against the Confederates were elements of the Union army commanded by Major General William T. Sherman. On June 27<sup>th</sup>, 1864, roughly 4,500 Union soldiers would attack the area that you are about to visit.",

        "notes": "The Assault\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-assault.htm\n\nThe attack on the Confederate position was designed to be a heavy frontal assault. Two brigades were to charge up this very hill in order to break through the earthworks at the top. The obstacles for the Union soldiers were immense. The earthworks at the crest stood up to 8 feet tall and were topped with head logs that protected the Rebels behind them. In addition to that, the Confederates had placed a series of formidable field fortifications directly in the Union path. Colonel Alan Fahnestock of the 86<sup>th</sup> Illinois infantry describes the scene: “They had logs with sharp sticks through the log like hay racks (called Chevalle de Frise), the ends bound together with wire”. These defenses, along with cleverly hidden Confederate artillery, causes the Union assault to falter, and then to stop completely. The fighting at the crest of the hill just ahead became some of the bloodiest and violent of the entire battle. Confederate soldier Sam Watkins of the 1<sup>st</sup> Tennessee Infantry writes “Yet still the Yankees came. It seemed impossible to check the onslaught… a solid line of blazing fire right from the muzzles of the Yankee guns being poured right into our very faces, singeing our hair and clothes, the hot blood of our dead and wounded spurting on us, the blinding smoke and stifling atmosphere filling our eyes and mouths, and the awful concussion causing the blood to gush out of our noses and ears, and above all, the roar of battle, made it perfect pandemonium… Hell had broke loose in Georgia sure enough.”",

The name comes from not only the bloodshed, but also the 'dead space' offered by the angle, meaniing that anyone in this postiion would not be visible to those in the earthworks above. Still visible today, this bulge or 'salient' in the Confederate defenses was where roughly 8 regiments (over 1,000) of Union soldiers concentrated their attack. Making it past the various field fortifications, the Federals make it to the top of the 8 foot tall earthen works and the fighting dissolves into hand to hand combat, with men using their muskets as clubs. Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee Infantry writes \"My pen is unable to describe the scene of carnage and death that ensued in the next two hours...talk about other battles, victories, shouts, cheers, and triumphs, but in comparison with this day's fight, all other dwarf into insignificance.\"<br /> <br /> Despite the 'carnage', the Confederate line held. Lieutenant Thomas Maney of the 1st Tennessee writes 'the word passed down to us to hold the works at all hazards, and it did look as if we would be pushed back by sheer force. But stand we must, and stand we did.\" The Union soldiers attacking both sides of the angle would fall back, but the ones assaulting the angle itself would dig in directly below the works, taking advantage of the 'dead space'.

Nixon Stewart, a soldier in the 52<sup>nd</sup> Ohio fighting alongside McCook would witness this scene. He writes “Our brave Colonel urging his men on, was struck as he said ‘Come on boys, the day is won,’ as he reached the earthwork. He was shot about 4 inches below the collar bone, in the right breast, falling outside of the fortifications.” McCook was believed to have been wounded in close vicinity to this location.

Howard said of Harker “The only complaint I ever heard was that if Harker got started against the enemy, he could not be kept back… Whenever anything difficult was to be done, anything that required pluck and energy, we called on Gen. Harker.” Harker’s 3<sup>rd</sup> brigade of seven regiments was ordered to charge this section of the Confederate works. In the early morning hours of the 27<sup>th</sup>, Harker was seen sealing and finishing up several letters home. In what was noted as potentially an eerie premonition, Harker gave a member of his staff his personal papers and said “I shall not come out of the charge today alive”. A few hours later, while at the front of the charge and urging his men forward, a bullet tears through his arm and enters his chest. He would fall near this spot. A private from Illinois would later write “Several of the men nearest him spang up to carry him off the field; of these some were struck down at once, but others filled their places.” A surgeon would declare his wound fatal and Gen.

Coffey of the 22<sup>nd</sup> Indiana was one of the many NCO’s and officers lost in the fateful charge against the Confederate works. The young soldier fell near this location during the battle. One of his comrades, Lieutenant Randalph Marshall would take on the difficult duty of notifying Sgt. Coffey’s mother with a letter written after the battle. He writes: “I felt it a duty for some weeks to write you indeed I should have done so soon after the death of your son, but the task seemed one of so delicate a character, that I have deferred it till now… That he fell like a brave solider, gallantly fighting in defense of his country, and for the most sacred rights of man, needs no assurance from me. The united testimony from his commander as to his courage, consistency, and patriotic devotion to his country is in conclusion evidence of the esteem in which he was held by them. …Copernicus was my messmate in many campaign, he and myself have messed and slept together and especially on this last one he and I shared the same tent and bed. On the morning of the 27<sup>th</sup> of June, we rose from our bed beneath our shelter tent and after breakfasting filled our knapsacks and started to the fatal charge. …He fell gloriously on the field. I miss him much and shall ever cherish his memory as a faithful and true friend. I know the pang of your sorrow and distress felt by his mother, whom he loved and revered.”",

Perhaps even more tragic is the presence of the unknown dead in those ranks. Honored and interred here is an unknown soldier from the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. While many of the other soldiers who perished here were reinterred in soldier's cemetaries, this young man's remains were missed. They were discovered in the trenches near this location in early 1934 by the Work's Progress Administration (WPA) as part of a trail building project. His remains were moved to this current location in order to be closer to the trail. A ceremony was held to honor his service and memory on July 1st, 1934 and his casket was lowered into the grave draped in both a U.S and Confederate flag. His grave sits directly in between in what was both the Union and Confederate lines.<br /> <br /> From an exerpt reflecting on the 'Unknown' by Walt Whitman: \"And everywhere among these countless graves - everywhere in the many Soldiers Cemeteries of the Nation ... - as at the time in the vast trenches, the depositories of slain, Northern and Southern, after the great battles - not only where the scathing trail pass'd those years, but radiating since in all the peaceful quarters of the land - we see, and see, and ages yet may see, on monuments and gravestones, singly or in massess, to thousands or tens of thousands, the significant word.. UNKNOWN.\" <br /> <br />  ",

There were roughly 8 regiments that fought in this general area. This particular part of the Confederate defensive line was particularly well fortified and extremely difficult for the Union to penetrate. Private W.T. Barnes of the 1st Arkansas Infantry regiment writes \"We had cut down and placed in our front hundreds of black jack saplings as abattis, cutting off the tips of the limbs with our jackknives and whittling them so shapr and close it would have been an uphill business for a rabbit to creep through\" ",

One notable example happened near this spot during the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. W.T. Barnes of the 1st Arkansas describes the scene: \" .. our cannon were placed for execution. Their redoubts so low, the cannon's mouth nearly on the ground, and at every discharge a blaze of fire sprang out among the dry leaves, which were soon ablaze and eating their way toward the gully, which was full of a mass of human beings, squirming around... Ah, but little can a peaceful citizen imagine the horror of war...At this stage our colonel, Will H. Martin, sang out, \"'Boys, this is butchery,\"' and, mounting our head logs, with a white hankerchief, he sang out to the Yanks as well as to our own men, \"'Cease firing and help get out those men.\"' Col. Martin's actions would save the lives of many Union soldiers in that incident. In a show of respect for this act of humanity, one of the Union officers would present Col. Martin with a pair of pearl-handled Colt revolvers. ",

Thomas, Commander of the Army of the Cumberland. Thomas's army was the largest of Sherman's three, standing just over 60,000 strong. This headquartered position was a veritable 'tent city' in the days surrounding the battle. Prior to the battle, Sherman issues 'Special Field Orders No. 28'. In it, he states that 'Maj. Gen. Thomas will assault the enemy at any point near his center, to be selected by himself...\" <br /> After doing reconnaissance with Maj. Gen. Thomas, Captain Henry Stone writes that what is today known as Cheatham Hill was finally selected 'more because the lines were nearer each other than beacause the enemy's lines seemed vulnerable' They were roughly 600 yards away from the Confederate line here. The attack would begin at roughly 9:00 am and would be the largest Union assault of the day. ",

Jefferson C. Davis’ 3<sup>rd</sup> Division would lead that charge. Mitchell and McCook’s Brigades would attack from the right and left, while Morgan’s Brigade would hold in reserve in the trench that you see before you. The moments before the actual attack were tense ones, spent in trenches like this one. A war correspondent from the Cincinnati Daily Commercial writes that ‘The minutes passed in muted apprehension. There was no evidence in the movement or bearing of the men that they were so soon to essay ‘the deadly imminent breach’ though they must have been conscious that the task laid out for them was on which none but men hoping to meet death would covet…. no one could have guessed from their undisturbed faces, that all the latent gallantry of their natures could be aroused, and lashed into a fury of heroism during the next ten minutes.” At roughly half past 8 am, the signal gun would sound, and the assault would begin.",

Walcutt’s Brigade. They would assault the northern slope of Pigeon Hill and the gorge between it and Little Kennesaw (visible to the northwest from this location). Walcutt’s assault would fare no better than Smith’s further south. With the 46th Ohio leading the way as skirmishers, the brigade advanced in two lines of two regiments each. Shot and shell from the heights in their front rained down on the troops as they crossed an open field. Confederate rifle pits 200 yards in front of Little Kennnesaw, manned by soldiers in the 46th Mississippi Regiment, suffered heavy casualties as oncoming men in blue easily overran their position. But Walcutt’s line would meet no more success that day. As John T. Hunt of the 40th Illinois wrote, “[N]earing the base of the mountain, we met a terrible withering fire. …[W]e found it would be a moral impossibility to scale it in the face of an active, vigilant and relentless foe. Some…tried the ascent, and left their lifeless remains as testimonials to futility.” On the crest of Little Kennesaw, Sears helped stem Federal penetration of the gorge by directing his men to fire downward on the men in blue. Now caught in crossfire between the brigades of Sears and Cockrell, Walcutt’s troops were compelled to en-trench and hunker down until nightfall covered their withdrawal. The rest of the Union force assaulting Pigeon Hill would follow suit, thus ending the fighting in this area.",

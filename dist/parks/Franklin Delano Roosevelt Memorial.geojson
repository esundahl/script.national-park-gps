Visitors will discover that Room Two is divided into two halves by a wall. There are two sculptures straight ahead on the wall in the first half. “Appalachian Couple” and “The Breadline”, both created by sculptor George Segal, clearly depict the troubling times faced by both urban and rural communities during the Depression and the Dust Bowl. To the right of both those works is a third sculpture, also by George Segal. “Fireside Chat”, set in an alcove, shows how FDR often communicated to the American people.

Most Americans had never heard a president's voice before FDR began his radio broadcasts. His confident and plain-spoken \"fireside chats\" reassured Americans even as many New Deal programs failed, and the Great Depression dragged on. FDR easily won reelection to a second term in 1936. <br /> <br /> Roosevelt's administrations created over 75 new programs to fight the Great Depression.

        "notes": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/franklin-delano-roosevelt-memorial.htm\n\n<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4> <p>A revolutionary presidential memorial that opened in 1997, the FDR Memorial was not a monolithic, white marble structure, but a flowing landscape architecture design. The memorial is designed as a timeline best experienced by starting at the northernmost end of the memorial. Bronze sculptures by several artists depict the longest-serving president and the major issues he dealt with during his presidency including the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II.<br /> <br /> This entry is an overview of the entire memorial with specific attention to the \"Prologue\" room. For more specific information about each \"room\" in the memorial, see the following records:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-1st-term.htm\">FDR 1st Term</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-2nd-term.htm\">FDR 2nd Term</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-3rd-term.htm\">FDR 3rd Term</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-4th-term.htm\">FDR 4th Term</a></li> </ul> <h4>About the memorial</h4> <p>The national memorial dedicated to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States, lies about half way between the Lincoln Memorial and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington, DC. Its four open-air rooms represent each of the four terms of office to which he was elected. A meandering pathway leads past waterfalls, bronze sculptures, and FDR’s own powerful words carved on the granite walls. The memorial honors the memory of one of America’s great leaders and the optimism and courage that he shared with his fellow citizens through the ordeals of the Great Depression and World War II. A statue of Roosevelt sitting in a wheelchair greets visitors and reminds them of the man who refused to let disability stop him. <br /> <br /> When Congress established the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission in 1955, there was already a modest memorial to Roosevelt in Washington, DC. Roosevelt told his friend Felix Frankfurter what he wanted: “a block about the size of [this desk] . . . in the center of that green plot in front of the Archives Building.” The new, larger memorial took over 40 years of planning before its dedication on May 2, 1997.<br />  <br /> The FDR Memorial Commission selected landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to design the memorial in 1974. The result, with its shade trees, waterfalls, and quiet alcoves, feels more like a secluded garden than a traditional memorial. Walls of red South Dakota granite define the memorial’s outdoor rooms and the passageways connecting them. Waterfalls, quiet pools of water, and Roosevelt’s own words, beautifully incised into the granite walls by master carver John Benson, create a mood of quiet reflection.<br />  <br /> Each room conveys in its own way the spirit of the man. In Room One, a bronze bas-relief of the first inauguration, one of the early public sculptures created by Robert Graham, introduces the first years of Roosevelt’s presidency, when he launched the New Deal in response to the worst economic crisis the nation had ever known. George Segal created the powerful sculptures in Room Two. The Breadline represents the despair of the Great Depression. The Fireside Chat depicts the hope that Roosevelt’s inspiring words gave to ordinary people.<br />  <br /> In Room Three of the memorial, a waterfall crashes over scattered boulders, suggesting the destruction and violence of World War II, which dominated Roosevelt’s third term in office. Neil Estern created the statues of Roosevelt and his beloved dog, Fala, calmly presiding over the chaos surrounding them. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s hopes for the future are engraved on the wall next to his statue:<br />  <br /> <em>\"We have faith that future generations will know that here, in the middle of the twentieth century, there came a time when men of good will found a way to unite, and produce, and fight to destroy the forces of ignorance, and intolerance, and slavery, and war.\"</em><br />  <br /> The centerpiece of Room Four is a monumental bas-relief created by sculptor Leonard Baskin. The Funeral Cortege represents the nation in mourning after the death of the only president many of them could remember. Neil Estern’s statue of Eleanor Roosevelt honors her contributions as first lady and as one of the early delegates representing the United States at the newly formed United Nations.<br />  <br /> One of the things visitors to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial see is a simple, but powerful, statue of FDR sitting in the kind of wheelchair he used after the polio attack that paralyzed his legs in 1921. Halprin carefully designed the FDR Memorial to be accessible for people with all kinds of disabilities, but the original plans did not include this sculpture. Spokespersons for the disabled protested, arguing that showing the truth of FDR’s paralysis, something that he himself rarely allowed, would increase awareness and set an inspiring example for others who struggled with disability. Congress agreed. Robert Graham created the present statue, dedicated in January 2001.<br /> <br /> <strong>Landscape Architect: </strong>Lawrence Halprin</p> <h4>Inscriptions - \"Prologue\" section of memorial</h4> <p>Outer wall, front<br /> Franklin Delano Roosevelt<br /> President of the United States<br /> 1933 - 1945<br /> Outer wall, back<br /> Men and Nature Must Work Hand in Hand.

Disability rights advocates, including the National Organization on Disability, successfully lobbied President Bill Clinton and Congress to add this explicit portrayal in 2001. The new statue depicted FDR as his family and close associates saw him. Why do you think the original designers left out a statue like this one? </p> <h3>A Carefully Crafted Image</h3> <p>The original 1997 memorial barely hinted at Franklin Roosevelt's paralyzed legs- much as FDR had during his Presidency. Roosevelt's battle with polio was not a secret. The president worried that if people knew he was unable to walk, his opponents could portray him as too weak for office. Years before live video, the press agreed not to report on FDR using a wheelchair or aides carrying the president. <br /> <br /> \"Franklin's illness... gave him strength and courage he had not had before. He had to think out the fundamentals of living and learn the greatest of all lessons- infinite patience and never ending persistence.\" - Eleanor Roosevelt (Below the quote is the quote in braille symbols, but at a size too large to be read by those who can read braille.)<br /> <br /> These hand sketches (right) appear on the back of the FDR statue in the Prologue. FDR believed a standard 1920s wheelchair was too bulky, so he designed his own. He oversaw the construction of his wheelchair, created by adding wheels to a kitchen chair. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inscriptions:</strong></p> <p>Arriving at the west end of the Franklin Delano Memorial from West Basin Drive, one enters the paved entrance plaza. Zelcova trees shade the plaza. Straight ahead is a wall of large stone blocks stacked four rows high.

Under Roosevelt's urging, representatives from 26 countries signed a \"Declaration by United Nations\" in 1942. After FDR died, Eleanor Roosevelt served as a delegate to the UN. She chaired the commission that adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. <br /> <br /> FDR (seated, second from the left) signed the \"Declaration by United Nations\" in Washington on January 1, 1942. The countries agreed to \"defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands.\"  <h3>Room Four Fountain</h3> The United States created a diplomatic framework to prevent another world war. The fear of nuclear war between former allies and nuclear powers the United States and the Soviet Union maintained a Cold War peace. The unorderly blocks in this fountain represent this uneasy stability. The two adversaries remained at odds throughout the second half of the 20th century. <h3>Memorial Quotes in Room Four</h3> <em>\"The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.

They also see the five columns that they may deduct tie in somehow with the five panels of the mural. “Social Programs” was created by Robert Graham. Confusing to most visitors are the squares depicting people involved in some kind of activity, the human body parts coming out from the bronze panels, the acronyms, the Braille symbols. The key to unlocking the mystery starts when they discover the list of New Deal programs on the bottom right corner of the left panel and realize that the figures on the columns are reverse of the ones on the mural panels and represent the idea of rolling out programs to create a positive effect on the economy.<br /> <br /> <strong>Inscriptions:</strong><br /> <em>“I Propose To Create A Civilian Conservation Corps To Be Used In Simple Work … More Important, However, Than The Material Gains Will Be The Moral And Spiritual Value Of Such Work.”<br /> <br /> “We Must Scrupulously Guard The Civil Rights And Civil Liberties Of All Our Citizens, Whatever Their Background. We Must Remember That Any Oppression, Any Injustice, Any Hatred, Is A Wedge Designed To Attack Our Civilization.”</em>",

There sits a larger than life statue of FDR wearing a cloak, portrayed in one of his favorite chairs at Hyde Park, New York. Hidden from view are the wheels on the chair located on the back. The wheels are there, if one looks. Just as FDR hid his disability due to polio, Halprin wanted to make sure the disability was hidden from visitors to the memorial. Accessibility advocates had lobbied during the design process for the statue of FDR statue to be shown in a wheelchair. Halprin, however, was a big fan of FDR and thus wanted to hold true to what FDR did during his presidency, hiding his disability. Accessibility groups continued to lobby even after the memorial was dedicated and won approval for a second statue of FDR, which is located in the Prologue Room. Next to the statue of FDR in Room Three is a statue of his dog, Fala, a Scottish terrier. Both bronze statues were sculpted by Neil Estern.</p> <h3>Wartime President</h3> <p>FDR said the US must be a \"great aresal for democracy.\" His administration sent military supplies to allies like Great Britain. After entering World War II, FDR and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill formed a close alliance. America, Great Britain, Canada, France, Australiam and other democracies often fought side by side. Join by the Soviet Union during the war, the Allies defeated the Axis powers.<br /> <br /> FDR joined British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (left) and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin (right) at the second \"Big Three\" conference in Yalta. The Allied leaders planned the post-war occupation of Germany, political borders of Eastern Europe, and the United Nations. </p> <h3>Memorial Quotes in Room Three</h3> <p><em>“They (Who) Seek To Establish Systems Of Government Based On The Regimentation Of All Human Beings By A Handful Of Individual Rulers … Call This A New Order.

With victory in sight, FDR made a final trip to Eastern Europe and the Middle East. At Yalta, he negotiated post-war agreements with the Soviet Union and Great Britain. On his return, Roosevelt addressed Congress seated, saying, \"it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs.\" He died months before the end of World War II. <br /> <br /> This bas relief (right) by sculptor Leonard Baskin represents a grieving nation. Baskin placed a riderless, blanket-draped horse honoring the fallen commander at the head of the procession. Mourners with heads bowed walk behind the casket. <br /> <br /> FDR died on April 12, 1945. New President Harry truman told reporters he felt as though \"the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.\" A horse-drawn caisson transported Roosevelt's body through Washington, D.C., from Union Station to the White House.  <h3>Memorial Quotes in Room Four</h3> <em>\"More than an end to war, we want an end to the beginnings of all wars.\"</em> Undelivered Address, Prepared for April 13, 1945<br /> <br /> <em>\"Unless the peace that follows recognizes that the whole world is one neighborhood and does justice to the whole human race, the germs of another world war will remain as a constant threat to mankind.\"</em> Radio Address, February 12, 1943",

FDR campaigned on keeping the US out of the war while secretly providing weapons and ships to democratic Great Britain without Congress knowing. These resources helped Great Britain fight authoritarian German and Japanese forces. With conflict raging off both coasts, voters reelected President Roosevelt to an unprecedented third term. Within a year, a Japanese attack on a Hawaiian naval base compelled the US to enter the war. <br /> <br /> FDR realized the US military was too small and outdated to fight a modern war. He authorized the first peacetime draft and the construction of new ships, aircraft, and other material. After the Japanese bombed the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war in December 1941. <h3>Memorial Quotes in Room Three</h3> \"We must be the great arsenal of democracy.\" Radio Address, December 29, 1940.<br /> <br /> \"I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded... I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed... I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war.\" Address at Chautauqua, New York, August 14, 1936.  <h3>Tumbled Blocks</h3> By 1940 military conflict raged from China and Australia to Africa and Europe. Projecting his desire to stay out of the war, FDR declared, \"I have seen war.... I hate war.\" These tumbled blocks represent the breakdown of international order. FDR's words did not prevent the US joining the fighting. <br />  ",

        "notes": "Ninety Six Star Fort Pond\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/ninety-six-star-fort-pond.htm\n\n<p>Built in the 1950s by the Greenwood Mill Company, the Star Fort Pond provides the community with opportunities for fishing, hiking, and bird watching. Located on the backside of the park off Highway 246 on Kinard Road the pond can be a amazing place to enjoy nature. <br /> <br /> Hiking can be done year round. The Fisherman's Trail travels around the park, providing access to the lake at several points. While traveling this trail be wary of stinging and biting insects and snakes.<br /> <br /> The Star Fort Pond is home to many species of birds, especially aquatic birds. While many of these birds, such as great blue herons, are year round residents other, such as the ruddy duck, are seasonal. <br /> <br /> The fishing season at the Star Fort Pond is limited from April through October. Visitors may cast a line on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Fishing can be done from the bank, the fishing pier, or from a boat. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nisi/planyourvisit/fishing.htm\">fishing page</a> to learn more about the rules and regulations. </p>",

Their duties included mending and washing men's clothes, as well as making their own soap and maintaining their equipment.<br /> <br /> The remains of the original, adobe hospital used until 1871 and the hospital steward’s quarters are now covered by the dike in front of the tour sign post.<br />  </p>",

They were divided in half and each side had a squad room, first sergeant's room, mess hall and kitchen. The average company size was 80 men, so quarters were definitely cramped. Four men slept on each bunk, two on each level lying head to foot. The first sergeant, the company's senior enlisted man, got a room to himself. <br /> <br /> There was no central mess hall on post for the soldiers. Soldiers ate with other men of their company in the barracks mess hall. The army didn't have trained cooks, so the job rotated among the men in the company as an extra duty. This meant the quality of the food preparation depended on how well each man could cook. <br /> <br /> In this building, the left (west) side has been restored as infantry barracks, the right (east) side as the post hospital. The east side had originally been for a cavalry company but when the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/10th-cavalry-at-fort-larned.htm\">10th Cavalry</a> left in 1869 it was converted into a new Post Hospital in 1872.   </p> <h2>Hospital </h2> <p>The new <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fort-larned-post-hospital.htm\">post hospital</a> in the east half of the barracks building was a big improvement over the former adobe hospital building that leaked mud from the ceiling when it rained. Even with a solid roof overhead, medical care was crude by today's standards, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Army doctors were some of the best trained and qualified doctors in the country, but they were still limited by the medical knowledge of the day. There were few medicines at the time to cure people and doctors had very little understanding of how diseases spread. Still, the doctors stationed at Fort Larned did the best they could to heal the soldiers under their care.</p>",

Extra help, if needed, came from enlisted men brought in for extra pay.</p> <p>The post blacksmith was a civilian contractor who worked for the Quartermaster Department. His job was to repair or manufacture any hardware needed at the post. He was also responsible for wagon repairs, which was usually the biggest part of his job. At a large post blacksmiths could specialize. At a small post like Fort Larned, the blacksmith was a generalist who had to be able to do a lot of different jobs.<br />  </p>",

They were an important part of fort life, providing goods and services not available to soldiers through the regular army supply system. Soldiers and officers could get such things as food, clothing, tobacco, and personal items from the sutler's store. <br /> <br /> Army regulations provided for one sutler per post so the trader who got the license had, in effect, a captive market. However, there were restrictions imposed by the Army for this privilege.  They were supervised by a post Council of Administration, which assessed a fee every few months  of several cents for each officer and enlisted man on the post. The Council also determined  “the quantity and kind of clothing, small equipment, or soldiers’ necessaries, groceries, etc.” the sutler had to have available for sale.  In order to keep soldiers from overspending their meager pay, the sutler was not allowed to extend credit to a soldier for over half of his monthly salary.  He also could not sell alcohol to them without the permission of their officers.<br /> <br /> Due to a mix up, Fort Larned had two posts sutlers for several years. The two areas circled on the picture indicate the location of each sutler's operation. The red frame building to the west is where the original sutler's store was located. The building is a reconstruction of the sutler's quarters. The store itself was a sandstone building constructed in 1863. Where you are standing is the site of the second sutler's store. This second complex had a restaurant, general store, recreation hall, billiards, and a one-lane bowling alley for military and civilians.<br />  </p>",

A grassroots network of willing partners, volunteers, and locations serve as the Freedom’s Frontier Board of Trustees, the coordinating entity for the heritage area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{245}\" paraid=\"8\">Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area has a distinct landscape of rivers, hills, valleys, soils, and vegetation. In the 1800s, before the nation expanded across the continent, the western border of Missouri was the American frontier. To its west, Kansas was known as a permanent Indian Territory for both the Plains Indians and other tribes who were forcibly sent to the region following decades of land disputes. Since river travel ended at the Kansas border, this area became a major jumping-off point for pioneers heading west on extensive networks of trails. Traders, miners, and emigrants secured necessities and purchased provisions, and prepared for long overland treks.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{251}\" paraid=\"9\">In 1854, political tensions between Missouri and Kansas resulted in a violent border war as the Kansas territory sought statehood and debated the legality of slavery. At the time, Missouri was a slave state, and the issue of Kansas entering the Union as a potential “free state” ignited years of turmoil. The violent conflict between slavery proponents and abolitionists in the war known as “Bleeding Kansas” (or “Border War”) focused national attention on Kansas sovereignty and territorial law. This was one of the nation's most widely debated political crises in the years leading up to the Civil War. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed in 1854 left the territory's future status in the hands of settlers. The struggle for freedom was at the forefront of the Border War, and in the Civil War that followed. Although the Fugitive Slave Law made assisting runaway slaves a hanging offense in Kansas Territory, abolitionists continued to help slaves escaping from Missouri by the Underground Railroad.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{16}\" paraid=\"10\">After the Civil War, hundreds of African Americans came to settle in Kansas as part of the \"Exoduster Movement\" in the 1870s. Through the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, African Americans in both states continued the struggle for freedom from inequality and segregation during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights eras. One of the heritage area’s most well-known civil rights stories is found in the landmark Supreme Court case known as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas which ended legal racial segregation in public schools in 1954. Today, Freedom’s Frontier National Heritage Area continues to advocate for equal freedoms for all Americans.  Visit, explore and learn about the nation’s enduring legacy and struggle for freedom through the shared stories of courage, conflict, and hope for reconciliation as told across their broad landscape.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{69}\"

McFerran, 1865. </p> </blockquote> <p>One of the most important roles for any frontier fort is amassing and securing the supplies that kept the Army functioning, including food, ammunition, and clothing. The army had to be able to supply itself in order to maintain a permanent presence on the plains. To that end, the first sandstone buildings completed at Fort Larned after the blockhouse was finished were made to store food, ammunition, and supplies. <br /> <br /> Fort Larned has three warehouses - the Old Commissary, the Quartermaster Storehouse, and the New Commissary. The first two warehouses were built in 1866 and 1867, this warehouse was added in 1868 to accommodate the additional supplies needed when the fort's troop levels surged to their highest. <br /> <br /> The New Commissary was the last sandstone building completed at the fort since troop levels continued to go down over the next decade. As the need for storage space declined, the New Commissary was turned into a multipurpose building, including the post library and schoolroom.<br />  </p>",

As troop levels went up the fort needed a better place to store food supplies. This building would serve as the Commissary Warehouse until the fort closed in 1878. <br /> <br /> Both \"issue\" and \"non-issue\" food supplies were stored here. The enlisted soldiers didn't pay for their food but were \"issued\" daily rations instead. Officers were given a food allowance and could purchase \"non-issue\" items at cost. A Commissary Officer was responsible for keeping track of all the supplies in the warehouse. He was assisted by several clerks, usually enlisted men who were assigned to the duty. </p> <h2>Arsenal </h2> <p>Although the main purpose of this building was food storage, as soon as it was completed in 1866 the west end was used to store ammunition. It wasn't a safe place to store the ammunition, but the fort didn't have a proper magazine, and it was better than the blockhouse, which had a leaky roof. <br /> <br /> Weapons, rounds of ammunition, and gunpowder were stored in the Arsenal. These included cartridges, for both the infantry and cavalry stationed here, as well as rounds and accouterments for the artillery. Ammunition would be stored in this building until 1872 when the old adobe hospital was converted to magazine.

Fort Larned National Historic Site protects a small area of grassland, offering a window into this now radically altered ecosystem.</p> <p>Today, mule deer and white-tail deer are the only hoofed mammals still here. You can still find many small mammals, though. Fox squirrels, thirteen-lined ground squirrels, prairie dogs, pocket gophers, beavers, skunks, raccoons, opossums, coyotes, muskrats, weasels, and badgers all make their home here. Occasionally, you might even see an armadillo in the northern extreme of their range.</p> <p>Several species of reptiles may also be found at Fort Larned like lizards, toads, turtles, bullsnakes, blue racers, hog-nosed snakes, and garter snakes.<br /> <br /> The nature trail’s variety of habitats provide for numerous species of birds such as hawks, orioles, kingbirds, blue jays, and red-headed woodpeckers, among many others. Fort Larned is located on the Central Flyway, a major bird migration corridor. White-fronted geese, sandhill cranes, and many other species pass over Fort Larned during spring and fall migrations.</p> <p>Dozens of species of grasses, forbs, and shrubs constitute the plant life of the grasslands, providing food and shelter for animals as well as impressive wildflower displays.</p> <p>Cottonwood trees, dependent on the water available in the river, line the banks of the Pawnee Fork. Historic photos show far fewer trees than today, largely because the trees were susceptible to naturally-occurring prairie fires and were also used for fuel.<br />  </p>",

A typical company's officers included two lieutenants and one captain. As such, each of the one-story buildings housed two captains and four lieutenants.<br /> <br /> The captain’s quarters were at the ends of the buildings and had two rooms, a kitchen, and servant’s room. Lieutenants had one room each with no kitchen until 1870. At that time, wooden lean-to structures were added at the back of each building to give the lieutenants kitchens and servant space.<br />  </p>",

Trees were scare on the prairies, making wood for a stockade too expensive. Instead, they built blockhouses, which provided a defensive structure in case of Indian attack.<br /> <br /> Fort Larned's blockhouse was built in the of winter 1864-65 to strengthen the fort's defenses after a Kiowa raid in June of 1864. The Kiowas were able to steal 172 of the fort's horses and mules. This hexagonal stone building contained a powder magazine, two levels of rifle slits or loopholes, an underground passageway, and well. However, it was not needed for defense, so in 1867 it was converted into a guardhouse and served as the post jail.<br /> <br /> The original structure was dismantled around 1900 by civilian owners who used its sandstone blocks to build other structures and to shore up the wooden porches on officers' row. When the building was rebuilt in in 1986, at least 200 of the original stones were used in the reconstruction.<br />  </p>",

Other ceremonies could include inspections and troop reviews.<br /> <br /> Military drills were how soldiers learned, and reinforced, the maneuvers they would use in combat, including marching in formation and responding to the various bugle calls that signaled different movements.

Agencies were set up as part of a formal relationship when the U.S. government signed a treaty with an Indian tribe. In exchange for their land the government promised them goods, food and annuities. Indian Agents maintained a relationship with the tribes to coordinate the distribution of those goods, as well as to make sure they were following the terms of the treaty.<br /> <br /> Agents were assigned regionally and usually located in communities or forts close to the tribes they were responsible for. Noted Indian Bureau agents Edward W. Wynkoop and Jesse Leavenworth were among those who served the tribes from Fort Larned. Edward Wynkoop rented the sutler's quarters at the original post sutler's complex to serve as his office. <br /> <br /> The Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche and Plains Apache were assigned to the agency here. The annuity goods they received from the government were most often distributed in the Autumn. For the years that Fort Larned served as an agency for the Indian Bureau, post residents watched in fascination as the scattered bands of these Plains Indian tribes assembled at the fort. Pitching their tipis on nearby prairie, the tribes settled in to locate their friends and kin among their neighbors, to trade, and to await distribution of their annuities.<br /> <br /> Annuities included staples like bacon, wheat flour, coffee, sugar, fresh beef, and tobacco. Usually clothing, beads, blankets, metal tools and cooking utensils, gunpowder, and lead for bullets were also provided. The annuity system was designed to pacify and transform roaming tribes of warlike Indians into sedentary, peaceful farmers. But they were reluctant to give up their traditional way of life and continued to fight against the U.S. government’s attempts to place them on reservations. <br />  </p>",

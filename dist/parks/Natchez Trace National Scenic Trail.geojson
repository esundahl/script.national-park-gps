This is our community. This is the place where we lived. It is not only a place where we lived, it is a place where we took care of each other. In our community, if one person is hungry, everybody is hungry, and the hunters would go out and they would hunt, and they would bring animals back and everybody would eat...<br /> \"If somebody is cold, or somebody doesn't have any clothing, the hunters would bring back those animals and the people would make clothing... <br /> \"If we were to have visitors that came from long distances, say from the area now known as North or South Carolina...They would find people within this village who were of the same clan. They would have a place to stay for the night. They would have a place to eat, and they would have entertainment. They could talk about the news of what was happening in their village.\" LaDonna Brown, Chickasaw Nation anthropologist. <br /> <br /> This was once the location of a large Chickasaw Village. The sizes and shapes of their homes are marked on the ground. Interpretive signs share the site history which is located on a portion of Black Belt Prairie.

A shallow area was created by the deposition of sediments as the river retreated. During periodic low water, seedlings of water-tolerant cypress and tupelo trees gained a foothold. The trees you see today are a result.<br /> <br /> Water tupelo and bald cypress trees can live in deep water for long periods. After taking root in the summer when the swamp is nearly dry, the seedlings can stay alive in water deep enough to kill other plants.<br /> <br /> The trail at this location leads through an abandoned river channel. As the channel fills with silt and vegetation, black willow, sycamore, red maple, and other trees will gradually replace the bald cypress and water tupelo. Also if you look closely you may see juvenile alligators sunning themselves on floating logs and other vegetation.<br /> <br /> This location is also a trailhead for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yockanookanysection.htm\">Yockanookany Section of the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail</a>.

Will it be history, nature, agriculture, recreation? You can experience them all at this overlook that combines everything the Natchez Trace Parkway is about. <br /> <br /> Folks interested in nature and recreation can fish in the pond, watch turtles pile up and warm their shells in the sun, or imagine back more than 11,000 years ago and picture mastodons ambling to the creek.<br /> <br /> Walkers can stretch their legs on a short jaunt into the woods or down to Town Creek. Hikers can access the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail and walk a little more than 2 miles south to the Chickasaw Village Site, or head northward for little less than two miles to the Beech Springs Trailhead. <br /> <br /> Over time, people have used this area in many ways. The human history of Old Town started with American Indians who settled here. The name Old Town was what the English called a large established Chickasaw village. <br /> <br /> Old Town was not always a peaceful bottomland. The 1914 DAR marker indicates that the Battle of Ackia took place near here, which is debatable, but we know that during the Civil War's Battle of Tupelo, on July 15, 1864, an intense battle was fought in the bottoms at the creek. <br /> <br /> Standing on the north side of the overlook, there are views of both natural and cultivated land protected by the Natchez Trace Parkway. The agricultural land is leased and planted with traditional crops to help conserve the rural beauty of the Parkway. ",

        "notes": "Rocky Springs Town Site, Milepost 54.8\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/rocky-springs-town-site.htm\n\nCalled \"the Rocky Spring\" by early travelers, the town later became Rocky Springs, a rural community covering about 25 square miles. Settlement of the area began in the late 1790's and continued until about 1860, reaching a peak of approximately 2600 people. Several businesses were established at different times, among them carpenters, wheelwrights, a well digger, cabinet makers, a cotton gin maker and blacksmiths. By the mid-1800's there was also a church, post office, a Masonic Lodge, and possibly a school.<br /> <br /> During the four years that the Civil War raged, many areas in both the North and the South would experience its devastation. A letter written in 1863 stated, \"My slaves, horses, and mules are carried off, my fences torn dowand my crops destroyed...\" <br /> <br /> In the summer fall of 1878, yellow fever struck the area. Pastor J.W. Sandwell on November 18, 1873, wrote that there were 180 yellow fever cases and 43 deaths. Although Rocky Springs tried to recover after the yellow fever epidemic, in the early 1900's boll weevil struck, a beetle that feeds on cotton buds and flowers, devastating the cotton crop. After this final disaster, the population declined rapidly and the last store in the area closed its doors during the 1930's.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the nearby spring no longer flows and today only the church and cemetery, two rustling safes and several abandoned cisterns remain of this once prosperous rural community.",

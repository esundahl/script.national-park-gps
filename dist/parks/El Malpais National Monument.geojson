Bat Cave is an important habitat for bats, and during the summer, thousands of bats can be seen flying out of the cave at dusk to feed on insects. <h3>Bat Cave</h3> During the summer, thousands of bats fly from the entrance of Bat Cave at dusk to forage for insects. These Mexican free-tailed bats use this cave as a summer home and migrate south for the winter. Other bats, like little brown bats and Townsend's big eared bats, live here year round and hibernate in this cave. <strong>Bat Cave is closed year-round.</strong><br /> <br /> A cloud of smoke circling toward the sky is what the nightly flight of Mexican free-tailed bats looks like. The flight can last for an hour or more without showing signs of slowing. In recent years, the circling cloud of smoke has been replaced by a winding tendril that lasts fifteen minutes or less. Research is underway to understand more about the monument's bat species. Please do your part to help protect the bats of El Malpais; do not go into Bat Cave or disturb any bats. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elma/planyourvisit/ranger-programs.htm\">Learn more about seeing a bat outflight. </a> <h3>Xenolith Cave</h3> Xenolith means \"foreign rock\" and refers to small chunks of white, non-volcanic rocks found in the walls of the cave's lower passages. These rocks got mixed into the lava as it flowed over, or erupted through, limestone or sandstone elsewhere in the monument.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\">Xenolith Cave is currently closed for resource and visitor protection.</span> </strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elma/planyourvisit/caving.htm\">Learn more about caving permits and caving safely.</a> <h3>Human Use</h3> Lava tubes have been used for temporary shelters, natural refrigerators, shrines, and even as a source for fertilizer. Bat guano is an excellent fertilizer because it is high in nitrates. Remnants of a simple mining operation are still in Bat Cave. Guano mining, even on this small scale, could not have been pleasant. Guano has a very distinct and unpleasant smell that you can occasionally get a whiff of from the trail near the cave entrance.<br />  ",

The trail crosses the oldest lava flow at El Malpais National Monument and passes by several <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elma/planyourvisit/caving.htm\">lava tube cave</a> entrances on the way to the summit of a cinder cone volcano. Picnic benches and a pit toilet are available at the trailhead.</p> <h2>Geology In Motion</h2> <p>The processes of geology are usually so slow that they cannot be measured in a human lifetime. Occasionally, we can see the effects of erosion or other processes after a good rain or high spring winds, but these are exceptions. However, there are some events that happen so quickly their effects can be seen immediately. Volcanic eruptions are one of these events.<br /> <br /> In 1943 near Parícutin, Mexico, a farmer noticed a crack in one of his fields sending out gas and ash. Less than ten years later, a cinder cone 1,200 feet (365 m) high towered over the field. El Calderon Cinder Cone would have had a similar beginning when it was formed somewhere between 30,000 to 60,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> A volcanic vent shot cinders hundreds of feet into the air, creating the cinder cone you see today. Rivers of molten rock created lava trenches and lava tubes. Since then, the changes have been less dramatic. A combination of vegetation and erosion slowly break down lava into smaller particles. Eventually, the area is transformed from a blackened landscape to the forested land you see today.</p> <h2>Signs of Life</h2> <p>The seasons bring an ever changing array of life to the El Calderon trail. In the spring, look for piñon jays and the occasional snake or lizard basking in the sun. Summer brings warmer temperatures, insects, and several species of bats that can be seen chasing after the insects from Bat Cave. As summer progresses and monsoon rains fall, wildflowers blanket the ground. Fall is a good time to spot deer, elk, and other animals foraging for food. During winter, prints from coyotes, bobcats, rabbits, and other animals are easy to spot on freshly fallen snow.</p>",

Through tree-ring research, scientists know that low intensity fires have historically occurred in this area every eight to ten years. These fires clear brush and prevent large, hot fires from burning everything.<br /> <br /> When European settlers came to this area, they began to suppress all fires to protect grazing land and homes. Land management agencies continued this practice throughout the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Because fires have not been allowed to burn on a natural cycle, forest lands have accumulated a high concentration of dry fuels. Fires today are generally hotter and larger, burning healthy trees that would otherwise withstand smaller fires.<br /> <br /> Park managers are trying to restore the natural fire cycle to El Malpais National Monument. Blackened areas you may see along the trail or in other areas of the park are from prescribed fires. These fires are ignited under specific conditions to clear excess fuel and allow healthy trees to thrive. <br /> <br /> Soon after a prescribed fire, grasses and wildflowers abound. The burned trees return nutrients to the soil and a healthy forest emerges from the ashes. One tree that thrives from the effects of fire is the quaking aspen. Known as a pioneer tree, it is the first tree to start life anew in a burned area.</p>",

Most of the life in this cave is small to microscopic and lives in dark corners, under rocks, and in deep cracks. Scientists divide the life found in caves into four categories: accidentals, trogloxenes, troglophiles, and troglobites. Accidentals can be anything from moths to animals that wander into a cave. The other types of cave life generally show som type of adaptation that allows them to use or live in the cave.<br /> <br /> Trogloxenes typically live above ground and do not depend on the cave for survival. Bats and mice are examples of trogloxenes. Troglophiles may live their entire lives in the cave, but are not fully adapted to the cave environment. Some spiders and beetles are examples of troglophiles. Troglobites live their entire life in the cave and are completely dependent on the cave for survival. Special kinds of tiny, all white mites and insects are two types of troglobiotic species found in Junction Cave. <h3>Bats in Peril</h3> A disease called white-nosed syndrome (WNS) is spreading across the United States. Although this disease does not bother humans, it has killed more than 6 million hibernating bats so far and threatens to wipe out entire bat species.<br /> <br /> The impact on agriculture may be profound - these millions of bats ate crop pests. Farmers may now have to use more pesticides to kill insects and grow their crops.<br /> <br /> WNS is named for a white fungus found on bat muzzles and wings. The fungus prefers cold, humid temperatures found in caves and mines. It strikes bats when they are most vulnerable--during hibernation. It appears that the fungus creates and irritation that invades the bat's skin, causing bats to wake up and use energy reserves needed to hibernate. They then starve or freeze to death.",

Since liquid follows the path of least resistance--which is typically downhill--you are standing slightly downhill from McCartys Crater.   <br /> <br /> Like any liquid, melted lava rock flows in different ways.  Lava’s temperature, speed, the volume of lava flowing, and the shape of the surrounding landscape all impact how flowing lava moves.  In the case of Lava Falls, a small “fall” of lava was created as one lava flow slowly dripped over the edge of a previous flow. <br /> <br /> Unlike water, lava can flow over itself if previous lava flows have cooled.  The hot lava may or may not melt the cooled rock beneath it, and this unpredictability creates countless lava features.  Where else besides this lava fall can you see where lava flowed over, under, and around other flows? </p>",

However, these ridges formed from the lava rising up, rather than tall, thick lava flows flowing down.  <br /> <br /> Lava can hold onto gasses, even as a liquid. Different minerals, such as silica, magnesium, and iron create a texture that can hold on to some gases easier than others. When lava cools, these gases rise upwards and outwards to escape into the air, and sometimes the lava expands with it. A similar process happens when bread bakes and expands in an oven.<br /> <br /> Lava with more magnesium is usually more black in color, while high iron levels turn the rock red. Where do you see the differences in this amphitheater? Why do you think some areas inflated while others did not?</p>",

Water trickles through the cracks of the rock and collects beneath the lava while still protected from the intense sunlight and wind.<br /> <br /> Trees find enough water and nutrients below the lava to survive, but not enough to reach the lofty heights of trees found off lava flows.  In non-lava habitats, ponderosa pine can grow up to two hundred feet (61 meters) tall and grow straight upwards, and pinon pines can grow 10-20 feet (3-6 meters) tall and grows at crooked angles.  How do the trees around you compare? <br /> <br /> Many other plants also find this as a suitable environment.  Hedgehog cacti and claret cup cacti bloom in late spring.  Other wildflowers such as Apache plume and vervain appear as summer storms bring more water, and plants like New Mexico olive and rubber rabbitbrush bloom into late autumn.

As lava is exposed to outside air, it begins to cool. As lava cools, it contracts or shrinks, cracks, and sometimes falls apart. Rock may break apart and fall if there is nothing below a rock ceiling to hold it up, much like the sink holes and other collapse features around you.  <br /> <br /> You don't need to worry about lava collapsing around you today: the cooling process ended between 1,900 and 3,900 years ago.  <br /> <br /> As life begins to move in to lava landscapes, it takes advantage of the shade, moisture, and protection that is in sink holes and other lava features. Summers on the lava are hot, sunny, and dry, but sink holes create pockets of cooler temperatures, indirect sunlight, and moisture.<br /> <br /> Sinkholes also house precious water sources. If enough rain water or melted snow collects at the bottom of a sink hole, ice forms in small pools or rounded towers and remain a source of water for life in the area.</p>",

Cairns--the rock piles you have been following--are often used in wilderness areas to direct and guide visitors without disturbing the views of a natural landscape.  <br /> <br /> However, there is no clear definition for \"wilderness.\" Some may view wilderness as serene--or scary--places with massive mountains, raging rivers, or winding canyons.  How would you define wilderness?</p>",

During the battle, the monster bleeds, and when the battle is over, the blood dries black. What color is lava when it flows? What color is the landscape you are on now? Although the word \"volcano\" is never used, the oral histories of Acoma Pueblo, Zuni Pueblo, and Navajo Nation all document a volcanic event.<br /> <br /> These three Tribes and many others in the region maintain a relationship with this landscape today. Acoma Pueblo and Zuni Pueblo continue their connection to the lava and each other with today's Acoma-Zuni Trail (or Zuni-Acoma Trail off of Highway 53), maintaining the connection through lava on foot.<br /> <br /> After completing the Lava Falls Trail, you have had the chance to create your own connection and experience with a lava landscape.

One of these habitats is actually found just along the edges of lava flows. Known as the \"edge effect,\" dense vegetation seems to thrive along the lava's edge. Scientists hypothesize that rainwater and moisture runoff from the lava and the surrounding land collects along this edge and allows more vegetation to grow. <br /> <br /> As you hike along the edges fo the El Malpais lava flows, look for the edge effect. Aspens, not normally found in this area, thrive along the lava edge. You can see this effect as you return to the hiking area along the dirt road or if you continue along the El Calderon loop trail to the Continental Divide trail (adds about 2 miles to this hiking loop).",

        "notes": "Summit of El Calderon\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/elma-el-calderon-summit.htm\n\nEl Calderon is a 60,000 year old cinder cone in El Malpais National Monument. From the El Calderon Summit, take a short 0.8 mile hike around the rim of El Calderon and look down into the eroded core of an ancient volcano. <h3>Cinders</h3> On your journey around the El Calderon summit, you will see many pea-sized rocks called cinders. Cinders are bits of lava that hardened as they were shot into the air from a vent in the ground. As the cinders fell to the ground, they formed a cone-shaped structure around the lava vent, building up the conical structure of the cider cone you see today.<br /> <br /> El Calderon had at least two main eruption phases. One created the black cinders you can see from the summit; the other created the red cinders. The red cinders contain higher amounts of iron and oxidized (rusted) as they were exposed to the air.<br /> <br /> How can anything grown in the loose, airy cinders around El Calderon? The cinders, as loose as they are, provide a good place for seeds to take root. The cinders may also retain water deep below the surface, providing ample moisture for trees, plants, and wildflowers. There are several plants in the monument that grow only on cinders: bracken ferns, cinder phacelia, and limber pine. On El Calderon Cinder Cone, look for ponderosa pines, Rocky Mountain juniper, and chamisa. In the late summer, primrose, Indian paintbrush, and sunflowers are common. <h3>Bombs Away!</h3> Cinders were not the only thing El Calderon sent flying into the air. Lava bombs, some up to three feet in diameter, were also hurled violently from the volcano. These rounded pieces of lava were formed when a piece of lava was ejected from the volcano and solidified before it hit the ground. If one of these bombs hit a tree, it could wrap around the trunk and create a horseshoe shaped lava bomb. If the bomb spiraled through the air, it would form an elongated bomb that resembled a football. Look for these lava bombs around the base of El Calderon. <h3>A Point in Time</h3> The eruption of El Calderon is just one dot on a timeline of events that continue to shape the earth. By the time El Calderon was formed 60,000 years ago, the area around El Malpais had already seen millions of years of volcanic activity. After El Calderon's eruption, volcanic activity continued about every eight to ten thousand years. Because cinder cones do not erupt again once the vent is plugged with hardened lava, El Calderon itself is no longer an active volcano. However, it is possible that there will again be volcanic activity in the El Malpais area. Will it happen in our lifetime? Only time will tell, but history reveals that it will be several thousand years before this area sees volcanic activity. <h3>Reminders of the Past</h3> Cinders were once mined from the El Calderon Area before it became part of a national monument. Notice a hole in the side of the cinder cone? This hole, along with items such as glass bottles, tin cans, and tools that occasionally turn up in the loose cinders are evidence of a cinder mining operation. It is not known how long the mine was active, but the cinders were probably used to build roads.",

        "notes": "Ellis Architectural Highlights\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/ellis-architectural-highlights.htm\n\n<p>Main Immigration Building - front elevation: The monumental Main Immigration Building opened at the end of 1900 to replace the original wooden station that burned in 1897. The New York firm of Boring & Tilton was chosen as the architects after an invitational competition, only the second held under the Tarsney Act of 1893 allowing private architects to compete for government commissions. Both principal architects had studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris.</p> <h3>Copper Tops the Towers</h3> <p>The towers are topped by ornate copper domes that were carefully restored by the National Park Service. The openings are filled with a terracotta screen that facilitates air flow.</p> <h3>Top of a Tower</h3> <p>The Main Immigration Building was designed with four corner towers featuring ornate decoration to create an impressive view from across the water. The large scale of the brackets, acroterion ( a pedestal placed on a pediment to support a statue or other ornamentation,) and other decorative features was intended to make them legible from a distance.</p> <h3>Entrance to Northeast Tower</h3> <p>The robust limestone quoins and heavy Classical entablature at the entrance to the northeast tower of the Main Immigration Building are characteristic of the Beaux-Arts Classical approach employed by Boring & Tilton.</p> <h3>Corbelled Bricks</h3> <p>The corbelled bricks visible in this stairwell help support the weight of the tower above.</p> <h3>Guastavino Ceiling Vault</h3> <p>The impressive vaulted space of the Great Hall was rebuilt using Guastavino structural tile. The Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company developed their patented system of interlocking tiles and thin layers of mortar to safely and relatively inexpensively create grand public spaces throughout the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The original plaster vault was damaged by the Black Tom Wharf explosion in 1916.</p> <h3>Main Hospital Complex</h3> <p>The main hospital was built in three stages on landfill designated \"Island 2.\" The first section (right) was designed by Boring & Tilton and opened in 1901. Government architects with the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury James Knox Taylor designed the Administration Building (center) and third section. The main hospital was completed by 1909 and presents a unified Georgian Revival appearance.<br /> Have you considered a hard hat tour? Guided 90-minute tours will take you to select areas of the 750-bed Ellis Island Hospital. Visit the Laundry Building, with much of its original equipment still in place, where over 3000 pieces of laundry were washed and sanitized daily. The tour will also take you to the infectious and contagious disease wards, kitchen, staff housing, autopsy room and more.

The brick and limestone structure replaced the metal-clad wooden ferry building at the end of the ferry slip between Islands 1 and 2.</p> <h3>Top of the New Ferry Building</h3> <p>The New Ferry Building offers stylish Art Deco details such as bas relief limestone panels and a lead-sheathed tower decorated with a chevron motif and dramatic eagles perched at each corner. New York architect Chester Aldrich served as consulting architect, with the Public Buildings Branch of the Department of the Treasury, led by Louis A. Simon, as supervising architects.</p>",

        "notes": "Ferry Building Wayside\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/ferry-building-wayside.htm\n\n<p>Overlooking the Ellis Island slip, the Ferry building has undergone may changes over the years. Today you see the third evolution of this building as a primary docking area for National Park Service boats.</p> <h3>Old Ferry Building</h3> <p>Built in 1901, the Old Ferry Building serviced the workers and riders of the Ellis Island: a ferryboat that transported employees, supplies, and immigrants released from the island to New York City. In 1904, the building was widened so that it could handle the growing number of immigrants.<br /> The Old Ferry Building was proposed to be a plain, durable, fireproof structure consisting of a central receiving area with waiting rooms on either side. This was where passengers (both employees and released immigrants) waited to board the New York-bound Ellis Island. Additionally, the Old Ferry Building contained offices and living facilities for the ferry's staff.<br /> By 1933, the Old Ferry Building was in poor condition. In 1935, the building was torn down and replaced by the New Ferry Building.</p> <h3>New Ferry Building</h3> <p>The New Ferry Building was built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1936 and designed by WPA architects Louis A. Simon and Chester Aldrich. This new fireproof ferry building was made of brick and featured a high central pavilion surmounted by a copper-covered cupola and two single-story wings. The central pavilion housed a waiting room for immigrants, the left wing was designated for use by the United States Customs Service, and the right wing had a lunchroom with kitchen facilities.<br /> The Ferry Building and its connecting corridors are also the key connection between the immigrant processing facility in Main Building and the United States Public Health Service hospital complex on the other side of the island.<br /> In 1999, the Statue of Liberty National Monument/Ellis Island was awarded a $1.2 million federal challenge grant from the Save America's Treasures program to restore the New Ferry Building. Initiated in 1998, the program is one of the largest and most successful grant programs for the protection of our nation's endangered and irreplaceable cultural heritage.<br /> While open to the public from 2007 through 2012, the building is closed today.</p> <h3>The Ferryboat Ellis Island</h3> <p>From 1904 to 1954, the Ferryboat Ellis Island transported passengers of all types between Ellis Island and Lower Manhattan - federal immigrant inspectors, doctors, nurses, interpreters, clerks, watchmen, matrons, and charwomen. It also carried immigrants bound for Manhattan and, after 1925, was the main ferry carrying all immigrants to and from Ellis Island.<br /> With a captain and crew of seven men, the Ellis Island could carry up to 1,000 passengers. It was 160 feet long and 45 feet at her widest point. Accommodations included an upper deck for staff, a lower deck for immigrants, a private room for Ellis Island's commissioner, an infirmary for twelve patients, and a padded cell for the mentally ill.</p>",

Since the British had easily invaded New York with very little resistance during the American Revolution, the protection of New York became a top priority for the new government. Preceding the War of 1812, the United States War Department constructed Fort Gibson (named after Colonel James Gibson who was fatally wounded in the British Siege of Fort Erie) on Ellis Island. Fort Gibson consisted of a barracks for a small garrison, a powder magazine, and a battery of guns located along the island's eastern edge.</p>",

Those allowed to pass continued downstairs. Those detained for additional legal examination waited for an opportunity to explain further in the Board of Special Inquiry room, where their Hearing would be held. About one percent would be denied admission for violation of America laws. Watching the clock? Come back and read the legal question sections later if needed. There's only one more stop - it's the Stairs of Separation. When you are ready, walk toward the center stairs on the west side of the Great Hall.</p> <h3>Will You Become A Public Charge?</h3> <p>Any immigrant deemed \"liable to become a public charge\" was denied entry to the United States. To Ellis Island inspectors, this clause (which has been a cornerstone of federal immigration policy since 1882) designated those who appeared unable to support themselves and were therefore likely to become a burden on society. Influenced by American welfare agencies that claimed they were being overwhelmed by requests for aid from impoverished immigrants, the Ellis Island inspectors carefully weighed the prospects of new arrivals, especially those of women and children intending to rejoin husbands and fathers in this country.</p> <h3>Do You Have A Job?</h3> <p>This question posed a dilemma for immigrants. The Alien Contact Labor Law of 1885 excluded all immigrants who came to the United States under contract for work. The law was meant to stop the importation of cheap labor, but was applied even to immigrants who had jobs promised to them through relatives or friends. Immigrants had to convince inspectors that they were able and willing to work and were not \"liable to become public charges, yet they could not admit that they had a job waiting for them.</p> <h3>Are You A Woman Traveling Alone?</h3> <p>Immigration officials detained escorted women and children until their safety was assured once they left Ellis Island. A telegram, letter, or prepaid ticket from waiting relatives was usually required before detained women and children would be sent on their way. Single women could not leave Ellis Island with a man who was not related to them. When a fiance and his intended were reunited at Ellis Island, their marriage was often performed right on the island. Then they were free to leave.</p> <h3>What If You Don't Speak English?</h3> <p>Many immigrants described the Registry Room, which frequently echoed with the sounds of many languages, as a \"Tower of Babel.\" Ellis Island inspections were assisted by interpreters who were fluent in major languages and any number of obscure dialects. The interpreters were rarely stumped, but often they had to try several languages before comprehension would finally light up an immigrant's face.</p>",

While ten percent were held back for additional medical examination, eventually all but one percent were allowed entry to the United States. After you read about the Doctors and the Six-Second Exam, walk across the Great Hall and have a seat on one of the Benches before scrolling to the Great Hall Bench Section.</p> <h3>The Doctors of Ellis Island</h3> <p>The doctors of Ellis Island were commissioned officers of the U.S. Public Health Service. Officially known as surgeons, they were in charge of the Ellis Island Hospital and the medical examination of immigrants in a routine procedure called the line inspection. As long lines of immigrants slowly entered Ellis Island's Registry Room, they were examined swiftly and expertly by the doctors for any sign of disease or signs of physical or mental weakness.</p> <h3>The Six Second Exam</h3> <p>U.S. Public Health Service doctors sometimes had only six seconds to scan each immigrant during the line inspection, a rapid, efficient process meant only to detect those who should be held for a more through medical examination. Experienced doctors could recognize the signs of a wide variety of diseases and disabilities. In 1917, the U.S. Public Health Service printed a list of over 60 health conditions - from anemia to varicose veins - that doctors could spot during the brief line inspection.</p>",

Three boards were usually in session all day, and during busy seasons a fourth board was added. Each board held 50 to 100 hearings daily in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer.<br /> Each board based its decision on the testimony of the immigrant and of friends or relatives allowed to speak on the immigrant's behalf. An immigrant who received an unfavorable decision from the board could appeal directly to Washington, D.C., with the help of a lawyer often provided by an immigrant aid society. Approximately 15 to 20% of the aliens who appeared before the boards were ultimately denied admission to the United States.</p>",

For the immigrants, however, the room was often a loud, confusing and frightening place. Nearly every day, for over two decades (1900-1924), the Registry Room was filled with new arrivals waiting to be inspected and registered by Immigration Service officers. On many days, over 5,000 people would file through the space. For most immigrants, this great hall epitomized Ellis Island. It was here that immigrants underwent medical and legal examinations. Here they encountered the complex demands of the immigration laws and an American bureaucracy that could either grant or withhold permission to land in the United States.</p> <h3>Historic Medical Inspection</h3> <p>The medical inspection was the first examination which an immigrant had to pass. The doctors and medical inspectors would look for any signs of illness or contagious diseases. If found, they would mark the immigrant with a chalk mark letter, indicating the suspected illness, and earmarking the immigrant for further examination. The majority of immigrants passed through the medical inspection the same day.</p> <h3>Historic Legal Inspection</h3> <p>Inspectors behind desks asked immigrants their name, home town, occupation, destination, and the amount of money they carried.

S. Public Health Service hospital in the country. Here doctors inspected and treated 1.2 million immigrants who arrived with illnesses or infirmities. In these buildings, immigrants learned if America's door would swing open to them or close because of a \"loathsome or contagious\" disease. Here, they also received the latest in medical care and treatment.</p> <h3>New buildings</h3> <p>Between 1892 and 1954, approximately 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island. At first most of the immigration station's functions took place in the Main Immigration Building (now home to the Ellis Island Immigration Museum), which opened on December 17, 1900 after the original wooden building burned down. However, in order to accommodate the overwhelming number of immigrants who annually passed through the island, the United States government added landfill to increase the island's footprint and constructed additional buildings to handle registration, medical care, and housing.</p> <h3>Main Hospital Buildings</h3> <p>In March of 1902, the Main Hospital Building opened. The hospital had the space and equipment to care for 125 patients. Over the next seven years, additional buildings were added to the hospital complex, including a Contagious Disease Hospital and Isolation Wards for patients suffering from contagious diseases like scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles and whooping cough. This additional space allowed physicians of the U.S. Public Health and Marine Hospital Services to properly diagnose and treat immigrants who failed the cursory medical inspection mandated by federal immigration laws.</p> <h3>Ellis Island Hard Hat Tour</h3> <p>Guided 90-minute tours will take you to select areas of the 750-bed Ellis Island Hospital.

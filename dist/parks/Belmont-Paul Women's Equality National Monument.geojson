        "notes": "National Mall and Memorial Parks\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/crnama.htm\n\n<p>Officially established in 1965, National Mall and Memorial Parks contains some of the oldest protected park lands in the National Park Service. The sprawling lands include the Mall, the public promenade extending from 3rd Street near the Capitol to 14th Street. The National Mall is the continuation of that space where congressionally authorized park icons, such as the Washington Monument, WWII and Lincoln Memorials stand. This historic expanse is the linear area between the Potomac River and Capital Reflecting Pool. In addition to the memorial core, the park includes some 156 reservations, circles, fountains and other open spaces, all of which serve as the nation’s front yard. Ford’s Theatre, The House where Lincoln died, Potomac Park, Hains Point and Pennsylvania Avenue NHS are also among the park managed areas that constitute National Mall and Memorial Parks.</p> <p>Having over 1,000 acres of National Park Service managed land at the heart of our nation’s capital, National Mall and Memorial Parks provides visitors with abundant opportunities to get in touch with our heritage. With everything from colossal monuments to commemorative gardens, from presidential inaugurals to civil rights demonstrations, National Mall and Memorial Parks hosts history in the making. Numerous First Amendment activities and special events are held in the park each year to honor the courage, sacrifice and devotion to duty of war veterans; celebrate the United States commitment to freedom, equality and democratic ideals; and enjoy symbolic architecture, historic vistas and renowned natural landscapes. </p>",

Grief holds her covered face against the shoulder of History and weeps in mourning. History holds a stylus and a tablet that was inscribed \"They died that their country might live.\" Below Grief and History, another life-size classical female figure represents Victory, holding high a laurel wreath and carrying an oak branch, signifying strength. Below her are the infant Mars, the god of war, and the infant Neptune, god of the sea. The shaft of the monument is decorated with wreaths, ribbons and scallop shells.</p> <p>Facing the U.S. Capitol is Peace, a classical figure draped from the waist down and holding an olive sprig. Below her are symbols of peace and industry. A dove, now missing and not documented in any known photographs, once nested upon a sheaf of wheat in a grouping of a cornucopia, turned earth, and a sickle resting across a sword. Opposite, the symbols of science, literature and art (including an angle, a gear, a book, and a pair of dividers) signify the progress of civilization that peace makes possible.</p> <p>At the corners of the monument, four marble globes are visually supported by massive brackets. The fountain below, with a jet on each side, empties into a quatrefoil-shaped basin. Inscribed \"In memory of the officers, seamen and marines of the United States Navy who fell in defense of the Union and liberty of their country, 1861-1865,\" this sculptural group has also been called the Naval Monument.</p> <p>The sculptor of the monument was Franklin Simmons (1839-1913), who was born in Maine, where he became known for his portrait busts. He worked in Rome after 1867, when he received the commission for a statue of <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/roger-williams\">Roger Williams</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/about-national-statuary-hall-collection\">National Statuary Hall collection</a>. In all, he created four statues and three busts for the United States Capitol. The Peace Monument is an example of his idealized <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/architecture-styles/neoclassical-architecture-capitol-hill\">neoclassical</a> sculpture.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>Peace Monument, first intended for Annapolis, was conceived by Admiral David D. Porter, who had commanded fleets of gunboats and troop transports during the war. Porter first sketched a simple design depicting Grief and History; beginning in 1865, he raised funds from private contributors, and the monument was commissioned from Simmons in 1871. The sculptor carved the Carrara marble in Rome and worked directly with Admiral Porter on many changes in the designs, including the addition of other figures. The architectural part of the monument was made by the Bonanni Brothers of Carrara, Italy, under Simmons's direction. The marble pieces were shipped to Washington in 1876; in 1877 the monument was erected on the base of Maine blue granite (designed by Architect of the Capitol <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/architect-of-the-capitol/edward-clark\">Edward Clark</a>); and the final figure, Peace, was set into place in January 1878.\"</p>",

This fountain was donated by Henry Cogswell and erected adjacent to the Central Market in 1884. Filled with ice, the water that flowed from this fountain offered a refreshing alternative to the numerous bars and liquor stores nearby, including one on the ground floor of the adjacent Central National Bank Building. Other temperance fountains were erected in other major cities, though few have survived to the present day.</p> <h4>Inscriptions</h4> <p>FAITH<br /> HOPE<br /> CHARITY<br /> TEMPERANCE<br /> PRESENTED BY<br /> HENRY D.

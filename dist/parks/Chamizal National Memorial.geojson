        "notes": "Vantage Point: Desert Landscape\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/vantage-chamizo.htm\n\n<p>The rolling hills on the Chamizal National Memorial grounds were constructed in the late 1960s to provide quiet areas for contemplation and a landscape that would appear to flow seamlessly from this commemorative park into the neighboring Mexican Chamizal park. A well provided abundant access to water that was needed needed to maintain a carpeted lawn of nonnative grass on which visitors could rest and recreate. </p> <p>Decades later, the park faces some unintended consequences in the context of a changing climate, growing demand for water, increased salinity in the soil, and a more acute environmental awareness. In more recent years, a former superintendent and landscape architect created a plan that proposes replanting areas of the park with native Chihuahuan Desert plants. Several years later, park rangers and volunteers planted a variety of native plants in the bare area north of you, between this vantage point and the road. Most of the plantings eventually died except for several four wing saltbushes and a couple of other small plants.</p> <p>There's likely a good reason that the four wing saltbushes that survived. This shrub's name in Spanish is <em>chamizo</em>, and a place where <em>chamizos</em> grow is a <em>chamizal</em>. This salt tolerant shrub was common. The disputed farmland was located in an area generally referred to as \"El Chamizal,\" so the name of the disputed land was transferred to the treaty that finally resolved the dispute and the national park that commemorates the historic event.</p> <p>While the treaty was a model of diplomacy and resolved a thorny dispute, it led to some consequences perhaps unintended and less beneficial. The Rio Grand used to meander back and forth creating braids up to two miles wide of natural channels through this area. Now, the concrete lined channels that keep the boundary from moving and protect the surrounding cities from flooding also remove natural banks that provide shelter and sustenance for plants and wildlife. People whose lives were daily tied to the river for centuries can no longer access it with its steep channeled sides and fences.</p> <hr /> <p>Have you ever been faced with a problem where the solution came at a price?</p>",

It rises over an international bridge connecting Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua in Mexico to El Paso, Texas, in the United States. It is named Bridge of the Americas but known locally as the free bridge, or <em>puente libre</em>, since there is no toll to cross from either side. It is one of five bridges connecting this binational metropolitan community. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a4469da2-2265-4f6e-91ce-e09e6d82625b}{109}\" paraid=\"458733364\">It is not visible from the park, but just beyond the border fence is the concrete-lined, present-day river channel where the Rio Grande (or <em>Río Bravo</em> as it is called in Mexico) runs its course.</p> <p paraeid=\"{a4469da2-2265-4f6e-91ce-e09e6d82625b}{129}\" paraid=\"2025058831\">Bridges can be symbols of transition. Rivers can symbolize the flow of time. The shifting streambed of the Rio Grande River can be used to mark different points of time in the story of the Chamizal. Let’s see how these two features can be seen as testaments to both change and continuity.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a4469da2-2265-4f6e-91ce-e09e6d82625b}{171}\" paraid=\"933987879\">In 1852, just 4 years after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo established the Rio Grande as the border between the United States and Mexico, the river’s channel ran just south of today’s downtown El Paso.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a4469da2-2265-4f6e-91ce-e09e6d82625b}{181}\" paraid=\"1763073433\">As naturally flowing rivers do, the Rio Grande changed course many times, sometimes gradually due to erosion and sometimes suddenly from flooding, in a generally southern direction into Mexico.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a4469da2-2265-4f6e-91ce-e09e6d82625b}{203}\" paraid=\"1318962272\">As early as 1864, the river carved a new channel through a piece of Mexican farmland known as El Chamizal. One farmer's claim to his land became the international boundary dispute that would endure for almost a century. <br /> Eventually, the United States and Mexico established treaties to determine norms for managing a boundary along a shifting river. They created the International Boundary and Water Commission to maintain the boundary moving forward. However, they still could not resolve the original disagreement over sovereignty of El Chamizal. That question would remain unanswered until the 1960s. </p>",

Chamizal National Memorial occupies another 55 acres of what was formerly the northern part of Cordova Island.

Implementing the treaty involved carving a new river channel and transferring three parcels of land to opposite sides of the boundary marked by the relocated river channel. For those unfamiliar with the area before these changes, it can be challenging to imagine where they are on today's landscape. Let's identify some landmarks that help to visualize the parcels of land involved in the treaty.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{8ba02e66-b57f-4efe-8dfb-12f74c8811fa}{59}\" paraid=\"1922389354\">El Chamizal: The Disputed Land</h2> <p paraeid=\"{8ba02e66-b57f-4efe-8dfb-12f74c8811fa}{59}\" paraid=\"1922389354\">This land, which had belonged to Mexico but was transferred to the north side of the river, is generally located south of downtown El Paso. With the treaty, the new river channel was shifted to the north, returning a long, somewhat triangular area of land south of the border. The point of the triangle is just west of the Paso del Norte international bridge, and it widens to about three fouths of a mile wide on its eastern end. The parcel is southwest of Chamizal National Memorial. If you are standing on the trail at this vantage point and look at the mountains in the distance to the right of our comfort station (building in the picnic area), your gaze passes over the top of the disputed Chamizal land. In other words, the Memorial is not situated on the disputed land. That parcel was returned to Mexico. So what land was used to commemorate this diplomatic achievement?</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{8ba02e66-b57f-4efe-8dfb-12f74c8811fa}{59}\" paraid=\"1922389354\">Cordova Island</h2> <p paraeid=\"{8ba02e66-b57f-4efe-8dfb-12f74c8811fa}{59}\" paraid=\"1922389354\">In the late 1900s, the Rio Grande had formed a large bend around this location. Its channel suddenly turned from an easterly direction to flow about a mile north, making a rough horseshoe bend and back to the south before continuing on its course to the Gulf of Mexico. When this bend in the river would flood, water would back up into El Paso and Ciudad Juárez causing extensive damage. By 1900, the two countries worked together to cut off this bend in the river by creating a straight channel through its narrow base. The river ran straighter almost a mile to the south, but it left an \"island\" of Mexican land on its north bank. This area became known as Cordova Island. While the island was not disputed land, the Chamizal Treaty proposed to carve the new river channel straight through the middle of Cordova Island instead of attempting to wind around it as the river had done before. Mexico would give the part of the island remaining on the north side of the river to the United States. Chamizal National Memorial was built on part of that land. Mexico also built a Chamizal commemorative park on the southern half of Cordova Island, which remained in its possession. The straightened river channel eased concerns of flooding, but it also meant that another parcel of land needed to be transferred to Mexico to compensate for the northern part of Cordova Island coming to the United States.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{8ba02e66-b57f-4efe-8dfb-12f74c8811fa}{59}\" paraid=\"1922389354\">Cordova Gardens</h2> <p paraeid=\"{8ba02e66-b57f-4efe-8dfb-12f74c8811fa}{59}\" paraid=\"1922389354\">From where you are standing, try to locate the \"Mega Bandera\", a monumental Mexican flag visible from these park grounds. You can spot the tall flagpole even when this enormous flag is not flying. It is a useful landmark to visualize the location of a former US neighborhood called Cordova Gardens. The neighborhood was east of Cordova Island and was transferred to Mexico to make up for the acreage of Cordova Island transferred to the United States. The Mega Bandera marks the western side of the former Cordova Gardens, and the large, red X-shaped structure marks its eastern side.</p>",

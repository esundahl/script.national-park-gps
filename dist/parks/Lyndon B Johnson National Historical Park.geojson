A hundred years later, their grandson, President Lyndon B. Johnson, would help fund the purchase of this property by the National Park Foundation in 1972. The few original structures still present at that time were restored to their historic 19th-century appearance.<br /> <br /> Sam Johnson Sr., his brother Tom, and three of their nephews ran cattle from this settlement after the Civil War during the boom years for the cattle industry until the Johnsons dissolved their business in 1871.<br /> <br /> The Johnson brothers sold the land to their nephew James Polk Johnson. In 1879 at a spring barbecue, the settlers in the area voted for James's property on the Pedernales River to be the site of the new town, which was named in his honor as Johnson City. In 1882, some of the land known as the original Johnson Ranch was sold to the Bruckner family, who resided there for nearly a century.</p>",

Access to the Johnsons' home and the LBJ Ranch was originally a low-water crossing a short distance downriver. The crossing gave visitors a dramatic entry into Lyndon Johnson's world.<br /> <br /> Constructed in 1951, the dam and crossing were the first improvements Lyndon Johnson made to the ranch after purchasing the property. He knew that water was the key to running a successful ranching operation, but in the Hill Country, water was not dependable. Often there was not enough water and at other times there was too much—sometimes all at once! To remedy this, Marcus Burg, a local contractor from Stonewall, was hired to stretch a nine-foot-high wall of concrete across the Pedernales River. The resulting lake supplied water to irrigate pastures for Johnson's Hereford cattle while also holding some of the water in times of flood. An added benefit was the creation of a swimming hole for the family.</p>",

But the land deceived. Only a thin layer of poor soil sustained this lush landscape.<br /> <br /> The virgin grasses that attracted the first settlers were the product not of one growing season—as was so back east—but of dozens. Once consumed by cattle and sheep, the grass regenerated slowly. Crops of cotton and corn thrived in the first years, but by 1890 per-acre yields had dropped by as much as two-thirds. Prosperity gave way to a toilsome struggle for survival.<br /> <br /> Today, brush, cedars, and non-native grasses dominate a land where once mustang grapes, wild plums, persimmons, and agarita bushes grew. Pecans now stand beside the native cypress. Terraces and fence lines crisscross the landscape. The imprint of human use is everywhere.</p>",

Johann \"Casper\" Danz, his wife Elisabeth, and their baby Frederick were among them.<br /> <br /> Tragedy struck the Danz family many times. Soon after they arrived in Gillespie County, Elisabeth and her son died from an epidemic. Casper's second bride, Johannette Margarethe Knaup-Flick, died during childbirth.<br /> <br /> In 1857, Danz married his third wife, Johanne Dorothea Bock. This time the family flourished with eleven children. In 1860, the couple purchased this land and built a two-room (dogtrot) cabin. One room served as both a bedroom and living space, and the other room was a kitchen. Fireplaces provided heat for warmth and cooking. Outdoor stairways leading to the sleeping lofts saved much needed space indoors.<br /> <br /> The smaller cabin nearby was moved here from a local community in 1974 to provide space for living history demonstrations and storage. This building sits atop a stone cellar that is believed to be the foundation of an earlier cabin built by Danz.<br /> <br /> Descendants of the immigrant Danz family lived here until 1966, when the land became a state park.</p>",

As a teenager he served in the Civil War and then moved to Blanco county to join his uncles Tom and Sam Ealy Johnson in their cattle droving business. For a time it was the largest cattle operation in Blanco and surrounding six counties, but the partnership was eventually dissolved in 1871, and James bought out his uncles' land holdings.<br /> <br /> By 1879 local settlers desired to establish a town in the area. At a Fourth of July celebration on Town Creek they selected James Polk Johnson's land for the site of the new community. Unfortunately, James's dream of making Johnson City the seat of Blanco County was not realized until 1890, six years after his death. Little did he know that the town that bears his name would someday also be known as the hometown of his cousin and 36th president of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson.</p> <h3>James Polk Johnson's Legacy</h3> <p>James Polk Johnson became successful in his own right.

However, the family's architect, Roy White, felt that the barn complemented the landscape as well as the house, and family friends also pleaded for its preservation. In the end, the barn was saved and rehabilitated.<br /> <br /> Before construction of the Klein Shop in 1967 and before ranching operations were moved northwest of the airstrip, the barn had adjacent corrals. Four pens, a chute alley and a grass patch could work up to 60 cattle at a time. By the mid-1960s, the cattle operation had grown as had the function of the Texas White House. Increased activity of White House Communications and the US Secret Service-as well as Mrs. Johnson's displeasure with the livestock smell and noise—prompted the move to the current Show Barn.<br /> <br /> Today, the historic Martin Barn contains exhibits on the famous LBJ Ranch barbecues held down in the live oak grove along the river.</p>",

When Lyndon Johnson was growing up, Johnson City had no electricity, a common occurrence at that time in most rural areas around the United States. People relied on kerosene lanterns for lighting, and on windmills, horses, and the occasional gasoline motor for other jobs that were too difficult to be performed by hand.<br /> <br /> In 1935, President Franklin Roosevelt created the Rural Electrification Administration, which encouraged rural areas to develop electrical grids by providing low-cost loans and other aid. The process was difficult, and there were significant challenges such as minimum population density requirements that needed to be overcome.<br /> <br /> Newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937, Lyndon Johnson immediately began lobbying the Roosevelt administration to waive the population density requirement. Meanwhile, local representatives across five Texas counties, sought support from area ranchers and residents, and in May 1938, the Pedernales Electric Cooperative was established. Later that year, Congressman Johnson was able to secure federal funds, and construction began on the infrastructure that would eventually bring electricity and the modern era to the Texas Hill Country.</p>",

The dirt yard was home to various farm animals such as a mule, a milking cow or goat, a pig, and chickens.

The reconstructed birthplace is similar in size and style to the dogtrot house that Sam Ealy Johnson Sr., the president's grandfather, built in 1889, but because the Johnsons intended to use it as a guesthouse, a modern kitchen and bathroom, running water, and electricity were added.<br /> <br /> President and Mrs. Johnson then furnished the house with many objects to which they had a deep sentimental attachment, either because they had belonged to family or were gifts from special friends.<br /> <br /> The Lyndon B. Johnson Birthplace-Cottage has the distinction of being the nation's only presidential birthplace to be reconstructed, refurnished, and interpreted by an incumbent chief executive.</p> <h3>What is a Dogtrot?</h3> <p>Stand in the open hallway of the Reconstructed Birthplace. Do you feel something? Imagine living through a hot, humid southern summer in a home before the benefit of air-conditioning. To provide shade and a cooling breeze, a covered porch area was built to separate the two main areas of the house. This is the dogtrot. By opening doors and windows, a homeowner could draw a breeze from the dogtrot throughout the house. Pets also enjoyed the cool shade, thus resulting in the name dogtrot.</p>",

While Sam ran the family's cattle business, Eliza attended by hand to virtually every detail of running the ranch. She hauled water, spun wool, made clothes, cooked meals, and tended the animals. Self-sufficiency was a must; the nearest store was in Blanco, a day's ride away.<br /> <br /> The Johnson cabin is typical of the \"dogtrot\" cabins that were once common in Texas. The shaded breezeway—through which a dog could easily trot—provided storage space and much-needed relief during the hill country's blistering summers.

After amassing a fortune, they lost it, and eventually resettled here along the Pedernales, where, Eliza Johnson remembered, \"the tempo of life was slower.\" Sam lived here until his death in 1915.

Here, costumed interpreters carry out the day-to-day activities of a turn-of-the-century Texas-German farm family. Some chores are seasonal, such as canning and butchering. Farm animals, however, must be cared for on a daily basis, including activities like feeding, milking, gathering eggs and slopping the hogs. Also, the house is cleaned, meals are cooked, butter is churned and cheese is made. Visitors may see the \"family\" scrubbing the floors with homemade lye soap, or plowing the garden with a team of horses.<br /> <br /> The setting for the present-day living history activities is an authentic Hill Country farm. Johann and Christine Sauer, along with their four children, settled this land in 1869. Their family prospered and grew and, by 1885, several stone buildings were built near the original rock and log cabins. Eventually, the Sauers had 10 children. One of those, Augusta Sauer Lindig, served as midwife at the birth of President Johnson.<br /> <br /> The Beckmann family acquired the property in 1900. A good cotton crop in 1915 allowed Emil and Emma Beckmann to build a new barn, to add a frame room onto the old rock structure, and to construct porches connecting to a lovely Victorian house covered with fashionable pressed tin. In 1966, Edna Beckmann Hightower sold the site to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Archeological surveying and restoration work was undertaken and the farm opened to the public in 1975. Since then, time has stood still and the farm remains forever a small piece of Texas as it was at the beginning of the 20th century. Park visitors can experience the farm at their leisure and groups can make arrangements for tours.</p>",

The registered Herefords on the ranch today are descendants of the animals owned by President Johnson. The show barn was the center of the ranching operation, where equipment was stored and the ranch's five or six employees reported to work.

A small fire is set in the bucket, and a lid (one with holes in it) is placed on the bucket. The fire is left to smolder. The meat is typically smoked overnight.

Johnson National Historical Park is located in central Texas about 50 miles west of Austin in the Texas Hill Country. The park protects the birthplace, home, ranch, and final resting place of Lyndon B. Johnson, 36th President of the United States.<br /> <br /> In November 1963 President Kennedy was assasinated in Dallas, Texas. This occurred as civil rights legislation began to take shape in Congress. President Lyndon Johnson addressed Congress five days after Kennedy's assassination, urging them to pass the bill. Johnson was famous for his tactics in getting legislation passed even as a member of Congress himself (he served in both the House and the Senate), before serving in the White House, and he used these skills to pressure Congress into passing what would eventualy become the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<br /> <br /> The Voting Rights Acts was a result of two things: 1. The elimination of the voting rights provision in the original Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 2. The Selma to Montgomery March in March 1965, which was a peaceful 54-mile march in an effort to register black voters in the South.

Often associated only with wildflowers, Lady Bird Johnson emphasized that \"beautification\" meant much more. It meant clean water, clean air, clean roadsides, and preservation of landmarks, parks, and wilderness areas.<br /> <br /> Her commitment to the natural world resulted in a national awareness not seen prior to her time as first lady, and it served as a catalyst for the modern environmental movement.

The schools were located close enough to children's homes to allow to them to walk to school. There were 31 one-room schools located in Gillespie County.<br /> <br /> The Junction School was a typical one-room school. A wood stove sat in a sand box in the center of the school and was the only source of heat. Two kerosene lamps suspended from the ceiling at opposite ends of the room provided light. The teacher's desk and a chair were in front of the classroom. A small brass bell on the teacher's desk summoned the students. Students sat at double desks which had wooden tops with holes for the glass inkwells. The desks were arranged in rows facing the teacher's desk; the boys in one row and the girls in another.<br /> <br /> The Junction School opened on November 21, 1910 and served the area for 37 years. In the spring of 1947 the school became part of the Stonewall Consolidated School District. With this move, the Junction School closed and its students attended the nearby Stonewall School.

The Johnsons added an office in 1958 when he was senate majority leader. In 1962, the dining room and kitchen were both extended to create additional space for entertaining when he was vice president. Additional bedrooms and bathrooms were created and remodeled to house invited guests including world leaders such as the President of Mexico, West German Chancellor, and Israeli Prime Minister.

The majority of cattle shipped off the ranch were from the Johnson's beef herd—some of which he would simply purchase, clean up, and resell at a profit.

The elegant structure you see today was constructed in 1928. A fine example of the Gothic Revival style of architecture, the church features lovely arched window and door openings, a Gothic steeple, and its original pressed-metal siding. Worship services were conducted in the German language until 1950.<br /> <br /> Although President Johnson was a member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and Lady Bird Johnson was Episcopalian, they would frequently attend services at Trinity Lutheran while at home on the LBJ Ranch.<br /> <br /> The church grounds also became the site for one of the first Head Start Schools in the nation.

Finished around 1959, it was initially constructed to protect then Senator Johnson's private plane from the elements. The spacious hangar faced the taxiway and had a wide carport in the back. In between the hangar and carport, two small quarters were built to house staff. Early on, the hangar was used for hay storage at one point, but during Johnson's presidency, it was a gathering place for community and political events as well as for official press conferences. The hangar was even used as a movie theater for the Johnson family and their friends. Today, it has been repurposed as the LBJ Ranch District visitor center, complete with exhibits, park film, and bookstore.</p> <h4>The Many Functions of the Hangar</h4> <p>Hay was not the only thing that has been stored in the hangar. Zoom into this December 29, 1963 photo. Underneath the wings of the aircraft is a stack of lumber. In this photo, President Johnson takes Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ( <strong>front passenger seat</strong> ) and others for a spin in the golf cart. Jack Valenti ( <strong>pictured in the dark jacket directly behind Johnson</strong> ) follows on foot.<br /> <br /> Protecting aircraft from the elements was the primary purpose for the hangar. In this 1965 photo, President Johnson has a conversation underneath the open hangar door. Today the hangar door has been opened permanently to allow a wall of glass windows to be added, thus giving visitors a panoramic view of the ranch from inside. Step inside the hangar and underneath the open door; look up and through a glass ceiling to see the hangar door.<br /> <br /> The hangar, with it's size and open space, made an ideal location for press conferences during President Johnson's time in office. Joining the president for this September 1967 press conference are Lynda Bird Johnson and her fiancé Captain Charles Robb ( <strong>far right</strong> ).<br /> <br /> Parties and dinners were often held in the hangar as well. On November 6, 1968, a dinner for military support personnel and their families was held. President Johnson spoke to the approximately 300 in attendance with his grandson, Patrick Lyndon Nugent, by his side. Notice the wall paneling, ceiling tiles, and lights which can still be seen in the hangar today.</p>",

Its many blades allowed for the windmill to hold up to the pressure of strong winds and still generate enough torque to pump water from the well during periods of low winds. The well water then flowed by gravity through a pipe to the wooden water trough inside the cooler house. Wind was an important resource that the settlers harnessed. Cooperation with nature was an integral part of life. <h4>Water Tank</h4> <br /> The water tank is an essential part of the pumping process. It stores water above the height of where it will be used, and then is gravity-fed into water troughs and buildings. No electric or mechanical energy source is required for this part of the process. <h4>Cooler House</h4> <br /> The original cooler house was built in the 1880s by N.T. Stubbs, a cousin by marriage to President Lyndon B. Johnson. The cooler house provided cold storage for perishable food and dairy products. It was constructed out of native limestone with walls 18 inches thick. Inside, shelves were built along the thick stone walls for storage of crocks filled with wild dewberries, hog plums, and garden vegetables such as onions, peas, beans, and tomatoes. Cans of milk and churns filled with cream for making butter were kept cool in the wooden water trough. Eggs, preserved in salt, and cabbage, stored in barrels for making sauerkraut, were kept on the cool, moist sand floor, while potatoes and other root vegetables were stored in a large box, layered with sand to keep them dry. <p> </p>",

        "notes": "Withers and Spauldings General Store\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/withers-and-spauldings-general-store.htm\n\n<p>In the early 20th century, general stores were an important fixture in small, rural towns such as Johnson City. Not only did they provide \"store-bought goods,\" but they served as social centers and community message centers. Shoppers who entered would be met by long counters, rounded glass showcases, and side walls lined with shelves, drawers, and bins holding all manner of items for sale. Imagine the Johnsons and their neighbors coming to the store to purchase such necessities as flour, tools, lanterns, fabric, or shoes. Lucky children with a little spending money could select penny candies from glass jars. The shop keeper would cut, grind, or weigh merchandise that required it, wrap the purchases with brown paper and string from a roll at the end of the counter, and ring the total up on the cash register. The waiting customers could catch up on the latest local news or peruse the notices posted on the store wall.<br /> <br /> W.E. \"Bud\" Withers and Warren and E.D. Spauldings operated the general store in Johnson City as a partnership from April 1909 until December 1915 when Withers bought out the Spauldings. He continued to run the business as <strong>W.E. Withers</strong> until 1925, first in the original frame building and then in the stone building which currently houses the Johnson City Bank.<br /> <br /> The historic Withers & Spauldings General Store now serves as an exhibit area and information center for Johnson City. Visitors can learn about Johnson City shopping and dining options as well as additional attractions in the surrounding Hill Country community.<br /> <br /> Staffed by Johnson City Chamber of Commerce members, the property is part of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park and is managed by the National Park Service.</p>",

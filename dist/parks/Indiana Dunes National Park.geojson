        "notes": "Bailly Homestead\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/bailly-homestead.htm\n\n<p>The Bailly Homestead, a National Historic Landmark, was the home of Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein (1774 - 1835). Bailly played a role in the development of the Calumet Region of northern Indiana. He was an independent trader in the extensive fur-trading network that spread from Montreal to Louisiana, and ultimately to Europe. Joseph Bailly was one of the earliest settlers in northern Indiana. In 1822 Bailly set up his fur trading post at the crossroads of several important trails, including the Tolleston Beach and northern branch of the Sauk Trail. He provided a meeting place for Native Americans and Euro-Americans. Except for White Pigeon, Michigan, Bailly's trading post was the only stopping place for travelers and missionaries between Chicago and Detroit. The Bailly Homestead complex is the last remaining site of its nature in the Calumet Region, both in its capacity as a fur trading post and in its vernacular architectural features and construction types. The Bailly Homestead was authorized as a National Historic Landmark in 1962.<br /> <br /> Bailly acquired formal title to the Homestead and the surrounding tracts of land, totaling over 2,000 acres, in the 1830's when the Calumet Region was officially opened to Euro-American settlement. At his death title passed to his family. The Homestead proper was left to his wife and segments of the acreage to each of his children.<span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p> <figure> <p alt=\"Baily brick house\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/learn/historyculture/images/1980-Bailly2Story.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Baily brick house\"> </p> </figure> <p>In 1843, after the death of Bailly's daughter Esther, management of the Homestead was assumed by Francis Howe, the husband of daughter Rose Bailly. Under Howe's management, the Homestead was again influential in the development of the area, as Howe sold timber from the land to be used in the construction of the nearby railroad. Upon Howe's death in 1850, Joel Wicker, husband to another Bailly daughterHortense, assumed management of the Homestead. It was under Wicker's management that the area surrounding the Homestead was settled. In an effort to continue providing timber to the expanding railroad, Wicker recruited Swedish immigrants, then living in Chicago, to move to the area and operate the sawmill. Not only did the Swedes cut timber and operate the sawmill, they purchased land from the Bailly-Howe family and settled farms, bringing Swedish culture to Northwest Indiana. Several log cabins, possibly dating to the 1860's and probably of Swedish origin, are located on nearby farms that were once part of the Bailly Homestead.<br /> <br /> The Homestead brings together an unusual combination of vernacular architecture with the imposing main house, featuring late 19th century architectural detail, the rustic log and brick structures, and the unusual family cemetery.</p> <p>(Paraphrased excerpts from the National Register Nomination, 1972, and the Bailly Homestead Historic Structures Report, Denver Service Center, National Park Service, November 1972.)</p>",

Hike through a forest dominated by maple, beech, basswood and oak trees. Follow a stretch of the Little Calumet River, once a critical transportation route for early regional travelers and explore the enchanting Mnoké Prairie for a glimmer of the vast stretches of pre-settlement grasslands. Explore the historic Bailly Homestead and Chellberg Farm.<br /> <br /> This featured hike combines sections from several trails into a perimeter loop hike. Start the hike at the Bailly / Chellberg parking lot and head north on the Bailly Homestead / Chellberg Farm Trail. Just before the Chellberg farm buildings is a trail junction. Proceed straight (north) onto the Little Calumet River / Mnoké Prairie Trail. The Little Calumet Trail will wind through a small scenic ravine that has some sections of stairs. After a third of a mile, stay left at the junction with the Bailly Cemetery Trail. Note that a 0.6 mile round trip out and back extension can be added by hiking up to the Bailly Cemetery and back.<br /> <br /> Shortly after the cemetery trail is a junction with a connector trail. Stay to the right. Next up, the trail will join the paved Porter Brickyard Trail. Follow the paved trail to the left until the hiking trail veers right off the paved trail. Take the hiking path. Cross Howe Road and follow the trail through mature forests. At roughly the 1.3 mile mark from the parking lot, stay right at an unmarked trail junction. The trail will make its way down to the Little Calumet River. Just before the river, avoid a closed trail by staying right. After crossing the boardwalk and bridge, the trail will open up into the Mnoké Prairie. After nearly a mile in the prairie, the trail pass by a closed trail on the left and end up in an alternate parking lot. Walk down the entrance road, pick up Howe Road north long enough to cross back over the river and up the driveway of the Bailly Homestead. Lastly, hike north through the homestead and pick up the trail to the northeast back to the parking lot.<br /> <br /> <em>Trail Features: River Crossings, Historic Homes, Birding, Fall Colors, Wildflowers and Wildlife</em><br /> <em>Must See Gems: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/learn/historyculture/bailly_homestead.htm\">Bailly Homestead</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/learn/historyculture/chellberg.htm\">Chellberg Farm</a>, Mnoké Prairie, Bridge over the Little Calumet River</em></p> <h3>Area History & Background</h3> <p>The Bailly Homestead, declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962, was the home of Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein (1774 - 1835) who was one of the earliest settlers of northern Indiana.

The Bailly Homestead complex is the last remaining site of its nature in the Calumet Region.<br /> <br /> In the 1870s, Swedish immigrants Anders and Johanna \"Kjellberg\" bought 80 acres to establish a modest family farm. They were the first of three generations of the Chellberg family to make their living here. In the 1930s, the Chellbergs started to tap the many maple trees on their property for the production of maple syrup.<br /> <br /> The annual Maple Sugar Time event, which takes place the first two weekends in March, features the evolution of \"maple sugaring\" in northwest Indiana. A relatively short hike will interest people of all ages as they travel through time observing various methods of making maple syrup. Park rangers and volunteers demonstrate a range from an early American Indian method to the pioneer method of boiling sap in open iron kettles to a more modern commercial method of producing syrup. The Indiana Dunes National Park is the only national park that makes maple syrup.</p> <h3>Visitor Activities</h3> <ul> <li>Hike to the Bailly Cemetery</li> <li>Explore the Bailly Homestead</li> <li>Stroll over to the Chellberg Farm</li> <li>Bike the Porter Brickyard Trail</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Fun Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Only national park that makes maple syrup</li> <li>Homestead of the first non-native Northwest Indiana resident</li> </ul> <hr /> <h4>Getting There</h4> <br /> <strong>Trailhead Parking Lot</strong><br /> North of U.S. Highway 20 on Mineral Springs Road, Porter, IN 46304<br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead GPS Coordinates</strong><br /> 41.624679, -87.089502 (Decimal Degrees) <hr /> <h4>Need to Know</h4> <strong>Hours & Information</strong> <ul> <li>Hours – Open daily from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm.</li> <li>Hike Length – Outer Loop: 3.4 miles, Bailly/Chellberg Inner Loop: 1.1 miles.</li> <li>Hike Time – 45 minutes to 2.5 hours.</li> <li>Difficulty – Easy to moderate with some changes in elevation and sets of stairs.</li> <li>Trail Surface – Packed soil with wood chips in places; several sets of stairs.

The ground breaking ceremony for the building took place in 1959 and opened on November 13, 1960 as the Presbyterian Church of the Dunes [An interesting side note is that the church had owned and held services in the Old North Church building in Beverly Shores (from the 1933 Chicago World's Fair) from 1938 until 1960]. The last service in the building was held on August 30, 1970 and the National Park Service purchased the land and building shortly afterwards. The building became the park's headquarters and visitor center in 1971. The headquarters moved out of the building to the abondoned Nike missle base on Mineral Springs Road in 1977. The visitor center stayed in the building until November 15, 2006, when the current <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/idnlvc.htm\">Indiana Dunes Visitor Center</a> on State Road 49 was opened.

Developer Robert Bartlett brought a dozen buildings from the fair including five from the Homes and Industrial Arts housing exhibit that make up the Century of Progress Historic District. The buildings were moved by barge and truck to Beverly Shores, a resort community he was developing on the Indiana shore of Lake Michigan.</span></p> Four of the five houses looked wildly modern in 1933, so ahead of their time that they remain modern looking today. The Cypress House, honoring its material, looks like a rustic log cabin, albeit with modern amenities. To save the structures, Indiana Landmarks leased them from the National Park Service, then subleased four to people who have restored them in exchange for long-term leases.<br /> <br /> Four of the houses were brought to the dunes by barge in 1935 by real estate developer Robert Bartlett. The Cypress Log Cabin was dismantled at the fair and moved by truck. Bartlett hoped that the high profile houses would entice buyers to his new resort community of Beverly Shores. Today the houses are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the houses have been leased by the non-profit organization Indiana Landmarks. Through this organization, private individuals or families have leased the homes and are rehabilitating them. Please respect these agreements by not trespassing on the properties.",

As you take a virtual tour of the Chellberg farmhouse, let your imagination guide you. Imagine rising before the sun to begin the farm chores. Imagine coming in after a hard day's work to the welcoming aroma of a home-cooked dinner and lively Swedish conversation. Imagine living without the modern conveniences of electricity and indoor plumbing.</p> <p>The Chellberg Farm represents a typical 1890 through 1910 Swedish and Northwestern Indiana farmstead. The brick farmhouse was built in 1885 as a replacement for an earlier wood-framed house that was destroyed by fire in December of 1884. The bricks for the new house came from a brickyard in nearby Porter. In the 1980s the National Park Service restored the farmhouse to its turn of the 20th century appearance, except for the dining room, which had been modified by the Chellbergs in the 1920s.</p> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"black & white family picture with 3 adult children standing behind parents\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/learn/historyculture/images/familyphoto.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"black & white family picture with 3 adult children standing behind parents\" /></figure> <strong>The Chellberg Family</strong> <p>Let's begin our tour by learning about the Chellberg family. Anders and Johanna Chellberg, with their young son Charles, made the long journey from Sweden to this country in 1863. Traveling first by boat and then by train, the Chellbergs arrived here four months after their departure from Sweden. After their arrival in northwest Indiana, the Chellbergs became part of a growing Swedish community. They often gave other immigrants a place to stay and helped them find work. In 1869, the Chellbergs purchased 40 acres of land and established their own farm. 40 additional acres had been added to the farm by 1874.</p> <p>Anders and Johanna had four children. After Ander's death in 1893, their son Charles managed the farm. Charles and his wife, Ottomina, had four children: Frank, who died when he was a year old, Ruth, Naomi, and Carl. When Charles died in 1937, his son Carl continued to farm until 1972, when he sold the property to the National Park Service. Let's continue our tour by looking at where the Chellbergs lived.</p>",

This location, where Dr. Henry Cowles conducted much of his early work in plant ecology and succession in the early 1900s, remains an important focus for scientific study today.<br /> <br /> Explore several distinct habitats along this 4.7-mile trail including ponds, marshes, swamps, black oak savannas and beaches. Steep sand dunes near Lake Michigan can make this a strenuous journey. Many visitors pack a lunch to enjoy at the shoreline while resting for the return trip (don't forget to \"pack out\" your trash). Make sure to bring plenty of water, sun protection, and extra clothing layers as the the weather at the lake can be very different than at the parking lot.<br /> <br /> This featured hike is a lollipop shaped trail and a classic of the Indiana dunes. Starting from the north parking lot, hike out back to Mineral Springs Road on the gravel entrance road and pick up the trail across the street. The trail heads along the edge of a wetland with abundant plant and wildlife diversity. At roughly the one-mile mark, you will reach the loop trail junction. The preferred direction around the loop is counter-clockwise. Take the trail to the right. The trail will now run through black oak savanna and between interdunal ponds filled with aquatic life.<br /> <br /> At roughly the 1.5 mile mark, stay to the right at the junction with the cut-off trail. As you near Lake Michigan, you have to climb up and then down the steep final dune. The reward is sweeping views of Lake Michigan and a beach to yourself. Pack a lunch and stay awhile.<br /> <br /> For the return, travel 0.2 miles to the west on the beach and look for the trail and signs to head back over the dune.

This location, where Dr. Henry Cowles conducted much of his early work in plant ecology and succession in the early 1900s, remains an important focus for scientific study today.<br /> <br /> Explore several distinct habitats along this 4.7-mile trail including ponds, marshes, swamps, black oak savannas and beaches. Steep sand dunes near Lake Michigan can make this a strenuous journey. Many visitors pack a lunch to enjoy at the shoreline while resting for the return trip (don't forget to \"pack out\" your trash). Make sure to bring plenty of water, sun protection, and extra clothing layers as the the weather at the lake can be very different than at the parking lot.<br /> <br /> This featured hike is a lollipop shaped trail and a classic of the Indiana dunes. Starting from the north parking lot, hike out back to Mineral Springs Road on the gravel entrance road and pick up the trail across the street. The trail heads along the edge of a wetland with abundant plant and wildlife diversity. At roughly the one-mile mark, you will reach the loop trail junction. The preferred direction around the loop is counter-clockwise. Take the trail to the right. The trail will now run through black oak savanna and between interdunal ponds filled with aquatic life.<br /> <br /> At roughly the 1.5 mile mark, stay to the right at the junction with the cut-off trail. As you near Lake Michigan, you have to climb up and then down the steep final dune. The reward is sweeping views of Lake Michigan and a beach to yourself. Pack a lunch and stay awhile.<br /> <br /> For the return, travel 0.2 miles to the west on the beach and look for the trail and signs to head back over the dune. Stay right at the cut-off trail junction, left at the Greenbelt trail south parking lot connector and right at the loop trail junction. The trail will now take you back out to the north parking lot.<br /> <br /> For a slightly shorter and easier journey, take the cut-off trail.

The different habitats you'll see along the trail help make Indiana Dunes National Park one of the top most biologically diverse of all the national parks.<br /> <br /> The featured hike is a lollipop shaped trail. From the parking lot trailhead, head south with a short tour through a foredune complex on sandy soil. It transitions into an oak savanna with a more stable soil structure, which provides better footing. At the junction with the loop trail, turn left to hike the loop in the clockwise direction. The loop starts on an old roadbed and you will need to turn right to leave the wide road onto single track. The trail will climb to the top of the dune offering sweeping views of the Great Marsh. Follow the trail along the ridge line before hiking down a steep section of loose sand. The trail will wind back to the loop junction. At the junction, turn left and follow the trail north to the parking lot.<br /> <br /> <em>Trail Features: Overlook, Birding, Fall Colors, Wildflowers and Wildlife<br /> Must See Gems: Great Marsh Overlook, Kemil Beach</em> <h4>History and Background</h4> Perhaps no other area in Indiana Dunes National Park will take you through as many diverse habitats in a short trail. Begin your habitat adventure by following the trail located in the southeast corner of the parking lot through the foredune habitat. Foredunes contain many pioneer plants such as marram and little bluestem grasses and cottonwood trees. These plants are specially adapted to live in the dunes where moving sand sometimes partially buries or uncovers plant stems and roots. Although those grasses may seem hearty, they may die when stepped upon. Able to withstand battering by sand and wind, grasses will eventually succumb to the shade of taller plants providing the necessary soil for the oak forest that lies ahead. <hr /> <h4>Getting There</h4> <br /> <strong>Dune Ridge Trailhead and Kemil Beach Parking Lot</strong><br /> North of U.S. Highway 12 on East State Park Road (300E), Beverly Shores, IN 46301.<br /> <em>Note</em>: East State Park Road is called Kemil Road to the south of U.S. Highway 12.<br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead GPS Coordinates</strong><br /> 41.677357, -87.008950 (Decimal Degrees) <hr /> <h4>Need to Know</h4> <strong>Hours & Information</strong> <ul> <li>Hours – Open daily from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm.</li> <li>Trail Length – 0.7 miles. 73 feet of elevation gain, 11% maximum grade.</li> <li>Hike Time – 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li> <li>Difficulty – Moderate with some steep slopes in loose sand.</li> <li>Trail Surface – Mixture of loose sand and packed dirt.</li> <li>Facilities – Year-round restrooms and potable water.</li> <li>Pets – Permitted on a leash (6' or shorter).</li> <li>Prohibited – Bicycles and motorized vehicles.</li> <li>Prohibited – Littering, hunting, and removing plants.</li> <li>Parking lot is paved and will fill up quickly on summer weekends.</li> <li>Visit the Kemil Beach page for information on swimming and other beach activities.</li> </ul> <strong>Safety</strong> <ul> <li>Please stay on the trail and respect closed area signs.

Instead, follow the loop trail back to the north and then east to the parking lot.<br /> <br /> The hike can be extended by adding the Calumet Dunes Paved Trail, Dunewood Trace Campground Trail and Glenwood Dunes Extension Trail for a total hike distance of nearly 15 miles. <h3>Dunewood Trace Campground Trail</h3> 4.4 miles, 30 feet of elevation gain, 0% average grade, 1% maximum grade<br /> Hike time: 2.5 hours<br /> <br /> This out and back trail connects the Calumet Dunes Paved Trail and Glenwood Dunes Trail to the national park's Dunewood Campground. Park at the Calumet Dunes parking lot as there is no non-camper parking at the campground. From the Calumet Dunes parking lot, walk around the main building to the left (south side) and follow the paved trail off to the right. The Dunewood Trace Campground Trail will break off to the left within a tenth of a mile. The trail is 4.4 miles round trip to the campground and back. As you get close to the campground, look for remnants of an old golf course.<br /> <br /> The trail surface is a mixture or packed dirt and loose sand. Please be careful as a section of the trail runs on county road 375E. There is no sidewalk or protected path. There are restrooms and potable water at the campground. Pets are allowed on a leash on this trail. <h3>Glenwood Dunes Extension Trail</h3> 2.6 miles, 26 feet of elevation gain, 1% average grade, 2% maximum grade<br /> Hike time: 2.5 hours<br /> <br /> This out and back trail connects with the Glenwood Dunes Trail with the South Shore Railroad's Dune Park station. There are no parking lots at either end of the trail. The nearest parking lot is the Glenwood Dunes lot located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 20 with Brummitt Road. Bring a trail map as the route has too many trail junctions and cut-offs to fully describe here. From the Glenwood Dunes parking lot, hike west until you reach the west end of the Glenwood Dunes trail. At the junction with the extension trail, begin the out and back hike. The trail will cross Tremont Road and ends at county road 50E. Turn around and follow the trail back to its junction with the Glenwood Dunes Trail.<br /> <br /> The trail surface is a mixture of packed dirt and loose sand. The round trip distance from the Glenwood Dunes Trail junction to the trail's western terminus and back is 2.6 miles. Pets on a leash are allowed on this trail, but not the Glenwood Dunes Trail. Horses are not allowed on this trail.<br /> <br /> <em>Trail Features: Fall Colors, Wildlife</em> <hr /> <h4>Getting There</h4> <strong>Trailhead Parking Lot</strong><br /> Glenwood Dunes Lot (main): 1475 North Brummitt Road, Chesterton, IN 46304<br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead GPS Coordinates</strong><br /> Main: 41.648245, -87.015382 (Decimal Degrees) <hr /> <h3>Need to Know</h3> <strong>Hours & Information</strong> <ul> <li>Hours – Open daily from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm.</li> <li>Hke Length – Less than 1 mile to 6.8 miles, with extensions to over 15 miles.

The Hobart Woodland trail offers views of forest ravines and has an overlook of Lake George. The Oak Savannah rail trail runs through the Hobart Prairie Grove and is a great place for biking, pushing a stroller or just hiking to relax and improve your health.<br /> <br /> The Hobart Prairie Grove preserves several habitats including wetlands, prairie remnants, white oak flatlands, and a rare bur oak savanna. At about 300 acres in size, it contains 343 native plants and an abundance of wildlife. This area is also noteworthy because of a unique soil that is made up of at least 70 percent silt and clay with the smaller portions of sand. This type of soil is one of the reasons for the outstanding diversity of life here at Hobart Prairie Grove. This very special place was added to the National Park System as part of a 1992 expansion of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (renamed the Indiana Dunes National Park in 2019).<br /> <br /> The Indiana Dunes National Park owns two miles of the almost nine mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/oak-savannah.htm\">Oak Savannah</a> trail that extends from Hobart to the east and Griffith to the west.

The Hobart Woodland trail offers views of forest ravines and has an overlook of Lake George. The Oak Savannah rail trail runs through the Hobart Prairie Grove and is a great place for biking, pushing a stroller or just hiking to relax and improve your health.<br /> <br /> The Hobart Prairie Grove preserves several habitats including wetlands, prairie remnants, white oak flatlands, and a rare bur oak savanna. At about 300 acres in size, it contains 343 native plants and an abundance of wildlife. This area is also noteworthy because of a unique soil that is made up of at least 70 percent silt and clay with the smaller portions of sand. This type of soil is one of the reasons for the outstanding diversity of life here at Hobart Prairie Grove. This very special place was added to the National Park System as part of a 1992 expansion of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (renamed the Indiana Dunes National Park in 2019).<br /> <br /> The Indiana Dunes National Park owns two miles of the almost nine mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/oak-savannah.htm\">Oak Savannah</a> trail that extends from Hobart to the east and Griffith to the west. The trail uses the corridor of the former Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railroad. In Hobart, the trail connects with the Prairie Duneland rail trail, which runs all the way to Chesterton and Porter.<br /> <br /> <em>Trail Features: Fall Colors, Views, Lake, River, Wildlife</em> <h3>Hobart Woodland Trail</h3> 2.2 miles, 40 feet of elevation gain, 1% average grade, 3% maximum grade<br /> Hike time: 1 hour<br /> <br /> This featured hike is an out and back trail.

Beach sand on the dune moves when the prevailing northwest wind exceeds 7 mph. The movement of Mount Baldy is made worse because there is no longer sand collecting at the water's edge to bolster the dune. Beach erosion is taking away more sand from Mount Baldy than the waves are bringing in due to the breakwall that was built for the Michigan City Harbor. To try and correct the effect of the breakwall, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began feeding the beach in 1974. <p> </p> <p>Thus far there have been four replenishments of sand to Mount Baldy:</p> <p>1974, fine sand trucked in.<br /> 1983, coarse sand trucked in.<br /> 1996, early summer, 35,000 cubic yards of sand slurried in by pipe from the harbor.<br /> 1996, late summer, 50,000 cubic yards of sand trucked in.</p> <hr /> <h4>Getting There</h4> <strong>Trailhead Parking Lot</strong><br /> 101 Rice Street (U.S. Highway 12), Michigan City, IN 46360 <p> </p> <p><strong>Trailhead GPS Coordinates</strong><br /> 41.706852, -86.929907 (Decimal Degrees)</p> <hr /> <h4>Need to Know</h4> <strong>Hours & Information</strong> <ul> <li>Hours – Open daily from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm.</li> <li>Hike Length – 0.75 miles.</li> <li>Hike Time – 1 hour.</li> <li>Difficulty – Moderate to rugged with the approach to the beach being very steep loose sand.</li> <li>Trail Surface – Packed dirt with sections of loose sand.

Douglas Trail through Miller Woods</h3> 3.4 miles, 46 feet of elevation gain, 1% average grade, 4% maximum grade<br /> Hike time: 2 hours<br /> <br /> The Paul H. Douglas Trail in Miller Woods winds through several habitats including wetlands, globally rare black oak savanna, open dunes and beach. The views of the lake and the dunes are incredible. The oak savanna's native grasses and wildflowers, including lupine, thrive in the sunlight and open forest floor. Please stay single file on the narrow trail to protect yourself from the abundant poison ivy along the trail edges as well as the fragile lupine habitat.<br /> <br /> This featured hike is essentially an out and back trail. Starting from the Paul H. Douglas Center, take the trail north or counter-clockwise around the wetland complex. Look for wildlife including beavers. The trail will run west along the top of the wetland. At the trail junction, take a right and follow the trail to the north. The trail from this point is an out and back to the beach. The trail features beautiful scenery with small interdunal ponds nestled among oak savanna covered dunes teeming with wildflowers in the spring and summer.<br /> <br /> Once you cross the bridge over the Grand Calumet River, the landscape changes dramatically into a world of towering sand dunes. The trail winds around and through the dunes all the way the shore of Lake Michigan. After enjoying the lake, follow the trail back to the junction at the wetland complex. Follow the trail to the right along the wetland back to the Paul H. Douglas Center.<br /> <br /> The trail surface is mostly sand with some sections of packed soil, gravel or boardwalk. The hike will take longer than you think due the loose footing of walking in the sand. The trail starts in relative shade but ends in the full sun. Please bring plenty of water, sun protection and dress in layers. The weather on the beach can be dramatically colder or hotter than in the woods.<br /> <br /> <em>Trail Features: Birding, Fall Colors, Lake, River, Swimming, Views, Wildflowers, Wildlife</em><br /> <em>Must See Gems: Dunes and Lake Michigan</em> <h4>History and Background</h4> The Paul H.

The club, spearheaded by conservationist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jens-jensen.htm\">Jens Jensen</a> and renowned ecologist Henry Cowles; formaulated the first concerted push to preserve the Indiana Dunes.<br /> <br /> Mather was appointed special assistant to the Secretary of the Interior, Franklin K. Lane, in 1915 and focused on establishing an office to manage the National Parks. His vigorous efforts to build public and political support for the parks helped persuade Congress to create the National Park Service (NPS) in 1916.<br /> <br /> In October of 1916, Mather conducted hearings in Chicago on a proposed \"Sand Dunes National Park.\" Although Mather's call for a national park along Indiana's coast had strong local support, conservation efforts for the Dunes came to a stand-still when the United States entered World War 1. Additional barriers included finding means to appropriate funds to purchase the Dunes from private holdings, along with Mather's absence for health reasons.<br /> <br /> Appointed the first director of the NPS in May 1917, he continued to promote park access, development, and use, and contributed generously to the parks from his personal fortune. Mather turned to his good friend Richard Lieber, head of Indiana's state parks to take the lead in saving the Dunes. <br /> <br /> Following Mather's death in 1930, a series of bronze memorial plaques were created to commemorate him and the sites he was involved in conserving. Plaques dedicated to Mather have been placed in national parks throughout the country, concluding with the inscription:<br /> <br /> \"He laid the foundation of the National Park Service, defining and establishing the policies under which its areas shall be developed and conserved, unimpaired for future generations. There will never come an end to the good he has done . . .\"<br /> <br /> This memorial plaque is located along the righthand stairwell down to the beach from the Lake View picnic area. This plaque was originally showcased at Indiana Dunes State Park when first recieved in 1932. After the establishment of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in 1966, the plaque was transferred to the National Park Service. The plaque was installed at Lake View in 1989.",

Together these dune ridges provide a glimpse into the changing shoreline of Lake Michigan. Tolleston Dunes has varied habitats ranging from globally rare black oak savanna to wetlands and plants such as prickly pear cactus, butterfly weed, and the wild blue lupine flower (Lupinus perennis) which grows in abundance. Another plant with a large population is the eastern prickly pear cactus (Opuntia humifusa).<br /> <br /> This featured hike is a lollipop shaped trail. Starting at the parking lot trailhead, the trail starts out in what was once a sand mining operation. This is why the parking lot and surrounding area are so flat. After roughly a third of a mile, the trail enters the rolling ancient sand dunes of Lake Michigan. The footing is generally good with some sections of sand. At the loop trail junction, follow the trail to the right. The trail wind will up and down through oak savanna and wetland habitats.<br /> <br /> Shortly after the boardwalk (roughly the one-mile mark), you will reach the cut-off trail junction. Staying to the right will take you on the outer loop (2.9 miles total distance). Taking the left trail will cut 0.8 miles off the hike (total hike distance of 2.1 miles). The recommended route is the outer loop. At the two-mile mark, stay to the right at the cut-off trail junction. Finally, at the loop trail junction, stay right again and hike back to the parking lot.<br /> <br /> <em>Trail Features: Fall Colors, Wildflowers, Wildlife</em> <h4> </h4> <h4><strong>History and Background</strong></h4> The Tolleston Dunes parking lot is the site of former sand mining activities from before the park was created. <hr /> <h4>Getting There</h4> <strong>Trailhead Parking Lots</strong><br /> <em>Main Lot</em>: 5800 U.S. Highway 12 (Dunes Highway), Ogden Dunes, IN 46368<br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead GPS Coordinates</strong><br /> <em>Main</em>: 41.615056, -87.192889 (Decimal Degrees) <hr /> <h4>Need to Know</h4> <strong>Hours & Information</strong> <ul> <li>Hours – Open daily from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm.</li> <li>Hike Length – 2.9 miles.</li> <li>Hike Time – 2 hours.</li> <li>Difficulty – Moderate with consistent changes in elevation.</li> <li>Trail Surface – Sand with some sections of packed soil, gravel, and boardwalk.

The Upland Trail highlights a rich beech and maple forest growing on top of a glacial moraine formed about 15,000 years ago. The Bog Trail leads to a bog in a depression in the moraine created when a large piece of ice broke off the melting glacier. The bog features an incredible habitat with unique plants.<br /> <br /> This featured hike is a lollipop shaped trail. Starting at the parking lot trailhead, take the trail east to the junction with the loop trail. The preferred direction is clockwise or to the left. The trail winds through mature beech and maple forest as you hike over the undulating moraine topology. There is a nice view of the bog near the south end of the loop. Upon returning to the loop junction, turn left and follow the trail back to the parking lot.<br /> <br /> <em>Trail Features: Bog, Unique Plants, Wildflowers, Wildlife<br /> Must See Gems: Pinhook Bog</em><br /> <br /> <strong>History and Background</strong><br /> Bogs like Pinhook are relics of our glacial past. Trapped in the pulverized clay and rock left behind by a melting glacier, the bog began as a kettle lake. Cut off from ground water, Pinhook's water gradually became acidic. Sphagnum moss, tolerant of acidic waters, formed floating mats that eventually supported carnivorous plants like pitcher plants and sundew, orchids like pink lady's slipper and ferns. Over time, blueberry and holly shrubs colonized this unique acidic bog, eventually giving way to larger trees like tamarack and red maple. Pinhook Bog is on the National Natural Landmark list. <hr /> <h4>Getting There</h4> <strong>Trailhead Parking Lot</strong><br /> 946 North Wozniak Road, LaPorte, IN 46360<br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead GPS Coordinates</strong><br /> 41.621214, -86.850227 (Decimal Degrees) <hr /> <h4>Need to Know</h4> <br /> <strong>Hours & Information</strong> <ul> <li>Hours – The Upland Trail and parking lot are open daily from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>The Bog Trail has Restricted Access</strong></span>.

The trails are varied and encompass many habitats. There are great views from the top of the Dune Succession Trail stairs, a beautiful pinery of jack pines, birding opportunities along Long Lake and secluded sections of forest. After hiking, relax and swim at the beach.<br /> <br /> For a virtual hike along Loop-1, check out our <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Dune Succession Trail StoryMap</a>.</p> <h3>3-Loop Trail</h3> 3.4 miles, 223 feet of elevation gain, 2% average grade, 20% maximum grade<br /> Hike time: 2.5 hours<br /> <br /> This loop hike combines sections of the three trails at West Beach. The hike starts with the Dune Succession Trail (Loop 1), which highlights the four stages of dune development. From the parking lot, head north to the bathing house to pick up the trail. This part of the trail is only ~0.6 miles long, but includes a strenuous climb up 270 stairs for a spectacular view of Lake Michigan and Chicago. Along the way you will pass through a beautiful pinery of jack pine trees. These are some of most southern jack pines in the world and are a result of Lake Michigan and the work of glaciers transporting seeds. Support the restoration effort in the fragile dunes and ponds by remaining on designated trails.<br /> <br /> The hike then picks up the West Beach Trail (Loop 2) for an easy hike through an area that was sand mined in the 1920s. The footing is mainly loose sand. This area is being restored as an oak savanna and is a great place to see prickly pear cactus. Birders will enjoy looking for water birds on Long Lake from the viewing platform.<br /> <br /> The final section of the hike is the Long Lake Loop Trail (Loop 3). This section is moderate in difficulty. The trail follows along Long Lake and then heads into the dunes. There is a great view of Long Lake after the initial climb. After crossing the entrance road, the trail winds through the undulating dunes and then has a steep descent into the picnic area and back to the parking lot.<br /> <br /> The trail surface varies from loose sand to packed dirt and sections of stairs and boardwalks. The hike will take longer than you think due the loose footing of walking in the sand. The trail starts in relative shade but ends in the full sun. Please bring plenty of water, sun protection and dress in layers. The weather on the beach can be dramatically colder or hotter than in the woods. <hr /> <h3>Dunes Succession Trail</h3> 0.9 mile, 81 feet of elevation gain, 3% average grade, 15% maximum grade<br /> Hike time: 45 minutes<br /> <br /> The Dune Succession Trail (Loop 1) highlights the four stages of dune development within its one-mile length. From the parking lot, follow the road north, toward the lake and look for the trail to pick up to the west of the bathhouse. This scenic, but strenuous, trail includes a climb up 270 stairs for a spectacular view of Lake Michigan and Chicago. Support the restoration effort in the fragile dunes and ponds by remaining on designated trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>History & Background</strong><br /> The flat areas at West Beach are the result of sand mining that took place in the 1920's.

The two-story building featured a mechanical elevator to lift carriages to the second story for storage and bring another down to use. Models included 1-2 seat \"piano box\" carriages and covered 4-seat \"buckboard\" carriages. Automobiles were later stored here as well. The south wing included stalls where prized horses were kept and cared for.<br /> <br /> Today, the National Park Service uses the Carriage House as a maintenance facility. Visitors to Cumberland Island can marvel at the size of the building and get a glimpse into how the Carnegie family got around Georgia's largest barrier island.

As you walk the island today, you are joining a long tradition of those who have visited and come to appreciate the natural beauty and abundance of Cumberland Island. Some chose to call the island home.<br /> <br /> Sometime around 1000 years ago, Eastern Timucuan people, calling themselves Mocama, arrived on Cumberland Island and lived off the island’s abundance, eating shellfish, game, and edible plants. They called the island Mocama, which is the Timucuan word for “ocean.” Although there are few traces remaining, you are currently standing near the site of a Timucuan village called Tacatacaru. By the late 1580s, the Spanish arrived on the island to missionize Mocama, building a Franciscan mission near Tacatacaru and naming the island San Pedro. La Mision del San Pedro flourished for almost 100 years.<br /> <br /> Although the Spanish saw themselves as bringing Christianity and European civilization to the New World, the Timucuans probably saw things slightly differently, with the Spanish serving as military allies against other tribes as well as providing many goods previously unavailable. No archeological traces of the Spanish era have been found, although written accounts tell us much about life on San Pedro.</p>",

As a result, today’s live oak trees are primarily second growth.<br /> <br /> The early 1700s was an uncertain time on Cumberland Island, with both Spain and England claiming ownership of this strategic location. In 1733 James Edward Oglethorpe established the colony of Georgia on the south bank of the Savannah River. In 1736, acting against orders, Oglethorpe pushed Georgia’s boundary all the way south to the Saint Marys River. Cumberland Island, known then as the “Highlands” but quickly renamed Cumberland, became a strategic outpost against Spanish encroachment in Georgia. By 1740, a group of Scottish Highlanders had built two forts for Oglethorpe, Fort St Andrews and Fort Prince William, one on each end of the island. They lived in a small garrison settlement on the north end known as Barriemacke outside of Fort St Andrews. In 1743, when the English decisively defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Bloody Marsh on St Simons Island, Oglethorpe no longer had need of his Cumberland Island fortifications and abandoned the island. Some of his men chose to remain behind, making Cumberland Island home</p>",

By the late 1700s, slavery had become an important aspect of life on Cumberland Island. Enslaved people were seen as essential for the cultivation of rice and sea island cotton, and as the island’s trees were cleared the number of people who were enslaved grew. Slavery was not legal in Georgia until 1751, so the late 1700s saw an influx of enslaved people to Georgia directly from Africa. The Gullah-Geechee culture that resulted in enslaved communities on Georgia’s coast was a result of the retention of many aspects of African culture and language.<br /> <br /> The isolated nature of Georgia’s barrier islands also resulted in distinctive slave management practices. Cumberland Island’s enslaved people worked largely on a task system, which meant that they were responsible to complete a certain task rather than work certain hours.  Enslaved families maintained their own gardens and livestock and hunted and fished to provide food for themselves. An archeological dig in this area has yielded a glimpse into their lifestyle. Along with pieces of iron skillets, glass, clay pipe segments and pottery, bones from small mammals, birds, turtles, frogs and fish were uncovered.<br /> <br /> During the Civil War, most of the island’s enslaved people left the island with Union troops, who occupied the island by the spring of 1862, compelling most property owners to flee. A few of the enslaved remained behind, and some freed peoples returned after the war. Those returning lived off the land as subsistence farmers in the following decades. Many African Americans moved to the Settlement on the island’s north end when land became available for purchase in the early 1890s. By this time, work was more plentiful. Settlement residents made a living in a variety of capacities: as employees for Hotel Cumberland, servants for wealthy island residents, and working for various timber operations.</p>",

These ruins are but one of numerous visual reminders of the Carnegie era here on Cumberland Island, but the Carnegie Dungeness represents only one layer of this area’s rich history. In 1783 Revolutionary War Hero Nathanael Greene obtained half of Cumberland Island and began cutting and selling live oaks. Although he died in 1786, his widow Catherine Littlefield Greene and her second husband Phineas Miller moved to Cumberland around 1800 and built a four story, 68-foot-tall tabby mansion that they called Dungeness and which stood in the same location as this Dungeness. The Greene-Miller Dungeness burned in 1866 and stood in ruins for fifteen years, acting as a tourist attraction and inspiring tentative plans for a hotel.<br /> <br /> In 1881, however, Thomas Carnegie purchased the property, tore down the Greene-Miller Dungeness ruins and built his own house in its place. The Carnegie Dungeness had 37,000 square feet and is estimated to have cost $200,000 to build. Abandoned in 1924, it burned in 1959, rumored to have been set on fire by poachers. </p> <h4>The War of 1812 at Dungeness</h4> <p>The war of 1812 officially ended in December of 1814 with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, but it took a few months for word to make it across the Atlantic. As a result, the war continued to be fought in North America. This had particular significance on Cumberland Island, which was occupied in January of 1815 by British Rear Admiral George Cockburn and his troops. Cockburn offered freedom and passage to the British Caribbean to any enslaved persons in the area who made it to Cumberland Island. In this way, around 1500 slaves gained their freedom in the opening months of 1815. By March, Cockburn had received word that the war was over and departed the island. During his stay on the island, Cockburn occupied the first two floors of Dungeness Mansion, forcing the Greene-Millers upstairs.</p>",

Although this is the only building still standing from the Greene-Miller era, the landscape that surrounds you bears many similarities to its early nineteenth century counterpart.<br /> <br /> Separated from high society only by geography, both Catharine Greene-Miller and Lucy Carnegie entertained extensively at their Dungeness estates. The carefully manicured landscape provided areas for strolling, games and exercise. Exotic palms, gray olive trees, magnolias, acacia, orange and china trees found in Caty’s gardens were reclaimed by Lucy providing guests in each time frame a beautiful respite from the harsh lines of city landscapes.

He was responsible to order supplies, hire and pay employees, and oversee the building of some of the other structures on the island. Page died in 1922, after which Carnegie daughter Florence used it as her residence until her passing in 1962. <br /> <br /> Florence’s death dissolved the trust Lucy Carnegie had created in her will which kept the island property intact until all children agreed to sell or until the last child passed away. Purchase of property by developers pushed family members to consider their options to protect the island from development. Plum Orchard and 12 acres surrounding it were donated by the Johnston families to the National Park Foundation who then conveyed it to the National Park Service. Other properties were sold to the National Park Service for the formation of Cumberland Island National Seashore. In exchange for the Plum Orchard property, these families were given the Grange under a 40 year retained rights agreement. During this time, this was considered private property. This agreement ended in 2010 and the property is now public land.</p>",

There are two main routes to get to the beach from this point. One route is to follow the sandy road directly to the beach. The road is about half a mile long. It consists of soft sand and can be hilly in parts and flooded during certain times of the year. This route is not recommended during the hot summer months, for those with mobility issues, or those using strollers or beach wheelchairs.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{5729dede-21cd-400c-b30a-8e205247b7d5}{198}\" paraid=\"1183689624\">The recommended route is to follow a series of trails and boardwalks that begin at the Greene-Miller Cemetery. On the far side of the cemetery, a shaded trail follows the edge of the salt marsh. This path leads to a boardwalk that extends over the marsh, providing a view of the Beach Creek marsh area.  Wading shorebirds frequent these tidal areas, and manatees often surface to feed on the cord grasses in the summer. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5729dede-21cd-400c-b30a-8e205247b7d5}{220}\" paraid=\"30214394\">The path surface later changes to a sandy dune field. The trail turns slightly left and visitors will have to trudge up a small dune field. Extra attention should be paid to the signage along the trail. Please stay on the trail in this sensitive area. This dune crossing is not recommended in summer because of the exposure, soft sand, and hot sand temperature. The shaded path to Sea Camp Beach is a great alternative for those wishing to go to the beach.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{3b7c3ef0-77b8-4ebd-aad8-44d11de2be40}{27}\" paraid=\"2100136430\">After the first dune crossing, a second boardwalk traverses the inter-dune meadow ecosystem. From here, you can reconnect with the vehicle road, or follow a footpath through the dunes to the beach. Please note the sand sifts often in this area and the footpath may not be readily visible and may have developed steep berms. Follow the wooden posts with arrows to the beach. The beach crossing is marked with a black and white striped pole. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3b7c3ef0-77b8-4ebd-aad8-44d11de2be40}{51}\" paraid=\"556280771\">Once on the Dungeness beach, you are more than halfway around the southend loop. Visitors may find it easier to hike the beach north a mile to the dune crossing at Sea Camp Beach. A black and white striped pole on the beach indicates the dune crossing to the interior of the island. </p>",

It takes its name from Catherine Greene-Miller, widow of Revolutionary War hero General Nathaniel Greene. She later remarried tutor and plantation manager, Phineas Miller, and oversaw the construction of a stately house named Dungeness. Catherine and Phineas depended upon nearly 200 enslaved laborers to produce sea island cotton. Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee, Robert E. Lee's father, died while visiting the plantation estate and was buried in the cemetery before his remains were moved to Virginia. When Thomas and Lucy Carnegie began purchasing property on Cumberland Island in the early 1880s, they constructed their Dungeness mansion on the same grounds as the previous mansion. They employed a large workforce, including housekeeper and poultry manager, Catherine Rikart. Her burial in the cemetery is evidence of her importance to the Carnegie family and their dynamic estate.<br /> <br /> Visitors today have the opportunity to delve into the island's storied past. The Greene-Miller Cemetery is a great place to do that. Located in the Dungeness Historic District, a visit to the ruins isn't complete without taking in the Greene-Miller Cemetery and the view of the salt marsh to the south.<br />  ",

The Ice house was constructed like a giant cooler, with a thick layer of straw and saw dust insulation.

Washed and rinsed fabrics were rolled through the mangle using a hand crank. This helped squeeze out much of the water for fast drying as well as flattened out any wrinkles in the fabric. Cranking the handle was hard work, and it took at least two people to operate the mangle. There is a screw on the top of the machine that allow the rollers to be adjusted to accommodate the thickness of the fabric.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{982d8311-5518-4262-8ef8-c04dd57127f8}{5}\" paraid=\"1480306525\">Currently the Laundry House is used as a restroom facility. Bathrooms and treated drinking water are available inside.

Cord grasses thrive on this western side of the island and provide many ecological benefits. Manatees can be seen feeding on the these grasses during high tide in the summer. Wading shorebirds probe the mud flats at low tide in search of small fish. Fiddler crabs in the hundreds scurry about- feeding, courting, and defending their territories.<br /> <br /> Include the marsh boardwalk if hiking the South End Loop. There are places visitors should avoid when temperatures are soaring. The beach crossing at Dungeness traverses is one of them. A dune field begins as you step off the marsh boardwalk going toward the beach. The soft sand here can be 150 degrees in the summer. There is no tree cover. <strong>We do not recommend this dune crossing in the summer.</strong><br /> <br /> Instead, access the beach from Sea Camp. When in the Dungeness Historic District, hike the main road or River Trail north, through the shaded maritime forest. Hike the path past the Sea Camp Campground, over the dune boardwalk out to the beach. This is a much more shaded option and one where you do not have to hike through soft, hot sand.",

This mansion was originally built for George Lauder Carnegie and his new wife Margaret Thaw. Construction of the mansion began in 1898 and several additions to the house were made through 1906. The architectural firm of Peabody & Stearns was employed to design the original home, built in a Georgian Revival style. The house served as the couple's primary winter residence until George passed away in 1921. Soon after his death, his younger sister Nancy moved in after her marriage to the island doctor, Dr. Marius Johnston, in 1924. Many of the original furnishing from Plum Orchard were auctioned off by Margaret after her husband’s death. Nancy did move many furniture items to Plum Orchard from Dungeness, saving these pieces from the eventual fire that consumed that house in 1959.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{44f7b343-3fa9-4826-87e8-0f846957e576}{217}\" paraid=\"1681181883\">Visitors can take a free tour of the 22,000 square foot mansion.

Here you would find family members and guests enjoying a swim in the heated pool, relaxing in the steam room, or playing billiards or a game of squash on the indoor court. An apartment in the southeast wing of the building housed second-eldest son of Thomas and Lucy Carnegie, Frank. It was outfitted with a parlor, bedroom, guestroom, and bathroom. <br /> <br /> Only the chimney and part of the foundation stand today. Time and harsh weather conditions have taken their toll on the structure. Visitors to the Dungeness Historic District should stop by the Recreation Building to learn of a time and place where recreation abounded, much like today on the island.<br /> <br /> Please do not climb on historic ruins for your safety and to help preserve them.",

When facing post number one, look east and slightly south. The Pine tree towers into the canopy above Red Bay and shrubs. Vines climb the trunk of the tree. The pine trees found on Cumberland Island in Timucuan times would have been much larger than any found here today.<br /> These large trees were harvested to make canoe-like vessels called pirogues. Timucuans did not carve these trees into canoes but used the power of fire to hollow out a cavity. Embers would be set on the log to char the top of the log. The charred wood was scooped out with shell tools and the burning continued until the log was hollowed out to make a canoe. Wet clay was applied to the areas that should not be burned. The completed vessels moved swiftly, and a large pirogue could carry 15-20 men.",

It can be seen the length of the River Trail as well as throughout the island’s maritime forest ecosystem. Neither Spanish nor moss, this plant is more closely related to the pineapples and other Bromeliads than any type of moss. This is an epiphyte which is a plant that collects moisture and nutrients from the air.  It is not a parasite and generally does not damage branches unless it gets too dense and heavy. Many animals such as insects, bats, birds, lizards, and snakes rely on Spanish moss for shelter. Timucuan women collected the moss, smoked it over a fire or boiled it to get rid of the insects then wove it together to make a skirt or a sash. Spanish moss was used through the mid-1900s for stuffing pillows and mattresses instead of wool because moths are not drawn to it. Today it is used mostly for floral arrangements.  <br /> <br /> This is the last station on the River trail.<br /> As you travel around the rest of the island, imagine only relying on the resources around you for survival. There are many hidden uses of the plants found on Cumberland Island that were utilized by Native Americans. The more we learn about the many uses of plants, the more we can reconnect with the natural world. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the rest of your day on Cumberland Island!",

Please do not pick the leaves in the park. The red bay produces round, single seeded, dark blue and purple berries in October. Many red bays have large areas of brown leaves. This is the result of an invasive beetle, the ambrosia beetle, that has introduced a fungal disease to the red bays called laurel wilt. The beetle and disease were first documented in 2002.

The saw palmetto gets its common name from little teeth along the leaf stem. These serrations help to protect the plant from predation. The plants typically grow in a horizontal fashion, with the main stem partially buried underground. This helps protect the plant from fire. Fibers gathered from along the stem could be woven into cloth as well as rope. Berries the size of grapes are found in clusters that ripen in late summer and contain high levels of sugar and oil. These berries could be dried for storage then later reconstituted by cooking or soaking in hot water. The taste, however, was said to resemble “rotten cheese steeped in tobacco” by early Europeans. The berries are used to create a medicine that helps with prostate problems and is a multi-million-dollar industry in Florida today.",

While there are several varieties of grape on Cumberland Island, muscadine is the most common. The vines seek the sunlight at the top of the forest canopy, often twining around the oak limbs and making the grapes hard to reach. Grapes ripen in July and August and were gathered for food and the vine tendrils were often nibbled as a refreshing snack. Raccoon and turkey are often seen munching on the purple fruit.

The live oak is the dominant tree in the maritime forest. Its dark green leaves are present throughout winter until the new leaves appear in the spring. The outstretched branches form a dense canopy. Thick, waxy leaves protect the tree from excessive salt spray. Prior to use, they were soaked in water to remove the bitter tannins. The nuts were then dried and ground into a meal for bread. These same acorns also attracted wildlife such as deer, squirrel, and turkey which made for easy hunting. In the late 1700’s, live oaks were sought-after for building ships. It is estimated that by 1802, 80% of the live oak trees were harvested from Cumberland Island. The strong, dense wood of live oaks resisted rot and even cannon balls, hence the nickname of the U.S.S. constitution, ‘Old Iron Sides’. The curved, twisted growth of live oaks made them desirable for ship building.  ",

The spikes are not actually thorns but are termed prickles. Prickles are projections of the plant’s skin, while thorns are modified branches. These prickles help protect the plant from predation. Smilax grows well in a variety of habitats, such as dunes or under the canopy of the Maritime forest.  Young new growth and tendrils from the vine were nibbled as a fresh green. Smilax grows a large tuber that allows the plant to sprout back quickly after a fire or other disturbance.

The northern trailhead of the River Trail can be found here as well. There is a self-pay station for visitors to pay the $10 park entrance fee. </p> <p paraeid=\"{73c34401-1259-4114-9543-2a22d4ca2e71}{11}\" paraid=\"393790275\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{73c34401-1259-4114-9543-2a22d4ca2e71}{13}\" paraid=\"1211903485\">Dock Rules: </p> <ul role=\"list\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-leveltext=\"\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{73c34401-1259-4114-9543-2a22d4ca2e71}{17}\" paraid=\"1108362613\">Private boaters are subject to the National Park Entrance Fee. </p> </li> </ul> <ul role=\"list\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-leveltext=\"\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{73c34401-1259-4114-9543-2a22d4ca2e71}{24}\" paraid=\"1483618321\"> Boat length is limited to 25 feet. </p> </li> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-leveltext=\"\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{73c34401-1259-4114-9543-2a22d4ca2e71}{31}\" paraid=\"1078560380\"> All areas painted in yellow are restricted. </p> </li> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-leveltext=\"\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{73c34401-1259-4114-9543-2a22d4ca2e71}{38}\" paraid=\"169294756\"> Docking is on a first come-first served basis. </p> </li> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-leveltext=\"\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{73c34401-1259-4114-9543-2a22d4ca2e71}{45}\" paraid=\"1515678259\"> All boats must leave the dock at sunset and anchor offshore at night. </p> </li> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"5\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-leveltext=\"\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{73c34401-1259-4114-9543-2a22d4ca2e71}{52}\" paraid=\"2031602139\"> Non-permitted charter boats are not allowed to disembark passengers on the island.</p> </li> </ul>",

It is made of tabby- a mixture oyster shells, lime (produced from the burning of oyster shells), sand, and water. The Tabby House was constructed by the widow of General Nathaniel Greene, Catherine, and her second husband Phineas Miller. The Tabby House may have served as the family’s temporary housing while Dungeness was being constructed before becoming the gardener's house. Later, the Carnegie family remodeled the structure to serve as the business office for the property. Such a space was necessary to oversee the Carnegie estate's many employees. Located adjacent to the Dungeness ruins, visitors can walk the grounds of this historic building and others nearby. There is no public entry to the Tabby House except when a ranger is present to open the house for tours. ",

The Wheeler Street boat ramp is managed by the City of St. Marys and is located next to the Cumberland Island Visitor Center. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ebbc7d21-6084-4ec7-99b0-29e5ff05d5a9}{178}\" paraid=\"1794814809\">Make sure you check the weather and the tides before heading out. Conditions can change rapidly and what you are experiencing up river at the boat ramp may not be the same conditions on the sound. If you are not experienced with the local waterways, ask a ranger or local boater to learn what you may need to know. There is a large tidal range on our waters that can expose sandbars near low tide. If you are not navigating through the designated channel, this could lead to stranding of the boat.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ebbc7d21-6084-4ec7-99b0-29e5ff05d5a9}{192}\" paraid=\"456196597\">There are three docks on the island where you can tie up and access the island, Sea Camp, Dungeness, and Plum Orchard. Navigate back to read about these docks.  </p>",

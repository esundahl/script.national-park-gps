        "notes": "Augusta Kohrs Victorian Garden\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/augusta-kohrs-victorian-garden.htm\n\n“Augusta Kohrs had a lovely garden…she loved flowers and she loved to work on them…she always had fresh flowers on the dining room table.” – Helen P. Dietrick, guest of the Kohrs family.<br /> <br /> When Augusta Kohrs arrived at the ranch as a new bride in 1868, she brought with her the sense of a proper Victorian home. Feeling a need to impose a degree of order and elegance to separate her home and its surrounding landscape from the rugged Montana countryside, Augusta began making refinements to the landscape surrounding the main Ranch House. Victorian gardens were prominent at the turn of the 19<span style=\"font-size: 10.5px;\">th</span> century in the eastern and Midwestern parts of the United States, but they were far less common in the West, and especially on a rugged cattle ranch in Montana.<br /> <br /> Augusta had an affinity for arts and culture and her influences of formality and order are seen in the layout and design of the garden. The main features of the garden included large flower beds, cobble rock walls, stone terraces, and sand walkways that divide several raised flower beds. Above the garden a lilac hedge borders a small irrigation ditch and provides a beautiful backdrop for the garden when in bloom, while at the same time creates a divide between the large front lawn of the house and the smaller, more intimate space of the garden.<br /> <br /> In the summer gardening became Augusta’s focus and daily activity. She planted a variety of brightly colored and strong-smelling annuals, perennials, bulbs, roses, and native species. They were placed in geometric shapes that not only provided decoration, but also created a sense of order. She added two 16-foot wooden trellises in the middle of the garden so her favorite sweet peas could climb and grow. In 1890, the State Nursery was established in Helena with Conrad Kohrs as a major stockholder. Augusta would seasonally purchase large amounts of native and non-native plants from the nursery and bring them to the ranch. Over time the garden would become an interesting blend of traditional Victorian styled colors, patterns and fragrances that were combined with hardy native plants that could thrive and survive Montana’s harsh climate.<br /> <br /> Conrad Kohrs died in 1920, but Augusta would return to the ranch every Memorial Day to begin planting ornamentals for the upcoming summer. In 1934, her grandson, Conrad Warren made significant improvements that permitted Augusta to access her garden safely and conveniently. Warren constructed rustic style stone stairs and a wooden handrail that intersected the lilac hedge. Several juniper shrubs were planted to flank the steps which gave Augusta a more direct route down into her garden and reinforced the feeling of an entry point. Augusta would continue to visit the ranch during the summer months until her death in 1945. She remained active in the upkeep and planting of her garden well into her 80's.<br /> <br /> Today, the legacy of Augusta’s garden continues to endure. In the summer it serves as critical habitat for an array of pollinator species, that include bats, beetles’ butterflies, birds, and bees. Recent restoration and rehabilitation efforts by park staff including the ranch’s gardener have created a unique opportunity to not only preserve and interpret the garden, but also display the bright and fragrant flowers that were favored by Augusta.",

        "notes": "Beaverslide Hay Stacker\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/beaverslide-hay-stacker.htm\n\nThe hard winter of 1886-1887 resulted in the losses of up to 90% of cattle in some herds across the northern plains. After these devastating losses it became a necessity for ranchers to grow and set aside enough hay to feed their livestock. Conrad Kohrs and other successful Montana ranchers could afford to purchase plenty of land and control reliable sources of water but finding a way to store several tons of hay would be the final hurdle.<br /> <br /> In parts of the nation that receive ample precipitation and have high humidity levels hay needs to be cut, put onto a wagon, and then stored indoors to keep mold and mildew from ruining the year’s crop. This method can be costly and potentially dangerous. If the hay is too damp when stored, the heat generated by the decomposition can spontaneously combust, burn down the storage barn and endanger other buildings, livestock, and livelihoods. However, in the arid west, ranchers learned that the outside storage of large quantities of hay was possible. The drier climate along with the weight of the haystack pressing down onto itself, coupled with the outer crust of dry hay, would easily shed the moisture from rain and snow.<br /> <br /> In 1908, the “beaverslide hay stacker” was invented in the Big Hole Valley of Southwestern Montana. This structure consists of a 30-foot wooden frame that supports an inclined plane. Loads of hay are pulled to a height of around 20 feet before dropping through a large gap at the top. With a portable piece of equipment like the beaverslide, hay could be piled in the same fields where it was cut. Because the stacker was made with little more than wooden timbers and metal joiners, it could be easily, quickly, and cost-effectively repaired or replaced.   <br /> <br /> There are two main methods of storing hay on the ranch today: bailing and stacking. Most of the ranch’s hay is bailed, but when used for historic demonstrations the Grant-Kohrs Ranch beaverslide can create a 20 to 25-ton stack of hay. The large stack is then left in the field and is used to feed the cattle raised on the ranch throughout the long Montana winters.      <br /> <br /> The beaverslide is named for Beaverhead County and they remain in use on many Montana ranches today.",

By using poles, a notched log, ropes, chain, and a pulley system a carcass could be raised up and “dressed out” into various roasts, steaks, and other basic cuts. The meat was then stored in a room under the icehouse until the 1930’s, when a walk-in refrigerator was installed in the basement of the ranch house.<br /> <br /> It took a tremendous amount of patience, practice, and skill to properly butcher a cow. When Conrad Kohrs first arrived in Montana, he set up butcher shops in the territory’s early gold camps. In 1918, John Bielenberg sat on a nearby fence, took out a sharpened knife and directed a young Conrad Warren on how to properly clean, skin, and butcher a cow using this very hoist. Several years later, Conrad would fondly remember this valuable lesson that he had learned from his great-uncle on the ranch that day.  ",

        "notes": "Bunkhouse Bedroom\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/bunkhouse-bedroom.htm\n\nCowboys working on the ranch spent most of their down time relaxing in the bunkhouse. This small bedroom was set up in the middle of bunkhouse row so those hard-working cowboys could read a book or get a good night's sleep.<br /> <br /> The original structure that would eventually become the core of the bunkhouse row was built by Johnny Grant in the 1860’s. He constructed two separate log cabins and connected them both by a structure called a dog trot. The dog trot was covered with a roof, but it was open on both the north and south sides, which created an alley-like space between the two cabins. Conrad Kohrs and John Bielenberg added walls and enclosed the dog trot sometime between 1884 and 1890, which created the space that would become the bunk room.  <br /> <br /> There would have been enough bunks or cots for about five cowboys in this room. Their bedding varied from warm blankets and soft pillows to the same bedrolls that they used when sleeping outdoors.  Electricity was added to the bunkhouse in 1894, the same time as the main ranch house. There was a single light source in each room. Most cowboys didn’t have much space to themselves and typically didn’t own a lot of possessions. They had clothes, tools for work such as lariats, toiletries, books, magazines, and other personal items, such as letters or photographs. They would sometimes use wooden fruit and vegetable crates to store their belongings or serve as a small bedside table. <br /> <br /> Historic photographs of the ranch taken between 1902 and 1927, show that a doorway once led into the bunk room from the outside. This door was taken out when Conrad Kohrs Warren started remodeling the bunkhouse floors, roof, and walls sometime after 1927. After this remodel, the only access into the bunk room was through the door in the side door in the main sitting room. ",

This space was added to the bunkhouse row sometime between 1884 and 1890. Cowboys gathered around the table and ate their meals together. The oval shaped table was originally used in the main ranch house before it was moved to the bunkhouse after 1890. The cook had easy access into the room through an adjacent doorway that connected the kitchen and the dining room together.<br /> <br /> Hungry cowboys knew it was time for a meal when the cook loudly rang the dinner bell or hit the metal gong that hangs outside of the kitchen. John Bielenberg and Conrad Kohrs Warren would often join the cowboys for a meal here in the dining room, especially for breakfast. The time spent together around the table created a unique opportunity for the ranchers and the cowboys to get to know each other, go over projects and discuss the work that was needed on the ranch for the day.<br /> <br /> The rooms in the bunkhouse were occasionally reorganized to hold modern equipment or house extra cowboys when needed. An electric freezer was added to the dining room in the early 1950s due to the limited space in the kitchen and there is evidence from marks in the floorboards that a bunk bed was once placed in the dining room near the stove. ",

They all had diverse personalities and came from much different backgrounds. Some were originally from as far away as Germany and China. Two of Conrad Kohrs nephews, John, and William Gehrmann remembered going into the bunkhouse kitchen when they visited the ranch and enjoyed the pies that were cooked by Sam, one of the Chinese cooks who worked for the ranch.<br /> <br /> In 1932, Conrad Kohrs Warren, the grandson of Conrad Kohrs, became the manager of the ranch and renovated the entire bunkhouse row. During this remodel, some modern conveniences such as running water for the sink were added to the kitchen. Eventually a hot water tank was installed in the 1940s and in the early 1950s, an electric freezer was installed next door in the bunkhouse dining room to store food for the cook.<br /> <br /> A large, metal gong hangs just outside the front door of the kitchen. This functioned like a dinner bell, with the cook hitting the gong to let the cowboys and ranch hands know that a hot meal was ready. To the right of the front door is a small garden where the cook could grow herbs to use in his recipes. Chives were found growing there during restoration work by the National Park Service in the late 1970s.<br /> <br /> The meals that were prepared in the bunkhouse kitchen were hardy and filling. The items included sourdough biscuits, beef, beans, hotcake's, bacon and eggs for breakfast, and bannocks, a type of fried bread, along with the ever-present coffee which cowboys loved. Breakfast was ready for the cowboys and ranch hands after they looked to the horses and fed them first.",

It was originally larger, but the southern wall was moved to the east, which allowed more space to build the woodshed and storage area at the end of the structure.<br /> <br />  The exact use of the room when it was built is not documented. In an oral interview Conrad Kohrs Warren, the grandson of Conrad Kohrs, remembered that this area was once an old workshop with a work bench when Kohrs and John Bielenberg owned the ranch.  There is a door in the back of the room by the shower, and Warren said that the cowboys would use the room as a quick way to go from the front to the back of the bunkhouse building.  <br /> <br /> Warren did an extensive remodel on the entire bunkhouse row in 1932 and added running water to the adjacent kitchen. In the washroom Warren built a partition wall and put in a concrete floor with a drain and a shower head so the cowboys could take a shower on the ranch. It was a cold shower since the hot water tank was not installed in the building until 1947. The water pipes came from the kitchen next door.  Prior to the shower installation in this room, the cowboys had to go into town to bathe.  They typically bathed once a week in the summer and once a month in the winter. <br /> <br /> The use of the other sections of the room are not as well documented. There were some wash tubs in the room during the last years of the buildings use, so the cowboys might have scrubbed their clothes in the large tubs after running water was added to the structure. Historic photographs from between 1902 to 1927, show a visible wash tub just outside the bunk room, but it was gone by the mid-1930s.  The wash tubs could have been moved into the washroom following the addition of running water so cowboys could do their laundry inside the building and not have to stand outside to wash their clothes",

The interior of the building features a chicken roost for sleeping and nesting boxes for laying eggs. The smaller brooding coop is used to incubate young birds until they are large enough to be placed with the adults. The high fence keeps the chickens from wandering around the ranch and prevents predators such as coyotes from entering the yard.  However, the chickens must be “cooped up” each evening by park staff because some predators like foxes and bobcats can easily climb over the fence! <br /> <br /> Over the years a variety of chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese have been raised on site for both their eggs and meat. On special occasions such as Christmas dinner or a family celebration, the Kohrs family would serve roasted poultry with special cranberry or lingonberry sauces.<br /> <br /> Today, visitors will typically see Plymouth Rocks and Rhode Island Reds running around the yard, loudly clucking to each other, soaking up the warm sun, and digging lots of holes. ",

        "notes": "Dairy Barn\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/dairy-barn.htm\n\nDuring the early 1930’s many ranchers struggled to survive as beef prices dropped, brucellosis infections rose, and an extreme drought devastated most crops. In 1931, the United States Department of Agriculture declared the period as one of the worst ever for stock growers. During this time, Conrad Warren reported that his potato and wheat crops were a “complete failure,” however, he was able to grow just enough hay on the ranch to support his cattle herd through the winters.<br /> <br /> There were several factors that contributed to either the success or failure of a ranch during this devastating period of widespread depression, drought, disease, and forecloses. Those that survived carefully bought and sold livestock, improved their vegetation and water systems, selectively bred cattle, and found unique ways to supplement their income.<br /> <br /> In 1932, Conrad Warren wisely developed a small herd of Jersey dairy cattle and constructed this barn as a processing center to sell milk. A handwritten entry from his “cash journal” shows that on February 28, 1932, he sold “642 gallons of milk at 10 cents a gallon, to the Deer Lodge Creamery for a profit of $642.00.” Eventually the cattle market slowly improved by the late 1930’s, but by developing this facility, Warren was able to guarantee a monthly income for the ranch during this tough period. As a bonus, the rich milk was also used to supplement Warren’s prized registered Hereford bull calves.<br /> <br /> To meet sanitation requirements of the time for processing food, a 6-foot deep, concrete lined manure pit was built to the northwest of the dairy barn. Manure was hauled from the building across the road to the pit, where it was flushed out with running water and allowed to flow downhill to fertilize the pastures below. Even though most of this pit has been filled in over time, it is still used to clean out manure from the nearby draft horse barn. <br /> <br /> The outside of the dairy barn hasn’t changed much since it was constructed, but the inside has seen many changes over the years. The interior was modified in 1975 and served as a maintenance building when the National Park Service took over management of the site. Today, the dairy barn is used as an indoor classroom, a meeting space for special events, and is a good example of how to balance historic preservation with modern needs.<br /> <br /> In August of 2019, the dairy barn hosted a Senate field hearing of the Subcommittee on National Parks to discuss the economic benefits of national parks and how to expand visitation at “lesser known” parks across the country. During this meeting the chair of the subcommittee joked that “this might be the first time in modern history that a Senate hearing has taken place inside of a barn.”<br /> <br /> Although the interior of the building has changed since 1932, visitors can still walk inside the barn today and see the original concrete trough running down the center of the building that once held the stanchions for Warren’s dairy cattle.",

When Grant sold the ranch to Conrad Kohrs in 1866, this wagon was included in the purchase and its believed that it was used to carry the newly-wed Conrad and Augusta Kohrs, from Fort Benton to their new home here on the ranch.<br /> <br /> The Dougherty wagon was originally designed as a passenger wagon. They typically featured side doors, two or three rows of seats, and canvas or leather sides that could be rolled up with ease.  Another feature was that the seats could be folded down to create a flat surface or bed and were often converted into use as an ambulance, especially by the Army during the Civil War. Following the battle of the Big Hole (Big Hole National Battlefield) on the morning of August 9, 1877, this wagon was called into such service and was temporarily used as an ambulance to transport wounded soldiers from the battlefield to St. Joseph’s Hospital in Deer Lodge.<br /> <br /> These wagons were also constructed to travel long distances and were desirable for their comfort and safety when riding over rough terrain. The Kohrs family used this wagon for a seven-week tour of Yellowstone National Park in 1883.<br /> <br /> There are only a handful of Dougherty wagons known to exist, which makes this wagon a unique artifact of the National Park Service and the nation’s transportation history.",

At that time there were no refrigerators on the ranch and perishable food items such as meat and dairy products were kept from spoiling by being stored inside the basement below or inside of an ice filled cabinet located in the ranch house. <br /> <br /> There were originally no windows in this room and the door was made of thick boards. The log walls acted like a natural insulator to keep the ice cold. Most winters the nearby Johnson Creek was turned into a pond and large blocks of ice were removed by hand or horse-drawn saws. Each block of ice weighed a few hundred pounds and several tons were stored in here each winter. The large blocks were then covered and surrounded by sawdust, which acted as an insulator between each layer and row.<br /> <br /> Just like a modern insulated cooler today, the ice did melt, but very slowly.  The floor was covered with an iron plating that was slightly higher in the front than the back. This kept melted water from soaking into the wood underneath and allowed the water to run down to an opening in the back of the building.  The ice usually lasted through the summer heat until the late fall when freezing temperatures returned to area.<br /> <br /> In the 1930’s Conrad Warren installed refrigeration in the ranch house and this building was converted into a tack room to repair and store the harnesses and other equipment needed to connect the teams of horses to wagons, buggies, and ranch machinery.  Today visitors can view some of the ranch’s historic bridles, harnesses, saddles, driving lines, and other tools on display inside of this building.",

        "name": "Jenkins Hay Stacker",
        "notes": "Jenkins Hay Stacker\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/jenkins-hay-stacker.htm\n\nHistorically, ranchers had to manually build their large haystacks by using tools such as pitchforks and wagons. This took a great deal of hard work and manual power to stack enough hay to feed their livestock through the harsh winter. Over time more efficient ways to stack hay were developed, which used large machines with cables and pulleys to speed up the process.<br /> <br /> This Jenkins hay stacker was patented in 1906 and is an automatic swinging hay stacker, which rotates or pivots to move hay from one location to another and place it in a pile, or haystack. It only required one person and one horse to operate it instead of needing a team of men and horses. The cut hay was placed on the front of the stacker on the fork, which laid on the ground. The person operating the device would then set the pulleys and gears to “control” the movement of the stacker. Once everything was set, the operator guided the horse to pull on the cables. This caused the fork to rise and pivot to one side and dump the hay on to the stack and then return the fork back to the ground, where it was ready for more cut hay to be lifted. <br /> <br /> The cutting, stacking, and storing of hay became a critical task on western ranches by the turn of the century.  As grazing lands were fenced in to create pastures, livestock needed supplemental feed, especially in the winter months when heavy snows made access to grass more challenging. Just a single cow or single horse can consume 24-27 pounds of hay each day in the winter. While some ranchers in the Open Range Cattle Era were using hay to feed some livestock, the need to prepare and store enough hay for all livestock to survive through harsh winters proved to be a necessity, and not just an option, following the Hard Winter of 1886-1887.<br /> <br /> It is also crucial to build and shape the haystacks properly to protect the feed from storms and winter weather. While the outside layer of the hay is exposed to the elements, most of the snow and rain will gently roll off the top and trickle down the sides, which protects the inner layer of hay within the stack from mold and moisture. <br /> <br /> This Jenkins hay stacker is a conserved artifact at Grant-Kohrs Ranch and repair and restoration efforts were completed in July of 2004. The work done on the stacker included replacing rotten wooden beams, and rusted iron bolts. The entire hay stacker was also raised off the ground and placed on pedestals to slow down the weathering and decay process of its wooden base. <br />  ",

        "notes": "Johnson Creek Flume\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-johnson-creek-flume.htm\n\nThe earliest Montana ranchers found an abundance of wide-open land for grazing their cattle but finding a reliable source of water was much more difficult in the arid west. The necessity of needing an abundant water supply became even more apparent soon after the hard winter of 1886-87, as ranchers began irrigating hundreds of acres of land for hay production.<br /> <br /> The first irrigation system on the ranch was built by Johnny Grant in the early 1860’s. This system used water from the Clark Fork River and several smaller springs to provide enough water for his cattle and crops. In 1866, Conrad Kohrs purchase the property from Grant and soon began making improvements and expansions to the ranch’s irrigation system.<br /> <br /> To avoid conflicts, a new type of water usage right known as “first in time, first in right,” was established to regulate Montana’s most valuable commodity. Under this type of appropriation, the first person to claim a water source and put it to a “beneficial use” could control it.<br /> <br /> One of the earliest water rights on the ranch was established in 1885 and is associated with the Kohrs-Manning Ditch. This ditch carries water from the Clark Fork River and Cottonwood Creek. The ditch is privately owned, but the National Park Service has the right to use a share of the water for irrigation and livestock purposes in exchange for allowing the ditch to flow through the entire length of the ranch.<br /> <br /> This unique structure in front of you is an 84 x 10 x 3-foot wooden flume that carries the Kohrs-Manning Ditch water over the top of Johnson Creek, which is a natural occurring water way. Over the years this flume has undergone several repairs and replacements to ensure continuous operations. These types of flumes have been used on the ranch for well over a century. The first wooden flume on the ranch was built by Conrad Kohrs sometime around 1880 and diverted water from Johnson Creek near the Main Ranch House to irrigate the lawn, lilac bushes, and Augusta Kohrs Victorian Garden on the south side of the house.<br /> <br /> Today, the historic flood irrigating system of Grant-Kohrs Ranch is composed of several miles of earthen ditches, diversion dams, flumes, and culverts that follow the natural slope of the land. This allows gravity to direct thousands of gallons of life-giving water to plants and animals throughout approximately 782 acres of land throughout the ranch.",

They are one of the tallest and strongest breeds of draft horses, and average 17 hands, or roughly 68 inches height and can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds. They first arrived in the United States in the mid 1800’s and quickly became popular with farmers and ranchers for their tremendous power and ability to haul heavy equipment and loads over rough roads.<br /> <br /> While most of the day-to-day operations of the Kohrs-Bielenberg Ranch were oriented towards beef cattle, the breeding and selling of thoroughbred and draft horses became an integral part of their business.  Both Conrad Kohrs and John Bielenberg had previously worked with Clydesdales, but apparently felt that Shires could outperform them and began a new breeding program. In 1907, Kohrs imported Leeds Lion, who was a descendant of a well-known sire that was tough, smart, and hardworking to bring new stock into his herd of draft horses.<br /> <br /> In the 1930’s, Conrad Warren took over the family business and continued the tradition of breeding draft horses on the ranch. He never preferred Clydesdales or Shires though and purchased Belgian stallions. By 1936, Warren had the largest breeding herd in Montana, but the demand for hard working draft horses was quickly replaced by tractors and other",

Several different Native groups such as the Ql̓ispé (Kalispell/Pend d’Oreille,) Sqelixw (Salish,) Ktunaxa (Kootenai,) Nimiipuu (Nez Perce,) and Siksikaitsitapi (Blackfoot,) used the valley for multiple purposes.<br /> <br /> Most of these tribes subsisted on hunting, gathering, and followed their food sources throughout the changing seasons. In the Perce language the valley was known as the “place where you get cached food,” which referred to the abundance of deer in the area. Elk, antelope, and smaller mammals were also regularly hunted.  The Deer Lodge Valley was a crucial travel corridor to and from the traditional bison hunting ground to the east. Every part of the bison was used, and nothing was wasted. The animal provided enough food, shelter, tools, and clothing for everyone.<br /> <br />  The Clark Fork River and its smaller tributaries provided a reliable, year-round source of fish and other riparian species. A significant part of their diets was supplemented by gathering the various plants, roots and berries that grow throughout western Montana. Because of their migratory patterns following different food sources throughout the year Native peoples constructed portable shelters called lodges or tipi. They were either constructed against saplings or trees, or constructed of poles that were covered with mat, brush, bark, or animal skin. These structures generally served as a shelter for entire families.<br /> <br /> The area was also a well-established trade route for many of these Native tribes, which made the valley a perfect location for Johnny Grant to build his ranch and trading post. A drawing of the ranch house done in 1865 by Granville Stuart shows two Siksikaitsitapi present on the front lawn of the house. This suggests that the ranch may have served as an informal trading post and safe camping area for Native groups passing through.<br /> <br /> Today, the Deer Lodge Valley still maintains cultural importance with several tribes and appears often in their oral histories. The valley itself gets its name from the Anglicization of a Shoshone word meaning “the white-tailed deer’s lodge.” This refers to a tall, conically shaped mineral deposit and warm spring that is located 16 miles south of the park. The mound closely resembles a lodge or tipi and the rich salt deposits attract deer to the warm spring year-round.",

The shop was instrumental in the economic stability of the ranch throughout the nation’s economic depression and during wartime when it became vital to a rancher’s finances to be able to maintain and repair their own equipment.</p> <p>The building was originally divided into two spaces. The north end contained a garage area with three large overhead doors and housed automotive equipment. The south end was a multipurpose ranch repair shop and included a forge, blacksmith tools, line shaft, grindstones, acetylene welding setup, wood working equipment, and some accommodations for shoeing and branding livestock.</p> <p>There were no professionally trained blacksmiths or carpenters working inside the shop. The work was done by cowboys and ranch hands who were not formally trained, but possessed skills in managing livestock, shoeing horses, repairing machinery, and working with wood and metal. Through hard work and repetitive practice, they were able to create or repair almost anything that the ranch needed.</p> <p>Some of the work done in the repair shop included:</p> <p>· Sharpening sickle bar blades and other tools</p> <p>· Drilling</p> <p>· Rough Carpentry</p> <p>· Acetylene and forge welding</p> <p>· Blacksmithing</p> <p>· Shoeing</p> <p>· Branding</p> <p>· Oiling and greasing machinery</p> <p>Although the blacksmithing history associated with Grant-Kohrs Ranch began in the early 1860s there were no professional blacksmiths working on site. Most Montana ranches were located several miles away from populated areas, but this ranch has been located adjacent to the town of Deer Lodge ever since the mid 1860’s. Historically there would have been numerous blacksmith shops located in Deer Lodge where horses could be shod, iron work could be ordered, and machinery could be repaired. Johnny Grant stated in his memoir that he once owned a blacksmith shop, but it was likely located in somewhere in town and the finical records of Conrad Kohrs note several payments to local blacksmiths for shoeing and iron work.</p> <p>This repair shop also reflects a change in the agricultural and business operations of the ranch in the early 20th Century. The Open Range Era largely depended on animal and human labor to make a profit, but as ranching evolved it quickly relied on the effectiveness and use of modern mechanized machines and equipment. Conrad Kohrs once observed that “the changes of the past have been many; and those of the future may be of even more revolutionary character.\" His prediction came true as the shop became vital to the economic stability of the ranch as agricultural and business operations changed across the west.</p>",

        "name": "The Chuckwagon",
        "notes": "The Chuckwagon\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-chuckwagon.htm\n\nDuring the Open Range Era, a cattle drive could take anywhere from three to six months depending on the destination. Large groups of cattle were herded by cowboys and trailed directly from a range to a nearby market; from a range to a distant railhead; or between ranges to find better grazing opportunities.<br /> <br /> On the earlier, shorter drives cowboys would eat what they could carry in their saddle bag, which typically consisted of dried meats, salt, and biscuits. As the distances increased it became harder for a cowboy to carry his own food. Texas cattleman Charles Goodnight solved this problem in 1866 by converting a surplus Army wagon into a mobile kitchen. Goodnight added a large pantry box to the rear with shelves, drawers, and a hinged door that laid flat to create a table. Heavier items like pots, cast iron skillets, and a Dutch oven were carried in a box mounted below the pantry called a “boot.” The chuckwagon also carried tools, sewing supplies, first aid essentials, bedrolls, firewood, and water.<br /> <br /> Life on the trail was exhausting work and the chuckwagon and the resourcefulness of the cook boosted the crews moral and played a vital role in the success or failure of the entire journey. Most cooks were ex-cowboys themselves that were often too old or injured to comfortably ride a horse. The cook lived a life of physical labor and maintained an exhausting daily schedule. He not only prepared three hot meals a day, but also drove the chuckwagon, pitched camp, and served as the banker, barber, doctor, dentist, or any other job that needed to be filled on the trail. His final task of the day was to locate the north star and point the tongue of the wagon facing north, which allowed the crew to know which direction to move the herd the next morning.<br /> <br /> The food carried on the chuckwagon was both easy to cook and preserve. Some common items included “whistle berries” (beans), rice, dried meat, onions, potatoes, flour, lard, canned fruits and vegetables, and various spices and condiments. Sourdough was a main component of most meals and the cook took great care of the keg and starter. Fresh beef was never in short supply and was supplemented with wild game and fish. If time permitted and the cook was in a good mood, he might bake the crew a desert like peach cobbler, fruit pie, or spotted pup in a Dutch oven.<br /> <br /> Most cowboys were devoted to coffee and demanded it a every meal. They preferred it hot, strong, black, and thick enough to float a horseshoe in! During the early years of driving cattle, coffee was not easily available on the trail because it was time consuming to roast the beans and they didn’t preserve well. In 1865, the Arbuckles Coffee patented a method to roast and preserve beans that sealed in the flavor, aroma and came packaged in easy to store one-pound bags. Arbuckles became so popular with chuckwagon cooks that most cowboys weren’t aware there was any other kind!<br /> <br /> The chuckwagon not only carried food, equipment, and vital supplies, but it also became the only home and familiar sight that a cowboy knew in the vastness of the open range. It was a special place where you could socialize, receive care, enjoy a comforting meal, and lay your head down to rest after a grueling day on the trail.<br /> <br />  ",

It’s considered to be the headwaters of the Columbia River Basin and stretches more than 280 miles from its origins south of Grant-Kohrs Ranch at the confluence of Silver Bow Creek and Warm Springs Creek to the Idaho border. The Clark Fork River enters the ranch from the parks southern border and flows for approximately 2.5 miles before exiting the ranch towards the north.<br /> <br /> There are at least 35 species of mammals that live on the ranch and more than 230 species of birds can be found passing seasonably through the park. The Clark Fork River and the surrounding riparian habitat provide important food and shelter for a variety of these wildlife species. It’s not uncommon to take a walk along the river’s edge and observe beavers, muskrats, river otters, moose, deer, ospreys, geese, bald eagles, ducks, kingfishers, and much more.<br /> <br /> Montana is known as a fishing paradise and the Clark Fork River supports a variety of fish species including rainbow, cutthroat, and brown trout. Both bait and fly fishing is allowed on the ranch. A Montana fishing license is required for anyone 15 years or older and state regulations must always be followed. The fishing access within in the park is by walk in only. Please stop by the visitor center to pick up a trail map.<br /> <br /> For centuries, the river provided sustenance for several Native American tribes. In the early 1800’s the Lewis and Clark Expedition explored much of the Clark Fork River Basin and it was eventually named after William Clark. As the Clark Fork River meanders its way through the Deer Lodge Valley it provides a crucial lifeline for ranchers that utilize it for watering livestock and growing hay. Johnny Grant chose to build his home near the banks of the Clark Fork River for the same reason and constructed the ranch’s first irrigation system in the 1860’s. Grant utilized water from the river and several smaller springs to water his cattle and irrigate his crops.<br /> <br /> Beginning in the 1880’s Montana became the center of a copper mining boom that would last for over a century. The mining and subsequent smelting operations upstream in Butte and Anaconda created a significant amount of waste. A massive flood in 1908 washed millions of tons of toxic sediments into the Clark Fork River that contaminated the surrounding soil, and polluted ground water for 120 miles. Over the years, natural water cycles and floods continued to wash more toxic sediments downstream.<br /> <br /> Historically the riparian area of Grant-Kohrs Ranch had rich soil and vegetation, which supported a mix of shrubs and forest. The healthy vegetation was used by wildlife and cattle to shelter from summer heat and winter cold. However, by the 1930’s ranch staff began documenting areas of exposed mining waste, dying vegetation, and bare soil along the river throughout the ranch.<br /> <br /> In 1992 the Clark Fork River from its confluence near Warm Springs to the former site of the Milltown Dam east of Missoula was designated as a Superfund Site. In the spring of 2018 work began on the ranch to remove contaminated soil, stabilize the eroding banks of the Clark Fork River, and re-vegetate the riparian area. ",

From these important role models, Warren learned about ranching, care and breeding of livestock, and business leadership.  Following the death of Kohrs and Bielenberg in the early 1920s, the overall size and scale of ranching on the home ranch was drastically reduced. By 1924, the home ranch was approximately 1000 acres in size and most of the livestock was sold off. </p> <p paraeid=\"{17a3d619-cedb-45aa-a878-b285d351a646}{136}\" paraid=\"1274488771\">In 1932, during the Great Depression, Conrad Warren became the manager of the ranch, and in 1935 he invested in repairs to the bunkhouse row. During these repairs, Warren converted this room into his office space.  When Warren was hired as the ranch manager, he focused on making this an active ranch again by buying land to increase the size of the ranch, as well as rebuilding the livestock herds. Warren centered his livestock operations around Hereford cattle and Belgian draft horses.  Warren was widely known for the quality of his livestock. </p> <p paraeid=\"{17a3d619-cedb-45aa-a878-b285d351a646}{186}\" paraid=\"2138769135\">Other ranching operations directed by Warren included adding new buildings to the ranch, repairing fences and buildings, and upgrading the irrigation systems for water on the ranch. Warren also focused on animal care, and though he was not trained as a veterinarian, Warren was an amateur vet and kept syringes and medical supplies in this office, as well as in the thoroughbred horse barn vet office, which he might need to treat the livestock, as well as early work in the field of artificial insemination of the livestock. </p> <p paraeid=\"{17a3d619-cedb-45aa-a878-b285d351a646}{226}\" paraid=\"547148093\">By World War II, Warren started mechanizing the ranch with the purchase of tractors and other motorized farm equipment which took less manpower to operate than the older horse-drawn equipment. This transition to mechanized equipment helped Warren realize it was time to sell the Belgian draft horse herd since there were fewer people with the skills needed to operate draft horse teams, and ranchers and farmers were not using as much animal power in their daily operations. </p>",

These tall, sleek racehorses were cross bred with smaller horses that had been used by indigenous people for centuries. The result produced fast, durable horses that were perfectly suited for covering long distances, whether for personal transport or working on cattle drives. Horses were not always left outside on the range, however and this barn was constructed around 1883 to house many of the ranch’s prized Thoroughbred horses.<br /> <br /> One of the stalls in the building was used by foaling mares about to give birth. An adjacent bricked-in sleeping room was constructed at the front of the building with an interior window. This provided a view to the foaling area and allowed ranch hands to keep a watchful eye on the mares. Johnny Bielenberg also utilized this small room as a makeshift veterinary office, and he spent many nights sleeping on the bunk so he could keep a watchful eye over the foaling mares.<br /> <br /> For a time, Conrad Warren housed his prized Belgian mares inside the barn. In the 1940’s and early 1950’s, Warren used the building as a show barn for his Hereford cattle. During sales, several tents were set up in the adjacent field and the cattle were brought out one at a time to be purchased.<br /> <br /> Today, the Thoroughbred barn is used to display some of the ranch’s historic equipment that employed true horsepower. The sleighs, buggies, and harvesters that visitors can explore inside the building are as diverse as the horses that pulled them.",

        "notes": "Warren Residence\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/warren-residence.htm\n\nThis colonial style cottage home was the former residence of Conrad and Nellie Warren. It was built in 1934 as a wedding gift from Augusta Kohrs to her newlywed grandson and his bride.<br /> <br /> The house was designed, by the New York City architect Lewis W. Welsh as a “country home for city dwellers.” The plans and specifications for the residence featured a beamed ceiling with a craftsman style touch that appealed to Conrad and the modern comforts of electricity, lighting, plumbing, and heating which appealed to Nellie.<br /> <br /> The two were married on May 1, 1934, and quickly departed for a honeymoon on the West Coast. It was noted in the Deer Lodge Silver State Post that “they will return in about a month and will be at home to their friends in their new residence at the Kohrs ranch.” In June, the newlyweds moved in.The Warren residence originally had five rooms – kitchen, living room, two bedrooms, and bath, plus a detached garage. The living room featured a stone fireplace made of rhyolite porphyry (igneous rock like granite) that was collected from the nearby south face of Orofino Mountain. <br /> <br /> The Warren family expanded in 1936 with the birth of their daughter Patricia, and in 1940 with the birth of their son Conrad Kohrs Warren II. With the family’s growth, the residence needed to be enlarged. In 1941, the roof of the house was raised four feet and two bedrooms, and a bath were added to the newly built second floor.<br /> <br /> Conrad worked hard to manage the ranch, while Nellie managed the home. She eventually added a garden, and a chicken coop.  In the 1950’s, Conrad added a workshop/hobby boat house to the west side of residence. The home and other structures were all grouped together and enclosed within a white picket fence. The yard was attractively landscaped and featured a barbeque pit and other conveniences for outdoor living.<br /> <br /> The house was highlighted in the <i>Westerner</i>, magazine in 1947. The author emphasized the Warren residence as a modern ranch home, but also included descriptions of antiques that belonged to Augusta Kohrs who had died in 1945. An appraisal in 1958 described the home as” having a basement, nine rooms, two baths and contains 1,735 square feet of floor space on the lower level alone.”<br /> <br /> The Warren's became advocates for the ranch joining the National Park Service and Nellie is credited with the preservation of much of the Kohrs family papers and furnishings. In 1972 designation for Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site was passed and Conrad gave his wife credit saying, “It was your idea that created the park, a thing of joy for many people, that enriches their lives and will for all time.” Unfortunately, Nellie became ill and died shortly thereafter. Conrad remained living in the home through the 1970s and 1980s and died in the Warren residence in 1993. <br /> <br /> In 2002, the building was converted into the park’s administrative offices.",

It was constructed in the 1930’s by a Works Progress Administration (WPA) crew in exchange for Conrad Warren providing housing for WPA workers on the ranch.<br /> <br /> The WPA was established during the Great Depression as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's “New Deal,” which provided jobs and improved infrastructure around the nation. While the program was best known for completing large scale projects, 2.3 million outhouses were constructed across the country to improve sanitation and public health in rural areas.<br /> <br /> Every WPA outhouse was identical in both design and construction. They were built with a 4’ x 5’ foot wooden frame, a hanging roof with a 6” wide fascia board on all sides, square pots set at a 45-degree angle, and a ventilation chimney with a metal screen that vented polluted air outside and kept flies from coming inside. Each outhouse was also constructed with a concrete foundation, floor, and vault because it was quickly discovered that outhouses with wooden vaults and floors were extremely difficult to clean and deteriorated quickly.<br /> <br /> Because of its association with the WPA and the “New Deal” program, this one-hole outhouse was known on the ranch as the “Roosevelt Building.”",

It was designed by architect Marcel Breuer to resemble a generator rotor. An evening <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/pn/grandcoulee/visit/laser.html\">laser light show</a> was added in 1989. The center was retrofitted in 2004 for seismic, life-safety, and accessibility standards. The original laser equipment was replaced in 2013, and a new laser light show, “One River, Many Voices,” premiered in 2014.</p> <p>In 2006, new exhibits and displays were installed. The exhibits highlight Grand Coulee’s role as one of the main irrigation, flood control, and hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. They also describe the effects the dam has had on various groups of people, including Native Americans and early settlers. The new exhibits were designed, manufactured, and installed by Formations, Inc., of Portland, Oregon. </p> <p>This visitor center is fully accessible and features hands-on exhibits and an auditorium. Service animals are allowed inside the visitor center.</p>",

The point also contains several points including native culture and Fort Colvile, a Hudson's Bay fur trading post.<br /> <br /> Mission Point is open to the public year round. St. Paul's Mission is open and self-guided however it is NOT wheelchair accessible. Take a hike and the ponderosa pine forest on a <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/thingstodo/mission-point-trail.htm\">short, self-guided hike</a> out to the point.<br /> <br /> A cell phone ranger audio tour is available and provides information about each point of interest.<br /> <br /> Stop by the Kettle Falls Information Center to see historic pictures and exhibts.</p> <h2>History of St. Paul's Mission</h2> <p><br /> In early November of 1838, two Catholic priests, Father François Norbert Blanchet and Father Modeste Demers were enroute from Montreal to Fort Vancouver when they stopped at Fort Colvile, a fur trading post on the Upper Columbia River near Kettle Falls. Throughout the region, the fur traders promoted their coming to the Native Americans. Representatives from five tribes came. For three days, the priests along with translators conducted religious services, including daily mass and 19 baptisms. Their activities marked the first Catholic presence in the region between the Cascade and Rocky Mountains. As they left the trading post, the priests promised the fur traders and natives that someone would return to establish a mission for the Upper Columbia River.</p>   <p>In 1847, Father Peter de Vos began his year-long residency at St. Paul’s. With assistance from fur traders at Fort Colvile, he began construction of a larger, substantial chapel to function both as a residence and a mission. Several cedar logs were chiseled and handhewn into beams for the frame. Instead of nails, pegs were used to keep the beams in place. White mud was chinked into the walls to prevent drafts. The building also featured glass windows. Two wood-burning stoves were installed to provide heat during the cold winter. By the end of the year, building of the mission was complete.<br /> <br /> Learn more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/laro/learn/historyculture/stpauls-mission.htm\">history of St. Paul’s Mission</a>.</p>",

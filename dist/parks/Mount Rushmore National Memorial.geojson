In the late 50’s the original studio was torn down. The only parts that remain are the two fireplaces. The framework you see today was put in place when the terrace was built to showcase the original size and location of the studio.<br /> <br /> While exploring the areas make sure to read the essay inscribed on the bronze plaque on the remnants of the original studio.<br /> <br /> Gutzon Borglum teamed up with the Hearst newspapers in 1934 to sponsor an essay contest to sum up the first 100 years of United States history. The winner would have their words carved into some part of Mount Rushmore along with the four presidents. After winners were selected and prizes awarded, Borglum decided against carving any text into his sculpture. A young Nebraskan named William Andrew Burkett, triumphed in the college-age category, and later donated this plaque showcasing his winning essay.</p>",

During the carving of Mount Rushmore, visitors to the site were very interested in the honeycombed granite and would often ask, \"How can I get a piece of rock like that?\" The hoist operator would usually respond, \"Oh, I can't give that away. I'm holding onto it for a buddy of mine that works up on the mountain.\" The visitor would respond, \"I'll pay, I'll give you $2.00 for it.\" The hoist operator's reply was, \"Nope, nope, I'd really catch it if I gave away my buddy's piece of granite.\" If the visitors were very determined to get a piece of that granite, they would make another offer. \"I'll give you $6.00 for that piece of honeycomb granite.\" The hoist operator would pretend to pause and think about it... then he would say, \"Alright for $6.00 I'm willing to take the heat.\" The hoist operator would give the visitors the piece of honeycombed granite and take their $6.00. The visitor would leave very pleased with their rare and hard-won souvenir. The hoist operator would wait until he was sure the visitors were gone, and he would get on the phone to the top of the mountain and say, \"Boys send down another one!\" Another piece of honeycombed granite was sent down, ready for the next visitor looking for a special souvenir from Mount Rushmore.<br /> <br /> The talus slope is now considered a cultural resource, to be preserved along with the historic structures, the museum collection, and the sculpture itself. Taking rocks or other materials from a protected area such as Mount Rushmore National Memorial is prohibited by law.</p>",

The State of New Jersey commissioned the monument in honor of the soldiers of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/14th_nj.htm\">14th New Jersey Regiment</a> for the their dedicated service and sacrifice throughout the Civil War.<br /> <br /> The monument commission was comprised of veterans from the 14th New Jersey. Funded by the State of New Jersey, the commission was responsible for the location, design, construction, and dedication. In their report to the Governor, the monument committee described their design as \"a departure from the usual form, a soldier at parade rest. This statue represents a 'soldier in action,' having just fired his rifle, he reaches with his right hand for another cartridge, while his left hand grasps his rifle to bring it into position to load as he advances.\"<br /> <br /> The commission placed two bronze plaques on the monument. The first plaque reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>Erected by the State of New Jersey to commemorate the heroic services of the 14th Regiment, New Jersey Volunteer Infrantry, 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, 6th Army Corps, Army of the Potomac, at the Battle of Monocacy, MD.<br /> July 9, 1864<br /> *************<br /> The 14th Regiment New Jersey Volunteers was organized on the Monmouth Battle Ground, and mustered in the United States service near Freehold, New Jersey August 26th, 1862, and was mustered out June 18th, 1865, near Washington, D.C.</p> </blockquote> <p>The second plaque reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Union forces commanded by General Lew Wallace on the battlefield so stubbornly opposed the Confederate troops under General Jubal A. Early as to assure the safey of the National Capital.<br /> *************<br /> The Commission to erect the monument<br /> Major John C. Patterson, President<br /> Adjutant William H. Foster, Secretary<br /> Corporal R.A.Clark, Treasurer<br /> Captain Jarvis Wanser<br /> Sergeant John Grover<br /> Thos Manson & Son, Builders</p> </blockquote> <p>Two additional plaques were added later to the monument. The State of New Jersey rededicated the monument on the centennial of the battle and added a plaque noting:</p> <blockquote> <p>This site rededicated July 5, 1964</p> <p>Civil War Centennial Commission<br /> State of New Jersey</p> </blockquote> <p>To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the monument, a ceremony was held on July 7, 2007. In advance of the rededication, the National Park Service initiated a restoration of the 14th New Jersey Monument.The project focused cleaning and repairing the monument. Restoration specialist removed biological growth and other contaminants from the sculpture and base. A number of areas of damage - probably as a result of vandalism - were carefully repaired and restored. The monument's bronze plaques were cleaned and waxed, and the concrete apron surrounding the base was replaced. A plaque commemorating the monument's anniversary was unveiled at the rededication ceremony.</p> <blockquote> <p dir=\"ltr\">We commemorate the 100th anniversary of this monument and rededicate it in honor of those who served with pride and distinction in the 14th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry.

It is located three miles south of Frederick, Maryland along the Georgetown Pike, today's Route 355. The Best Farm comprises the southern 274 acres of what was originally a 748-acre plantation known as <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/hermitage.htm\">L'Hermitage</a></em>, owned by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/victoire_vincendiere.htm\">Victoire Vincendière</a>. The Vincendieres were the second largest enslavers in Frederick County, holding up to 90 people in bondage in 1800. The Vincendieres sold the farm in 1827, and after several transfers of ownership it was acquired by Charles E. Trail in 1852. The Trails, however, never occupied the farm and instead operated it as a tenant farm until it was acquired by the National Park Service in 1993. For many years during Trail's ownership, members of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/best.htm\">Best family</a> leased the farm.<br /> <br /> Because of its proximity to the Georgetown Pike and Monocacy Junction, portions of both the Union and Confederate armies camped at the Best Farm throughout the Civil War. On September 13, 1862, during the Maryland Campaign, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/an-invitation-to-battle.htm\">lost order No. 191</a> (which outlined his army's movements) was found on the Best Farm by soldiers from the 27th Indiana. Passed up through the chain of command, the captured order gave Union General George B. McClellan advance notice of his enemy's movements. Holding the paper, McClellan exclaimed, \"Here is a paper with which, if I cannot whip Bobby Lee, I will be willing to go home.\"</p> <p>In 1864, John T. Best took over operation of the farm from his father David. The first year of farming on his own looked promising, but soon proved disastrous. During the Battle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864, Confederate artillery set up on his farm and sharpshooters took positions in the barn. They fired at Union troops guarding the covered bridge over the Monocacy River on the Georgetown Pike. The Union returned fire, however, setting the Best's barn ablaze and destroying the grain, hay, tools, and farming implements kept there. Confederate infantry, using the farm as a staging area, soon destroyed any crops left standing in the fields.</p>",

Carpenter’s Battery was half a mile north of the junction, near the other replicas.<br /> <br /> Around 2 p.m. on the other side of the Georgetown Pike, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/east-best-farm-confederate-cannon.htm\">Kirkpatrick's Battery</a> moved forward to support General Gordon's attack on the Union left.

This was particularly effective during <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-b-gordon.htm\">General Gordon</a>'s assault. These were the final positions of Confederate artillery at the end of the Battle of Monocacy.</p> <h4>Unit Information</h4> <p>Captain John L. Massie commanded the Fluvanna Virginia Artillery during the Battle of Monocacy. This battery had one 3-inch ordnance rifle and three 12-pounder smooth bore Napoleons. Two of the guns were sent to guard Crum’s Ford and did not play an active role in the battle. This battery was formed in October 1862 by combining the 1st and 2nd Fluvanna artillery batteries. It was with Lt. General Jubal Early throughout the Shenandoah Campaign. Captain Massie was mortally wounded a few months later in September 1864 and Captain Charles G. Snead assumed command for the rest of the war. The unit was overrun and captured at the battle of Waynesboro, Virginia on March 2, 1865.<br /> <br /> Captain John C. Carpenter commanded Alleghany Rough Artillery. This battery was armed with either; two 3- inch ordnance rifles and two 12-pounder smooth bore Napoleons (armament during Gettysburg battle); or two 10-pound Parrot rifles and one 12-pound Napoleon (armament in December 1864). This battery was originally an infantry company known as the Alleghany Toughs in the Stonewall Brigade. After the Battle of 1st Manassas, its senior officer was Lt. Joseph H. Carpenter whom General Jackson recognized as an artillery student of his at the Virginia Military Institute. On General Jackson's orders the unit was reorganized as artillery. It fought throughout the war until it was overrun with most members and all guns captured on April 1, 1865, at the battle of Five Forks.<br /> <br /> Captain William M Lowry commanded a unit of Virginia Light Artillery that is sometimes referred to as Wise’s Legion. This unit was armed with six 12-pound Napoleons. It formed in June 1861 in Monroe county, Virginia. This artillery battery served throughout the war in most of the major engagements. In January 1865, the battery left its artillery pieces in Charlottesville, Virginia, because of a lack of forage for its horses and its members disbursed to winter quarters around Dublin, Virginia. On reassembly in April 1865 they learned of General Lee's surrender and disbanded.</p>",

        "notes": "Best Farm House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/best-farm-house.htm\n\n<p>In 1794 and 1795, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/victoire_vincendiere.htm\">Vincendières</a>, a French planter family from the colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), began acquiring lands that would comprise a 748-acre plantation that they called <em>L'Hermitage</em>. The Vincendières came to the United States in 1793 to escape civil unrest associated with the French Revolution and the successful revolt by people enslaved in Saint-Domingue. Today's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/best-farm.htm\">Best Farm</a> consists of the southern 274 acres of the original 748-acre <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/hermitage.htm\">L'Hermitage</a> plantation.<br /> <br /> Even before the Vincendiere's purchased the land, they began construction of the main house. This may reflect their intent to eventually purchase the land or the terms of their lease. Standard tenant agreements in colonial Maryland required the tenant to build and maintain a dwelling. Architectural studies of the main house have identified its stylistic influence as a combination of \"French Colonial and Caribbean Island, mixed with Early Federal,\" which are noted in the original hipped roof, the large rooms, high ceilings, and alcoved, double-hung windows.<br /> <br /> The main house was constructed in several phases. The earliest portion is believed to date circa 1794 and consists of the south wing of the house, which is made up of a stair passage, cellar, and two south rooms; this portion of the house originally had a hipped roof. A two-story, four-room north addition was constructed relatively soon after the original south wing, and initially had a shed roof. Both the south and northern addition of the main house are built of stone and covered in stucco.  A detached, single story, log kitchen was also constructed west of the main building in the 1790s. In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, a wood frame addition was added to connect the kitchen to the main house. A second floor was added to the kitchen in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p> <p>For most of its existence the L'Hermitage/Best Farmhouse served as a rental home with long-term tenants. The Best Family leased the farm for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The Wiles family began leasing the farm in the 1920s and continued to live there for a few years after the National Park Service acquired the property in 1991. Assessments of the building in the 1990s and early 2000s revealed extensive termite damage. Because rehabilitation or restoration would have required removing a significant amount of the original materials; park managers decided to stabilize the building and preserve its presence on the landscape. A peak inside the ground floor windows reveals modern construction supporting the ceiling and second floor.</p>",

Architectural evidence indicates that the structure was built in two parts in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. First was a one-story stone dwelling that faced east towards the Georgetown Pike. A log second story was added in the 1790s. Similarities between wood trim in the secondary and main houses and the placement of the the second-story doors on the west-side of the building facing the main house suggest that the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/victoire_vincendiere.htm\">Vincendieres</a> added the second floor.<br /> <br /> Use of the secondary house has changed over its more than two centuries of existence, but it appears to have primarily served as a tenant house. In the colonial period, most of the land in the area was claimed by land speculators who leased it to tenant farmers. Standard leasing language required tenants to build and maintain a house and plant 100 apple trees. Daniel Dulaney, who owned the property until he sold it to James Marshall in 1791, frequently used pre-printed lease agreements with his tenants.<br /> <br /> When the Vincendiere family moved to the property in 1794, they probably used the stone building as a residence while they constructed and expanded the main house. The secondary house may also have served as an overseer's residence. Archeological studies revealed that a series of six wood cabins existed five hundred feet to the west of the secondary house during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. According to the 1800 census, the Vincendieres enslaved 90 people here.<br /> <br /> After the Vincendieres sold the property in 1828, the land was once again a rental property. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/best.htm\">Best</a> family began leasing the farm known as the South Hermitage in 1852. When David Best retired from farming in 1864, he may have turned the main house over to his son and daughter-in-law and moved into the secondary house. While the 1870 census does not provide addresses, it does list John T. Best and David Best next to each other and as heads of households, indicating that they were neighbors.<br /> <br /> In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, changes in farming practices and increased mechanization reduced the need for farmers to maintain a large labor force. The secondary house fell into disuse and disrepair throughout most of the century. In 2005, the National Park Service stabilized and repaired the building. The Secondary House is not open to the public; however, the grounds of the Best Farm are open.</p>",

The guns moved forward and positioned on the hill, on the east side of Rte.355, just north of where the Union skirmishers had previously been sited.</p> <h4>Unit Information</h4> <p>The Amherst Light Artillery or Virginia Light Artillery formed in July 1861, with men from Amherst County, Virginia. The battery served with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jubal-early.htm\">General Jubal Early</a> throughout the Shenandoah Campaign (Spring and Summer 1864).

On the morning of July 9, 1864, a pregnant Antoinette Gambrill and sons, Richard and Staley, sought shelter in the basement of the Thomas House; while her husband, James, remained at their home. Mr. Gambrill sat on his porch talking to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/james-b-ricketts.htm\">General James B. Ricketts</a> when Samuel Thomas, son of his neighbor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/the_thomas_family.htm\">Christian Keefer Thomas</a>, and two of his friends joined them after escaping the Union line they had been impressed into days prior. Shortly after, artillery shells began falling all around them and the four men took shelter in the stone mill, down by the waterwheel and remained there until the battle was over.<br /> <br /> In 1864, James Gambrill purchased the adjacent land to build the Gambrill house. The house was built 1872–1873. The richly ornamented, okra-colored brickhouse was built in the Second Empire Style with a mansard roof, cupola-topped tower rising over the front entrance, tall windows with heavy arches above them, elaborately carved doors, porch posts, bay windows, and balconies. It contained 17 rooms, including a 17 X 40 foot ballroom, butler’s pantry, china closets, range, hot and cold water, and seven fireplaces. At the time, it was one of the largest homes in Frederick County. The lower level of the two-story L-shaped porch on the back of the house was originally partially enclosed and used as a summer dining room, while the upper level had a glass enclosure. The house was the heart of a working farm that had a two-story bank barn with space for six carriages, and icehouse, poultry house, hay barrack, and two-story servant cottage. Originally the house had a coal-burning furnace enclosed in a small cellar from heated air which was spread through the first floor of the main block via ducts. A machine also located in the cellar contained gas, which lit wall-mounted gas lamps throughout the house. Toilets located on the first and second floors worked by pipes which ran from a hydraulic ram positioned at a spring several hundred yards to the north of the house. A five-hundred gallon hot-water tank provided hot water for the sink in the service room, and the bath located directly above. The kitchen had a twelve-burner gas range with a large oven and several small warming ovens.<br /> <br /> The house stayed in the family that had grown to include 9 children until 1901. It was owned by three other families until the National Park Service acquired the home in 1981. In 1935 a limited number of rooms were wired for electricity, but the most significant change to the house came in 1967, when it was renovated in part to house a medical clinic. Kitchen and bathroom facilities, intercoms, and many electric outlets were added and altered. In 1996, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1098/index.htm\">NPS Historic Preservation Training Center</a> restored and rehabilitated the house; it remains as their headquarters today. </p>",

Gambrill owned and operated a flour mill, a sawmill, and a plaster mill on this land. Today only the first two-levels of the flour mill remain. Originally known as Araby Mill, the stone mill building was constructed in 1830. James Gambrill purchased it in 1855. The Gambrill family owned and operated the mill into the 1890s when economic hardship forced them to sell the mill and the grand home that they built up the hill.<br /> <br /> Gambrill Mill was a three-story merchant flour mill fitted with two pairs of \"burr\" or flour-milling stones. The mill's inside, undershot water wheel was powered by a millrace fed by nearby Bush Creek. The creek was dammed about a mile from the mill, and a sluice gate regulated the amount of water allowed to flow into the millrace. Remnants of the tailrace may still be seen at the front of the building. In addition to the flour mill, the complex also included a sawmill, a chopping and plaster mill, and a one-and-one-half story miller's house, along with a variety of other support structures. <br /> <br /> At its peak, the mill could produce up to sixty barrels of flour per day. James Gambrill employed three mill hands to manufacture the flour, along with two coopers to produce barrels for its transport. A contemporary newspaper account gave the following description:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>By far, the Gambrill's mill did the most extensive business of all. The neat, well-appointed mill was up-to-the-minute...it was a pleasure to accompany the big wagon team on its slated trips to Gambrill's. The squat, neat old mill, the more than comfortable atmosphere of the place, and last, but not least, the handsome jolly miller, all combined to make one's visits a genuine pleasure.</i></p> </blockquote> <h4>A Field Hospital</h4> <p>During the Battle of Monocacy, Union forces were positioned in battle lines in the yard of the mill. The building was set up as a field hospital, although as Major General Lew Wallace declared in his autobiography, \"the place appeared well selected for the purpose, its one inconvenience being that it was under fire.\" As the Federal forces fell back towards Baltimore, Confederate troops moved in and occupied the mill and the surrounding area.<br /> <br /> In the 1920s, the top story of the mill was removed and the mill race partially filled in to convert the building into a dwelling house. Today, Gambrill Mill is used by the National Park Service for staff offices.</p>",

Confident that it would be an easy route, the dismounted cavalry soldiers began marching towards the Thomas Farm around 10:30 am. When they were within 125-feet of the fence separating the Thomas and Worthington Farms, the Union troops opened fire. Surprised by the disciplined and well coordinated attack of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/james-b-ricketts.htm\">General Ricketts's</a> VI Corps, the Confederates fell back in confusion.<br /> <br /> In the fields behind the Worthington House, McCausland regrouped his men.

The panel has an artist’s rendering of Union troops in retreat with one solider carrying two US Flags in retreat, one solider firing his weapon, another running to in retreat and lastly one wounder solider laying on the ground. There is a battle map showing where both Union and Confederate forces were on the battlefield just before the retreat was ordered.<br /> <br /> The main body of text on the upper third of the wayside reads as follows: </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{0d7b5f8e-3c9d-43cd-b0b4-7eed2ca33921}{26}\" paraid=\"342868119\">Retreat </h4> <p paraeid=\"{0d7b5f8e-3c9d-43cd-b0b4-7eed2ca33921}{36}\" paraid=\"848543643\">At about 5:00 p.m. on July 6, 1864, the Confederates stormed the Union line on the Georgetown Pike. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/lew-wallace.htm\">Union General Wallace</a> ordered the withdrawal and chaos soon followed. With Confederates in hot pursuit, Union troops fled past <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/tour-stop-4-gambrill-mill.htm\">Gambrill Mill</a>, then through the field in front of you, and across Bush Creek behind you.

Corporal Alexander Scott, fearing the Union flags might be captured, ran both flags to safety. For his valor in saving the national flag he received the Medal of Honor on September 21, 1897. <br /> <br /> There are two notes along with black and white circular pictures on the maps about key command officers in the battle and a map key that describes symbols used to portray Union and Confederate units on the battlefield. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0d7b5f8e-3c9d-43cd-b0b4-7eed2ca33921}{140}\" paraid=\"85155775\">The first note reads: </p> <p paraeid=\"{0d7b5f8e-3c9d-43cd-b0b4-7eed2ca33921}{150}\" paraid=\"654938183\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/james-b-ricketts.htm\">Brigadier General James B.

John Worthington and his enslaved laborers rushed to salvage the wheat crop in the fields. As the boom of cannons began in the distance, John Worthington sent two of his enslaved laborers, John Ephraim Tyler Butler and Thomas Palm, to take the horses to nearby Sugar Loaf Mountain and hide them in the “darkest and loneliest place you can find.”<br /> <br /> After salvaging as much of the wheat harvest as possible, Worthington prepared the house and family for the battle. Worthington had two-inch thick oak boards put across the cellar windows. Tubs and a barrel of water were placed in the cellar. As the fighting drew nearer, the Worthington family and their enslaved laborers took refuge in the cellar. Around 11 am they were joined by the wife of the B&O Railroad station manager and her four children.<br /> <br /> Mid-morning the Confederates found the nearby ford and began crossing the river. Worthington and his family took refuge in the cellar, and through the boarded-up windows, six-year-old Glenn Worthington watched intently as the fighting raged in front of the house. In his account of the battle, <em>Fighting For Time</em>, Glenn Worthington recalls that, “Glimpses of blue could be seen as they passed windows. More than one received his death wound close to the house and fell there to die, in Worthington yard.”<br /> <br /> After the battle, John Worthington and his family assisted with the care of the wounded soldiers. Glenn and his seven-year-old brother Harry were sent into the nearby fields to gather sheaves of wheat for use as a bed for a wounded Confederate soldier.</p> <p>While the wounded were being cared for, other Confederate soldiers gathered the muskets that had been thrown away by the retreating Union soldiers. The muskets were placed in a pile in Worthington’s back yard and set on fire, leaving only the gun barrels and bayonets. Glenn desired one of these bayonets as a souvenir. He procured a stick and began to drag the bayonet from the embers, and as he stooped to retrieve his prize, an ember touched a discarded paper cartridge which exploded in his face. A Confederate soldier carried him, blinded and yelling, into the house. Luckily Glenn’s eyesight was not damaged by the explosion and he made a full recovery.</p>",

The covered bridge provided easy movement for the Confederates, intent on speeding 15,000 troops with their horses, wagons, and artillery toward their objective, Washington, D.C. Union General Wallace ordered the bridge held “at all hazard.” Throughout the morning the Confederates advanced on the bridge, but a determined Union force held them back. By noon, Wallace decided to move his troops toward the Confederate threat at the Thomas farm, then ordered the bridge burned. Sheaves of wheat were gathered and ignited under the bridge's roof; flames engulfed the structure destroying it.<br /> <br /> <i>[The covered bridge] had to go.… I remember as if it were yesterday the struggle I had with myself to have the match applied.… I gave the word and in a moment…the old crossing was in a whirl of flame and smoke.</i> — Union Major General Lew Wallace<br />  </p>",

Pushing through the Shenandoah Valley to Frederick, Maryland, Early expected to encounter minor resistance, but instead he found an opposing force of 6,600 troops he had not anticipated. Although his army prevailed at the Battle of Monocacy on July 9th, 1864, the delay cost his army the chance to take Washington and, perhaps, to turn the tide of the war in favor of the confederates.</p>",

It starts at the corner of the parking lot and is denoted by a marker and sign. The trail leads heads South, paralleling the railroad spur tracks. In 1864 this spur line was used for cargo only. The trail borders a farm field planted (rotationally) with crops of corn, alfalfa, soy beans or wheat. About 3/4 of the way along the east leg of the trail crosses a farm road that extends from Rte. 355 across the railroad tracks to a small farm field to your left. This road, and the small farm field, are NOT accessible to the public. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9961ed74-2db9-4b8b-929f-92cbc8c5826e}{124}\" paraid=\"1909984745\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Standing at the Wayside signs looking South the land drops off about 10 feet to the track level. The tracks at the bottom of the cut just before you are the spur line rails. About 50 feet beyond the main line rails leads to Baltimore and points west. The junction of the rails is further to the west on the other side of the current bridge. Inside the Vee formed by the tracks stood the Monocacy Junction station. Looking to the left you can see where the farthermost tracks curve off toward the Monocacy River Railroad Bridge. During the battle Union forces took cover in the railroad cut. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9961ed74-2db9-4b8b-929f-92cbc8c5826e}{126}\" paraid=\"1559337868\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">At this point the trail turns North (right) and back towards back to the Visitor Center. Rte. 355 is to your left and the farm field is to your right. This section is a bit more rolling than the Eastern leg. Just after you cross the farm road on your return, you will top the highest point of this section of the Battlefield. Looking ahead (north) you have an clear and open view towards Frederick. Looking behind you, there is a shallow swale. The trail back to the Visitor Center parallels Rte, 355. At the end of the farm field on the right, is a beige marker post with a blue stripe which marks the turn right to proceed back to the Visitor Center.</p>",

The stone barn is believed to date from the 1790s and may be one of the improvements that reflected in an unusually large assessment on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/victoire_vincendiere.htm\">Vincendiere family</a> for the 1798 tax year.<br /> <br /> Constructed of local stone, the barn is rectangular with large bays facing east and west and a segmentally-arched brick door opening in the north elevation. With its hipped roof, stone construction, and tall opposing front and rear bays, it is markedly different from the Pennsylvania-style forebay banked barns that are common to the region. The stone barn may have originally been divided into three equal bays to form an \"English\" or \"Yankee\" barn, a style that has been employed in the British Isles and Continental Europe in general since the Middle Ages.<br />  ",

An 1856 advertisement for the property declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>“<i>THAT BEAUTIFUL AND PRODUCTIVE FARM called 'Araby,' CONTAINING 261 acres of Land, more or less. ... The improvements are of the best order, consisting of a large TWO-STORY BRICK MANSION HOUSE, with Back Building, suitable for a large family.” </i></p> </blockquote> <p>C. K. Thomas relocated his family to Frederick County to avoid Baltimore's pre-war strife; however, Arby’s location near important transportation routes and Monocacy Junction subjected it to both Union and Confederate troops throughout the war.<br /> <br /> The Union Army established a permanent presence at Monocacy Junction after Confederate troops damaged the B&O Railroad bridge on their way to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/anti/index.htm\">Antietam</a> in September 1862. The Thomas family spent the winter of 1862-63 getting to know members of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/14th_nj.htm\"><b>14th New Jersey Regiment</b></a>, the first regiment assigned to guard the nearby Monocacy Junction. In June of 1863, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/winfield-scott-hancock.htm\">Major General Winfield Scott Hancock</a> established his headquarters at the Thomas home for three days while the Union army marched north toward Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.<br /> <br /> During the Battle of Monocacy, on July 9, 1864, the Thomas Farm was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting of the day. Caught between Union and Confederate lines, the house and outbuildings were captured and recaptured by both armies several times. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/confederate-cannon-at-worthington.htm\">Confederate artillery</a> posted at the nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/worthington-farm.htm\">Worthington Farm</a> caused severe damage to the house while attempting to dislodge Union sharpshooters. C. K. Thomas and his family took refuge in the cellar of the house during the battle. Among those hiding in the cellar was Alice Thomas' friend Mamie Tyler Gatchell, who recalled:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>Pieces of shell were flying too near to be pleasant ... Minié balls slashed the shubbery, while the larger missiles of War's fearful instruments twisted huge limbs from the trees, leveled down chimneys, & tore out an angle of the house.</i></p> </blockquote> <p>In August of 1864, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ulysses-s-grant.htm\">Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant</a> stayed with the Thomas family and used their home to hold a \"council of war.\" During that meeting, Grant confirmed with General Phil Sheridan a plan to secure and destroy Confederate resistance in the Shenandoah; a plan that Sheridan carried out in the fall of 1864.<br /> <br /> After the Civil War, the Thomas Farm returned to its previous prosperity. By 1868 the farm had sufficiently recovered to serve as the setting for 21-year-old Alice Thomas's wedding. C. K. Thomas died in 1889; his obituary described him as a \"gentleman of pleasant manners\" and remarked that \"his beautiful home was noted for its hospitality and delightful social entertainments.\" The farm remained in the Thomas family until 1910. It was acquired by the National Park Service in 2001, and today the Thomas House is home to the park headquarters.</p>",

Originally known as \"Clifton Farm,\" the house and surrounding 300 acres adjacent to the Monocacy River were sold to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/the_worthingtons.htm\">John T. Worthington</a> in 1862. Renaming his new property \"Riverside Drive and Farm,\" John Worthington enjoyed success in farming until his death in 1905. The farm remained in the Worthington family until 1953. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d5f192cf-a767-4573-a85b-d6b5edab5ac4}{105}\" paraid=\"606831427\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">During the Battle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864, Confederate troops crossed the Monocacy River via a ford onto the Worthington Farm. From the farm fields, the Confederates initiated three advances toward the Union line positioned at the neighboring Thomas Farm. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d5f192cf-a767-4573-a85b-d6b5edab5ac4}{128}\" paraid=\"1066601128\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">These actions resulted in heavy casualties. The Worthington House and yard were subsequently used as a field hospital. A Confederate artillery piece unlimbered in the front yard during the battle provided an amusing aside to the horrific fighting: every time the gun fired, the Worthington's rooster would crow! </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d5f192cf-a767-4573-a85b-d6b5edab5ac4}{134}\" paraid=\"1584362049\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">As the battle raged throughout the day, John Worthington and his family took refuge in the cellar of the house. Although the cellar windows had been boarded up prior to the battle, six-year-old Glenn Worthington was able to observe the action. Impressed with a scene that was forever etched in his memory, Glenn Worthington grew up to write a history of the battle called <em>Fighting for Time</em>. Published in 1932, the book remains an excellent eye-witness account of \"the Battle that Saved Washington.\" <br /> <br /> Today visitors may enjoy the scenic views or <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/planyourvisit/foot_trails.htm\">hiking</a> on the Ford Loop or the Brooks Hill trails.</p>",

The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/worthington-farm.htm\">farm</a> and the house were sold to Turner Ball and John Wheatley in 1856—along with Araby, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/thomas-farm.htm\">Thomas farm</a>. Ball and his family lived in the house until 1862. The two men were partners with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/the_gambrills.htm\">James Gambrill</a> in a distillery business that failed in 1860, but the farms continued to be prosperous enterprises. Ball is credited with trying to elevate the house from simple farm house to gentleman’s house by adding decorative painting to both the parlor and the entry hall and grain painting the woodwork in the main rooms to resemble fine mahogany and walnut.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{964a50aa-8c60-40dc-b486-38ac10e04f86}{180}\" paraid=\"10016749\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/learn/historyculture/the_worthingtons.htm\">John and Mary Worthington</a> bought the house and farm in 1862 and moved into it with their two sons, John and Glenn. In the winter of 1862–1863, Union troops camped in the area, and, while they had a major effect on the farm and the family who lived there, probably had little effect on the house. However, the Battle of Monocacy was fought around it on July 9, 1864. In his book, <em>Fighting for Time</em>, Glenn Worthington recounted his memories of the battle as a six-year-old, hiding with his family, some neighbors, and enslaved workers in the cellar room below the parlor. Glenn watched the battle through the slats in the boards covering the window to protect it. He was very much aware of the cannon in the side yard bombarding the Thomas House below them, and a rooster crowing every time the cannon was fired. He also watched the Confederates who had crossed the Monocacy at the ford below the house advance on the Union forces around the Thomas House, be driven back in the first assault, reassemble behind the Worthington House, and make the second charge down the hill. After the battle, it was used as a field hospital treating Confederate and Union wounded.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{964a50aa-8c60-40dc-b486-38ac10e04f86}{188}\" paraid=\"1428802887\">The Worthington family continued to live in the house for the next forty years and there were few changes made to it. As John and Mary aged and their sons moved out, a cousin, Lavinia Worthington, moved in as their caretaker, and she also took in boarders. It was probably at this time that the kitchen was moved upstairs to the room at the west end of the ell. Lavinia probably did her cooking on a woodstove installed in front of the fireplace.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{964a50aa-8c60-40dc-b486-38ac10e04f86}{192}\" paraid=\"124380811\">After John and Mary’s deaths, the house stayed in the family and was rented out to tenant farmers for the next 48 years. Electricity was added in 1935, and water was pumped into the kitchen from a well in the side yard, but a bathroom was never installed. In 1953, the house was purchased by Jenkins Brothers, Inc. a local farming corporation. They used it to house migrant workers brought in during the summer to work the fields, raising fruits and vegetables for the cannery in Frederick. Most of these African American workers were housed either in the farm buildings or in the house, and the art work on the walls of the parlor date from this period, done by the workers or the homeless who might have taken refuge in the house doing the winter. The numbers of workers living in the space fluctuated but we do know that in June of 1961 approximately 60 workers and 28 children were on the farm. According to newspaper accounts, as many as fourteen people were living in two cow stalls in one of the barns. </p> <p paraeid=\"{964a50aa-8c60-40dc-b486-38ac10e04f86}{196}\" paraid=\"2056853387\">The National Park Service purchased the house and farm in 1982. </p>",

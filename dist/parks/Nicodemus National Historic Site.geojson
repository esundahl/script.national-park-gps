The congregation built the church using the limestone that was in the area as wood was hard to come by in the grasslands of western Kansas The church was occupied by two different congregations over the years, Mount Pleasant congregation worshiped in the building from 1885-1897. The A.M.E. domination worshiped in the church from 1910-1947 eventually the doors of the church closed due to declining membership. Remaining A.M.E members joined the 1st Baptist Church congregation. <b> </b><br /> <br /> The A.M.E. church received major restoration, the project entailed restoring the floors, walls, ceiling, and altar.

He anticipated the railroad would go through Fagan. Instead, the Missouri Pacific established a town to the east of Fagan that they named Bogue after Virgil Bogue, their civil engineer. In the end, the railroad went through Bogue. Fagan businesses moved to Bogue, and all that’s left of Fagan is a graveyard. By 1926, Kansas designated Highway 18, travelers can see remnants of the Sturgeon School Farm. In 1901, the state established it to teach Nicodemus youth farming practices.

As settlers established claims, they formed satellite communities, including this one they called Fairview. Using crude hoes and spades they brought from Kentucky, families broke virgin sod for agricultural use. By the end of 1878, the average homesteader planted three to fifty acres of winter wheat.Tom Johnson and his family were among the first settlers to venture out of Nicodemus. He homesteaded northwest of here on Spring Creek. Many families and friends who traveled together to Nicodemus homesteaded near one another. His friend and first pastor Rev.

Church/religion was very important for the settlers of Nicodemus as the town was settled by several Preachers. The First Baptist Church was established in 1878, in the beginning the Nicodemus Colony members attended church services in a dugout. Members of the church when wanting to be baptized were baptized in a creek located on Thomas Johnson's Homestead north of town. Thomas Johnson was a deacon of the church and arrived with the first colony in September 17, 1877.  Eventually the congregation was established enough to build a small structured church. As the town grew the church grew and the congregation needed a larger building. A larger building was built in 1907 and the older generations tell the story how the larger church building was built around the smaller building and the smaller building was demolished piece by piece and removed out the door and windows of the newer church building. The congregation used that method so that they could continue to hold church services while the new church building was being built.The First Baptist Church was the first building in Nicodemus to receive electricity in early 1950. The congregation built a newer building to the North of the church in the 1970's. Currently, Nicodemus First Baptist Church is still in full operation, the church members meet Wednesday night for bible study and Sunday mornings for teachings.",

Town organizers solicited large groups to settle the site and homestead within the 4x7 mile Nicodemus township (see map). At its peak, the population reached nearly 650 residents, but steadily declined after the Missouri Pacific Railroad bypassed Nicodemus in 1887. South of here, the town of Bogue became the railroad hub. This caused several businesses to relocate there, which weakened Nicodemus’s economic foundation and potential growth. Nearly a century later in 1976, the Department of the Interior designated the town a Historic Landmark District.

Other teams existed, but the most popular was Nicodemus Blues, created after the turn of the century. When committee members moved The Celebration from the grove to the town site, they also moved the baseball field. Most recently, the Nicodemus Historical Society built the Roberta Robinson Baseball Field on Washington Street.Several descendants had the talent to play professionally. Tall, muscular, and fast, Freddie Switzer hit a home run off a Satchel Paige pitch when the Kansas City Monarchs played at Nicodemus. The Monarchs urged Freddie to try out for the team, but he chose to stay and raise his family.Clarence Sayers, descendant and one time resident remembered, “When the Groves (Raymond, Jr.) came to play, you’d better get you some good gloves. Get you some good gloves and put a glove on underneath the one you have on.” 2011Raymond Grove Jr. remembered, “We’d go all over the country and play baseball. And everybody was glad to see us… and when Hill City had their first Graham County Fair, we won the tournament.” He added,”…they wanted me to go down there, but I couldn’t get down there to Kansas City to try out…I might have been a professional ball player if I had gotten there.

Many former enslaved people began moving out of the south to make a living farming their own land. In 1877, six black entrepreneurs in Topeka, Kansas joined with a white developer to form the Nicodemus Town Company. They wanted to establish an all-black community utilizing the Town site Preemption Act of 1844 and the Homestead Act of 1862. The group selected a site in north-central Kansas in the Solomon River valley.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The first group of settlers arrived from Topeka. The company then recruited approximately 300 migrants from Kentucky. Many of these settlers left soon after they saw what was available in the town of Nicodemus. Within two years, 500 to 700 people had migrated to Nicodemus primarily from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> By 1879, the town had a general store, hotel, churches, livery stables, post office, and a real estate office. Some of the early structures including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/zachary-t-fletcher.htm\">Z. T. Fletcher's</a> general store began as dugouts or sod buildings. Nicodemus residents established Graham County’s first public school. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-kirtley.htm\">William Kirtley</a> and Francis Fletcher were two citizens who spearheaded the educating the community’s children. Town leaders gained political prominence in Graham County and Kansas politics.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The most important event in the town was Emancipation Day. It is still celebrated in late July with speeches, bands, games, sports, and food. Today this celebration is called Homecoming.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Many of the settlers filed homestead claims.

Here they began turning the dense sod, building homes and businesses, and forging new lives for themselves.<br /> <br /> Established as an all black community, the founders of Nicodemus envisioned a town built on the ideals of independence and self-determination. The community experienced rapid social and economic growth in the early years and many speculated that Nicodemus would become a major stop for the railroad. It became clear by 1888, however, that the railroad and the predicted economic boom would not come. This did not mark the end of the great experiment that was Nicodemus, however. Although the population of the town itself dwindled to only a few dozen souls, many African American families stayed in the area, settling on farms in the surrounding township. From this time onward Nicodemus became a community of primarily black farm families. This living community is the only remaining all black town west of the Mississippi River that was settled in the 1800s on the western plains by former slaves.<br /> <br /> The U.S. Congress, recognizing the importance of Nicodemus' contribution to America's history, enacted legislation establishing Nicodemus National Historic Site as a unit of the National Park Service in November 1996. The legislation directs the NPS to cooperate with the people of Nicodemus to preserve its five remaining historic structures - First Baptist Church, African Methodist Episcopal Church, St. Francis Hotel, the First District School, and Nicodemus Township Hall - and keep alive the memory of the many roles African Americans played throughout the American West.<br /> <br /> Nicodemus National Historic Site preserves, protects, and interprets the only remaining western town established by African Americans during the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War. The town of Nicodemus is symbolic of the pioneer spirit of African Americans who dared to leave the only region they had been familiar with to seek personal freedom and the opportunity to develop their talents and capabilities. The site was named for a legendary African-American slave who purchased his freedom.</p>",

In 1879 the town established the first organized school in the country with the title \"School District No. 1.\" Many different structures were used a schoolhouses such as sod dug outs, and the Saint Francis hotel. Due to many first settlers being born into slavery a large importance was put upon education especially reading and writing. Within a few years many settler's were literate with two news papers being printed within the town. The current school house was built in 1918 before closing in the 1960s due low enrollment numbers. The building was purchased by the American Legion in 1983. ",

The original owners were Zachary and Jenny Fletcher. The two bed room hotel was also used as the first post office, schoolhouse, general store and stage coach station. Later the hotel was used by the Switzer family as a family residence.<br /> <br /> The great plains and grasslands of Kansas lacks an easily accessible source of wood for building which lead to the hotel being made of limestone bricks. These lime stone bricks can viewed on the west side of the structure where the stucco has fallen away. Each brick is over twenty pounds and had to be hauled from quarries twenty miles away by Stockton, Kansas. <br /> <br /> Former Green Bay Packers player Veryl Switizer was raised in the residence in 1930s and 40s. Veryl later became community leader in preserving Nicodemus' historic buildings like the one he grew up in. Ora Switizer (1902-2009) who is considered the matriarch of Nicodemus lived and raised her family within the Saint Francis hotel. Today many Nicodemus residents remember Ora telling stories of her visiting dug outs as a young girl and watching the Nicodemus baseball team, the Nicodemus Blues.   <br />  ",

Over time, routes in the Nicodemus Township changed and now reveal their stories through old maps, abandoned roadbeds, and Google Map views. Counties built roads in the 1880s, including the old Stockton trail. It traveled west from Stockton into Graham County 3 miles north of Nicodemus. From there, it continued west 4 miles. At that point, it turned south where it connected with a westerly road from Nicodemus right here. Finally, in the late 1950s, transportation authorities rerouted Highway 24 so it passed the town of Nicodemus on its northern border.",

It attracted hundreds who came to celebrate freedom.The annual Celebration became a popular event, attracting thousands from nearby settlements and towns. Wagons, buggies, and later automobiles lined adjacent roads for three miles in each direction. Food stands barbecue, lemonade, fried chicken, desserts, and more. Organizers added two dance platforms, one for black people and one for white people. Attendees listened to political spiels, watched horse races, gambled, and danced to local bands. Children rode the Ferris Wheel and merry-go-round. A representative from the famous Kinsley, Kansas, Brodbeck Carnival Company referred to the Nicodemus Celebration, saying, “You haven’t been to a carnival until you went to Nicodemus.” Descendant Orlo Van Duvall commented,” Las Vegas didn’t have nothing on them.”R.B. Scruggs later purchased the Welton property and planted cottonwoods alongside walnut trees, creating what locals referred to as the Grand Arbor. The location of the celebration was then changed to the Scruggs Grove. Beginning in the early 1930s, the Celebration transitioned to the townsite and the new township hall. In 1951, descendants celebrated for the last time in Scruggs Grove.Organizers eventually changed the name from Emancipation Day to Emancipation/Homecoming Celebration, which is still used today. The celebration now occurs the last weekend in July nearest to August 1<sup>st</sup>. In 2020, due to the Covid pandemic, planners hosted the first virtual Emancipation/Homecoming Celebration.In 1983, Mary Elizabeth Gage spoke for all descendants, saying, “Something we looked forward to from one year to the next. I think we were as anxious about the Emancipation Celebration affair…as we were about Christmas.”",

In this building the people of Nicodemus held their town council meetings, elections, and other town events.<br /> Having been denied self governance under slavery and later in the post-reconstruction era, this building symbolizes the freedom of the people of Nicodemus to choose their own representatives and let their voice be heard.<br /> Today the Township Hall acts as the defacto visitor center where visitors can learn all about Nicodemus",

The last of the three large groups that migrated west to Kansas to settle at Nicodemus arrived in spring of 1879. Earlier settlers homesteaded land in and around Nicodemus, compelling these newcomers to locate farther from town. Some of the homesteaders settled 4 miles south of here and called their area of Wildhorse Township Kebar after the local post office. This area had a cemetery and school but not a church. However, Reverend John Samuels who organized the group that settled here was an ordained Christian minister and held services in his home for family members. Rev. Samuels, his family, and others arrived in prairie schooners rather than by train from Leavenworth. Napue, Samuels, Craig, Sadler, Garland, Hall, and Travis are common family names of those who resided in this region that teemed with native grasses and natural springs. Area explorers can still view remnants of the Napue Homesteads, one directly across from the other on a hill 4 miles south on Road 360, south of the Samuel cemetery.",

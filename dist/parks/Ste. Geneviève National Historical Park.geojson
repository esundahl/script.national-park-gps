Jean Baptiste was the son of one of the first residents of Ste. Genevieve, Jean Baptiste Bauvais Sr., who appeared on the first census of Ste. Genevieve in 1763. Following the Flood of 1785, the Bauvais’ like many families had to move from the old settlement and rebuild. When they moved to new Ste. Genevieve, Jean Baptiste chose to build his home near the farmland of le Grand Champ to have easy access to his crops. The Bauvais family lived in the house until 1852 when Jean Baptiste Bauvais’s son sold the home. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{e04a6f95-cc46-4424-a4a1-37e184ab30a4}{136}\" paraid=\"2047717485\">The Amoureux Family  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{e04a6f95-cc46-4424-a4a1-37e184ab30a4}{210}\" paraid=\"283182860\">Pélagie and Benjamin Amoureux purchased the home from the Bauvais family in 1852 and lived there with their five children. Pélagie Amoureux was born in 1805, as Pélagie Vital. Pélagie was the daughter of a woman enslaved by Vital Bauvais. Pélagie was enslaved for the first 27 years of her life. During those years, Pélagie met a white Frenchman by the name of Benjamin Amoureux, who she fell in love with. Around 1830, Pélagie and Benjamin rowed across the Mississippi to Illinois where they were married by a Catholic priest. They then returned to Ste. Genevieve, where they presented their marriage certificate to the church and took communion together, meaning they were legally married in the eyes of the Catholic church. For the first few years of Pélagie’s married life, she continued to be enslaved by the Bauvais family. During that time, her first son Felix was born. Pélagie and Felix were manumitted in 1832, finally gaining their freedom. From 1832 until 1852, Benjamin and Pélagie continued to live apart until they purchased the Bauvais-Amoureux home. After buying the house, Pélagie and Benjamin lived the rest of their days in the home. The descendants of Pélagie and Benjamin continued to live there until 1923 when they moved away from Ste. Genevieve. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{d194d3e6-103e-453b-ba50-c4466f742c43}{219}\" paraid=\"601365177\">The Architecture  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{d194d3e6-103e-453b-ba50-c4466f742c43}{225}\" paraid=\"881191423\">The Bauvais-Amoureux House demonstrates a unique form of construction, poteaux-en-terre (post-in-ground), which means the vertical logs that make up the home are foundational. Today, only three poteaux-en-terre houses remain in Ste. Genevieve with five total known to remain in the United States. Another important architectural feature is the heavy timber trusses supporting the steeply pitched roof. The walnut ceiling beams are original, and the date of the construction has been confirmed by dendrochronology. The house was shortened, and interior alterations were made in the 1840s. While the house looks different today than it did when it was built, it is a great example of the post-in-ground vertical log construction.</p>",

        "name": "Green Tree Tavern",
        "notes": "Green Tree Tavern\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/green-tree-tavern.htm\n\nSince 1790, Green Tree Tavern has filled many different roles for many different people. For some, it was a beloved gathering spot, a place of business, a home. For others, it was a place where they were denied equality and freedom.<br />  <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">Architecture</span><br /> Green Tree Tavern is a French colonial <em>poteaux-sur-sole</em> building meaning the vertical logs on the exterior walls rest on a wooden sill on a stone foundation. Typical French colonial architecture consists of two to four rooms of roughly the same size. Green Tree Tavern strays from the pattern by including a large central room flanked by two or three smaller rooms. The home was built with two triangular chimneys, a wraparound <em>galerie</em>, or porch, and a raised basement. Construction began in 1790, a date determined using dendrochronology. By testing five pieces of wood, the house was dated as the oldest existing structure in Ste. Genevieve. <h4>The Janis Family</h4> Green Tree Tavern was built for the Janis family for whom it was both a home and a business for over 40 years. Like many French colonists in Ste. Genevieve, Nicolas and Marie Janis migrated from Kaskaskia, Illinois, arriving around 1789.The Janis family brought with them at least fifteen people who were enslaved. Clarisse was one of the women enslaved at Green Tree Tavern. Clarisse and other enslaved people were viewed as property and willed to Nicolas’ son, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/francois-nicolas-janis.htm\">François</a>, with the house after Nicolas died. <br /> <br /> After inheriting the house, François decided to open the home up as an inn. One guest wrote about his stay in 1806: “I was by no means disappointed; the landlord, a lively Frenchman, looked after my horses and his wife made me a cup of coffee with as much perfection as ever I drank at the Palais Royale or at the food of Point Neuf.” <br /> <br /> When François died, the house was sold. Clarisse was once again willed to another Janis descendent and finally received a license for her freedom in 1836. Afterward, she bought her own home just down St. Marys Road from Green Tree Tavern where she lived not far from her former enslavers’ family. Her home still stands and is now known as the Bequette-Ribault House.  <h4>A Masonic Lodge</h4> The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 encouraged many Americans from the East to move west across the Mississippi River. Some of these individuals formed the West’s first Masonic Lodge. Masonic Lodges are meeting places for Freemasons, members of a fraternal organization started by stonemasons in the medieval period. <br /> <br /> A request was made to the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania for the formation of the “Louisiana Lodge” in Ste. Genevieve in 1806. The petition was approved on July 17, 1807, establishing Louisiana Lodge 109 as the first Masonic Lodge west of the Mississippi River. Masonic Lodges are identified by several different symbols like “the square and compass.” Multiple Masonic symbols were carved into porch posts at Green Tree Tavern. The porch posts have since been replaced, but sections with historic carvings were preserved when they were removed.  <br /> <br /> Louisiana Lodge 109 held their first meeting on November 14, 1807, using François’ house and tavern as their meeting space. The Lodge quickly fell into financial trouble as it struggled to collect and send its dues to the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. As a result, Louisiana Lodge 109 lost its charter in 1824. By 1826, the dues had been settled and a new Lodge formed in Ste. Genevieve.  <h4>The Ziegler Family</h4> The Janis family owned Green Tree Tavern until 1833 when Mathias and Barbara Ziegler bought the home. Mathias and Barbara traveled from modern-day Germany to live in Ste. Genevieve in the 1820s. Mathias established a business with Jean Baptiste Vallé in 1827. Under their original business agreement, Mathias manufactured tobacco while Jean Baptiste ran the general store. After purchasing the house, Mathias and Barbara ran a successful tavern and tobacco shop from their home while raising six children. There are no records suggesting the Zieglers enslaved people at Green Tree Tavern. Instead, they chose to employ white servants.  <br /> <br /> Mathias died in 1835 leaving Barbara to run the family business and care for the estate. Many of Barbara’s children and grandchildren helped run daily activities at the tavern. One grandson, Lewis Ziegler, tracked daily transactions at the tavern in his daybook from 1839 to 1841. Items mentioned in his sales log include bread, beer, brandy, cigars, rubs, and glasses. Barbara and the Ziegler family ran the tavern and tobacco shop until the 1850s. After closing the family business, their son Francis began making payments to purchase the property and became the sole owner of the house in 1860. Barbara continued to live there until her death in 1862 and the Ziegler family continued to live in the home into the 20th century.  <h4>The German Influence</h4> The history of Green Tree Tavern mirrors changes that were happening broadly in the community of Ste. Genevieve. Though Ste. Genevieve started as a French town, people of many nationalities migrated to and through the area. After 1763, land east of the Mississippi River was controlled by British Protestants, causing French Canadians and other Catholics to move across the river. Many eastern American Indian Nations also crossed over as Europeans continued to force them from their homelands. Each political change, here and abroad, brought new waves of people to Ste. Genevieve. <br /> <br /> Beginning around 1830, thousands of German immigrants came to the United States. German author Gottfried Duden wrote a book in which he painted Missouri as an ideal place to live which may have inspired some of the German families who chose Missouri as their new home.  <br /> <br /> Many German families like the Zieglers settled in Ste. Genevieve. The German influx was significant. The church began offering German services and German language publications also became popular. By 1860, there were more German households in Ste. Genevieve than there were French. The German influence is still evident in the architecture and culture of the region. ",

Over the course of those 200 years the home and community shifted as the territory transformed from Spanish to French to American. The house reflects some of these transformations through renovations, additions and restoration projects that allowed the home to better suit the families that resided there. The Vallé family who first resided in the house played a role in guiding Ste. Genevieve through its many transitions.  </p> <p>Jean Baptiste Vallé is best known as the last commandant of Ste. Genevieve, a title he and several of his family members held. The commandant was the civil and military leader within Ste. Genevieve and served as a point of contact for the colonial governors and the everyday townspeople. The first Vallé to hold the position was Jean Baptiste’s father, Francois. Francois Vallé started as just the head of the militia but following the French success in the battle of St. Louis, in 1780, he was promoted to civil and military leader. The Vallé’s passed the position down until Jean Baptiste received the position in 1804 and served as the commandant who oversaw Ste. Genevieve's shift from French to American. Despite only serving as commandant for six months, Jean Baptiste was called the last commandant until his death in 1849.  </p> <p>Following the death of Jean Baptiste Vallé, the home was sold first to Anthony LaGrave, and then later in 1860 to Leon Papin and his family. Anthony LaGrave and the Papin family made a variety of changes to the home, which modernized it and made it better suited to meet the various needs of the families. Anthony LaGrave made the largest change to the property by adding an English-style roof and second floor bedrooms. He also transformed the first floor by adding an entry hallway and removing the large French colonial-era central fireplace. The Papins transformed the home by closing off sections of the full wrap-around porch to bring in modern plumbing and a kitchen in the late 1800s. </p> <p>The interior of the Jean Baptiste Vallé House is available during <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stge/planyourvisit/calendar.htm\">scheduled program times.</a> </p>",

These individuals were members of the wealthy families associated with houses managed by the National Park Service. The wealth of these families is evident by the impressive stone markers at their gravesites, but the average habitants of the early settlement were laid to rest without permanent markers.

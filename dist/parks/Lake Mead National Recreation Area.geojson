As water recedes, be aware of the potential for soft mud.<br /> <br /> All other water-oriented activities, such as boating, fishing from vessels and floating devices, swimming, snorkeling, and SCUBA diving, are prohibited in this designated area.<br /> <br /> Fishing equipment, bait and supplies are available at the marina store. A convenient fish cleaning station is located at the top of the launch ramp parking lot.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h3><strong>Beaches & Coves</strong></h3> <p>Boulder Beach has a variety of multi-use beaches, including North and South Swim Beaches at Boulder Beach which is popular for families and triathletes alike. The surface is graded regularly, but tends to be rocky.<br /> <br /> Be aware that as the lake levels get lower silty mud becomes exposed and people and vehicles have been known to get stuck. Always carefully test the ground before committing - even if it looks dry on top.<br /> <br /> To the south, visitors can setup for the day with their watercraft and enjoy boating in the Boulder Basin.<br /> <br /> Open dawn till dusk.</p> <p><br />  </p>",

Many visitors choose to take a guided raft or kayak trip from the base of the Hoover Dam to Willow Beach, stopping at coves, hot springs and waterfalls along the way. Others drive straight to Willow Beach where you can rent boats or paddlecraft and fish from the accessible pier.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Georgia, Times, \"Times New Roman\", serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; letter-spacing: -0.25px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Boating</span><br /> Willow Beach offers a range of boating services; including a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">launch ramp</a>, fuel on land and water, along with a variety of <a href=\"https://www.willowbeachharbor.com/watercraft-rates\">boat and equipment rental options</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.willowbeachharbor.com/paddlecraft-rentals\">paddlecraft</a>. Boat slip rentals and dry storage are also available.<br /> <br /> <font color=\"#222222\" face=\"Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif\"><span style=\"font-size: 25px; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Where to Stay</span></font><br /> Looking to spend the night? Willow Beach has an <a href=\"https://www.willowbeachharbor.com/willow-beach-campground-and-rv-park\">RV Park and Campground</a> with 28 full-service (water, sewer, electric) RV sites and nine tent sites. All sites have fire rings, picnic tables and 24-hour shower and laundry access. You can also camp in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/backcountry.htm\">backcountry</a> as you kayak up and down the river. <h3>Resteraunts and Picknicking</h3> You may choose to dine while viewing the water at the Willow Beach Grill, or the on-site <a href=\"https://www.willowbeachharbor.com/marina-and-camp-store\">store </a>sells a variety of snacks, drinks and charcoal. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/picnicking.htm\">Picnic</a><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/picnicking-old.htm\"> </a>tables and grills are available throughout the area. <h3>Hiking</h3> While there aren't any hiking trails at Willow Beach, you can hop in a canoe or kayak and paddle up river to access the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/hiking.htm\">Arizona Hot Springs</a>. This trail is located in a dramatic slot canyon that joins the river just downstream of Ringbolt Rapid. <h3>Fishing</h3> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/fishing.htm\">Fishing</a> is a year-round activity in Lake Mohave; each season bringing its own exciting opportunities. For those without a boat, there is an accessible fishing pier, and many enjoy fishing right from the shore. Fishing equipment, bait and supplies are available at the marina store. A convenient fish cleaning station is located east of the marina parking lot.<br /> <br /> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/southwest/fisheries/willow_beach/index.html\">Willow Beach Fish Hatchery</a> is located north of the marina near the fishing pier. They routinely release rainbow trout on Fridays. You can also tour their facility. <h3>Beaches and Coves</h3> The riverfront along Willow Beach Harbor includes a mixture of sandy and smooth rocky beaches with a few picnic tables and grills. If you travel by water north or south along the river, you will encounter many coves. Some offer special wonders of nature, including an emerald cave, hot springs and waterfalls.  <h3>History</h3> <p>From artifacts found along the Colorado River, Willow Beach might have been a prehistoric trading center. The Basketmaker Indians from Lost City started camping at Willow Beach around 250 B.C. In more modern times, Willow Beach became a well-known fishing camp on the Colorado River, and once Davis Dam was built, creating Lake Mohave, more amenities were added like pictured here in 1954.<br /> <br />  </p>",

Over vast amounts of time, the Colorado River has carved its way through the rocks exposed in the Black Canyon. These ancient rock walls are made of volcanic lava. Geologist estimate the lava erupted between 15 and 20 million years ago.<br /> <br /> From this overlook you can see Willow Beach in the Lake Mohave portion of the Colorado River. This iconic river established its present course about five million years ago. Carving its way downstream, the water erodes thick beds of sedimentary rock, sand and gravel while leaving the harder volcanic rock behind. The river follows a relatively gentle grade from the Grand Wash cliffs at the east end of Lake Mead to the Gulf of California in Mexico.",

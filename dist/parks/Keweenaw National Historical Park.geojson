Green sold mining supplies and general stock. By 1884, the building was occupied by a confectionery as well as a dry goods store. In 1888, the south storefront was still occupied by a dry goods store, but the north storefront was occupied by a coffin showroom, probably owned by the Argall brothers, John and William. They operated a furniture and undertaking business here until at least 1900. The combination of furniture and undertaking was common in those years. Cabinet-making skills used for making fine furniture were equally applicable to the production of caskets. Soon after they opened their business here, the Argalls moved to the south storefront, and the north storefront was occupied by a fruit and confectionery store again for several years. By 1908, William Kehl had a saloon in the south storefront, and Athens Anegone had the fruit and confectionery store next door. Anegone also ran a cigar factory upstairs. In the 1950s and 60s this building was home to the very popular Franklin Fountain, and later the Town House Restaurant. It became home to Copper World when Tony and Joyce Bausano purchased the building in 1977.",

In 1898 the duplex was demolished, and W.C. Kinsman built the existing sandstone building. It was designed by architect Charles Maass and built by masonry contractor Paul Roehm and carpentry contractor Bajari & Ulseth. Initially, the north storefront housed Kinsman’s horse and carriage supply store, specializing in harnesses, saddles, whips, ropes, blankets, and bells. Kinsman was known as the pioneer harness dealer in the area, having started in business in 1872.<br /> By 1903, the building was home to The Economy Store, H. E. Lean and Sons, proprietors, which occupied both storefronts and carried general merchandise. The Esther Hotel occupied the upper floors. Harold E. Lean and Joseph A. Lean also lived upstairs for a time in the early 20th century. In the 1910s, Kinsman’s son Frank opened a hardware store in the south storefront with Charles C. Wagner.

In 1870, he moved the business to this location, in a two-story wood-frame building, with a stone vault attached to the north side. Around 1890, it was replaced with a two-story brick building, which forms the oldest part of the building existing today. In about 1894, the second storefront with a second story was added to the building on the north side; a third story was added around 1905.<br /> From about 1894 until about 1910, the north storefront was occupied by Louis Sibilsky’s dry goods store, also an old Eagle River business. By 1916, Joseph Hermann had died, and the business was run by the Hermann Brothers Company, consisting of John and Lucas Hermann, and Paul Tritschler.

Holman and Williams were grocers. In 1900, they rented the other half of their store to Izzy Blumenthal, who sold dry goods and clothes.

George Jacka worked at the Cliff Mine before coming to Red Jacket in 1868 and working as a timber contractor for C&H. In 1875, he established a grocery business and built the first commercial building on this site shortly thereafter. Between 1884 and 1888, that structure was remodeled into a two-story brick-veneered double-storefront building. Around 1890 Jacka added a livery stable to his business enterprises, located at the back of the lot. In 1904 the first Jacka Block burned in a fire thought to have been started to cover up a burglary. At that time the south storefront was occupied by jeweler J. J. Ellis, and the north storefront by druggist Charles Fichtel. Upstairs were offices of the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company, W. W. Ellis insurance agent, and Drs. Labarge and Watson. Jacka quickly rebuilt after the fire. The entire main floor of the new building was designed for and occupied by the Merchants and Miners Bank.

By 1903, the business partners were able to afford their own homes in Laurium.<br /> In 1907 Richards left the partnership and established an independent clothing store in the Lisa Block on the corner of 6th and Oak Streets. In 1916, Penberthy and Spehar had a clothing store here. They carried Hart, Schaffner, and Marks Clothes, and advertised as “the home of good clothes.” In 1930 this building was home to Ward’s Electric Company, which sold electric lamps and appliances. Herbert Ward lived upstairs. In later years this building was home to Lepisto’s sporting goods store, and later the Anthony family established The Office Shop.",

Olson must have done well in business, for by 1900, the family was living at 519 Pine Street, a home they owned without a mortgage, and they had a domestic servant living with them. Sometime between 1901 and 1903, 423 5th Street became a Singer sewing machine shop. In an era when many people still made their own clothes, a sewing machine was an important appliance in the home and required a significant financial investment. Then sometime between 1917 and 1930 it became a barber shop, managed by Percy Penberthy, who resided at 209 Tamarack Street in Laurium.",

When he came to Red Jacket, Dunstan sold sewing machines, books, picture frames, notions, and organs. By 1893, the earlier Dunstan building was occupied by a saloon. When the existing building was first built, the main floor was occupied by a store known as a bazaar, selling picture frames and other items. The second floor was occupied by one or two apartments. The third floor was occupied by a lodge hall used by the Cornish fraternal group, the Sons of St. George. By 1917, the main floor here was occupied by a dress factory, and apartments occupied both upper floors of the building. In the 1920s, Gorshe Brothers bicycle and motorcycle shop was located here.

In the 1940s, the Tambellinis sold the bar to Lajeunesse & Lajeunesse, a father and son from Laurium. Though it has changed hands a few times since then, it's still known as the L&L.

At the time most steam locomotives could only drive in one direction, so a turntable was needed for them to turn around. The circular house built around the table was often used for storage and servicing of railroad equipment. Altered for modern use, the rounded sides of the building indicate its former use beside a central turntable.

The support of C&H allowed the company influence over curriculum and activities. However, with constantly increasing population by 1915 the original school was not capable of supporting local students. The original building was moved, and additions were made to support this larger body of students.

        "notes": "Italian Hall Memorial Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/italian-hall-memorial-park.htm\n\n<p>The Italian Hall Memorial Park is located just north of Elm and Seventh streets in downtown Calumet.<br /> <br /> The Società Mutua <i>Beneficenza</i> Italiana, or Italian Mutual Benefit Society, met at their social hall on this site for decades, renting out the upstairs to other area groups. The Italian Hall building was a two-story brick structure with space for commercial businesses on the ground floor and a large meeting hall with a stage on the second story. During a party here on Christmas Eve of 1913, a false cry of \"fire\" incited a panic that claimed the lives of over 70 people, many of those children. The building was demolished in 1984 amid concerns for public safety. A memorial park was created with the original stone archway repositioned in the center of the lot. Behind the building's reconstructed entrance arch, a granite monument lists the names of those lost. Interpretive panels tell the story of the disaster.<br /> <br /> A memorial service is hosted at the site each year on December 24th.</p>",

One of several mine shafts at the Quincy location, the #2 was the longest, extending over 9,000 feet along the angle and reaching an overall depth of 6,225 feet below the surface. Men mining on the 92nd level would have spent their entire 8-hour shift working more than a mile underground in 90-degree heat. Over time without use the shafthouse severely rusted, leading it to be resided in the mid-1980s - an early preservation effort by the Quincy Mine Hoist Association. ",

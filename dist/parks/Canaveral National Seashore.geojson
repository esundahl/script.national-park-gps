Settlers came as treasure hunters, having purchased maps to hidden riches. Others came as carpenters, fishermen, beekeepers, and farmers. These hardy folks were met with harsh environments, lack of fresh water, mosquitos and summer heat.<br /> <br /> All depended on the shallow draft steamboats that served the inland waterways for transportation of goods and people. It played an important role in Florida’s interior development before roads and rail lines were built. When the railroad came to Edgewater the Eldora economy was transformed. The little town was no longer on the main trade route.<br /> <br /> Two years of killing frost in the 1890’s wiped out most of the citrus, causing residents to leave. By 1900 nearly all business on the island had ended. Some families stayed and made the turn from a farming community to a resort area for visitors seeking refuge from cold northern winters. ",

They left the shells behind and formed mounds like the one here at Seminole Rest. Over time most of the mounds were destroyed and their stories lost with them.Oak Hill Mound, also called Sam’s Mound, once occupied the spit of land to your right. In 1918 it was reported that 2000 railroad cars of shells were removed from the mound for road fill.<br /> <br /> Quote from former resident, Jacqueline Snyder Stevens, “We always called it Sam’s Mound. They built the road out here for the railroad – just a little railroad- and they just cleared that mound. All the roads used to be shell. When they were taking down Sam’s Mound, I went down there often after I got out of school and I had quite a collection of pottery and stuff like that.”Please do not collect any artifacts from Seminole Rest property which are protected under the Archeological Resource Protection Act of 1985.",

Snyder's mound, the largest mound, is not one mass of shells but in some areas seventeen different layers deposited over time. In an effort to find clues to the Timucuans, archeologists are interpreting the layers. <br /> <br /> Clam shells make up most of the mound layers even though other materials, including oysters, conchs, and whelk shells and the remains of sea trout, shark, and bass were discovered. The abundance of clam shells indicates the site was mostly used for harvesting clams. <br /> <br /> There are layers that suggest there were periods when the mound was not used but instead was overgrown with vegetation. Remains of poke berry, hackberry, and skullcap in the layers show vegetation has changed very little over the centuries. Many of these plants may have been used by the Timucua for food, fuel, and medicine. ",

Snyder purchased this house and the surrounding land. They named their homesite “Seminole Rest” after the Seminole Indians. Their purchase saved the story of an even earlier culture – the Timucuan Indians.<br /> <br /> “Daddy bought the place from an Englishman, “Lord” Turnor – the buildings, this house, and the other house. There was a long dock that went out and the boathouse was on the dock. My father saw this place as he was going duck hunting with some people over across the lagoon. Then to come over and see it.<br /> <br /> It was vacant when my father saw it. He bought it and the 10-acre grove. Bet you can’t guess what he paid for it all, $2,000 for the hill, and 10 acres. Mother added to it – there was some land south of the grove between here and Sam’s Mound – just to protect it.” – Jacqueline Snyder Stevens",

Early explorers once thought it looked like a turtle shell from the ocean which is it's name sake. Currently it faces constant erosion from sea level rise and annual storm surge. Learn about shoreline stabilization efforts underway by volunteers from the University of Central Florida.<br /> <br /> Plant life on the mound represents the cross section of both the temperate and the subtropical. While making your way to the top observe the various plants present. Look for the oyster shells peeking out on the surface of the forest floor. Also explore the small fisherman’s path around the side of the mound which gives a view of the transect layers of the mound. Enjoy salt water fishing along the shore of Mosquito Lagoon.

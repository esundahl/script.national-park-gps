The hard conglomerate boulder compressed the softer dirt directly beneath, making it resistant to erosion. The boulder also acted as a massive umbrella, protecting the stone beneath from years of wind and rain. Over time, at least 6 feet (2.8 m) of the surrounding loose ground was carried away, leaving an ever-growing pedestal with a balanced rock perched on top. You can see this process taking place under many rocks in the area. At some point, the sheltering boulder may become too much weight for its pedestal, toppling and taking another fateful tumble.",

Slowly it liberates this water over time to create a surprisingly lush plant and animal habitat that delights and surprises those who discover it. The desert is astonishingly subtle and delicate. If you walk quietly, you will see and hear more. It can refresh observations and awaken inactive senses with each step you take.<br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead: </strong>The turn-off is 1/4 mile (0.4 km) east of Glen Canyon Bridge (the opposite side of the bridge from Carl Hayden Visitor Center) on Highway 89.

The parking lot and trailhead is located off US Highway 89, approximately 5 miles (8 km) south of the Carl Hayden Visitor Center.<br />  </p> <p>Changes are underway in this busy and beautiful place, including expanded parking and trail maintenance. Please respect construction closures. Much of the rim remains exposed, so watch your footing and keep track of children.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2> <p>The hike to the overlook is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) round-trip over a hardened path. The trail is accessible under the regulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. There are two shade strctures along the length of the trail, but not at the overlook. There are railings at the edge of the overlook's viewing platform, but not along the trail.</p> <p>As with any hike, be prepared with plenty of water, sturdy footwear, sunscreen, and other basic hiking essentials. Know that there is little shade along the Horseshoe Bend Trail. Avoid hiking during the hottest part of the day.</p> <h2>Where Am I?</h2> <p>Horseshoe Bend has been featured as a landmark for Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Grand Canyon National Park, the Cities of Page AZ, Kanab UT, St George UT, and the Navajo Nation. Boundary lines are very close in some places. Horseshoe Bend itself, and that part of the Colorado River, are a part of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. About nine miles downstream is where Grand Canyon National Park begins. US Highway 89, the land north of the trail to the Horseshoe Bend overlook, and the parking area for the trailhead are in the City of Page. The land south of the parking area and the trail and overlook are on the Navajo Nation. This mixture of jurisdictions provides a unique opportunity in the management of this magnificent trail and overlook.</p> <h2>An Entrenched Meander</h2> <p>Below the rim, the Colorado River makes a wide sweep around a sandstone escarpment. On its long downward journey to the sea, the river meandered, sometimes making wide bends, but always seeking the path of least resistance. Around 5 million years ago, the Colorado Plateau uplifted and the meandering rivers that crossed the ancient landscape were trapped in their beds. Over time, the rivers cut through the uplifted layers of sandstone.</p> <p>Here at Horseshoe Bend, the Colorado River created a roughly 1,000 ft (305 m) deep, 270º horseshoe-shaped bend in Glen Canyon.</p> <h2>Parking Fees</h2> <p and=\"\" area=\"\" bend=\"\" by=\"\" canyon=\"\" city=\"\" glen=\"\" horseshoe=\"\" in=\"\" is=\"\" located=\"\" lot=\"\" managed=\"\" national=\"\" of=\"\" page.=\"\" park=\"\" parking=\"\" recreation=\"\" service.=\"\" the=\"\" within=\"\">Horseshoe Bend itself is in the park, but the parking lot is on city land.

Nearly 600 miles (965 km) of deep canyons along the Colorado River stood in their way. One of the only places a wagon could reach the river from both north and south was at the mouth of Glen Canyon. Since the area was accessible and was a natural corridor between Utah and Arizona, a ferry was established there in 1873. Named after the first ferry operator, John D. Lee, Lees Ferry became an important route for pioneers, settlers and local traffic. In the 1920s, automobiles began using the ferry as a means to cross the Colorado River. It was recognized that it was time to find a safer, more reliable way for vehicles to cross. A bridge site was selected 5 miles (8km) downriver at Marble Canyon.<br /> <br /> Construction of the bridge began in June of 1927. This was rugged and remote country and it was difficult to get men, materials and equipment from one rim to the other, a distance of only 800 feet (244m). The ferry was used to transport materials when possible. However, on June 7, 1928, the ferry sank in an accident which killed three men. Since the bridge known then as Grand Canyon Bridge was nearing completion, the ferry was not replaced.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"display:block\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><span style=\"font-variant-ligatures:normal\"><span style=\"font-variant-caps:normal\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:normal\"><span style=\"orphans:2\"><span style=\"text-transform:none\"><span style=\"white-space:normal\"><span style=\"widows:2\"><span style=\"word-spacing:0px\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"text-decoration-style:initial\"><span style=\"text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"font-size:1rem\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"color:#555555\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">So, for the next several months, no direct route existed between Utah and Arizona. People had to travel 800 miles (1287km) around the canyon to reach the other side of the river. It was an historic day when, on January 12, 1929, the bridge was opened to traffic. At the time, it was the highest steel arch bridge in the world and made traveling between Utah and Arizona much easier. No longer did travelers have to contend with the moods of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry. The dedication of the bridge took place June 14-15, 1929. For such an isolated spot, it was an astounding event. Nearly 7,000 people in 1,217 automobiles arrived for the celebration. Speeches were given by the governors of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah and by the President of the Mormon Church. Bands, choral groups, and Native American dancers were also a part of the festivities. It was reported that airplanes flew under the bridge and as Prohibition was in effect, the bridge was christened with a bottle of ginger ale. The bridge was known as the Grand Canyon Bridge for five years following the dedication. In 1934, after great debate in the Arizona legislature, the official name was changed to Navajo Bridge.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <h3>The New Bridge</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glca/learn/historyculture/navajobridge.htm\">Navajo Bridge</a><span style=\"font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: normal;\"> </span><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-weight: 400;\">served the area well for 66 years. However, as automobiles and trucks became larger, wider, and heavier, the need for a stronger, wider bridge became evident. The historic bridge was only 18 feet (5.5m) wide and had a 40 ton (36 metric tons) limit. Approaches to the bridge on each side were dangerous with limited sight of oncoming traffic. Pedestrian safety was also a factor. Although pedestrians were not allowed on the bridge, the temptation was too great for many. Over a 13 year period, 72 accidents occurred on or while approaching the bridge; eight were fatal.</span><br /> <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" /> <span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"display:block\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><span style=\"font-variant-ligatures:normal\"><span style=\"font-variant-caps:normal\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:normal\"><span style=\"orphans:2\"><span style=\"text-transform:none\"><span style=\"white-space:normal\"><span style=\"widows:2\"><span style=\"word-spacing:0px\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"text-decoration-style:initial\"><span style=\"text-decoration-color:initial\"><span style=\"font-size:1rem\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"color:#555555\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"line-height:1.7\">The time had come to replace the historic bridge. It was decided a new bridge would be built just downstream from the existing bridge, with new approaches on each side. The historic bridge would remain and serve as a pedestrian bridge and provide visitors with a breathtaking view of the Colorado River 467 feet (142m) below.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Construction on the new bridge began in May of 1993. During construction, it was necessary to make sure no rocks fell into the river. There would be too great a danger to the rafters on the Colorado River below. A net was strung under the bridge to catch debris. All rock for the footings was cut and hauled up to the rim. Additionally, it was necessary to remove rock for the new approaches to the bridge. The rock was cut using a technique that made it appear natural and in places it was stained to give it a weathered look. On May 2, 1995, two years after construction began traffic was diverted onto the new Navajo Bridge</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">The dedication took place on September 14, 1995. Once again, the ceremony attracted a large number of people. Speakers included representatives from state and local governments, National Park Service, Native American tribes and Arizona Department of Transportation. The new Navajo Bridge was christened with a bucket of Colorado River water.</span></span></span></span></p> <h3>Navajo Bridge Interpretive Center</h3> <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box\"><span style=\"display:block\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Navajo Bridge Interpretive Center is open to the public year-round.

But as a basic level, a riffle and a rapid are much the same. Both are formed were a tributary flows into a main river, as the Paria river does here. Tributaries deposit sediment into the river channel. During floods this could include large boulders and rocks as well as sand and gravel. The debris clutters the river bottom and constricts the channel, forcing the river to gain speed and power. The river swirls thought or crashes over the debris-strewn riverbed, forming mild riffles or deadly crushing rapids. Paria Riffle is the first turbulence faced by boaters on their Grand Canyon river journey. Once through, over 90 named features still await them, and the rapids only get bigger. A flash flood may completely change a rapid overnight. Even on calm days, you can see the muddy Paria river depositing sediment into the clear Colorado river.",

Model map builder Robert Miller used information from topographic maps and overflights of the area to construct the model in his basement. It took over a year to complete. He cut the map into seven pieces to be transported to the opening of the Glen Canyon Visitor Center, later renamed after Arizona senator and water use proponent Carl Hayden.<br /> <br /> This terrain relief model of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and vicinity can only be described as precisely accurate. The topography shown was based on both topographic maps and aerial photographs. Everything on the map actually exists just as it appears to, considering the vertical scale of the model. When it was installed at the visitor center at Glen Canyon Dam, is was oriented to real life. You could use it for wayfinding.<br /> <br /> In 2017, during the installation of new exhibits at Carl Hayden Visitor Center, the relief map was cut into the original seven pieces and removed from the building. Two years later, park partners Glen Canyon Conservancy retrieved the pieces and reassembled the map at their Flagship office and retail store for the public to once again enjoy and plan trips. In mid-2023, renovations at the Powell Museum & Archives were complete, so the map has a forever home amongst relevant exhibits.

If so, consider the Vermilion Cliffs looming before you like a 3,000 feet thick red velvet cake, perched upon a Chocolate Cliffs base. This colorful cake can also be read as a stack of differing ancient environments. It took millions of years for each layer to form; time for the earth and landscape to change extensively while sediment stacked and cemented into layers. Geologists further divide the “steps” into specific rock formations: Environmental conditions at sediment deposition—like wetness or dryness—along with mineral presence account for differing rock appearance and color. The Vermilion Cliffs’ namesake reds come from an abundance of iron minerals in the rock sediment. When iron is exposed to oxygen in the air, it oxidizes, or rusts. The same chemistry that applies to a rusty old nail applies to the rock in this rusty-hued plateau.",

This high point offers a 360-degree panorama of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. It is a “must see” at anytime of day, however, sunrise and sunset adds a fusion of brilliant color to this awe-inspiring scene. There is a shade shelter and a bench for your viewing comfort. Bring a picnic, camera, and binoculars along and enjoy this delightful view.<br /> <br /> <strong>Safety Comes First</strong><br /> Take plenty of water. Wear sunglasses, sunscreen, and a hat. Avoid hiking in the hottest part of the day. Tell a friend where you are hiking and when you will be home. There is no railing at the viewpoint. Parts of the edge are very slippery. Watch your footing, and keep track of your children!<br /> <br /> <strong>Leave No Trace</strong><br /> Pack garbage out. Don’t disturb any plants or animals you come across. Dogs must stay on leashes no longer than six feet.<br /> <br /> In every view, there is a story. Like a window to the past, the landscape before you represents a timeline of natural and cultural events. Within the panorama that is Glen Canyon, stories and secrets are revealed; and through exploration, we discover some of its mysteries. Glance over the Glen Canyon landscape, and imagine events form a distant past.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Colorado River and Lake Powell</strong><br /> In 1869 Major John Wesley Powell led an expedition down the Colorado River, taking copious notes about the geography, geology, natural and cultural history he encountered along the way. With the building of the Glen Canyon Dam, nearly a century later, this reservoir would be his namesake. Lake Powell and the Colorado River provide water, vital to western habitation, by contributing to crop irrigation and water resources for the lower basin states of California, Nevada and Arizona, as well as Mexico. In addition, it provides clean hydroelectric power.<br /> Throughout the years, the Colorado River has been both friend and foe. It has been a barrier to cross and conquer, a way to explore uncharted territories, a provider of vital resources, and simply a means to experience the adventure of it all. Lake Powell and the Colorado River continue to fulfill our zest for adventure.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stories Within the Stone</strong><br /> On the north side of Lake Powell, the geological layers of the Straight Cliffs, Tropic Shale, and Dakota formations allude to a world long gone. Within the fossil record, a remnant of the Cretaceous period (144-65 million years ago) is revealed. Plesiosaurs, Ichthyosaurs, and Tortoises swam in a vast inland seaway. The shoreline sported a lush habitat and the first flowering plants appeared. Among them, dinosaurs roamed the earth and early mammals flourished.<br /> <br /> <strong>Franciscan Explorers</strong><br /> On July 29, 1776 two Franciscan Priests, Padres Francisco Atanasio Domínguez, and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante set out on a quest. With a small assemblage of men, horses, and cattle, they departed Santa Fe, New Mexico in search of a trade route to Monterey, California. With winter soon at their heels, they decided to turn back, reaching the Colorado River at the Paria confluence on October 26. Finding the river difficult to cross, the padres dispatched scouts to seek out a better location. Think of the frustration experienced by these hungry, exhausted, explorers. Imagine the desperate hope that motivated their search. On November 7, they finally forded the river in present day Padre Bay at a location now known as Crossing of the Fathers. Though they failed in their quest to reach Monterey, part of their original route would come to be known as the Old Spanish Trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Kaiparowits Plateau</strong><br /> Opposite Navajo Mountain, the Kaiparowits Plateau reaches in from your left. Though the origin of its name is unknown, some sources have revealed two possible, yet unsubstantiated meanings: “Big Mountain’s Little Brother”, or “One Arm”. One thing is certain, archeological evidence reveals the fact that Ancestral Puebloans hunted and gathered here. The diversity of the Pinion-Juniper woodland provided nuts, berries and grains to gather, as well as rabbits and deer to hunt. What kind of tools do you think prehistoric humans created to help them survive in a harsh desert environment?<br /> <br /> <strong>Wahweap Creek</strong><br /> Nested on the edge of the canyon, Wahweap Marina serves as a destination resort and launch point for modern day explorers seeking recreational adventure on present day Lake Powell. Wahweap Bay curves around from the left eventually joining the main channel of the Colorado River. Before the building of Glen Canyon Dam, Wahweap Creek meandered as an intermittent stream. Along this channel, seeps and springs occur, and the Paiute name of Wahweap, referring to the bitter taste of these alkaline seeps, is bestowed upon this canyon. Early river runners hiked up Wahweap Creek to seek out these cool grottoes. Other seep springs thrive within Glen Canyon providing vital habitats for many plant and animal species. Our continued stewardship will help protect these fragile and unique habitats.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navajo Mountain</strong><br /> On the far horizon, Navajo Mountain looms, a big dome erupting from the canyon landscape - a laccolith, a volcano that never came to be. Reaching an elevation of 10,388 feet (3,166m) above sea level, Navajo Mountain supports several plant life zones: desert scrub, riparian, pinion-juniper woodlands and ponderosa pine forests. It is one of many mountains sacred to the Navajo People.<br /> <br /> <strong>Tower Butte</strong><br /> Glancing across from left to right many buttes and formations appear. The most prominent on the far right is Tower Butte. Once a part of Romana Mesa, time and the erosive forces of water and weather carved and washed away the materials that connected them. Now this 1600-foot (488m) monolith stands solo and someday it too will crumble and disappear into the landscape.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Dynamic Force of Water</strong><br /> Water has played a significant role in Glen Canyon’s past, and continues to do so today. Deposits left by ancient sea beds, runoff from a melting ice age, undercutting seeps that create a desert oasis, erosion, and the flowing force of the Colorado River have all contributed to the dynamic scene before you. Within this tough and rugged landscape resides the delicate beauty of life. Butterflies dance from one wildflower to another, coyotes lurk in the shadows of twilight, ravens play in the air currents overhead. Water is the liquid gold that makes life possible within the desert environment, however, periodic drought can challenge even the heartiest species. We must be ever mindful of the challenges that plants and animals must endure, remembering we are respectful visitors in their desert home.</p>",

Where pioneers had persevered years before, the Weavers struggled to make a profit, and soon gave up their cowboy dream. Gus and Romana Griffin bought the ranch to enjoy their retirement in isolation and nature. In later years, the Griffins sold to a group of private investors who added electricity and replanted the orchard.In 1974, ownership changed hands for the final time. The National Park Service maintains this historic site to preserve the spirit of western exploration.",

Look for cairns (small stacks of rocks that act as trail markers) to lead you out. Wayfinding required. Use caution in extreme heat and avoid hiking during the hottest part of the day. There is always a potential for flash floods. Do not hike when there is potential for flash floods. <br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead: </strong>From Page, drive north on Highway 89 about 12 miles (19 km) to Big Water, Utah. Between mile posts 7 and 8, turn right, in the opposite direction of the Big Water Visitor Center. Turn right again in 0.3 mile (0.5 km), at a sign reading, “Glen Canyon National Recreation Area – State Highway 12.” Drive 4.6 miles (7.5 km) to the Wiregrass Canyon Back Country Use Area and park in the pullout. If you get to the side road for Crosby Canyon, you have driven too far.</span></p>",

Farm hands, bee keepers, hay bailers, and educators all toiled together to support and sustain life on a busy ranch. Native Americans and pioneers of differing faiths shared tales of success and hardship around glowing candle light within these outbuildings and homes.The tragic story of Lonely Dell character James Jackson told a tale of a school teacher who set off to bring back a wife only to return heartbroken on frostbitten feet. The cold cabin walls of his home played audience in his final moments. Jackson would be the first person buried at Lonely Dell cemetery under loose dirt and stones, but not the last supporting player to call the ranch community home.",

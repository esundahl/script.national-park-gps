The turbines are arranged in a line straight out from the wayside within a grassy lawn bordered on all sides by well-maintained trails. To the east, or right as you face the wayside, is a path that leads to the steps up to the Crissy Field Center. To the left is the parking lot. Straight ahead on the far side of the lawn is more parking and the San Francisco Bay Trail, which hugs the edge of the bay.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Golden Gate National Recreation Area is going greener. National parks are experimenting with innovative green technology and this climate-friendly park is working toward a goal of being carbon-neutral by 2016. Carbon neutrality is achieved through advances such as adding electric vehicles to the park fleet, incorporating renewable energy features and designing energy-saving buildings. There are plenty of places in the park where you can experience cutting edge sustainable technology.<br /> <br /> Crissy Field Center is one of the nation's greenest park-based buildings. This high performance modular educational facility is a model of sustainability where youth learn from the building itself.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: An aerial photograph of the Crissy Field Center and the surrounding campus complete with lawns and terraced walkways. The Center has elaborate arrangements of solar panels on three roof sections, and glass front walls and doors.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: In the lower right hand corner of the panel is an aerial photo of the main cellhouse on Alcatraz Island. The remains of the warden's house as well as the lighthouse are visible, as are the solar panels on the roof of the cell house.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Alcatraz has a number of sustainability challenges, from generating electricity on the island to shipping the sewage back to San Francisco. One major improvement was to add solar panels to the cell house reducing the amount of diesel fuel needed to run the generator.</p>",

There's a fenced-off section of dune plants and coastal scrub before a sandy shore that encircles the blue waters of the marsh. On the far shore is a large white two-story building. Cypress trees and thick bushes surround the building, obscuring it somewhat from this vantage. Further in the distance, you can see the domed top of the Palace of Fine Arts. To the left, east, the trail takes you to East Beach. Right, takes you to Crissy Field, Fort Point and the Golden Gate Bridge.<br /> <br /> TEXT: How a Coastal Wetland Works. This tidal marsh was designed and engineered to mimic a natural system. Like the dunes that front the wetland, the system thrives on natural disturbance. Freshwater and storm runoff drain from the land into the marsh, bringing sediment that settles or is flushed out to the bay. Tides continually ebb and flow, importing mineral and organic materials. Constant movement and mixing foster a biological storehouse of organisms that can tolerate fluctuations in salinity, dissolved oxygen levels, water temperature and moisture.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Three small, puffy birds on a sand dune. The birds have white underbellies and brown backs, heads and wings. Their heads are turned so that they're looking over their backs.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Sandpipers in winter plumage.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Original Mud Pie. Twice a day receding tides unveil nutrient-rich mudflats that serve up a feast to multitudes of shorebirds. Algae, fungi and decaying organic debris nurture countless invertebrates--insects, worms, crabs, clams and myriad others--that float, swim, settle to the bottom or bury themselves in the mud. This tidal menu refuels many shorebirds that stop over here during their long migration between the Arctic and South America. Though many species of shorebirds appear to eat together, their different feeding habits assure they seldom compete directly with one another for food.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration of a brown and white bird with a very long, thin needle-like beak. The bird is walking in shallow water with its head down, its beak near the water's surface. It's labeled, \"Marbled godwit.\"<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Long-legged wading birds ply the shallows for swimming creatures or sweep or probe the muddy bottom with their slender bills for burrowed worms, mollusks and crustaceans. Similar species such as sanderlings pick up tiny prey from the exposed mud surface or just below it.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Map of the Presidio. Included is a section of the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the San Francisco Bay to the north. Also labeled is a section of the Presidio beginning at a small body of water just inland from the shore of the bay and continuing down to the southeast corner of the Presidio is Tennessee Hollow watershed.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Freshwater laden with organic nutrients and minerals drains from the Tennessee Hollow watershed to merge with tidal inflows in the Crissy Field marsh. The mixing of freshwater with saltwater creates an estuary, a rich habitat for a diversity of plants and wildlife.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Located below the map. Yellow bulldozers in front of the reddish-brown dome of the Palace of Fine Arts. In the background, is the San Francisco skyline.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Construction of the Crissy Field tidal marsh in 1999 was supported by mitigation funds from the San Francisco International Airport. About 230,000 cubic yards of soil and rubble were excavated to create the marsh.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk west one fifth of a mile to reach the next wayside located on the northern side of the trail.</p>",

The wayside faces north, on the northern side of the trail.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: This panel stands along the bayside of the San Francisco Bay Trail. Directly in front of you is a fenced off section of dunes, mostly covered in dark green coastal scrub plants. Further out are the waters of the bay and the Marin Headlands. To the north west, you can see the Golden Gate Bridge.<br /> <br /> TEXT: These revitalized coastal dunes are a small remnant of an extensive ecosystem that once covered about one-third of the area that is now San Francisco. The sandy soil sustained a mosaic of native grasses, wildflowers, shrubs and oak trees adapted to a climate of mild, wet winters and summer drought. This coastal dune scrub community supported a diversity of animals from insects to grizzly bears. The transformation to cityscape has been devastating to both the dune habitat and its native wildlife.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Thick plant cover on a white sand dune. The plants are low to the ground, with yellow and pink blossoms. Their tendrils spread over the sand, extending their reach across the dune.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Adapted to desert-like conditions of low nutrients, high winds and extreme water loss, native plants stabilize the dunes. Growing in a patchwork, the plants capture moving sand and their lengthening root systems help hold the sand in place.<br /> <br /> TEXT: \"CPR\" for Dunes. The development and use of Crissy Field destroyed its natural dunes and decimated its native plant communities. Ecological restoration of the native dune system here has included the reintroduction of native plants grown in park nurseries and planted by park volunteers. A generous grant from the California Coastal Conservancy helped fund this project, and sustained CPR--community-based preservation and restoration--will assure long-term protection and care for these improvements.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A young woman and boy crouching on bare soil, facing each other. They're wearing work gloves, and the woman has a baseball cap on that's shading her face from the sun. They're both holding onto a small plant with long, thin tendrils above a small dug out hole in the soil. Behind them are more people crouching in the dirt, which extends far into the distance.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Thousands of volunteers helped restore Crissy Field. They removed countless invasive exotic plants and placed more than 100,000 native plants in the ground to help the ecosystem get established.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration of a plant with a white blossom with six petals around a light-yellow center. Its green leaves grow in threes and are rounded except for the front edge which is serrated. It grows along a pinkish-red vine.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Beach strawberry spreads rapidly by runners and forms dense mats that stabilize the soil. Its waxy leaves retard water loss.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration shows a plant that also grows on a vine, but has a more vertical structure to its blossom. The blossom is pink and round like a sphere, the petals growing in more of a three-dimensional pattern. The green triangle-shaped leaves with rounded edges grow above and below the flower.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The pink sand verbena's sticky succulent stems store water and trap windblown sand. Sand buildup stimulates the continued growth of this mat-forming perennial.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration shows a vertical plant with five small, round blue blossoms at the top of its stalk. Lower down on the stalk are five crinkly looking leaves, and at the very bottom, a dense section of smaller leaves growing close together.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Silky hairs on the silver bush lupine's leaves reflect heat and protect them from drying out. Capable of fixing nitrogen from the air, an advantage in nutrient-poor sand, these plants can live many decades.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration is of a plant with a long stalk with small round blossoms growing on both sides all the way to the tip, which is bent slightly to the right. At the plant's base are green, serrated leaves and spiky, yellow blossoms growing at intervals along the center of the stalk.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The thick roots of the beach bur stabilize the sand that builds up around the fast-growing stems. Its seeds have spines that resist movement in the shifting sand and enable the seeds to take root.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk west a little over one tenth of a mile and you'll arrive at the next wayside on the southern side of the trail.</p>",

To your right is a path that cuts diagonally west across Crissy Field.<br /> <br /> TEXT: U.S. Army Coast Defense Air Station. From 1921 to 1936, Crissy Field was at the forefront of military air operations. Home of the U.S. Army Air Corps' Coast Defense Air Station, the site included a grassy landing strip and the barracks, offices and hangars that typified the era of barnstormers and biplanes. Limited space for expansion and frequent fog eventually prompted the Air Corps to move north to Hamilton Field in Marin County.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Black and white photo of a biplane in mid-flight, close to the ground.

Like information technology today, aviation grew by leaps and bounds during Crissy Field's heyday. In the 1920s, the Air Service promoted military aviation with many news-making flights that involved Crissy Field, including aerobatic stunts and air races. Most significant were a series of long-distance flights. By 1936, airliners were crossing the nation regularly, and aviation was no longer only for daredevils.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph at the center of two biplanes flying in profile with Crissy Field in the background.

Crissy Field was the site of several record-breaking flights that helped make the world a smaller place. Given its strategic location on the West Coast and its capacity to accommodate both land and sea planes, Crissy Field influenced the expansion of military air power and the rise of commercial aviation. As the San Francisco Chronicle noted in 1925, \"It is here in the Pacific that the future drama of our expanding commerce will be enacted. The play of rival forces now finds the Pacific for its stage...\"<br /> <br /> TEXT: An Air Corps Aloha. In 1929, two PN9 seaplanes made the first attempt to fly from the mainland to Hawaii. Both aircraft were forced down short of their goal. One of the crews was adrift for 12 days before the men were rescued. Two years later an Army modified Fokker C-2 flew from the shoreline here at Crissy Field to the new Oakland Airport, then on to Hawaii. Charles Lindbergh called it \"the most perfectly organized and carefully planned flight ever attempted.\"<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Black and white photograph of a propeller plane from the front at a three-quarter angle. Its wings are straight and flat across the top of the cockpit, and the wheels below its undercarriage are small, resembling the black and white wagon wheels of a Radio Flyer. The propeller is barely visible because of a dark shadow. In the background is half of a building with an angled roof, and a large bay door left open. The plane is on display on a gravel lot next to a field of grass.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Specially modified to carry extra fuel and the latest navigational equipment, this Fokker C-2 transport, the Bird of Paradise, completed the first California-to-Hawaii flight in 1927 in less than 26 hours.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph shows a plane from a three-quarter rear angle.

Geologic forces have been shaping the San Francisco Bay Area landscape for 4 million years. The block of rock between the San Andreas and Hayward faults, under the bay itself is slowly sinking, and the mountains on both sides of the bay are being uplifted. Climate change and human activity have further altered the bay. The filling of wetlands has shrunk the bay's size, and human-caused silting has made it shallower. Only in narrows, such as the Golden Gate, does tidal flow maintain deep channels.<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: Map of the bay's underwater topography. Most of the image is a brown mass that represents depressions in the bay.

Movement along faults in the earth's crust causes earthquakes that shift land upwards, downwards or laterally and continually change the bay's size and shape.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Golden Gate's River. Cold climatic episodes within the last two million years captured ocean water in inland glaciers, lowering sea level and moving the coastline westward. Just 14,000 years ago, a glacier fed river flowed through the Golden Gate and crossed 20 miles of coastal plain before meeting the Pacific Ocean where the Farallon Islands are today. Subsequent warming has melted polar ice and raised sea level to create the largest estuary on the West Coast, San Francisco Bay.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An illustration of a brown, muscly bear walking along a rock ledge and in the background, a craggy mountain range with a river at its base.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Bay Area has supported different plants and animals as conditions have changed over<br /> millions of years.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk 355 feet west and 15 feet south to arrive at the next kiosk and wayside on the western side of the Warming Hut.</p>",

There are 3 colored illustrations at the bottom of the panel.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The land known today as Crissy Field has undergone many changes. once a rich salt marsh and homeland of Ohlone people, it was later a landing site for Spanish and Russian explorers, a venue for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition and a pioneering United States military airfield.<br /> <br /> Along with the entire Presidio, Crissy Field was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962. With generous community support, Crissy Field has been transformed into a spectacular 100-acre shoreline park at the center of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Revitalizing Crissy Field. Sponsored by the National Park Service and its nonprofit support partner, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, the revitalization of Crissy Field owes its success to community support and stewardship. The Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund provided the lead gift for site restoration, and many other individuals and organizations from throughout the Bay Area generously contributed time and funding.<br /> As part of the site restoration effort in 1998-2000, individuals and groups from schools, corporations and civic organizations planted more than 100,000 native plants to help restore natural habitat at Crissy Field. Community volunteers continue to play an important role in sustaining long-term stewardship of this national parkland.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: Pink sand verbena, a plant that also grows on a vine, with a vertical structure to its blossom. The blossom is pink and round like a sphere, the petals growing in more of a three-dimensional pattern. The green triangle-shaped leaves with rounded edges grow above and below the flower.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: There is an illustration of Indian paintbrush, a plant with teardrop-shaped leaves alternating their way up its stalk to a red blossom.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #3: There is a vertical plant with five small, round blue blossoms at the top of its stalk: silver bush lupine. Lower down on the stalk are five crinkly looking leaves, and at the very bottom, a dense section of smaller leaves growing close together.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Silky hairs on the silver bush lupine's leaves reflect heat and protect them from drying out. Capable of fixing nitrogen from the air, an advantage in nutrient-poor sand, these plants can live many decades.<br /> <br /> PANEL #3: The Bounty of the Bay-Panel Description<br /> DESCRIPTION OF PANEL: The panel faces north east. There are illustrations and a list of crabbing regulations.<br /> <br /> TEXT: San Francisco Bay abounds with fish. Striped bass, sturgeon, surfperch, anchovy, flounder and herring, among others, depend on the bay's shallow waters for food or to spawn. Chinook salmon and steelhead require highly productive ocean waters for growth. These two species, now in dwindling numbers, migrate from the ocean through the bay to their upstream spawning grounds. Steelhead spawn several times, but adult salmon make this journey only once. They die after spawning, and their newly hatched offspring migrate downstream to the ocean. Each generation of salmon lives there for three to six years before repeating the cycle.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: A Chinook Salmon and Steelhead Trout are illustrated in a profile view. Steelhead have a more greenish coloring, while the Chinook are a darker blue. The mouths of Chinooks are slightly more pronounced, with a pointed, beak-like upper jaw.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: These illustrations show differences in the jaws and gums of the similar steelhead and Chinook salmon. Should you catch a fish that looks like one of these, check these features. You must release steelhead, a threatened species.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: Illustrated depiction of 3 crabs. On the far left is a crab with a dark gray shell, and lighter gray pincers and legs. A Dungeness Crab, <strong>Cancer magister</strong> . Trapping Dungeness crabs is illegal. In the center is a red crab, <strong>Cancer productus</strong> . Its pincers are much larger than those of the Dungeness. The crab has a dark gray shell and pincers, and light purple legs. A brown rock crab, <strong>Cancer antennarius</strong> .<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Please observe these crabbing rules:<br /> - Crabs must be at least 4 inches across the widest part of the shell.<br /> <br /> - The limit on crabs is 35 crabs per person per day.<br /> <br /> - No Dungeness crabs may be taken. Born in the ocean, Dungeness crab larvae drift into the bay. The larvae transform into young crabs in food-rich shoreline areas. Since these crabs don't reach maturity until long after they return to the ocean, it is illegal to trap them in the bay.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: The next wayside is directly to the left of the kiosk if you're facing west, about 8 feet.</p>",

To the right, the Golden Gate Bridge stretches off to the right across the bay, with the rolling hills of the Marin Headlands behind it.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Fort Point Mine Depot. The Fort Point Mine Depot was created to defend the West Coast's greatest harbor from enemy attack. Here, U.S. Army personnel assembled mines, loaded them on ships and planted them in minefields outside the Golden Gate. An enemy ship attempting to enter San Francisco Bay would have had to maneuver through a deadly obstacle course. Completed in 1910, the depot remained in the service through World War II.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph of a building with an angled roof, a double door entrance and two identical windows on either side of the doors, highlighting the symmetry of the building. A curved path leads up to the entrance.<br /> CAPTION: Soldiers inserted explosives into the mines in their loading rooms. Extreme care was taken to ensure that no accidents occurred.<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: A map showing the coast you're standing on now, with a brown L-shape extending out over the water representing Torpedo Wharf, and white, rectangular blocks on the green area representing land. These blocks represent buildings, including the explosive storage facilities and the mine loading rooms.<br /> DESCRIPTION IMAGE: Illustration of two devices side-by-side. Each has several sections, arranged in a vertical line, and tethered together by a rope at the bottom connecting them horizontally. The device on the left has a tan rectangular prism labeled \"Planting Buoy\" that looks like a brick with a ring through its center tied to a rope that descends and attaches to a gray sphere, labeled \"mine case.\" Below the mine case is a metal clasp that attaches to the rope tether, labeled \"mine shackle.\" Below the shackle, are two rope tethers running parallel to one another. One rope is short, and goes straight down, connecting to a gray circular prism, the shape of a hockey puck and labeled, \"anchor.\" The other rope, which is knotted to the anchor, runs horizontally to the right, and is tied to a dark gray device shaped like a pie plate, with multiple cables sticking out from its sides like spokes on a wheel. This device is labeled \"distribution box.\" On top of the distribution box, at its center, is an upside-down \"U\" shaped ring, like the top portion of a combination lock to which a rope is tied, extending upwards to a device, labeled \"distribution box buoy\" which resembles a barrel turned sideways, to which it is tied.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: This schematic shows an underwater mine and distribution box, with temporary buoys that were placed during planting operations. Throughout the modern era of American harbor defenses (1890-1950), mines were considered to be one of the primary harbor defense weapons.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: The next kiosk is one fifth of a mile away. To reach it, first walk 50 feet to the south to get around the Warming Hut, then turn left to start back east. In 100 feet you'll encounter a path to your left.

Along the southern edge of the road are several long, two-story buildings with matching red roofs and cream-colored exteriors. There is a crosswalk to reach the southern side of the street 40 feet to the east, anticipated by a textured surface. On the northern side of the road is a paved path for cyclists and pedestrians that runs the length of Crissy Field. North of the kiosk is a small, grassy field separating the sidewalk from the San Francisco Bay Trail further north. The trail has a bench about 60 feet due north of the kiosk. The bench overlooks a sandy beach and the San Francisco bay, with a view of Alcatraz Island and the Marin Headlands. To the west is a row of picnic tables and barbecues set along a grassy field. The first table is 50 feet from the kiosk, and the barbecue is right of the table.<br /> <br /> PANEL #1: Protecting Wildlife<br /> <br /> TEXT: The western end of Crissy Field embraces rich and varied wildlife habitats-rocky shoreline, sandy beach, open water and piers. Designated a wildlife protection area, this site hosts many resident and migratory birds, which rest and feed here. Offshore, pelicans and terns plunge headlong into the water for fish. Grebes and cormorants gracefully dive for small fish and invertebrates. In the tidal zone, willets, plovers and sandpipers glean and prove the sand for worms, insects, mollusks and crustaceans.<br /> <br /> Watercraft and pets are not permitted in the wildlife protection area, but you may enjoy jogging, fishing, picnicking-and watching birds without disturbing them. Protecting wildlife, and providing you the experience of seeing them wild, is part of the mission of the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An illustration of three birds in flight.

Some 75,000 San Franciscans simply left after the disaster, but an even greater number, 250,000 homeless, stayed in the city and formed makeshift communities. During the crisis, the US Army managed 21 of the 26 emergency camps including four on the Presidio. Fortunately, the army had a large supply of tents on hand from the Spanish American War, which they provided as immediate shelter.<br /> <br /> <br /> As winter approached, 5,300 'earthquake cottages' were built. Modest though these structures were, they were an attractive offer that housed over 16,000 refugees at the height of their popularity. Trying to avoid permanent settlements of the cottages, the $2.00 a month rent went towards the purchase price of $50.00. Once purchased, residents were required to relocate their cottages from the camps. In today's SF housing market, two bucks a month to own in two years is quite the attractive rental offer, even without electricity.<br /> <br /> <br /> The 1906 earthquake left more than half of San Francisco's citizens homeless. Roughly 500 square blocks of downtown were reduced to rubble, including the decades-old immigrant neighborhood, Chinatown. Amid chaos and tragedy, city officials attempted to displace the Chinese community from the neighborhood they had called home since 1870 to the less desirable Hunter's Point area.</p> <h3>Chinese and the 1906 Earthquake</h3> <p>The 1906 earthquake left more than half of San Francisco's citizens homeless. Roughly 500 square blocks of downtown were reduced to rubble, including the decades-old immigrant neighborhood, Chinatown. Amid chaos and tragedy, city officials attempted to displace the Chinese community from the neighborhood they had called home since 1870 to the less desirable Hunter's Point area.<br /> <br /> The earthquake's leveling force was so devastating that of the 15,000 Chinese living in Chinatown before the quake, only 400 remained in the aftermath. Most moved to Oakland to start over. In the days immediately following the disaster, the army rounded up the Chinese that remained in San Francisco and relocated them to a windy section of the Presidio near the area where Fort Scott stands today.<br /> <br /> After a drawn out battle, the plan to permanently relocate the Chinese community never came to pass thanks to community resistance and the realization by city officials that they stood to lose lucrative trade with the far East and tax revenue if they went through with the move. The Chinese community returned to and rebuilt Chinatown, an enduring San Francisco icon.</p>",

Both are part of the same building, which features an all-glass facade and reddish-orange siding reminiscent of the Golden Gate Bridge. The building is segmented, with alternating sections with tall ceilings that draw back at a downward angle towards the back of the building and linking corridors with lower ceilings. In front of the entrance to the Beach Hut is a patio area with several large, green chairs and tables. Beyond the wayside across the lawn is a water fountain.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Crissy Field Center is an environmental education and leadership center for youth and their communities. Programs encourage new generations to become bold leaders for thriving parks, healthier communities and more environmentally just society. Through this partnership of the National Park Service, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy and the Presidio Trust, the Center also works to provide park opportunities for underserved audiences.<br /> <br /> This green building is on its way to attaining LEED Platinum status and the Center has been a Certified Green Business since 2010. From building construction to sustainability in its future--for people, and for the planet. \"Reduce, reuse, recycle\" are demonstrated here in many ways.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION: A simple illustration of the Crissy Field Center. The diagram shows the outline of the building's floor plan, as well as its walls, but not the roof. The result is an outline that shows the basic contours of the space. On the right side of the outline in the space where the roof would be is a yellow grid of squares that together, make up a rectangle, and above this, the sun, rendered as a yellow circle with lines radiating from it in a ring.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: Below the illustration of the Crissy Field Center several photographs along the bottom. The first is of a large solar panel mounted on a trailer. The panel appears to be one rectangular piece, but is broken up into 14 smaller black rectangles.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Because building components were manufactured off-site, construction waste was greatly reduced. The advanced pre-engineering substantially slashed the demand for raw materials and made the construction site virtually waste free.<br /> During construction, electricity from the grid was used as little as possible. Contractors had a solar generator on site that provided the electricity for their tools.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A long tunnel with a rounded roof made of wood panels. To the right of this photo is another photo, a close-up of several light brown wood planks.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Center abounds with creatively reused and repurposed materials. The raised flooring, for example, came from a Hewlett-Packard facility. The redwood siding is re-milled from lumber salvaged from an old railway tunnel in Marin County.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: The frame of a building under construction. Only two wood frame panels have been installed along one side of a wall. Two workers are in the midst of lowering and placing a windowpane next to them.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Every effort was made to incorporate recycled materials in the Center. More than 35% of the building is made of recycled content. This includes the steel frame (up to 95% recycled), light gauge steel walls, roof panels, ceiling tiles (77% recycled), and carpet tiles.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk 72 feet to the west, down the steps behind you and continue walking straight until you nearly reach the edge of the plaza and East Beach parking lot.

An asphalt trail borders the field, you can take it east towards East Beach or west towards Fort Point.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The 91st Observation Squadron. Crissy Field was home to many daring pilots who made their mark on aviation history. Among these famous flyers were Major Dana H. Crissy, who died in a crash attempting to fly to the East Coast from here, and Major Hap Arnold, who later led U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. In 1924, Lieutenant Russell L. Maughan flew from the East Coast to Crissy Field in one day from \"dawn to dusk,\" and Lieutenant Lowell H. Smith landed here after flying around the world.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: A black and white photograph of young man with a receding hairline and subdued smile wearing an elaborate uniform with gold, braided epaulets, a stiff, high collar and twin rows of brass buttons running from his chest to his belt. The sleeves of his uniform are decorated with three loops like a clover, and two small lines that cross each other in an \"X\" with a circular button at their center, just above a broad stripe marking the cuff.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The airfield's namesake, Major Dana Crissy, commander of Mather Field in Sacramento, crashed while attempting a transcontinental flight that left here in 1919.

The sheet has several prominent circular tears, as though something has punched through it.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Air Corps members show off a target sleeve after a practice mission with antiaircraft gunners.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: To the right of the photo of the Air Corps members, is one of many women dressed in long coats, cowls, goggles and boots. Several of them are holding small children, all of whom are wearing winter hats and coats. Behind the women, clearly visible above their heads, is the propeller of a plane, upon which sit three toddlers in pullovers and shorts.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Behind the Flight Line. Officers and their families were housed on the bluff by the Golden Gate. Enlisted men lived in the three-story barracks behind you. The mothers, wives and children of the aviators were authorized to go aloft on special occasions to \"eliminate worry\" about the risks their daring men were taking. Their happy expressions suggest the strategy worked.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk east just under one half mile to reach the next wayside located on the northern side of the trail.<br />  </p>",

Wetlands swarm with life and produce more food per square inch than the richest California farmland. Their complex food webs are based on detritus, the decaying remains of dead plants, rather than on living green plants as in terrestrial ecosystems. Flooded by bay tides twice daily, salt marshes serve as nurseries for countless marine fish and invertebrates, many of them food sources for people. Wetlands offer shelter, breeding habitat and abundant food for an array of animals, from microscopic plankton to large animals. Tidal estuaries also filter out pollutants and prevent flooding by capturing storm runoff.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: An illustration of 6 different marsh plants growing in a sand dune near water.<br /> PLANT #1: The first plant is the tallest, with long, thin green leaves and wispy, wheat-like tops. It's labeled \"cordgrass.\"<br /> PLANT #2: Next on the dune are three green stalks growing vertically, with smaller stalks stemming from the main one. The tops droop slightly. The plant is labeled, \"pickleweed.\"<br /> PLANT #3: Following the pickleweed is a rendering of arrow grass, which has several green, vertical tendrils that grow halfway up the plant, around a taller center stalk.<br /> PLANT #4: To the right of the arrow grass is a plant that creeps along the surface of the dune, Jaumea. With little yellow flowers and alternating little leaves, Jaumea grows more horizontally than the other examples of dune plants.<br /> PLANT #5: To the right of the Jaumea is a rendering of salt grass. These two plants share a certain resemblance. Both have yellow flowers and thin leaves that alternate up the stalk. Salt grass, however, has more of a vertical structure.<br /> <br /> PLANT #6: The last image is of a plant with many oval-shaped green leaves at its base, and and many forking stalks with blue blossoms at their tips. It resembles a miniature tree, with many branches. It's labeled \"sea lavender.\"<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Salt-marsh plants tend to grow in distinct bands parallel to the shoreline. Tide levels determine soil salinity and how long plants are submerged, thus defining where each species can grow. A mere inch or two of elevation can make a significant difference in the vegetation mosaic. Marsh plants grown in park nurseries from seeds collected in six neighboring wetlands were planted in and around the Crissy Field marsh.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: A photograph of tall, thin stalks growing thickly in a marsh. The stalks are a healthy, dark green.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: California cordgrass, common in salt marshes, excretes excess salt that crystallizes on its leaves. Because cordgrass grows in waterlogged, oxygen-deprived mud, its stems, containing specialized tissue, transport oxygen to the roots.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF #2: Photograph close up of a marsh plant, only this one has a brown and white patch of dead and dying stalks, which are shorter and resemble elk antlers, with small, branching sections coming off a main stem.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The succulent tissues of pickleweed maintain an internal salt level equal to that of the surrounding soil or water. The plant absorbs freshwater and concentrates excess salt in the tips of its fleshy leaves.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Build it and They Will Come. The Crissy Field tidal marsh and lagoon restore vital natural habitat and ecological diversity within an urban setting. Birds began frequenting the site even before the marsh was fully excavated. Opening the marsh channel in 1999 brought together bay saltwater with freshwater runoff, attracting yet more birds in dramatic numbers and variety, some for the first time in almost a century. The calm waters and dense foliage of the fully evolved wetland will offer a feeding and roosting refuge for both resident bird species and migrants on the Pacific flyway.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: On the far right of the panel is an illustration of the American continents, with an icon of a flying bird running the length of the West Coast, the southern tip of Argentina up to Alaska.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Every spring and fall about 11 million birds of more than 100 species migrate along the Pacific coast to or through the Bay Area. Nearly three-fourths of them rest and feed in the region's tidal marshes, many for the entire winter. Sanderlings, for example, nest on the Arctic tundra and winter as far south as Tierra del Fuego. They linger at Crissy Field to feed and rest during their migratory flights of up to 15,000 miles.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk east just over one tenth of a mile to reach the next wayside, located on the northern side of the trail.</p>",

Twenty feet away is a small fence barring access to the marsh waters and a tall, bushy willow and other coastal plant species. There is a small clearing directly in front of the wayside. Three feet to your right is a trash can.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Presidio Quartermaster Depot. From the 1870s until the early 1900s, the Presidio Quartermaster Depot at this site stored provisions and equipment for the soldiers stationed here. Two wharves gave supply ships access to the depot. Warehouses and stables covered the area and trash was dumped in the adjacent marsh, considered a wasteland at that time. In 1912, the marsh was completely filled, creating a foundation for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915 and subsequently for the Crissy airfield.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: To the right of the text at the top center of the panel is a black and white photo of several men standing next to six overturned carriages with wooden spoke wheels. Behind them are three long, two-story buildings at the intersection of a wide street.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Barracks and supply buildings at the northern-most end of the Quartermaster Depot area, ca. 1898.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: At the bottom of the panel are three photos of objects side by side. On the left, is a clear, glass bottle with raised lettering that reads, \"Rubifoam for the Teeth, Put Up by E.W. Hoyt & Co., Lowell, Mass.\" To the right of the bottle is an advertisement with the image of a blonde woman with a headband covered in daisies on her head, with long, curly blonde hair. Around her neck is a white silk scarf and she's holding two kittens and four pink flowers in her lap. She's smiling so that her top row of teeth shows. She's encircled by an oval frame, which sits in the middle of a portrait-oriented rectangle. The rectangle has a green trim, with the words \"The Teeth, their care and preservation,\" at the top, and \"E.W. Hoyt & Co., Lowell Mass\" along the bottom. To the right of the advertisement is a white bowl with a gold ring around its outer lip. On its base is the image of a crossed sword with hilt, and a shovel. The characters \"4\" and \"B\" appear above and below the space where the sword and shovel cross, respectively.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Archaeological artifacts are important remnants of historic sites, buildings and landscapes and help tell the stories of earlier people. Removing them damages culturally significant sites piece by piece. Artifacts are protected under federal law. Please leave them in place!<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE IN #3: In the bottom right corner of the panel is a photo of two men in coats, sunglasses and brimmed hats standing facing one another with a table between them. They're both facing down at the table, sifting through several small, metal objects.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: During construction of the new tidal marsh in 1999, archaeologists recovered much of the historic refuse dumped in the former marsh. These artifacts enhance our understanding of daily life at the Presidio.<br /> <br /> TEXT: A Strategic and Useful Site. Long before the Presidio became a U.S. military post, this waterfront site hosted a succession of human events. Originally a system of marshes, it was a seasonal home to native Ohlone people for thousands of years. In the 18th century, Spanish sailors came ashore here. Russian, English and Boston traders negotiated deals on this shore in the early 19th century, and in 1846, Americans led by John C. Fremont landed on this waterfront to silence the cannon at the Mexican Castillo, where Fort Point was later built.</p>",

The tall, metallic vertical-axis wind turbine poles line the edge of the lawn in front of the sidewalk that borders the East Beach parking lot. Immediately to your left is an asphalt path that leads to stairs up to the Beach Hut Cafe. Go up the stairs and continue straight to go to the Beach Hut, or turn right, then left, for the entrance to the Crissy Field Center. Before the stairs that lead to the Beach Hut and Crissy Field Center is another path to the right, which takes you to several wooden benches on the left-hand side of the path. Directly behind the wayside about 30 feet away, are trash and recycling bins.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Using Nature's Gifts to Achieve Sustainability. What if each building was able to supply its own energy and water? What will our world be like? And what will our future look like? There are many ways to reduce a building's impact on the environment. One way is to maximize the use of natural elements: sun, wind and rain. Crissy Field Center harnesses nature to \"off-set\" the resources the building would otherwise need from the grid (the network of electricity, gas and water lines). For more information about all of the Center's green features and to see how its systems are performing, check out the interactive building dashboard for real-time data: http://frogdashboard.com/crissy/home.htm<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: A photograph of a row of three black, rectangular solar panels on the roof of a building set at a 45-degree angle with the roof.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Off-Setting Electricity. Five vertical-axis wind turbines (of three designs) capture the wind that rushes through the Golden Gate. Wind speeds average 10.5 miles per hour in this area. This experimental 5.4-kilowatt (5,400 watts) system is wildlife safe, quiet and operates at relatively low wind speeds. The turbines along with the 28kW solar panel array help to off-set the electricity needed from the PG&E grid.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Off-Setting Natural Gas. The cafe utilizes a solar thermal hot water heater. The energy from the sun preheats water, which then moves to a standard gas heated water tank. Pre-heated water reduces the amount of gas needed to keep water hot in the tank.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A large, dark green tank with a domed cover and a metal pipe connected to it on its right side surrounded by creosote bushes. In the background, part of a building is visible on the right.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Off-Setting Water. A 5,000-gallon catchment tank collects rainwater for use in the facility's restrooms. More than 50% of the water used to flush toilets is reused greywater.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: In the top right corner of this panel is a photograph of a long building with many windows that alternates between two-story and single-story sections, the Crissy Field Center. In front of the center, the photo captures the image of three metal poles with different shapes at the tops.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: The next wayside is a little under two tenths of a mile west. Facing the Natural Off-Set wayside, walk to your right, or west, along the grassy edge of the lawn bordering the parking lot 70 feet. To your right is a crosswalk across the parking lot to the San Francisco Bay Trail waterfront path. The crosswalk takes a diagonal jog north west across the parking lot to the edge of the San Francisco Bay Trail. From where you stand, walk 18 feet to your right to cross the parking lot in the crosswalk, then, change your trajectory slightly left for 30 feet to stay in the crosswalk, then slightly right for 18 feet until the parking lot ends. Then, walk straight, or north, 30 more feet. Now you are on the San Francisco Bay Trail, a wide area for bikers, joggers and pedestrians to walk along the edge of the Bay from East Beach to Crissy Field and further west to Fort Point. The trail periodically has benches on its southern edge.</p>",

Facing west from the kiosk, the San Francisco Bay Trail is to your right, hugging the edge of the bay, and stretches on into the distance towards Crissy Field and to the north west, the Golden Gate Bridge. To the left, and south, is a concrete bathroom building in a grassy field. The bathroom also includes a dog wash station and water fountain. To the east, is the Crissy Field Center.<br /> <br /> PANEL #1: A Place of Renewal<br /> <br /> TEXT: The land known today as Crissy Field has undergone many changes. once a rich salt marsh and homeland of Ohlone people, it was later a landing site for Spanish and Russian explorers, a venue for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition and a pioneering United States military airfield.<br /> Along with the entire Presidio, Crissy Field was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962. With generous community support, Crissy Field has been transformed into a spectacular 100-acre shoreline park at the center of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.<br /> Revitalizing Crissy Field. Sponsored by the National Park Service and its nonprofit support partner, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, the revitalization of Crissy Field owes its success to community support and stewardship. The Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund provided the lead gift for site restoration, and many other individuals and organizations from throughout the Bay Area generously contributed time and funding.<br /> As part of the site restoration effort in 1998-2000, individuals and groups from schools, corporations and civic organizations planted more than 100,000 native plants to help restore natural habitat at Crissy Field. Community volunteers continue to play an important role in sustaining long-term stewardship of this national parkland.<br /> <br /> <br /> ILLUSTRATIONS: In the lower portion of this panel are three illustrations of plants.<br /> ILLUSTRATION #1: An illustration of pink sand verbena, a plant that also grows on a vine, with a vertical structure to its blossom. The blossom is pink and round like a sphere, the petals growing in more of a three-dimensional pattern. The green triangle-shaped leaves with rounded edges grow above and below the flower.<br /> <br /> ILLUSTRATION #2: An illustration of Indian paintbrush, a plant with teardrop-shaped leaves alternating their way up its stalk to a red blossom.<br /> <br /> ILLUSTRATION #3: An illustration shows a vertical plant with five small, round blue blossoms at the top of its stalk: silver bush lupine. Lower down on the stalk are five crinkly looking leaves, and at the very bottom, a dense section of smaller leaves growing close together.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Silky hairs on the silver bush lupine's leaves reflect heat and protect them from drying out. Capable of fixing nitrogen from the air, an advantage in nutrient-poor sand, these plants can live many decades.<br /> <br /> PANEL #2: Enjoying Crissy Field<br /> <br /> TEXT: The National Park Service invites you to enjoy all that Crissy Field, the Presidio and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area have to offer. Crissy Field has been designed to accommodate a variety of uses. For the safety and enjoyment of all visitors and the protection of national park resources, please obey park rules.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP: A map of the San Francisco Bay coastline, from the San Francisco side, that includes Marina Gate and Entry Grove to the east and stretches all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge to the west. Several areas within the parkland are labeled, including the Warming Hut to the west near Fort Point, then moving east: Golden Gate Promenade, the Tidal Marsh and East Beach.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Regulations.

The Maritime climate at Crissy Field is one of moderate temperatures-averaging between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit year-round-with a total precipitation of 20 inches annually. However, the wind that funnels continually through the Golden Gate creates harsh conditions here. The salty ocean wind dries and blows the sand ashore, fashioning dunes, blasting and covering plants and perpetually remodeling the shoreline landscape.<br /> During summer the wind causes colder deep seawater to surface. The cold water condenses the moist air to form fog. As heated air inland rises, the fog is drawn eastward through the Golden Gate and over the coastal ridges, making San Francisco summers typically cool.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photograph of a windsurfer, leaning at a 45-degree angle with arms outstretched, holding on to the white sail of his board.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The wind at Crissy Field can be not only invigorating to walkers and runners, but it also offers boardsailors one of the most challenging sites in the world. The best boardsailing conditions occur between March and October, when the wind blows strongly onshore.<br /> <br /> TEXT: How Crissy Field Got Its Name. In 1918, the U.S. Army sent 61 airplanes racing in short hops across the continental United States to test aircraft reliability and endurance. Major Dana H. Crissy led the west-to-east contingent, which left from the still-unmanned airfield at the Presidio. He died in a crash on the first day out. In 1921, Major Hap Arnold, pioneer military aviator and later a five-star general, saw to it that the air base was named in Crissy's honor.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: In the bottom left corner of the panel is a black and white photograph of Major Crissy, standing in profile with his arms behind his back, wearing full aviator uniform with hat and goggles resting on top of his head.</p>",

Cypress trees offer some shade to cars in the parking lot near East Beach, to the right of them, you can see the bathroom building at the far end of the grassy field that starts to your right.<br /> <br /> NOTE: This exhibit was prepared in collaboration with the Ohlone community. Illustrations and text courtesy of Linda Yamane, Rumsien Ohlone.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Traditional Uses of Native Plants. Ohlone people used plants for food, tools, building materials, boats, baskets, twine, medicines, musical instruments, games and more. Their small population and their understanding of plants made it possible for them to use resources without depleting them. Today, we must be careful not to overuse what remains. We can, however, learn from Ohlone tradition, seeing native plants with renewed respect and appreciating the resourcefulness of this area's first people. As part of the restoration of Crissy Field, the National Park Service reintroduced many native plant species, including several shown here, which were traditionally used by the Ohlone.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: An illustration of a wispy, feathery-leafed plant next to a woven basket. The basket is two-toned, with a ring of black triangles pointing downward along the top and inside lip of the basket. A similar pattern is continued further down, with a solid black ring making its way around the basket, with a series of angled quadrilateral shape, like a trapezoid, extending down from it. The space between these four-sided shapes forms a rectangle, the bottom edges of which, serve as the base of another row of black triangles.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Bracken Fern, <em>Pteridium aquilinum</em>, Spanish: Manita, Rumsien Ohlone: Witt (pronounced: WEET). Traditionally, bracken fern fronds were used as umbrellas, roof-thatching and the lining of earth ovens or acorn-leaching basins. The underground runner contains a dark band of material that is used to create patterns in basketry.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: An illustration of the basket and fern is another illustration of a plant, one with slender oval leaves and a light green coloration.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Arroyo willow, <em>Salix lasiolepis. </em>Spanish: Sauz de la oja finite. Mutsun Ohlone: Tarhasan (pronounched TAR-hah-sahn). Willows have served Ohlone people for countless generations, providing framework for thatched houses, a pain reliever found in the bark, and material for weaving the various baskets so important in everyday life.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #3: An illustration of another plant and its root bulb. The plant has long, curling leaves that all stem from the center of the plant, just above the bulb. Next to this is an illustration of a hand holding a thick paint brush going over a woven basket.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Soap root,<em> Chlorogalum pomeridianum</em>. Spanish: Amole. Mutsun Ohlone: Torow (pronounced: to-RO). The bulb of this plant, when mixed with water, lathers into a fine soap or shampoo. The brown fibers that surround the bulb are tied into sturdy little brushes that are used when preparing acorn meal. In the past, the edible bulbs were baked into underground ovens or crushed and placed in water to stupefy fish for an easy catch.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #4: A plant with a long, tall stalk with pairs of round leaves growing at intervals to its top. The leaves are fairly round but come to a point at their end and are a bluish-green color.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Yerba Buena, <em>Satureja douglasii</em>. Spanish: Yerba Buena. Rumsien Ohlone: Tcawricim (pronounced: CHOW-reesh-eem). The city of San Francisco was first named for this aromatic little mint, which means \"good herb\" in Spanish. Ohlone people have long valued the medicinal properties of yerba buena, drinking it as a tea for good health.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #5: The second plant illustration shows a bright orange bowl or bell shaped flower rising above the green stalks below. Two orange cones, unopened blossoms, are visible lower on the plant.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: California poppy, <em>Eschscholtzia californica</em>. Spanish: Amapolla. Rumsien Ohlone: Cululuk (pronounced: SHOO-loo-look). While it is well known today as the state flower, did you know that Ohlone people once brewed poppy flowers into a remedy for head lice? They also placed these flowers beneath a child's bed to encourage sleep.<br /> <br /> TEXT: What is a Dune Swale? The area in front of you is known as a dune swale. Lying below the water table between sand dunes, these depressions seasonally pool freshwater that seeps up through the soil. The freshwater sustains plants, such as those shown here, that are less tolerant of the salty dunes and tidal marsh.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: To the right of the wayside, follow the path right as it curves around the trash cans and heads north west. You'll pass four picnic tables and barbecues on the right. Walk 280 feet until you reach the next wayside to the left of the path facing west.</p>",

To the right, or northwest, the density of the coastal scrub plants lessens, and on clear days, affords a clear view of the Golden Gate Bridge, the bay and the Marin Headlands. Behind and to the right of the wayside are picnic tables. A path to the right curves around to the left along the coastal scrub and connects to the San Francisco Bay Trail at a section with a bridge over the marsh. To the left of the wayside there's a gate that leads to a boardwalk bridge over the marsh, and, a wayside panel.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Based on archeological study, native people have lived in this region for at least 8,000 to 10,000 years, and in what is now San Francisco at least 5,500 years. Traditional creation stories place the origins of the Ohlone people to \"a time out of memory.\" The Yelamu, an Ohlone tribe, inhabited the tip of the San Francisco peninsula at the time Spanish colonization began in the 1770s. These lands bordering the bay provided the Yelamu with a rich array of plants and animals that supplied food, tools, ornaments and shelter.<br /> <br /> An abundance of plants and animals in this estuarine location sustained the Yelamu. In limited archeological excavations at this site, the remains of at least 84 species were found. These include shellfish, surfperch and various other fish (huyi in Ohlone); birds, chiefly seabirds, waterfowl, shorebirds, birds of prey, ravens and crows; marine mammals and assorted terrestrial mammals, including sea otters (shuushch), harbor seals (asks), tule elk (tiwu) and grizzly bears (ores).<br /> <br /> These Ohlone words are from the well-documented southern Rumsien and Mutsun dialects. Only a few words from the Ramaytush dialect spoken here were ever recorded.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: A detailed illustration of an Ohlone dwelling. Shaped like a bell, the structure is made of woven natural fibers, with a rounded opening on one side.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The most common type of Ohlone house (illustrated here by Linda Yamane, Rumsien Ohlone) along the bay shore was a domed structure made from the wood of willows and thatched with tule.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: To the right of the illustration of the Ohlone house is a drawing of three Ohlone people in a small canoe. Two of them are men, shirtless with their long, black hair tied on top of their heads and headbands around their foreheads holding long, pointed paddles in both their hands over their shoulders. Between the men is a woman dressed in a white, hooded cloak. The waters are calm, and the hilly land formations behind them plainly visible.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Ohlone people made boats of tule, which they used for transportation, fishing and hunting.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: On the right hand side of the panel is a photograph of an empty dirt patch with a brown sign with white lettering that reads, \"Crissy Field Project.\"<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Preserving an Ohlone Cultural Site Together. Buried remnants of a seasonal Yelamu village were discovered here before the reconstruction of the Crissy Field marsh began. In consultation with Ohlone tribes, individuals from the Ohlone community and archeologists, the National Park Service redesigned the marsh to preserve this native heritage. This decision reflected the preference of the National Park Service and the Ohlone community to preserve this site rather than disturb it.<br /> <br /> Middens--accumulations of bones, shells, food refuse, fire pits and discarded and lost materials--mark the locations of ancient encampments. Some middens contain the remains of human burials, although none were found here.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A photograph of a black, obsidian stone arrow, with one smooth and one serrated edge.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Arrowhead styles signify specific time periods. This obsidian projectile point, along with shell beads, the remains in soil layers and scientific dating methods, indicates this site was occupied 200 to 600 years ago.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: From the wayside, walk to your left about six feet where you will find a boardwalk and gated fence. The latch to the gate is on the top left. Proceed through the gate onto the boardwalk about 400 feet until you reach a wayside on the right.</p>",

Beyond the marsh are sand dunes butting up against the waters of the San Francisco Bay, and further north, the Golden Gate Bridge in front of the Marin Headlands.<br /> <br /> TEXT: This recreated tidal marsh and lagoon recoup a fragment of a luxuriant 130-acre marsh system that once stretched along this shoreline. Abounding in life, the marsh offered the native Yelamu people an ideal place for fishing, hunting and gathering. The U.S. military regarded it as an unhealthy wasteland and dumped the Presidio's trash into this rich estuary before it was filled for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The Army developed Crissy airfield several years later and used the site for housing and industrial operations until transferring it to the National Park Service in 1994.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP: A black and white map in the bottom left corner depicting Crissy Field and the San Francisco Bay to the north, at the top of the illustration. On land, many paths cut east to west, paralleling the shoreline. It also shows a large and elaborate body of water that feeds into the bay. This map shows the extent of the original Crissy Field marsh in 1870.<br /> <br /> IMAGE LOCATION: At the top center of the panel are two black and white photographs, one on top of the other.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: The top-most photo shows a sandy, low-lying area with a very low water level. In the foreground, a pile of wood can be seen, and in the distance, a row of buildings.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The original marsh here was considered worthless for military purposes. The Army used the wetland as a dump and later paved over and built on much of it after the marsh was filled.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A section of muddy, land with areas inundated by water. In the foreground is a building with an angled roof and in the distance, a larger building along a coast, surrounded in low-lying water. To the left of the frame, a ship sits just off the coast.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: An ocean-going dredge pumped sand and mud from the bottom of San Francisco Bay into the salt marsh in 1912 as the first step in construction of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.<br /> <br /> TEXT: \"Wastelands\" No Longer. Like wetlands everywhere, Bay Area tidal marshes for years were viewed as wastelands best suited for dumping, diking, draining and filling. More than 90% of the bay's 200,00 acres of perimeter wetlands were lost to urban growth by the early 1960s. As people began to recognize the ecological values of marshes, lawmakers passed laws to protect California wetlands and require replacement of wetlands damaged or destroyed by development. About 11,000 acres of wetlands around the Bay Area were restored or enhanced between 1995 and 2000; an additional 60,000 acres is the goal for the ensuing three decades.<br /> <br /> MAP: The panel features a map of the San Francisco Bay to the south, and San Pablo Bay to the north. To the west, the bays feed into the Pacific Ocean through the narrow Golden Gate separating the peninsula containing San Francisco, and the Marin Headlands to the north. Areas within the bays are marked with different shades of blue; a lighter blue represents areas that were tidal marsh from 1770-1820. The darker blue shows modern day tidal marsh habitat. Areas to the south of San Francisco Bay are the marshiest now, in San Pablo Bay, the same is true for areas to the north.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Over about two centuries, people converted many acres of wetlands around San Francisco Bay to other uses.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Turn right from the wayside and go back the way you came. When you pass through the gate, turn left and take the path as it curves around the marsh to the north west about 150 feet until you reach a wayside to the left of the path.</p>",

The area includes a wooden bridge over a shallow body of water with a sandbar protruding at its center. Closer to the fence is a sandy dune dotted by green coastal scrub plants. Much of the dune remains exposed, with a pile of discarded wood lying in the grass.<br /> <br /> To the right is a path leading to the San Francisco Bay Trail, which runs east to west. East takes you to East Beach and Crissy Field Center. West takes you to Crissy Field, Fort Point and the Golden Gate Bridge. To the left is a path that leads to picnic tables and barbecues.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Native People of the Peninsula. The Yelamu were one of 50 independent Ohlone tribes related through culture and language. Ohlone peoples have lived in the Bay Area for several thousand years. The Yelamu, whose territory included today's Crissy Field, moved seasonally from the winter villages of Tubsinte, Sitlintac and Petlenuc to the summer/fall villages of Chutchui and Amuctac. Archeological study of remains found at Crissy Field indicates the Yelamu lived here when plants, fish and other animals were available for harvest.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP #1: Small map shows the San Francisco peninsula, labeling Yelamu sites circa 1770. Petlenuc is the furthest north, in the same area as the Presidio, followed by Sitlintac a little south and further east, Chutchui in the center of the peninsula, then Amuctac further south along the eastern coast and further south and inland from there, Tubsinte.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP #2: A larger map showing the entirety of the Ohlone territory circa 1770, an area that stretched from a small area just north of the bay all the way down the coast past Monterey Bay and significantly inland.<br /> <br /> QUOTE: \"I am very old...my people were once around me like the sands of the shore...many...many. They have all passed away. They have died like the grass...they have gone to the mountains. I do not complain, the antelope falls with the arrow. I had a son. I loved him. When the palefaces came he went away. I do not know where he is. I am a Christian Indian, I am all that is left of my people. I am alone.\" --Pedro Alcantara, the last known Yelamu, born in 1780, from an interview recorded by Indian Agent Adam Johnston in 1850, the year California became a state.<br /> <br /> CHART DESCRIPTION: A two column chart. The first column lists individuals' Yelamu names and their dates of birth. The second column lists the individuals' corresponding Spanish name and the dates of their baptism.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Mission San Francisco baptism records reveal the names of some of the last Yelamu individuals from the village of Petlenuc. At baptism the individual was given a Spanish name.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: On the left side is a photograph of Ohlone children dancing in a circle wearing traditional regalia including grass skirts, animal pelts and feather headdresses. They're watched by a group of adults and children in modern dress. A man with a goatee wearing a dark shirt and jeans beats a white round drum with a mallet, and looks on as the children dance barefoot on the grass of Crissy Field, overlooking the water's of the bay.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Crissy Field tidal marsh opening, 1999.<br /> <br /> TEXT: \"We Are Still Here.\" The Yelamu population, around 200 at the time Spanish colonists arrived in the 1770s, was among the smallest of all Ohlone tribes. The disruptions wrought by European colonization decimated the Yelamu. Although we know of no Yelamu descendants living today, several Ohlone tribal groups and many individuals from the broader Ohlone population make up a vital contemporary native community. Ohlone people have played an active role in the Crissy Field restoration project.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A photograph of several men sitting around a table in a dark room looking on as one man signs a piece of paper on the table.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Ohlone representatives signed an agreement with the National Park Service concerning the preservation and interpretation of Ohlone culture.<br /> <br /> TEXT: This exhibit was prepared in collaboration with the Ohlone community. \"Ohlone\" is a native term used by many tribes and individuals today. Some local tribes, individuals, anthropologists and linguists use the term \"Costanoan,\" which was originally applied to this cultural group by the Spanish.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk 180 feet west along the San Francisco Bay Trail.

        "notes": "A Mob of Soldiers: Philippines War Tour\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/a-mob-of-soldiers-philippines-war-tour.htm\n\n<p>This letter illustrates how regional and racial tensions were running high at this time in the country, and the role that these played in the Tennessee volunteers getting their reputation.</p> <blockquote> <p>August 15, 1898<br /> Dear Uncle John,<br /> You would certainly laugh were you to visit Frisco about now, and ask a citizen about that Tennessee regiment. He would tell you they are the worst men for fighting you ever saw. The New York boys run from us. We have come out ahead in every scrap so far, but when we first moved to the Presidio where we are now situated some of them made the remark they were going to throw us in the bay when they caught us out, but it is the other way now.<br /> <br /> This morning when I got up some one says catch that negro and about four hundred men started after a negro. He had hit one of our men with a pair of brass knuckles and run you might say for his life, for I tell you, the boys who chased him tried to kill him, some one struck him in the head with a rock while others trying to cut him with knives, but Major Cheatham came in time with the guards to keep off the crowd, but if he had been five minutes later the negro would have been cut all to pieces. It looks like this regiment has to have somebody to fight any way, but we still have some hope of going to Manila.</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The near-lynching of the African American by the Tennessee regiment warranted a full page spread in the San Francisco Call newspaper on August 16, 1898,<br /> <br /> <em>Soldiers of Tennessee Mob a Negro, Drunken Row Almost Results in a Murder</em><br /> <br /> The trouble began on Baker Street, between Filbert and Greenwich. The victim Dan Thomas reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I was on my way back from Dwyer's saloon, on the corner of Filbert and Baker streets, where I had been delivering some crabs, when two soldiers stopped me. One of them asked for a chew of tobacco and the other for a dime. I told them I had no tobacco and no dime, and then one of them hit me. I hit back and then I ran home as fast as I could, a lot of soldiers following me. I told my brother and mother they were after me to kill me, and then I climbed up into the garret. I heard them come into the house, and I stayed where I was until an officer told me it was safe to come down.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> Major Cheatham of the Tennessee Volunteers, who took a prominent part in the rescue, and who undoubtedly saved Thomas from death, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I was sitting in the mess tent this morning about 7:30 when I saw a number of men running down the road from our camp. I asked one of our men what the trouble was, and he said that one of our regiment had been killed by a negro and that the crowd was after him. I quickened my pace toward the entrance to the reservation, and just as I arrived I saw a large crowd running down the hill. I ran to the house where the men were gathered. I jumped the fence and entered the back door and ran up the stairs. There I found soldiers pulling a man through a hole in the ceiling. I drew a revolver and ordered the men to stop, saying that I would shoot, and they immediately obeyed me. I took the negro in charge, appointed guards over him, taking the very two men who were closest upon him for this purpose, and we brought him back to camp.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> General Miller's indignation at the barbarous treatment of the negro knew no bounds. The general said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The negro did not use brass knuckles on the soldier, but he did very good service with his fist-just about what the soldier deserved: and the whole company, or what amounted to a company in numbers of Tennesseans and Iowans who attacked him afterwards. I had him placed in the post guardhouse, and if any attempt had been made to take him back, as I hear was contemplated, the perpetrators would have met with a warm reception from the Washington guard. A soldier on duty can use his gun. I placed the negro this afternoon among his friends, and no one need know where that is.\"</p> </blockquote>",

Now, in addition to the soldiers stationed here to defend San Francisco Harbor and the west coast, the post took on responsibilities for staging the operations in the Philippines and elsewhere in the Pacific. In April 1900, Presidio post commander briefed his superiors on the Presidio's activities since the beginning of the war:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Presidio has become the most important post in the U.S. Army, forming a defense of the Golden Gate with fifty-two modern defense guns and mortars. The Presidio garrison amounts to upwards of 1,000 men. The post processes all the regulars and volunteers going to the Philippine Islands. It handles recruits, furloughed soldiers, and discharged men. All the sick returning from the Pacific pass through the reservation, and the remains of deceased soldiers are received here. In addition, animals destined for the far Pacific are handled at the post.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> With the increase in troops at the Presidio, overcrowding became a real problem, not only for the enlisted men, many of whom were camping in tents, but also for the officers. In 1901 the San Francisco Call had this account of activities at the Presidio:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Presidio presents an animated scene since the return of the volunteers commenced and the issuance of orders calling for the organization of new regiments. There are at present quartered on the military reservation more than 7000 men, exclusive of the 600 patients in the general hospital. Within the next few days 2300 men will leave for Manila, but their places will-be filled by the incoming recruits and returning regiments.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The same year, post commander Colonel Rawles reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A captain in Texas who has orders for the Philippines has asked for quarters for his family, but I answered no and suggested he apply to Benicia Barracks. Even the chaplain has complained that the post chapel is too crowded and has requested the construction of a larger chapel.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The arrival of newly assigned officers produced a kind of musical chairs at the post. In 1904 the San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The arrival of Colonel Edward A. Godwin, Ninth Cavalry, has raised a great commotion at the Presidio. His rank entitles him to select any quarters except those of the commanding officer of the post. His eye lighted on the beautiful grounds and commodious home of Major Stephenson, so the major was politely requested to seek other quarters. As Major Stephenson has his two sisters visiting him and desires to entertain in their behalf, he will naturally choose the next best quarters in the line, which will oust a captain, and this will result in a grand change all down the line. Things will be merry in the moving line next week.\"</p> </blockquote>",

And much of the sickness was attributed to the lack of trained cooks. So, in 1905, the War Department opened the first school for bakers and cooks at Fort Riley, Kansas. It soon added schools at the Presidio, at Washington Barracks, D.C., and at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.<br /> <br /> Building 35, the large building across Lincoln on your left, and Building 220, the large building across Halleck to your right, both housed the Bakers and Cooks School over the years.<br /> <br /> On April 1, 1906, when the Presidio acquired the new Bakers and Cooks school, Colonel Morris urged that a barracks be erected for the sixty-eight students, then camping on the lower parade ground in tents. Meanwhile, he moved them into the brick barracks where they would be close to their classes in the bakeries and various kitchens. The post commissary described the school:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The school is divided into four squads. Four of the best cooks in the Department of California serve as instructors. Classes last four months and the school graduates 120 cooks annually. It produces 2,000 loaves of bread daily, which are sold for 3 cents each.\"</p> </blockquote>",

Chamberlin, First Artillery, who served with distinction in the Civil War and continued as an artillery officer until his death at the Presidio in 1889. This Endicott-era battery was completed and armed in 1904 with four six-inch guns mounted on disappearing carriages. The battery was built to protect underwater minefields laid outside the Golden Gate during the time of war. These guns had a range of nine miles and could fire at the rate of two rounds per minute.<br /> <br /> The original guns were dismounted in 1917 for use in World War I, but the battery was modified to receive two six-inch guns on simple barbette carriages in 1920. During World War II, the Sixth Coast Artillery (Harbor Defense) Regiment, Battery \"D,\" manned the two guns at Battery Chamberlin, which were placed under camouflage netting to hide them from potential air attack. In 1948, the Coast Artillery Corps was deactivated, the battery disarmed and the guns scrapped during \"Operation Blowtorch.\"<br /> <br /> In 1977, the National Park Service received the Six-Inch Rifle Gun Number Nine and disappearing carriage, listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places, from the Smithsonian Institution. The gun and carriage were installed at gun emplacement Number Four at Battery Chamberlin, and are the same type as initially used here before World War I. An underground cartridge room also is open for inspection and contains photos and small exhibits on the coastal defenses of San Francisco.<br /> <br /> Battery Chamberlin, part of the Presidio of San Francisco and a National Historic Landmark, is administered by the National Park Service's Golden Gate National Recreation Area.

The Philippine wars are no exception. In the early 1900s there were dozens of fresh graves in the sections to your right. The cemetery saw a huge increase of burials at this time; from 48 in 1898, to a peak of 855 in 1901.<br /> <br /> Soldier's bodies were first sent to the U.S. Army Morgue and Office of Identification in Manila. Remains were then shipped to San Francisco, some for further transport to their home communities, others for burial in the national cemetery. The Presidio's flag was lowered to half-staff on days when ships bearing bodies arrived in the harbor.<br /> <br /> The question of where to store the bodies before burial arose in 1899. The first recommendation was to use the dining rooms of the nearly empty the Model Camp. The post commander thought that a poor solution, especially if the press got wind of it. Instead, he designated storage in a large temporary recreation center that the YMCA had erected near the Lombard Gate.<br /> <br /> Volunteers training at the Presidio saw their fallen comrades return. One of the 51st Iowa Infantry regiment wrote this of a military funeral at the Presidio:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A funeral here is a most impressive ceremony. Led by a band playing low solemn music, pall-bearers and an army wagon with the corpse follow; then company officers and comrades of the dead, marching in slow cadence to the military burying ground, where a salute is fired by his mess mates. The band then plays \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" as soldiers stand at parade rest, and officers with hats removed and bowed heads.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> In the summer of 1900, the San Francisco Call reported on the crowding at the national cemetery:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The bodies of 110 men who died in Manila now remain unburied at the Presidio. Every day witnesses the burial of at least twenty, but they arrive almost as fast. Extension of the limits of the cemetery is now a necessity, and a force of men has been at work during the last few days removing the trees to utilize a portion of the national cemetery that is now covered with a growth of timber. To utterly destroy the growth, a charge of powder is placed under the roots and set off. It is expected that the acre of ground covered by the trees will be cleared within the next few weeks, and that the interrupted weekly funeral processions will be resumed. \"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> Several notable figures of the Spanish American and Philippine wars are buried at San Francisco National Cemetery. These include -- Major General William Shafter, commander of the Cuban Campaign during the Spanish American War -- Major General Frederick Funston, Medal of honor recipient and captor and Filipino nationalist leader Emilio Aguinaldo during the Philippine War, and Sgt. William Tompkins, of the African American 10th Cavalry, who received a Medal of honor for bravery and valor in the Spanish American War. These are but a few of the thousands of men buried here who risked and, for some, gave their lives for their country during the Philippine wars. A touch-screen kiosk outside the cemetery office provides grave location information and maps if you want to visit the graves of any of these notable figures.<br /> <br /> The Spanish American and Philippine wars not only altered the lives of the many soldiers that fought in them, but also had a lasting influence on the Presidio and San Francisco as a whole. It was during this period that the post transformed itself from a relatively sleepy duty station to one of the preeminent military installations on the west coast. It was also at this time that the Presidio became a significant part of the San Francisco community, leading up to its full involvement with the City after the 1906 earthquake.</p>",

In addition to the stables, there was a paddock, blacksmith shop and barracks that stood on the hill.<br /> <br /> The horse cavalry was phased out of the military after WWI, and the stables were eventually adapted for use as a K-9 Corps facility and a veterinary hospital.</p> <h3>Buffalo Soldiers</h3> <p>In 1866, Congress decreed that African Americans would be allowed to enlist in the Regular Army. Four segregated regiments were quickly created. These units, the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th and 25th Infantry, became known as the Buffalo Soldiers. The origin of the moniker is debated, but it likely came from the Cheyenne. Accounts contained in letters talk of the Cheyenne likening the hair of the black soldiers to buffalo fur. The comparison to the buffalo was intended as honorific by the Cheyenne and was received as such by the soldiers.<br /> <br /> After serving in Cuba, the Philippines and Hawaii during the Philippine American and Spanish American wars, the Buffalo Soldiers returned stateside and were garrisoned at the Presidio in San Francisco in 1903.</p> <h3>Colonel Charles Young</h3> <p>During their stay in California, Buffalo Soldiers patrolled Yosemite and Sequoia national parks in the Sierras during summer seasons. Their commanding officer, Colonel Charles Young, earned the distinction of being the first African American Park Superintendent as he led his troops to build roads and trails, and protect and manage the park. This is only one of his many accomplishments.

From 1921 to 1936, Crissy Field was the military's cutting-edge location for testing flight technology. During this time, the Air Service captured the nation's imagination with eye-grabbing headlines about flights at Crissy Field, including aerobatic stunts and air races. Most significant were a series of long-distance flights that contributed to the development of airline travel.</p> <h3>The Naming of Crissy Field</h3> <p>Presidio coast artilleryman Dana H. Crissy was ambitious. Being an artilleryman was interesting, but more interesting would be to get in on something new and innovative. Crissy changed the trajectory of his military career by joining the ranks of the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, going on to become the Commander of the Mather Airfield in Sacramento. His position in Sacramento made him eligible to participate in a daring military test.<br /> <br /> On October 8th, 1919, 61 planes took flight from Roosevelt Field, Long Island heading west across the US while 15 planes, including one piloted by Crissy, flew east from a still unnamed airfield at the Presidio in San Francisco. These planes made up the Transcontinental Reliability and Endurance Test, the first US military attempt to fly across the North American continent. After three days and 24 hours in the cockpit, Captain Lowell H. Smith was the first to complete the trip, touching down on Roosevelt Field, New York.<br /> <br /> In the end, only nine planes made it all the way across. Nine pilots died, including Major Dana H. Crissy and his navigator, Sergeant 1st Class V. Thomas, who perished on their first day out trying to land their DH-4 airplane near Salt Lake City. Colonel Hap Arnold of the Presidio, a personal friend and brother in aviation to Major Crissy, requested the airfield at the Presidio, where Crissy took off on his last flight, be named in his honor.</p> <h3>First Flight to Hawaii - Almost</h3> <p>In 1925, after running six miles at full throttle across the bay, two P-N9 Navy seaplanes under the control of Commander John Rodgers took flight and headed west at a brisk 115 miles per hour. Their destination? Hawaii. But this was no pleasure flight making its way to a weekend of luaus. Rather, it was a major test of aviation.<br /> <br /> Coming on the heels of the around-the-world flight, which made use of short hops over the northern continents, the Navy was eager to show it was possible to fly planes over entire oceans at a single go.<br />  </p> <h3>Tragedy Averted</h3> <p>Despite meticulous planning, the expedition encountered adversity just five hours in, when one of the planes sprung an oil leak and was forced out of the air. Commander Rodgers' plane was flying fine, and so continued towards the south Pacific. Things continued uneventfully until 400 miles from their destination, the fuel reserves ran dangerously low, forcing Rodgers to veer off their charted path in search of a ship that could help them refuel. Unfortunately, no ship could be found.<br /> <br /> The airmen were forced down over the Pacific, in an area teeming with sharks. The low fuel took out both the engines and the radio. Stranded with little food, the men were left with few options. They managed to stay calm enough to remember their naval training and fashioned sails out of the canvas covering their plane's wings. Their ingenuity paid off. Against all odds, the men survived long enough to be rescued by a Navy submarine before sailing past Kauai, one week later than their intended arrival.</p> <h3>Crissy Field Today</h3> <p>Chrissy Field is a popular place to jog, walk, or ride bicycles. A pedestrian and bike trail stretches from Fort Point to the Maritime Museum, both Golden Gate NRA sites.</p>",

Yessir, Crissy Field has it all. Beaches, picnic spots, scenic overlooks and renowned conditions for windsurfing. Dog friends welcome!<br />  </p> <h3>From Seasonal Village to Pioneer Airfield</h3> <h4>The Ohlone: Coastal Native Peoples</h4> <p>The Ohlone people lived in and around the vicinity of Crissy Field by 740 AD. They and their predecessors lived in seasonal villages that could be moved to accommodate migratory hunting, fishing and foraging practices. Crissy Field was one such seasonal site. The Ohlone's way of life remained largely unchanged for 10,000 years, until the late 18th century and the arrival of European colonists.<br /> <br /> The Spanish arrived next, establishing a territorial presence alongside the Ohlone. They quickly adopted tactics to assimilate and systematically destroy the Ohlone culture and way of life. Yet the Ohlone continue to endure. The descendants of this pre-European society are still in the bay area, working to preserve and revitalize their culture. Revitalization happens in many ways, including language restoration, protection of ancestral sites and cultural revitalization through song, dance, storytelling and other traditional arts.<br />  </p> <h4>The Military at Crissy Field</h4> <p>This area was an anchorage for ships that supplied the Presidio soldiers during the Spanish, Mexican and US Army periods. After the US Army arrived, soldiers built stables, warehouses and refuse dumps in these damp lowlands. In the 1870s, the US Lifesaving Service (Coast Guard) Station opened at the west end of Crissy Field. The army always desired to fill the tidal sloughs to make the area more suitable for military activities.</p> <h4>Swamp to barracks via the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition</h4> <p>With a stroke of luck, the opportunity finally came with the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition, when the city filled the marsh for the army. During the Exposition, this area housed state and international pavilions at the east end. The west end had livestock show areas and an automobile racetrack. After the fair closed and World War I commenced, barracks for 6,000 soldiers training at the Presidio covered the Crissy Field area. After the war in 1919, construction of the airfield began where the old racetrack stood.</p> <h4>From Post to Park</h4> <p>In the World War II period, temporary barracks were again built along Crissy Field and stood here until the Army turned the Presidio over to the National Park Service in 1994. By that time, the area was showing signs of neglect and had an industrial feel. Restoration of the area began and continues today.</p> <h3>Restoration in the 21st Century</h3> <p>At the tail end of the 20th century, the focus on Crissy Field turned to restoration. A 1994 National Park Service management plan made a commitment to preserving the area as a place for relaxing, where visitors could experience solitude and enjoy a natural refuge in an urban setting, dedicated to the protection of cultural and natural resources. The first major initiative was the restoration of both the historic airfield and wetlands at Crissy Field. In consultation with the Ohlone, efforts to plant native vegetation have proven successful. The tidal marsh re-opened in 2000 and is now home to countless birds, jack smelt, bay shrimp and crabs.</p> <h3>Protecting Snowy Plovers</h3> <p>The snowy plover uses the beach at Crissy Field to rest and replenish its food reserves. This shorebird friend is a federally threatened species with only about 2,100 individuals left along the Pacific Coast from Washington to Baja. Their diminishing numbers are largely due to habitat loss.<br /> Plovers nest on nearby beaches and little things like walking dog friends near plover nests flushes protective parents out into the open, leaving eggs and chicks exposed to wind, sand, cold and predators. Leaving food scraps behind attracts opportunistic predators like gulls, coyotes, dogs, feral cats, skunks and raccoons, so please be mindful of your mess and pack out everything you bring.</p> <h3>Climate Change, Rising Seas</h3> <p>Burning fossil fuels like coal and gas releases carbon dioxide, which acts like a heat-trapping blanket around the planet, disrupting the climate. As glaciers melt and sea temperatures rise, so does sea level.<br /> <br /> Rising seas, coupled with bigger storms and waves, are causing more flooding and erosion of low lying areas like the one here, and could affect how sand is distributed along the beach. These trends may cause future visitors to have a very different beach experience here.<br /> <br /> A display at the bridge over Crissy Field marsh shows possible future sea levels, caused by global warming. The rate of sea level rise can be slowed by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>",

The building's components were manufactured offsite, greatly reducing the amount of construction waste here at Crissy Field. During construction, contractors used an onsite solar generator that provided electricity for their tools.<br /> <br /> Much of the Center is made up of creatively reused and re-purposed materials. More than 35% of the building is made of recycled content. This includes the steel frame (95% recycled), the light gauge steel walls, roof panels, ceiling tiles and carpet tiles (77% recycled). The raised flooring came from a Hewlett-Packard facility. The redwood siding is re-milled lumber salvaged from an old railway tunnel in Marin County.<br /> <br />  </p>",

The dunes surrounding the marsh are planted with coastal scrub plants that provide a beautiful carpet of flowers in the spring.<br /> <br /> <br /> Efforts to restore this tidal marsh, which feeds into the bay, have been long and arduous because of the environmental damage caused by the army. It was used as the army's dump site for years before it was filled for the 1915 International Exposition. Thanks to the countless hours and uncompromising efforts of the Golden Gate Parks Conservancy and the National Park Service, the natural beauty and diversity of life of this environment is being restored.</p> <h3>Unsustainable Practice</h3> <p>During the late 1800s when the US Army took over the Presidio, they considered the wetlands as an unhealthy nuisance and attempted to fill the marsh with refuse, wreaking havoc on the natural wetlands.<br /> <br /> <br /> In 1915, in preparation for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE), the city filled in 630 acres of tidal marsh, stretching a full three miles from Fort Mason to Fort Point. Thirty-one nations and several US states built exhibits to dazzle the public, all connected by 47 miles of walkways. The PPIE demonstrated not only major technological achievement, but also that San Francisco had rebounded from the devastation of the 1906 earthquake and fire.</p> <h3>Bringing the marsh back to life</h3> <p>Since the tidal marsh re-opened in 2000, visitors have seen a resurgence of over 120 bird species in the area. Jack smelt, bay shrimp and Dungeness crab, popular food sources for our bird friends, are also rebounding. Today the marsh covers 20 acres, stretching over a mile along the Promenade.</p> <h3>Come fly the Pacific skies</h3> <p>During the re-creation of Crissy marsh, while the water was still unconnected to the bay, many shorebirds that hadn't been seen in the area for decades began stopping by at this location.<br /> <br /> <br /> Each year thousands of birds pass through the Presidio along the Pacific Flyway, the migratory bird equivalent of a cross-continent highway that goes all the way from South America to Canada. Birds use the marsh like a rest stop, to give their wings a break, grab a bite and let the kids go to the bathroom.</p> <h3>How does the marsh water look today?</h3> <p>Sometimes Crissy marsh is separated from the bay by the barrier beach for periods lasting several months because there isn't enough water in the wetlands to keep the channel open. Park scientists monitor the water quality in the marsh. When conditions are deemed too poor, a ditch is dug to reconnect the marsh to the bay.<br /> <br /> Today the marsh is alive and thriving. Enjoy the view, and see if you can spot some of these friendly guys!</p>",

        "notes": "El Polín Spring\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/el-pol-n-spring.htm\n\n<p>Located at the heart of the Tennessee Hollow Watershed, El Polí­n offers visitors a chance to connect with the Presidio's earliest history, experience some of the park's best birdwatching and enjoy the blooms and wildlife made possible by the year-round flow of the spring.</p> <h3>History of El Polí­n</h3> <p>Before European colonists arrived, the Yelamu Ohlone and their ancestors inhabited this space for thousands of years. When the Spanish arrived in 1776, El Polí­n Spring provided an essential water source for the Presidio. By 1812, Spanish colonial families were firmly established at El Polín, over twenty years before the town of Yerba Buena, later named San Francisco, was founded. According to legend, the waters of the spring increased fertility in women. The Miramontes family, who resided near the spring in the early 1800s, are often used to support this claim. They produced 20 children.<br /> <br /> After the US Army took over the Presidio in 1846, they changed the watershed by planting cypress and eucalyptus trees. They also redirected the flow of water by constructing dams, which were used as a water supply at the Main Post. The habitat for many of El Polin Springs' wildlife was forever altered.<br /> <br /> The watershed was home to tent encampments during the 1898 Spanish American War, and later served as temporary housing for San Franciscans left homeless by the 1906 earthquake. The area also saw several generations of more permanent housing. By the 1930s, several neighborhoods of brick houses had sprung up and in 1959 a new set of apartment buildings arrived when the Army expanded during the Cold War. As a result, only small pockets of riparian habitat remained.</p> <h3>Juana Briones</h3> <p>One enduring figure of the 1800s is Juana Briones, a woman of European, Native American and African descent, who grew up at El Polí­n. Briones was the descendant of members of both the Anza and Portolá expeditions from Mexico to Alta California. She made a name for herself as a healer, midwife and self-taught doctor, skills she is said to have learned from Native Americans. She was also a cunning businesswoman with a prominent business selling milk, produce and raising cattle.<br /> <br /> Briones was such a respected member of her community that she was able to keep her several Mexican ranchos, even after California's admission to the Union in 1850, and many Californiano families lost their land rights. Though there are no authenticated surviving photos, journals, or other primary documents from Juana herself, she is well remembered.</p> <h3>Restoration of the Southlands</h3> <p>For the past decade, revitalization has been underway within the Tennessee Hollow Watershed surrounding El Polí­n Spring. The watershed covers 270 acres in the eastern Presidio. It's made up of three streams that flow north through the valley before merging into one watercourse that flows into the San Francisco Bay. Creeks provide most of the freshwater for the restored Crissy Field marsh.<br /> <br /> <br />  </p>",

As you stroll the Presidio and visit the Philippine War sites, you will hear first hand accounts and news reports from the period, giving you a flavor of what it was like to be here during the busiest time in the Presidio's history... as soldiers made their first and last stops here while on their way to and from war in the Philippines. This audio tour will reveal the many ways in which the soldiers and the citizens of San Francisco interacted, forever changing the face of the Presidio and the city.<br /> <br /> After Indian uprisings were no longer a threat in the mid-1890s, the Army began moving troops from frontier posts to bases better connected to transport routes. The rail lines and port of San Francisco made the Presidio a prime place to relocate troops, and by 1896 the monumental brick barracks along Montgomery Street emerged above the newly expanded Main Post parade ground. Foreshadowing the coming conflict in the Pacific, these impressive buildings would house a growing contingent of soldiers.</p>",

Fort Scott offers amazing views situated near several trails and scenic overlooks. It's also the backdrop for popular volunteer stewardship activities at the Presidio Nursery and the surrounding area.<br /> <br /> Fort Scott is home to the Presidio Institute, which provides transformational experiences to inspire and empower leaders across an array of fields to make positive impacts in their communities.</p> <h3>Get Your Nature On: Trails and Vistas at the Fort</h3> <p>The best way to enjoy the outdoors at Fort Scott is to park in the lot at Langdon Court off of Lincoln Boulevard. Go south to walk the Batteries to Bluffs Trail (featuring an in-app tour) which takes you to Marshall's Beach and points south, including Baker Beach. North of the lot is the Golden Gate Overlook, old coastal batteries and the Golden Gate Bridge.</p> <h3>History of Fort Winfield Scott</h3> <p>Prior to 1912, Coast Artillery soldiers lived at the Montgomery Street Barracks at the Presidio's Main Post, a good thirty minute march from the coastal guns where they performed their duties. Fort Winfield Scott significantly shortened their morning commute.<br /> <br /> Between 1922 and 1946, the fort was designated headquarters of the Coast Defenses of San Francisco, commanding other coast artillery forts in the area, like Fort Barry and Fort Baker.<br /> <br /> After the Pearl Harbor attack, the fear of Japanese invasion prompted Army command to station soldiers at the batteries 24 hours a day. Fort Scott became a place where shift-weary soldiers could enjoy a little rest and relaxation.</p> <h3>Old Fuss and Feathers</h3> <p>\"Old Fuss and Feathers\" is high in the running for greatest nickname of all time. The honor belongs to US Army General Winfield Scott, who served more time as an active duty general than any other commander in US history. His career began in the War of 1812, though his rise to prominence came during the Mexican War. He led the assault on the fort of Chapultepec, resulting in a Mexican surrender in 1847. The US victory against Mexico led to the annexation of California.<br /> <br /> At the end of his illustrious career, his deeds earned him a second alias, \"The Great Old Man of the Army,\" which is epic, but lacks a certain ring you get with his original moniker. Scott's also remembered for devising a blockade to defeat the Confederacy, and for being an insufferable crank.</p> <h3>Prisoners of Conscience</h3> <p>During the Vietnam War, the Presidio was a functioning US Army post complete, with its own stockade, used to jail enlisted men who had committed violations against their terms of service. In the late 1960s, 127 men were held at the Presidio as military prisoners. The majority were serving time for AWOL offenses.<br /> <br /> 123 soldiers were kept in Building 1213, a facility fit to hold a maximum 88. The conditions of the stockade were deplorable. The men were subjected to extreme cruelty from the guards, who the soldiers described as antagonistic and racist. Overcrowding resulted in insufficient meal portions and two hour wait times to use bathrooms overflowing with human waste.<br /> <br /> While many prisoners suffered from mental stress and disorders, Private Richard \"Rusty\" Bunch, was particularly unstable. He was known to meditate in his cell, muttering that he'd been reincarnated and attempt to walk through walls. One day, Private Bunch asked a guard if he would shoot him if he ran, to which the guard replied he'd have to run to find out. Bunch did run, and the guard shot him in the back with a shotgun from ten feet away, killing him.</p> <h3>The Presidio Mutiny</h3> <p>The killing of Private Richard \"Rusty\" Bunch was the spark that led to the so-called Presidio mutiny. Upon hearing of Bunch's slaying, the prisoners were enraged, threatening violence against the guards. Ultimately, cooler heads prevailed. Instead of a violent outburst, 27 prisoners organized a peaceful non-cooperative demonstration where they sat in a field, sang protest songs and refused to move until meeting with Captain Robert Lamont, commander of the Presidio stockade.<br /> <br /> When Lamont arrived, the protesters read him their seven demands which sought to improve conditions at the stockade, ensure psychiatric evaluations of prisoners and guards, and allow prisoners a chance to talk to the media regarding Bunch's killing. Lamont cut the men off and accused them of mutiny before having them forcibly returned to their cells.<br /> <br /> The men were court-martialed, found guilty and handed sentences ranging from six months to 16 years. As often happens, justice arrived late. A year after the court-martial, the decision was reversed by judge Jacob Hagopian, who ruled that the men's actions did not meet the definition of mutiny, and the charges were dropped.</p>",

These beautiful homes embody an American ideal, managing to be both urban and pastoral in their aesthetic.<br /> <br /> In 1878, the order was given for the houses on the west side of Funston to do an about face. Yes, the homes were flipped around. Originally, they faced west towards the parade ground, but the army felt it was tacky to leave the backside of the homes visible for anyone entering from the main entrance to the east. The decision to spare visitors the sight of army majors' undies however, caused unintended consequences with the overall feng shui of the place.<br /> <br /> Now, the houses are inhabited by small businesses.</p>",

From here, you can learn about the history of the bridge and its impact on the Bay Area with the help of interactive installations and models, including a cross-section of the bridge's main suspension cable. There is limited paid parking at the plaza, and we highly recommend that you take public transit.</p> <h3>Bridge Across the Bay</h3> <p>Crossing the bridge is a popular activity for tourists and locals alike. People from around the bay area flock every day to bike or walk across the span. Depending on weather, the walk across the bridge can afford stunning views of the city and the Marin Headlands, but don't be surprised if you get caught in the Fog Dome!<br /> <br /> The <strong>Golden Gate Bridge Welcome Center</strong> is your starting point for walking across the Golden Gate Bridge or planning an excursion in nearby parklands. You can ask a ranger about places to visit and pick up bridge-related souvenirs. Trails from the plaza go in several directions, even leading to Fort Point below. These trails have recently been improved for accessibility and the accommodation of cyclists.</p> <h3>Bridge Trivia</h3> <p>The following are some fun bridge facts you can use to impress friends at your next bridge-related get together...</p> <ul> <li>A bridge spanning the Golden Gate Strait was first proposed in 1872 by railroad tycoon Charles Crocker. At the time, many people thought a bridge across the strait couldn't be built. The idea wasn't brought up again until 1919, 47 years later, when the San Francisco Board of Supervisors instructed the city engineer to do a study to evaluate the feasibility of such an undertaking.</li> <li>The bridge took more than four years to build, from January 5th, 1933, until its official opening to vehicular traffic on May 28th, 1937.</li> <li>When it was first being built, the bridge had several enemies. Among them, the Southern Pacific Railroad, who had a controlling interest in the ferry that conveyed commuters from Marin County to the city. Legendary landscape photographer Ansel Adams, along with the Sierra Club, also opposed the bridge, fearing it would ruin the view.</li> <li>At its opening in 1937, the bridge weighed 894,500 tons. After modifications in 1986, the bridge slimmed down to a lean 887,000 tons. The towers are 746 feet tall, and each have about 600,000 rivets. End to end, including abutments, the bridge is 1.7 miles long. The span across the strait is 1.2 miles long.</li> <li>The main suspension cables, which run the length of the bridge passing over the tops of the towers, are made of galvanized carbon steel wire. Each cable is 36 3/8 inches in diameter and 7,650 feet long. The total length of galvanized steel wire used in both cables combined is 80,000 miles, for a combined weight of 24,500 tons.</li> <li>The bridge was built to move. At midspan, the bridge can lower as much as 10.8 feet, or rise as much as 5.8 feet. Side to side, the bridge can sway up to 27.7 feet.</li> <li>The bridge's unique color, \"International Orange,\" was carefully selected by consulting architect Irving Morrow, who picked it to complement the bridge's environs, highlight its immensity and make it more visible in fog.</li> <li>The Civil War-era Fort Point was slated for demolition in 1933 to make way for the bridge's construction, but Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss put a halt to the plan, citing the fort's fine masonry as well as its historical significance among the reasons it should remain. The bridge was redesigned with an arch at the south end to accommodate the fort.</li> <li>In 1967, San Francisco topless star Yvonne D'Angers, aka the Persian Lamb, protested threats of her own deportation by chaining herself to the bridge.</li> <li>In 2004, a young deer decided to join the commute, bounding across the bridge in a FasTrak lane before exiting on 19th Avenue and disappearing into the Presidio.</li> <li>In late August 2005, a 6-foot tall ostrich escaped from a cargo van just in time to jam the evening commute north and south across the bridge.</li> </ul> <h3>Parking is Limited</h3> <p>Paid parking is extremely limited at the plaza. It's highly recommended that you take public transit to the plaza. Options from San Francisco include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Downtown, at Main and Folsom or along Mission Street. (Routes 10, 70, and 101)</li> <li>Union Square, at 5th Street and Mission. (Routes 10, 70, and 101)</li> <li>Civic Center, at 7th Street and Market or McAllister and Polk Street. (Routes 10, 70, 92, 93, and 101)</li> <li>Along Fisherman's Wharf. (Routes 2, 4, 8, 18, 24, 27, 38, 44, 54, 56, 58, 72, 74, and 76)</li> <li>You can also take the <a href=\"https://presidio.gov/visit/getting-to-and-around-the-park/presidio-go-shuttle\">Presidio Go</a> shuttles from the Presidio.</li> </ul>",

        "notes": "Letterman General Hospital\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/letterman-general-hospital.htm\n\n<p>The building now known as Letterman General Hospital began providing healthcare in different capacities in 1898. In World War II it was one of the largest hospitals in the country, and continued to function as a hospital into the 1980s. Now, nonprofit organizations reside in what remains of the original hospital building. A 1960s addition to the hospital complex wasn't up to modern earthquake code, and so it was replaced by new buildings that are home to George Lucas' LucasArts and Industrial Light and Magic divisions of Lucasfilm.</p> <h3>Letterman Origins</h3> <p>In 1898, the Old Post Hospital was short one too many bedpans for all the sick men, soldiers and volunteers at their facility. A request for a new Army General Hospital at the Presidio was made. Established in 1899, this later became known as the Letterman Hospital. Most of its patients were sick soldiers who were going to or on their way back from the Philippines during the Spanish-American War.<br /> <br /> From its infancy, the hospital was home to state-of-the-art technology, including an intercom telephone system as well as primitive X-Ray equipment. Further progress came in 1901, when the facility became the first army general hospital to employ women of the newly created Army Nurse Corps. Soon Letterman Hospital became world-renowned for its research on tropical diseases and was instrumental in many crucial developments in orthopedics. Although it was chartered to serve the Army, the hospital opened its doors to civilian casualties after the 1906 earthquake and fire.</p> <h3>Letterman in WWII</h3> <p><br /> During World War II, Letterman's location made it the most important hospital for the treatment of sick and wounded soldiers from the Pacific Theater. The statistics are staggering-in 1945 alone, Letterman General Hospital received more than 73,000 patients. Letterman and Walter Reed Hospital were the Army's largest hospitals during this period.</p> <h3>Renovation and Innovation</h3> <p>By the Vietnam era, the Army renovated the aging structure into a new ten-story, 550-bed facility in 1969. The new Letterman Army Medical Center trained a quarter of the Army's medical specialists and served soldiers wounded in Vietnam throughout the 1970s. The facility was on the cutting edge of the development of artificial blood, laser physics, and the treatment of trauma. Following the transfer of the Presidio to the National Park Service, both the hospital and the research institute were deactivated in 1995.</p> <h3>George Lucas' Letterman Digital Arts Center</h3> <p>The hospital was deactivated in 1995 following the transfer of the Presidio to the National Park Service. As part of an ongoing effort to make the Presidio a financially self-sufficient National Park, Lucasfilm was selected to redevelop the site. The new Letterman Digital Arts Center is home to several Lucasfilm divisions, including Industrial Light & Magic and LucasArt. The beautiful campus is host to many inspirational sculptures.</p>",

When we arrived in California we were sent to Camp Merritt, near the coast and a very unsanitary place, heavy fog and the men began to develop chest colds and several died from pneumonia. I was sick, very sick, and went to the field hospital and all they did for me was to soak some cotton in alcohol, put it in a glass, set it afire, and cupped my chest which did nothing for me, but I visited the home of some people there and the lady of the house realized how sick I was and applied red flannel cloths to my chest with camphorated oil and I then got well fast.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As sick soldiers overwhelmed the 50-bed post hospital, an Army General Hospital was requested for the Presidio. Later known as Letterman Hospital, the general hospital was established in 1899 to receive sick troops en route to and from the Philippines and to care for patients transferred to the States from the Manila hospitals. The largest number of patients in one day was 1,040 on August 2, 1899.<br /> <br /> When Maj. Alfred Girard took command of the still incomplete general hospital in July 1899, he had mixed emotions about his new command, writing:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The location of the hospital has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are proximity to the city, to the post of the Presidio, and to the camps which were to shelter the troops assembling for duty in the Philippines and the volunteers returning therefrom. The disadvantages are exposure to the high winds and fogs, the low ground with swarms of mosquitoes and flies, and the proximity to the liquor shops adjoining the Presidio.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The role of the hospital grew and by 1905 it was also handling special cases from all over the United States - obscure tropical diseases; serious surgical cases; and eye, ear, nose, and throat cases throughout Western military installations. In 1904 Surgeon Maj. William Stephenson pleaded for a third doctor at the Presidio because it now had one of the largest military populations in the Army.<br /> <br /> In addition to the 1,600 men stationed here, hospital surgeons care for a large contingent of active and retired officers' and soldiers' families, servants, widows, and families of soldiers in the Philippines living near the reservation. Hospital doctors also sit on examining and courts martial boards, supervise the medical needs of troops en route to and from the Philippines (vaccinations, sick calls, etc.), and complete extensive administration work.<br /> <br /> The Army responded by assigning a third post surgeon to the Presidio at the end of 1904. Daily activities at the hospital are described in an August 1900 newspaper article:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It seemed like a special visiting day at the General Hospital, so great was the number that applied for passes. The fruit peddlers disposed of their stock long before the day was over, and every sick and convalescent soldier could be seen contentedly munching the grapes and pears given them by the kind-hearted crowd.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The General Hospital also dealt with a different kind of sickness from the war as reported on in this July 1900 news article.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Reports of hundreds of mentally diseased soldiers returning from the Philippines are exaggerated. The landing of eleven insane men from the transport Sheridan brings to sixty-four the number of insane patients returned from Manila. There are now close to sixty-five thousand men in the Philippines, and there are enough State volunteers returned to bring the total up to nearly one hundred-thousand, yet insanity patients have numbered less than one hundred. The causes of insanity are not numerous. They comprise heat, drink, hard campaigning, homesickness and loose ways of living. There is also a class of insanity patients who swell the number materially, but who have merely decided upon that method of escaping the service.\"</p> </blockquote>",

Many changes were happening here through this period. The San Francisco Call reported in the December of 1903:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The new gymnasium at the Presidio is nearing completion. It is a fine building and a most valuable adjunct to the fine quarters of the post. Also, in the gymnasium, there is to be a bowling alley, coffee and lunchroom, reading room and baths. The original Casual Camp No. 1 appears very different today from what it did during the Spanish American war. Then it was a rough hillside which sloped down into a steep ravine. Now all is being changed; a big gang of men, horses, plows and dump carts are leveling the place. When finished it will greatly add to that part of the post and make a magnificent site for a fine building. Down at the gun wharf a new torpedo station and torpedo cable station are being put in. On the beach two more storehouses are under construction. They will be 300 feet long by fifty feet wide. A new operation pavilion will soon be ready at the general hospital.

The San Francisco Call newspaper gives this account of the President's visit.<br /> <br /> President McKinley's visit to the Presidio yesterday will live long in the memory of the gallant soldiers who were greeted by the commander in chief. Three-thousand strong, the recently returned volunteers from the Philippines listened to stirring words from the head of the nation, while the wan and wasted faces of the sick soldiers in the General Hospital brightened as the President passed through the wards and gave a kindly word to the men who lost their health in faraway jungles while fighting for the stars and stripes.<br /> <br /> Thousands of citizens flocked to the Presidio yesterday morning to witness the ceremonies. The big parade ground facing the General Hospital, was the spot where the volunteer soldiers gathered to listen to the words of the President.<br /> <br /> Suddenly the thunder of the guns told of the approach of the commander in chief and a tumult of applause greeted him as his carriage and escort swept past thousands of sightseers. The band struck up \"Hail to the Chief\" as the President's carriage drew up at the reviewing platform. As he walked along, the President glanced with pride at the 2000 stalwart men who stood rigidly at attention. The soldiers wore blue coats and trousers, brown leggings and brown slouch hats and carried no arms. As the President advanced to the front of the platform, the buglers sounded the salute and the cheers of the soldiers rent the air in mighty volume. The President raised his hand in salute, and when the cheering subsided addressed the men in terms of glowing praise.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I count myself very fortunate to have been in the city of San Francisco upon the arrival of your two regiments. I join with my fellow citizen of this city in giving you a welcome home, and at the same time express not only my own thanks as President of the United States but the gratitude of the American people for the splendid service you have rendered to your country in the past two years.

The cover story was that this place was an industrial laundry. Instead, this building was the training facility of the first MIS class, which had 30 graduates who had an accelerated six-month training after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The school was then moved to Fort Snelling in Minnesota, where over 6,000 men were trained over time.<br /> <br /> The graduates of the MIS became interpreters, interrogators, instructors, propaganda specialists and signal technicians whose work provided vital intelligence during the war. They saved countless Allied lives and hastened the end of the war. Collectively, the graduates of the MIS earned the Presidential Unit Citation.<br /> <br /> The army moved the school to Fort Snelling after its short time in the Presidio, when, in a dark historical twist, Japanese Americans living on the West Coast were placed in camps following President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066. This decision, a knee-jerk reaction to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, was implemented across the road from MIS in Building 35 at the Presidio Main Post.<br /> <br /> The center is now a <a href=\"https://njahs.org/640/\">museum </a> with exhibits and information about its historical use.</p> <h3>Japanese Internment</h3> <p>Soon after the Pearl Harbor attack, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. It granted the armed forces the authority to designate sections of the U.S. \"military areas,\" geographic zones where \"any and all persons may be excluded,\" if deemed potentially threatening or capable of carrying out acts of sabotage.<br /> <br /> Senior US Army official and Commander of the 4th Army and Western Defense Command at the Presidio in San Francisco, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, designated the entire West Coast of the U.S a military area as per Order 9066. He then classified all persons of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast potentially threatening, regardless of their citizenship. This decision led to a policy of internment, forcing Japanese men, women and children out of their homes to live in impoverished conditions in concentration camps.<br /> <br /> Even as families were living in camps, many had relatives fighting for the U.S. in the Pacific. Some were MIS graduates, highly trained linguists who provided invaluable service to US military efforts. These men fought bravely for a nation that assumed their families were capable of treason and stripped them of their rights, yet not a single internee was ever convicted of acting against the U.S. When the war ended, so did internment. But the effects of living in the camps continued and were passed down through the minds and bodies of former internees and their descendants.</p>",

Magazines, newspapers and story books were eagerly grasped by the soldiers. Most of the men prefer a quiet spot and a periodical to read to spending their time roaming aimlessly about the camp. The intention is to secure a piano and a collection of all sorts of games to furnish amusement for the soldiers. Maps and atlases are greatly in demand and dictionaries are greatly needed. The tent will be lighted by electricity and be open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Chaplain Miller has secured it for one night a week and will endeavor to provide entertainment for the men. There are at present 9000 soldiers at the Presidio, and the reservation presents a lively aspect. Hundreds of visitors spend hours there daily, and the scene is not unlike the appearance of the reservation at the outbreak of the war.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> As the volunteer soldiers returned home, it became evident that the army would need to improve conditions here. The first indication that the camps needed something more than canvas tents came in May 1902 when Maj. Gen. Robert Hughes wrote to Washington saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Army has spent $60,000 on canvas at San Francisco since 1898 and something more permanent is required. I recommend construction of temporary barracks of rough lumber, double tier bunks, and small heating stoves for four battalions.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> To house and feed the returning soldiers, the Army constructed the wood-frame buildings across Lombard Street in 1903, incorporating them with the older wooden kitchens and mess halls surviving from the 1899 Model Camp. Even then, the conditions were considered substandard. The San Francisco Call reported in July of 1904:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"General Adna Chaffee, chief of staff United States Army, accompanied by General Charles Humphrey, made an inspection of the Presidio yesterday. There was no review, no salute, no inspection of the troops. Every department was inspected including the main barracks, cantonments, warehouses and both hospitals. General Chaffee now has a full understanding of the needs of the Presidio. On entering the post, General Chaffee was received in the little shack that serves as headquarters for the Infantry Cantonment. They could barely squeeze in there and Colonel Pitcher took advantage of the occasion to call attention to the needs of an administration building. As far as the cantonments are concerned, the head of the army made a special and complete investigation. Whether he recommends an appropriation for entirely new barracks or whether he will decide that the present quarters of the cantonment camps are sufficient remains to be seen.\"</p> </blockquote>",

Though the lake suffered serious degradation for many years, long term efforts to improve the environmental health of the area are proving effective.</p> <h3>Restoring Mountain Lake</h3> <p>Mountain Lake experienced rough times during the last 100 years. The lake was partially filled when Highway 1 was built next to it in 1939. Since then, traffic pollution has led to an accumulation of heavy metals in the water, impacting our native animal friends. Further challenges came from residents releasing aquatic pets (including an alligator) that competed with native wildlife in the lake.<br /> <br /> With help from scientists, academic institutions and volunteers, Mountain Lake is rebounding. Thanks to an improvement in water quality, the Presidio Trust recently reintroduced the western pond turtle, pacific chorus frog and three-spined stickleback.<br /> <br /> Native submerged aquatic vegetation has also been successfully reintroduced to Mountain Lake, a sign that things are looking up for native species. More than 65 bird species visit the site, and the area has become a living classroom for students learning about ecology.</p>",

With the increased in troop activity near the turn of the century came many changes at the Presidio. New orders restricting activities on the Presidio were issued in the spring of 1899:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"News reporters can no longer use a camera on the reservation. Women can neither enter a barracks nor sit on barracks porches or steps. Privates are not allowed to \"walk, stand, or lie\" on the boardwalk leading from officers' row to the trolley terminus. The civilian fruit stand at the terminus is to be closed and a post exchange opened at the site.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The new post exchange at this site supplied cigars and candy to soldiers and visitors, the profits of which contributed to the comfort and welfare of the command.<br /> <br /> In 1898 this was the edge of a large tent camp that spread over the area now covered by the Letterman Digital Arts Center. It was known as Camp Miller, and volunteer regiments like the First California volunteers camped here before going to fight the Spanish in the Philippines. This camp and others located up the hill across Lombard Street and over in Tennessee Hollow later became known as Camp Merriam, with its East and West Cantonments.<br /> <br /> While waiting to ship out, volunteers from around the country took part in the local sports scene. The entire 51st Iowa Infantry regiment took a train to Stanford University where its football team beat Stanford 6 to 0. Later the team tied the University of California 0-0.<br /> <br /> But by the end of October 1898 Camp Merriam lay almost deserted after most volunteers had sailed for the Philippine Islands. A year later these regiments began returning. The 51st Iowa's historian wrote of their return in 1899.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"General Shafter, himself, with cavalry and artillery, led our regiment on a parade from the pier up Market Street to Golden Gate Avenue, down Van Ness, then Lombard to the Presidio. Company M still had its two dogs, Bob and Dewey, who had gone overseas the year before. At the post, the brick barracks were familiar but nearby stood a new army general hospital. The hillsides were covered with round-topped tents pitched along well kept streets with adjacent wooden kitchens and other buildings.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The 1st Idaho Infantry left Manila on July 29. The ship was quarantined for two days at Yokohama, Japan, because of measles. Arriving in San Francisco Bay on August 29, the regiment marched to the Presidio, only quite a number were unable to stand the walk, and made the trip on the street cars. Pvt. James Camp wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"On the voyage home we had good food. We marched to Camp Presidio where we lived pretty good. The people from San Francisco brought us food to eat. The Sibley tents of the new Model Camp on the warm hillside had board floors and a small stove heated each.\"</p> </blockquote>",

It was in response to several fires on the post, including the tragic fire that claimed the life of General John Pershing's wife, Frances Warren Pershing, and their three daughters. Frances Pershing's father was Francis E. Warren, a US senator of Wyoming, who, after his daughter's death, pushed for a fire station at the Presidio and on military bases around the country.<br /> <br /> After the Presidio was turned over to the National Park Service in 1994, the firefighters at the Presidio became the only park service firefighters trained in both urban and wildland firefighting.

As part of a military post, the small adobe building that would become the Officers' Club served military officers of three nations. Today it is a great space to enjoy an elegant meal or plan an event. It's also a great place to spend an afternoon taking in the historic and artistic exhibits on display.</p> <h3>Heritage Gallery</h3> <p><em>Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. - 5 p.m.</em><br /> The Heritage Gallery showcases artifacts from the diverse cultures and overlapping historical narratives that describe the complex history of the Presidio in the context of California, the nation and its people. The gallery also features films, images, artifacts and multimedia exhibits.<br /> <br /> Been before? The gallery has short-term as well as permanent displays, so there's always something new to see.</p> <h3>Archaeology Lab</h3> <p><em>Open Wednesdays - Guided tours 1 p.m., open lab 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</em><br /> Discovering the past is hard, ongoing work. Come take a look at what technicians from the <a href=\"http://www.presidio.gov/volunteer/Pages/archaeology.aspx\">Presidio Archaeology Lab</a> are doing to make sense of the clues left behind from the original Presidio colonial site.</p> <h3>Preserving the Heart of the Presidio</h3> <p>The adobe walls of this key building have stood for almost 250 years and have their own long history of renovation and restoration. Beginning in 1776, Spanish and Mexican forces occupied and then abandoned the post, allowing the adobe to fall into disrepair. In 1847, the US Army rebuilt the building when its soldiers started to occupy the Presidio. In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) remodeled the Officers' Club to resemble the Mission Revival style.<br /> <br /> The 1970s saw the addition of the bell tower, and restoration in 2011-2016 sought to highlight historical preservation and integrate the Officers' Club into modern San Francisco while reinforcing the structure of the building. Visit the Mesa Room in the club to see the building's history peeled back.</p> <h3>History of a Happening Place</h3> <p>The history of the Officers' Club is the history of the Presidio. Over the years, the building that is now the Presidio Officers' Club has housed living quarters for Spanish and Mexican soldiers, barracks for the U.S. Army, a mess hall and kitchen, laundresses' quarters, post headquarters, an assembly hall, a ballroom, a restaurant and bar, and now a museum.</p> <p><strong>The Spanish Conquest</strong></p> <p>The year is 1776. In one week, some upstarts in Philadelphia will sign the Declaration of Independence. On the West Coast, an expedition of almost 200 mestizo soldiers and colonists, one priest and 1,000 head of cattle under the command of Juan Bautista de Anza arrive here after traveling from Nueva España (now Mexico). These colonists, under command of Lieutenant Jose Joaquin Moraga, established a tiny military garrison, <em> el Presidio de San Francisco</em>. It was the northernmost Spanish settlement in the New World.<br /> <br /> <br /> In the earliest days, Presidio soldiers concerned themselves with protecting the frontier and forcing the indigenous peoples into newly established Spanish-style communities. They built many of the simple buildings from the very available adobe clay, which unfortunately quickly deteriorated from the rain and harsh winds. This building served as the commander's residence and headquarters for the soldiers living here; much later it would become the Officers' Club.<br /> <br /> <br /> Thin soil and strong coastal winds made agriculture and cattle grazing difficult, but the colonists bent themselves to the task. The bay was the Spanish wild frontier and their efforts took a toll on the land, their bodies and their culture. The Presidio's residents were largely on their own.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Mexican Independence and the Presidio</strong><br /> Despite Spain's efforts to fortify the area, wild Alta California became a Mexican territory with the victory of the Mexican Revolution and subsequent independence from Spain in 1821. The modest adobe structure continued to be the commander's home and headquarters for the Presidio under Mexican rule. In 1834, the Presidio was temporarily abandoned when the soldiers moved north to Sonoma to defend that area from Russian and American encroachment. When the US military arrived in 1846, the commander's residence as well as many of the post's buildings were virtually in ruins, and the bay was essentially unprotected.</p> <h3>From US Military Post to National Park Service Park</h3> <p><strong>The US Army comes to the Presidio </strong><br /> The Mexican-American War exhausted Mexico's resources to hold its northern territories. As the Bear Flag Revolt of 1846 routed Mexican forces from the area, the abandoned Presidio was occupied by the US Army. With the flurry of the California Gold Rush in 1849, protection of the San Francisco Bay and its golden cargo became paramount. Fort Point was established, and the Presidio was once again a hub of activity and command. The remodeled building became a barracks, and by the 1880s, became a place for officers to rest and relax.<br /> <br /> <strong>The New Presidio Officers' Club</strong><br /> By the Spanish-American War of 1898, the adobe building built by mestizos and soldiers over 120 years earlier became the officers' club for the most important military port of the Pacific. For nearly 100 years, a constant stream of US troops came to and left from the Presidio, shuttled from the mainland to new US possessions in the Pacific. The Presidio Officers' Club served as an institution for rest, relaxation and entertainment for the leaders of our troops as they served our country.<br /> <br /> <strong>Post to Park, 1994</strong><br /> The Officers' Club, as a part of the Presidio, became a National Park Service site in 1994, officially ending almost 250 years of military service. At the time of its closure, the Presidio was the oldest continuously operating military base in the country and contained a National Historic Landmark District with hundreds of historically significant buildings. As part of the agreement that established Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972, the Presidio was transferred to the park service when Congress decided to close the base as a part of a military base reduction program.<br /> <br /> <br /> Its history as a focal point for the main post continues today for the citizens of San Francisco. A museum and cultural center, gallery, shops, a restaurant, and private and public events fill a busy calendar. Free and open to all, the Presidio Officers' Club offers exhibits tracing the Presidio's past and present, free live music and talks, weekend crafts for kids, and school field trips.</p>",

Today, it's home to the Presidio Landmark apartments. The Public Health Service District is an increasingly popular entry point to trails in the Presidio's Southern Wilds. Parking is limited, so arrive early.</p> <h3>Southern Wilds Trails</h3> <p>You can access four in-and-out trails from here into the Southern Wilds area.

There wasn't a lot in the way of social services then, but one place you could go if you were a merchant seaman in need of aid was the US Marine Hospital, which provided free treatment to sailors of all nations.<br /> <br /> Built in 1875, the Marine Hospital operated until 1932, when it was replaced by the building that stands here now, the Public Health Service Hospital. Two wings were added to the front of the building in the 1950s. The work of caring for ailing sailors continued when the Public Health Service took over.<br /> <br /> <br /> Eventually, the hospital extended its programs to caring for members of the US Coast Guard and other governmental agencies, as well as Native Americans and Vietnamese refugees. The Public Health Service also conducted important research on plague and other communicable diseases.<br /> <br /> After the hospital's closure in 1981, the Military Language Institute used part of the facility from 1982 to 1988. In the early 2000s, the building became a major destination for graffiti artists. In 2009, the Presidio Trust demolished the wings that were added in the 1950s, and the following year the main building reopened as the Presidio Landmark apartments.<br /> <br /> Located in the heart of the Presidio, the historic apartments offer amenities equal to modern apartment complexes throughout the city, with similar rents.</p>",

It is here that the freshwater stream from the Presidio’s largest watershed (known as <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/tennessee-hollow-watershed\">Tennessee Hollow</a>) flows into the saltwater <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/crissy-marsh\">Crissy Marsh</a> and ultimately to San Francisco Bay, creating valuable brackish habitat where plants and animals thrive.</p> <p>The site is named for the U.S. Army’s Quartermaster Corps, which operated in the area when the Presidio was a military post. Quartermaster Reach Marsh is located just east of the <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/tunnel-tops\">Presidio Tunnel Tops</a>, which open to the public in fall 2021. Together, the sites will create a wonderful new experience of the waterfront.</p> <h4>Connect with Nature</h4> <p>Visitors can enjoy an up-close experience of nature along an elevated pedestrian bridge and trail that winds through the marsh. Native salt marsh and riparian plants grown at Presidio Nursery create an extraordinary habitat for fish, crabs, and oysters. Bring your binoculars – Quartermaster Reach is a great place for birding.</p> <p>For the first time, visitors can use this new section of the <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/trails/tennessee-hollow-trail\">Tennessee Hollow Trail</a> to walk from Crissy Field’s East Beach, through Quartermaster Reach, under the Presidio Parkway, and along the 1.2 route tracing the watershed’s springs to their origin near Inspiration Point.</p> <h4>Access + Amenities</h4> <p>Quartermaster Reach is located south of Mason Street at Crissy Field, not far from <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/east-beach\">East Beach</a>. The MUNI 30 bus stops nearby at the intersection of Mason Street and Halleck Street. The site is also just a five minute walk from the <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/presidio-transit-center\">Presidio Transit Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/presidio-visitor-center\">Presidio Visitor Center</a>. Parking is available at a lot to the west on Mason Street and at East Beach. The nearest restrooms are at East Beach.</p> <h4>About the Marsh Restoration</h4> <p>Quartermaster Reach Marsh restoration is the latest milestone in the 20-year revitalization of the Tennessee Hollow Watershed.</p> <p>An Army-era landfill placed over the former saltmarsh was recently removed at Quartermaster Reach, enabling us to bring an 850-foot length of stream once contained in a pipe back to the surface. Box culverts were then installed beneath Mason Street at Crissy Marsh to allow the fresh water of the stream to flow into the saltwater marsh and San Francisco Bay.</p> <p>Specially fabricated fiberglass panels installed within the culverts, and concrete and shell “reef balls” placed in the marsh channels, promote the resurgence of the native Olympic oyster. The Presidio is planting 23,000 plants - including more than 40 different species of saltmarsh and dune plants grown in the Presidio Nursery - to create habitat for migratory shorebirds and water animals like fish and crabs.</p> <p>Restoration was sponsored by the Presidio Trust, the National Park Service, and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.</p> <p> </p>",

The city is full of peaceful oases like Rob Hill Campground. Atop the Presidio's highest point above Baker Beach and under cover of a forest canopy, Rob Hill can make you forget that you're still in the city.<br /> <br /> Rob Hill is home to Camping at the Presidio (CAP), providing meaningful outdoor experiences to kids who don't have many opportunities to camp or visit national parks. It's also a training program for youth leaders, designed to get them comfortable leading their own camping trips.<br /> <br /> The campground is for group camping only, and open from April through November. Dates fill quickly.

Below the Golden Gate Bridge is Fort Point, a Civil War-era US Army post, but this was not the first fortification to be built here.<br /> <br /> Prior to Fort Point, the Spanish built a fort of their own, Castillo de San Joaquí­n, which sat on a cliff nearly in the same place as Fort Point, only higher up. Castillo de San Joaquí­n was destroyed when the US Army blew up the bluff where it stood, in order to build Fort Point, because they wanted their fort to be able to fire at ships from water level.<br /> <br /> On this walk you will mostly see concrete coastal defense structures installed from the late 1890s in a time known as the Endicott Period of coastal defenses, although a 1970s Nike ground to air missile base on the Presidio marked the final period of defenses here.</p>",

        "notes": "Soldiers Return: Philippines War Tour\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/soldiers-return-philippines-war-tour.htm\n\n<p>In May of 1904, Colonel Nobel wrote a letter in explaining why the East Cantonment had such a high desertion rate.<br /> <br /> The present recruits are of very low quality. Recruiting officers concern themselves more with quantity than quality. The result is a class of men who are of inferior character, many being mere nomads. Also contributing to the desertions are the poor accommodations and deplorable surroundings. The men can see the Artillery and the 9th Cavalry troops over at the Presidio's main post with their good barracks, reading room, gymnasium, and so forth. The contrast with the cantonment's humble barracks causes discontent. Also, the numerous dives and saloons just outside the cantonment provide a source of evil. The veterans of foreign service expect better when they came home, but when they first see the post they are heartsick. While much has been done to improve matters much remains to be done.<br /> <br /> As Colonel Noble noted, the poor quality of the recruits led to less than savory interactions between the soldiers and citizens and proprietors of San Francisco. Papers reported on both the trouble caused by drunk soldiers, and the gouging of soldiers by local grafters. In August 1900 the San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>Last night additional police officers were detailed to the Barbary Coast to prevent the soldiers from repeating Monday night's outrages. The danger to citizens through soldiers being allowed to carry their revolvers while away from camp has been exemplified on more than one occasion, notably the murder in the Spreckles Market by Private Rosser of the Tennessee Regiment. Another case, which fortunately did not have a tragic ending, occurred early yesterday morning. Several colored soldiers were drinking in the saloon at Pacific Street when a row started and one of the soldiers pulled a revolver out of his pocket and fired a shot at a white man. The bullet fortunately missed its mark. The soldiers fled from the saloon and Sergeant Christiansen was unable to get any clue to the identity of the would-be murderer.</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The most notorious of the bar brawls and riots by Presidio soldiers occurred on Christmas night 1901. The San Francisco Call reported on December 26, 1901:</p> <blockquote> <p>Not much of peace on earth, nor good will toward men, was displayed yesterday afternoon by more than 1000 howling soldiers in front of Dave Tarpey's saloon, on Baker Street, near Greenwich, just outside the Presidio grounds. They were men from several regiments, cursing, yelling, demanding blood and mixing in a general free-for-all. The riot was finally quelled by the police and several detachments of troops from the Presidio. Revolvers, clubs, stones and mud were brought into play during the riot, and for their participation fifty-nine of Uncle Sam's warriors are under arrest in the reservation and fifteen of them are lodged in the North End police station. The wonder of the riot is that no one was seriously injured. Dave Tarpey's saloon received a shake-up that brought back recollections of the old Tennessee days.</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> Soldiers being discharged from the army often encountered men scheming to fleece them of their money near the Presidio Gates. In April 1901, the San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>Twenty-seventh Infantry soldiers mustering out at the Presidio yesterday had an opportunity to \"get even\" with certain neighborhood storekeepers and others of the human vampire species. Early in the morning the grafters began to gather around the entrance to the Presidio. Their number kept increasing until, at 12 o'clock, there were so many of those bipeds who make an easy living off the unsophisticated soldiers, that it became necessary to adopt drastic measures to protect the soldiers. Colonel Cummins had the camp surrounded by a mounted guard with orders to keep all persons out who could give no valid reason for their presence. The result being that all the men who had been hanging around the camps were driven from the reservation. At the entrance to the Presidio, the numerous individuals who were under the impression that a soldier is easy game fell into the hands of police officers, who kept them on the move, resulting in a freedom from the wily schemers not having been enjoyed for some time.</p> </blockquote>",

During the Philippine war years the stockade, or jail, was kept busy detaining soldiers caught taking absents without leave, participating in barroom brawls, or any number of other offenses.<br /> <br /> The March 1900 San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The number of military convicts who have evaded the vigilance of their guards and taken French leave within the past few weeks has been unusually large. The climax was reached when a prisoner, who was working in the quarry at the mortar battery about two miles beyond the Presidio, disappeared Friday accompanied by the sentinel detailed to guard him. Colonel Eskridge yesterday ordered that all guards hereafter be armed with repeating shotguns loaded with buckshot. The ordnance department at once issued twenty of these weapons. Hereafter, if a prisoner attempts to escape he will take big chances, as buckshot is much more effective in bringing down a runaway than a rifle bullet.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> In October 1902, the 3rd Squadron of the famed 9th Cavalry \"Buffalo Soldiers\" arrived for duty at the Presidio; the first time an African American unit was assigned here. On arrival, the soldiers were dismayed to find that their horses were placed in the new flimsy shed stables located in the damp marshy flats below the bluff in front of you. They immediately applied for stables located on top of the bluff, in the area in front of you, only to be refused. This refusal was probably due to the better stables already being assigned to another cavalry unit rather than discrimination against the black troopers.<br /> <br /> Four troops of the 9th Cavalry served at the Presidio for the next two years. During the summer of 1903, they patrolled Yosemite and Sequoia national parks. They also performed numerous drills and exercises that entertained the citizens of San Francisco.<br /> <br /> The San Francisco Call published this account in the spring of 1904:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The 9th cavalry troops have been in the field every day, except Saturdays and Sundays, for several hours, and the result is shown by the fine display the squadron made yesterday. They were put through a pretty stiff drill, and when they dashed across the big field under full gallop with the bright guidons waving in the morning breeze, they presented a stunning appearance. Following the main drill came the pitching of the Sibley tents. In less than five minutes every tent was up. What had been a plain, smooth, clear field could now house a small army of men. At the conclusion the bugles sounded recall and the troopers galloped off the field to the stables. The day was absolutely perfect\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> In May of 1903, two of the 9th Cavalry troops had the special honor of serving as Theodore Roosevelt's presidential escort during his two-day visit to San Francisco, the first time black troops had been asked to do so.<br /> <br /> The San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"As President Roosevelt emerged from the train depot he was greeted by hearty cheering from citizens who pressed against the wire cable on each side of the thoroughfare. The soldiers of the Ninth Cavalry presented sabers and the band stationed at the corner played enlivening music.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> In the afternoon, five thousand people gathered at the Baker Street entrance of Golden Gate Park to see President Roosevelt break ground for a monument to the late President McKinley. They waited patiently for the President to arrive and when he put in an appearance, escorted by the Ninth Cavalry, he was greeted enthusiastically.</p>",

These men made a big impression on both the citizens of San Francisco and the local military establishment and the name has persisted through the years.<br /> <br /> Oral Histories and letters from this regiment portray what it was like for the many young men from across America, who had volunteered to fight in a land far from anything they know. From oral histories we hear - about the trip to San Francisco:</p> <blockquote> <p>No member of the regiment will ever forget the exciting moment when the news that we were to go to the Philippines spread through the camp. We did not know just where these islands were, but we wanted to go bad and find out their location.</p> <p><br /> Then came the preparations for the long trip to San Francisco, which we started on June 10, 1898. The trip to Frisco brings to us all the most pleasant memories-the open hospitality of the various cities and towns through which we passed, the cordial greetings and many kindnesses shown us, the good meals and hearty God-speeds--all will never be forgotten.<br /> <br /> Then came the Grand Canyon, beautiful Salt Lake City, the snowy mountains, and finally San Francisco. We cannot congratulate ourselves on the soldierly appearance of the boys as we marched through the City to the sand dunes of Camp Merritt, near Golden Gate Park; but under the parti-colored coats beat manly hearts filled with patriotism and only awaiting opportunity to prove same.<br /> <br /> To say we were given the glad hand by the people of San Francisco poorly expresses our reception by them. Never before was there seen such free-handed hospitality and welcome given to so ragged a lot of soldiers, or will we admit that there was ever a more appreciative lot of hungry boys with excellent digestions. We say hungry, but this condition did not last long, and though the strain on our digestions was great, we are proud to say that no man broke the first and most important rule of soldier life--eat whenever you get the chance.</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> A series of letters written by Richard Steele of the 1st Tennessee Infantry to his Aunt and Uncle reflect his impressions of his stay in San Francisco. Several letters report on the regiments activities and entertainment in the city.</p> <blockquote> <p>June 20, 1898<br /> <br /> Dear Auntie,<br /> Friday evening after we settled, we all went to the Sutro bath house out on the coast about three miles and went in, which made us all feel like new boys. We all put on bathing suits and some of the boys went in 9 foot water, some in 6 and some in four, but I couldn't hardly swim in four foot, so I just contented myself by something good.<br /> <br /> Yesterday we were allowed to go to town and stay two hours at a time, so I went to town twice and we got pretty view of the town, but the most important place was China town, it contains about four blocks and there the Chinese are all together and trade with each other.<br /> <br /> Auntie tell all my friends to write to me even the little girls I used to know, for it would make me feel right happy to hear from a nice pretty little girl from Nashville, but Nashville can't beat Frisco on pretty girls because they are all pretty and are as sweet as these plums that grow out here. I don't see how I will ever be able to come to Nashville again after mixing with the western people.<br /> <br /> July 4, 1898<br /> We left camp this morning about 7:30 to enter the parade and suppose we marched about ten miles, but the time past away fast, for every step we marched we were cheered by the California people and some of them say we drilled better than any regiment out of fifteen or twenty although we were not equipped, the people would say they are ragged but they can drill.</p> </blockquote>",

Radiolaria in these rocks lived somewhere in the central Pacific between 200 and 100 million years ago.<br /> <br /> The graywacke sandstone formed at the edge of North America during submarine landslides that dumped sand into the deep-ocean subduction trench about 100 million years ago. These rocks sometimes contain fossilized shells of marine mollusks.</p>",

        "notes": "The Spanish American War: Philippines War Tour\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-spanish-american-war-philippines-war-tour.htm\n\n<p>To many, the Spanish American War is only a faint memory from scant discussion in some distant American History course. If you were living in America in the late 1890s, you would be reading newspaper articles and editorials, particularly in William Randolf Hearst's papers in San Francisco and New York, declaring the Spanish mistreatment of colonial subjects and encouraging the country to go to war to liberate the oppressed Cubans and other Spanish colonies. Although these articles were often based on accounts of doubtful accuracy, they convinced many that a war with Spain was the right thing to do.<br /> <br /> After the battleship Maine mysteriously blew up in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, and a naval court of inquiry and newspapers proclaimed it the result of a bomb, it did not take much convincing for Congress to declare war on Spain on April 19. By May, troops began pouring into the Presidio, preparing to fight the Spanish in the Philippines. Over the next two years, the Presidio was bustling with activity as over 80,000 men and their gear passed through the post during the seven-month Spanish War and the following three year Philippine War. Afterwards, troops continued to circulate through the Presidio on their way to and from the Philippine Islands for more than a decade.<br /> <br /> Many of the soldiers were volunteers who joined the army in their home states - like Utah, Iowa, Tennessee, New York, Kansas, and Nebraska. They came to the Presidio by train, stopping here for several weeks or months before shipping out to the Philippines. On returning from war, many of these same volunteers made their last stop here before leaving the army and returning home.</p>",

This groundwater is often very alkaline and can be home to plant species specifically adapted to those conditions, like Franciscan thistle. The willows seen here grow naturally in wet areas and are indicative of water near the ground surface, in this case coming from serpentine seeps.<br /> <br /> This willow grove provides exceptional habitat for songbirds. Keep your eyes peeled for warblers and sparrows. You may also hear the chittering and whistling dive-bombing of an Anna's hummingbird. Hawks and ravens are common sights overhead taking advantage of the updrafts over the bluffs, and looking out to sea you may spot cormorants, brown pelicans and surf scoters.</p>",

        "notes": "Bellefield\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/bellefield.htm\n\n<p>Formerly the country place of the Newbold-Morgan family, Bellefield embodies the distinctive characteristics of Colonial Revival country-house architecture in the Hudson Valley dating to a renovation and expansion designed by McKim, Mead & White from 1909-1911. The house reflects changes in architectural styles and building methods dating back to its initial construction in 1795.</p> <h4>The River Families of the Hudson Valley</h4> <p>In the eighteenth century, New Yorkers acquired large parcels of property along the Hudson, prized for the rich agricultural soils and ready access to the river. Early land owners and New York City merchants accumulated great wealth selling or leasing the land to families who established modest farms. By the time of the Civil War, wealthy residents of New York City were converting the old riverfront farms to elegant seasonal residences. Drawn by the natural beauty of the region, they transformed these working farms into country estates that featured grand houses, pleasure grounds, formal gardens, and model farms.</p> <p>The river families typically used their Hudson Valley homes in spring and fall, favoring other seaside settings, such as Newport and Bar Harbor during the summer. While here, they engaged in a range of leisurely pursuits including carriage drives, horseback riding, lawn tennis, swimming and boating. River society was composed of discreet and inconspicuous families like the Astors, Livingstons and Roosevelts whose genteel way of life was distinguished from the “new money” opulence of their wealthy industrialist neighbors during the Gilded Age.</p> <h4>The Newbolds of Bellefield</h4> <p>New York State Senator Thomas Newbold and his wife Sarah Coolidge purchased Bellefield in 1885. Newbold was a man of local prominence serving as State Senator for the Hyde Park district and later as head of the State Health Department. Sarah was from a cultivated Boston family and a direct descendant of President Thomas Jefferson. Their children, Mary, Jefferson and Julia, were playmates of Franklin Roosevelt, riding bicycles and horses freely among the private roads connecting the river estates.</p> <p>Constructed in 1795, the house was perceived locally to have historic significance as one of the oldest colonial houses along the Hudson River. Bellefield was remodeled between 1909 and 1911 by prominent architects McKim, Mead & White, enlarging the house from 16 to 29 rooms. The new facade in the restrained, neoclassical style was typical of country place architecture at the turn of the century.</p> <p>McKim, Mead & White transformed the original two-story three-bay house by adding two symmetrical two-bay wings to either side and tying the entire front facade together by the addition of a raised brick and stone terrace with a one-story Doric portico sheltering the center entrance. The gable roof features pedimented dormer windows and prominent chimney stacks, the eaves are detailed with mutules and guttae (recalling the style of the original Federal house), and the walls are simply treated in stucco, with long shuttered casement windows as the primary design elements. A large stair hall lit by a Palladian window was incorporated into the north wing. The rear of the house features flush board siding, quoins, and tall six-over-six double-hung sash windows that may have been remnants of the original house. Eaves that continued the same classical detailing found on the front tied the facade together with the rest of the house. The renovations also left intact a mid-nineteenth-century wrought-iron veranda at the rear. The McKim, Mead & White design of the interior featured restrained neoclassical paneling and mantelpieces in the living room, entrance hall, and stair hall, while leaving intact most of the earlier rooms.</p> <h4>The Walled Garden at Bellefield</h4> <p>In 1912, Newbold asked his cousin Beatrix Jones to design a new garden. Marrying later that year, Beatrix Farrand would soon become one of the leading landscape architects of her time. During her prolific career, Farrand created gardens for many influential individuals, public institutions and universities and was selected a founding member—the only woman—of the Association of American Landscape Architects in 1899. Few of her gardens remain, but notable exceptions include the Rockefeller’s Eyrie Garden, large portions of the Princeton and Yale campuses, and Dumbarton Oaks, indisputably one of the great gardens of the world. The garden at Bellefield is thought to be her earliest extant residential design. Created nearly two decades into her professional career, it is a fully mature work consistent in complexity and depth with her most famous projects.</p>",

Roosevelt's own instructions, written on December 26, 1937, his body was to be buried \"where the sun dial stands in the garden.\" His wishes reflect his intense connection to the place of his birth and formative years, the launching point of his rise to public prominence, his refuge from the serious demands of the world, and the place where he found the resources to face head on the challenges first of polio, then of executive office in a time of dire national crisis. FDR's burial at Springwood ensured his home's establishment as a national shrine. </p> <p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt died unexpectedly from a cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945 at Warm Springs, Georgia. He made his last journey from Warm Springs on the morning of April 13, 1945. His bronze coffin, covered by the American flag, followed a procession from the Little White House between double ranks of 2,000 servicemen en route to the funeral train for Washington. The roll of muffled drums added a solemn mood to the slow-moving cortege, which paused momentarily where all of the patients of his infantile paralysis Foundation were assembled.</p> <p>The train moved slowly throughout the night, passing stations filled with silent crowds gathered in reverence to watch as the President passed by. At Union Station, the procession continued with full military escort along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House for a funeral service in the East Room.</p> <p>That evening, the funeral train embarked on the final length of the journey. In the rose garden at Hyde Park, three hundred people waited in silence on the morning of April 15. The approaching sound of Chopin’s “Funeral March,” performed by the West Point band, signified the horse-drawn caisson was climbing the hillside through the woods toward the President’s final resting place.</p> <p>The monument marking FDR’s grave was executed to the president’s design by the Vermont Marble Company in Proctor, Vermont. For more than a century, Vermont marble was used in the construction of important public buildings and monuments, including many of the nation’s finest structures—the Jefferson Memorial, the U.S. Supreme Court Building, and eventually the United Nations headquarters in New York City.</p> <p>FDR specified that a plain white marble monument without carving or decoration be placed at his grave, situated east and west, measuring 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet high with a base extending 2 feet around the perimeter. The memorial stone was manufactured to President Roosevelt’s design and installed in fall of 1945. According to the President’s wishes, Mrs. Roosevelt was interred here also upon her death in 1962.</p>",

        "notes": "Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/franklin-d-roosevelt-presidential-library-and-museum.htm\n\n<p>When President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed the idea of building a library to house his papers and memorabilia, detractors believed he was simply interested in constructing a monument to himself. Roosevelt, however, viewed the library as a solution to two problems—how to simultaneously preserve and provide public access to the records of his presidency. His was an attitude of “open government,” believing that the people of the United States were entitled to a better look at how their government was working, even at the executive level.</p> <p>As an avid amateur historian, Roosevelt recognized the value of his papers and believed they should be saved for future historians and the American people. His collections contain personal and family papers, manuscripts related to his public career at the state and national level, photographs, sound and motion picture recordings, books, and periodicals. FDR also had a vast memorabilia collection, including ship models, prints and paintings, state gifts, gifts from the American people, and family items.</p> <p>By the time FDR reached the Presidency, his personal and professional papers amounted to such a large collection of material there was no single place that could adequately house it all. During his presidency, Roosevelt received approximately 4,000 letters a day from people commenting on his policies and his running of the government. He enjoyed his contact with the people and encouraged their writing. On November 19, 1939 at the cornerstone laying ceremony for the library, Roosevelt said, “Of the papers which will come to rest here I personally attach less importance to the documents of those who have occupied high public or private office, than I do the spontaneous letters which have come to me and my family and my associates from men, from women, and from children in every part of the United States, telling me of their conditions and problems, and giving me their opinions.”</p> <p>In 1934, Roosevelt signed legislation allowing for the creation of the National Archives, a repository dedicated to preserving the nation’s history. He had always had an interest in history and recordkeeping, and often involved himself in the organization of the new agency. In a 1949 article published in The American Archivist, Dr. R.D.W. Connor recalls his first meeting with Roosevelt, during which he was appointed Archivist of the United States. Connor described his meeting with Roosevelt, saying he “delivered a dissertation on the importance of the National Archives, both to the government and to scholars, pointed out some of its problems that required immediate attention, and assured me that I could rely on his continued interest in its development. ‘You know,’ [Roosevelt] added, ‘it’s my baby!’”</p> <p>At a press conference held December 10, 1938, Roosevelt explained the need for a place to keep his own papers after his presidency, saying, “For the last two years I have been considering more and more the final disposal of what amounts to probably the largest collection of original source material of almost anybody over the last quarter of a century.” To solve this problem, FDR wanted to build a library to house his collections on his family property in Hyde Park.</p> <p>Roosevelt shared this vision with those at the press conference, saying, “Because these papers relate to so many periods and activities which are not connected with my service in the Federal Government, I do not wish to break them up, leaving a portion of them to the National Archives and dividing the rest . . . It is my desire that they be kept as a whole and intact in their original condition, available to scholars of the future in one definite locality.”</p> <p>In addition, Roosevelt hoped the library would also become the repository for the papers of his associates and contemporaries. He envisioned creating a source material collection, a place where people could research not just the FDR administration, but a significant period in American and International history. Roosevelt explained this idea at his press conference, saying the library would hold all of his own collections along with “other source material relating to this period in our history as might be donated to the collection in the future by other members of the present Administration.”</p> <p>FDR’s idea was to build a new library using private funds, then to give the structure and its historical collections over to the United States government. The National Archives would become stewards of the library and its historical materials—museum objects, archival documents, photographs, and moving images. The government would also be charged with maintaining open access to these materials in the form of a museum and research room.</p> <p>His plan for the first presidential library set a precedent that all future chief executives have followed since, and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) now administers 13 of these institutions in all.<br /> <br /> <em>Article courtesy of the Franklin D.

        "notes": "Springwood\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/springwood.htm\n\n<p>Home to the 32nd and longest-serving president of the United States, Springwood reflects much of Franklin D. Roosevelt's personality and values. FDR returned to Springwood often, drawing on his roots here to renew his spirit during times of personal and political crisis. These walls bear witness to lively and somber discussions that profoundly shaped our nation and the world.</p> <p>Springwood was home to one of our nation's most famous disabled persons. The house and its furnishings tell the story how FDR modified his environment to mitigate the effects of a world that was not designed for people with disabilities. The ramps, handrails, elevator, custom wheelchairs, crutches, and other artifacts of the president's disability are preserved in place at Springwood. </p> <p>The original house was built about 1793 and later renovated into an Italianate style villa about 1850. The Roosevelts undertook a substantial enlargement and redesign of the Springwood house, transforming it from an Italianate villa into a Colonial Revival–style mansion designed by Hoppin & Koen of New York City. The enlargement, completed in 1916, accommodated Franklin and Eleanor's growing family while creating a more formal and stylish residence that reflected FDR's political aspirations. The new design was evocative of neoclassical mansions in the Hudson Valley during the formative years of the United States of America. </p> <p>The 1915 alterations resulted in extensive changes to the house interior including the raising of the central roof to create a full third floor, expansion of the entrance hall, addition of the living room and a large suite of bedrooms above, and enlargement of the service areas. The stone and stucco house has a roughly U-shaped plan of two and three stories, and today reflects a Colonial Revival style appearance.</p> <p>The interior of the house, which is furnished according to its appearance c. 1941, consists of a mixture of styles reflecting the additive nature of the 1915 alteration and expansion. In general, rooms that predate 1915 retain their earlier architectural details, except the entrance hall. This room features neoclassical arched openings, wainscot, and plaster paneling dating from 1915 and an 1892 staircase with turned balusters and carved newel posts in the Romanesque Revival style. The dark-stained grained woodwork installed in 1915 matches the visual appearance of the earlier finish on the staircase. A drawing room and dining room that predate 1915 are located off the hall, and the Smoking Room in the octagon wing dates to 1887. North of the entrance hall, the 1915 north wing and earlier service wing contain a series of service rooms, including the kitchen and servant's hall. FDR's study, which opens onto the loggia, and a rope-pulled lift he used after he contracted polio are also in the 1915 north wing. A gallery framed by French doors extends south of the entrance hall, with a small room known as the Snuggery to the east, formerly the south parlor in the c.1850 tower. The gallery opens to the living room in the south wing added in 1915. This room, the largest in the house, is ornately detailed with two fireplaces surrounded by shield and rose appliques, a canvas ceiling with decorative molding, raised wood paneling finished in a dark color matching the entrance hall, and French doors that open onto the south porch. The walls are lined with built-in bookcases.</p> <p>The upper floors of the Home are generally simply detailed with painted woodwork and papered walls. Bedrooms for Sara, Franklin and Eleanor occupy the second floor of the south wing. Five bedrooms are in the main block of the house. These include the original master bedroom for the house, where FDR was born. The second floor of the north wing contains eight servants' rooms. On the landing of the stairs to the third floor are two rooms for visiting servants. The third floor of the house contains three bedrooms, a play room, and a nursery.</p> <p>Host to the president and his family, friends, cabinet members, secretaries, ambassadors, foreign government officials, and royalty for extended stays away from the White House, Springwood is full of history. It bears the unmistakable imprint of FDR's personality. It is the house where he was born, endured his early battle with polio, crafted his vision for a modern world governed by an alliance of peaceful nations, and where he returned frequently during times of national and international crises to partake of its restorative nature. It was his wish to leave the house intact to the American people. Soon after his death, the family transferred ownership to the National Park Service. The Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site opened to the public in 1946 and has remained in continuous operation as a museum since. </p>",

        "notes": "The Roosevelt Home Garden\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-roosevelt-home-garden.htm\n\n<p>The Home Garden, nearly two acres in size, was a central part of life for the Roosevelt family. FDR grew up playing in the garden and savoring its bounty. His children and grandchildren helped work the garden, pulling weeds and harvesting its fruits and vegetables. FDR's memories of the garden helped shape his values and sense of identity.</p> <p>Large home gardens like the Roosevelt's garden were typical features of the diverse, self-sustaining Hudson River estate farms. These farms grew a variety of crops in gardens, fields and orchards and maintained livestock like chickens, hogs and cattle to provide meat as well as eggs and dairy products for the table.</p> <p>When the Roosevelts originally bought this property, the vegetable garden occupied a small bed in the present-day rose garden and gravesite. Although they were only a family of three, the garden expanded continuously throughout their time at Springwood, even after FDR’s departure for school and James Roosevelt’s death in 1900.</p> <p>The Home Garden was an integral part of Roosevelt family life. Frequently mentioned in letters between the Roosevelts, it was clearly important not only as a source of food, but as a part of their home—a part they made an effort to enjoy no matter where they were staying. When the Roosevelts weren’t living at Springwood, they would have produce shipped from their garden to wherever they were—to their property in Campobello, to New York, and to FDR at school in Massachusetts.</p> <p>The current vegetable garden is designed to replicate the Roosevelts’ garden with as much historic accuracy as possible. Minor adjustments are introduced to ensure its health and accessibility, including deer fencing around its perimeter and porous pavement paths. In addition, although the heirloom vegetable varieties grown in the garden today remain the same as during the Roosevelts’ time, they are cultivated using modern organic practices. Bug traps, black biodegradable film, white row cover, and kaolin clay are all examples of these modern strategies used in combat typical garden pests.</p> <p>The Home Garden is maintained through the support of volunteers who help plant, maintain, and harvest the crops. Produce is donated by the park's philanthropic partner, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Hyde Park Foundation, to Dutchess Outreach in the city of Poughkeepsie. In addition to being a food resource, this garden is used for a variety of educational programs, and is free and open for the public to enjoy.

        "notes": "The Stables\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-stables.htm\n\n<p>FDR's father James Roosevelt built the Coach House, also known as the Stables, in 1886. Hudson Valley architect Frederick Clarke Withers (1828-1901) of Newburgh, New York, designed the Queen Anne-style building. James Roosevelt commissioned Withers after the peak of his career, during his later phase working in the Queen Anne and more academic Gothic Revival styles. At the time of the construction of the Coach House in 1886, Withers had recently been in the area, working in 1885 on the Frank Hasbrouck house on Market Street in Poughkeepsie. For the Roosevelts, Withers designed a two-story frame building featuring characteristic Queen Anne-style details, including gable roofs with bargeboards and a turreted cupola, a prominent oriel window and projecting porch, fish-scale shingles on the second story, and doors with braces recalling the pattern of half-timbering. The Coach House reflects the hallmarks of Withers' work during the period, as illustrated by his better-known commissions such as the Queen Anne-style James Dunbar House in Monmouth Beach, New Jersey (1881). The intact interior of the Coach House, complete with horse stalls and a tack room, illustrates the function of this late-nineteenth-century building type. Aside from the historic addition of a sleeping porch on the rear elevation prior to 1924, the Coach House remains largely unchanged from the original construction. The existing rifle gray and dark maroon paint scheme is historic but not original to the building.</p> <p>One among the first generation of professional American architects, Withers was an English immigrant who did his initial training in Dorchester and London and then accepted a position in 1852 with Andrew Jackson Downing in Newburgh. This association was short-lived due to Downing's death in July 1852. Soon after, Withers became associated with Calvert Vaux, another English immigrant architect working in Newburgh. The partnership of Vaux & Withers continued until 1856, when Vaux left Newburgh to assist Frederick Law Olmsted with the design of Central Park. Withers subsequently built a reputation for continuing the Downing legacy of picturesque design. He became well known for his ecclesiastical work and, in particular, for introducing the High Victorian Gothic style to the United States. One of Withers' best known buildings is the Jefferson Market Courthouse in New York, a flamboyant High Victorian Gothic complex completed in 1877. James Roosevelt may have known of Withers from his commission for the massive main building complex at the Hudson River State Hospital, built on the site of the Roosevelts' former country home, Mount Hope, near Poughkeepsie. Withers prepared his initial drawings for the hospital in 1867, but construction was not completed until 1878. By the time of its completion, the High Victorian Gothic style was falling out of favor, and Withers had begun to work in late medieval styles that collectively became known in the United States as the Queen Anne style.</p>",

        "name": "The Wild Garden",
        "notes": "The Wild Garden\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-wild-garden.htm\n\n<p>The idea of the wild garden originated in the late nineteenth century as a counterpoint and challenge to the prevailing fashion for excessively formal gardens characterized by geometric patterns of tender plants, standard roses, statuary, and terraced architecture. Codified and popularized by Irish gardener William Robinson (1838-1935), the wild garden introduced fresh gardening principles that embraced and celebrated the use of hardy plants cultivated in naturalized plantings. The wild garden is characterized by a mix of native and exotic plants laid out to mimic patterns observed in the wild landscape. It includes layers of densely planted perennials and groundcovers in natural drifts among trees and hardy shrubs.</p> <p>The wild garden is in no way truly wild, allowed to return to a natural state. It is a method of gardening where the plant’s nature and habit of growth dictates the design. Human intervention is required, but undetectable.</p> <p>Based on his first-hand observations of natural habitats in Europe and North America, Robinson shared these principles in magazine articles and his ground-breaking and highly influential book <i>The Wild Garden</i>, published in<i> </i>1870. His sensibility focused on the “outer parts of pleasure grounds,” with the “fields, woods, and copses . . . and in neglected places in almost every kind of garden.” The wild garden celebrates untidy edges, where the garden blends into a larger landscape.</p> <p>Hardy plants utilized in the wild garden include more than native species. The wild garden also features plants from foreign but temperate climate zones. Many of these are familiar garden standards today, but they were novel for the nineteenth-century.</p> <p>Beatrix Farrand was no stranger to Robinson and his art. She visited Robinson and his home Gravetye Manor in England on several occasions, including 1908 when she photographed his gardens at their peak. Throughout her career, Farrand drew heavily on Robinson’s writings. Farrand’s lifelong associate, Robert Patterson, noted that her work had a “freedom of scale, a subtle softness of line and an unobtrusive asymmetry.”</p> <h4>Restoration of the Wild Garden at Bellefield</h4> <p>Restoration of the wild garden began in 2022 and is made possible in partnership with the Beatrix Farrand Garden Association, an official philanthropic partner of the National Park Service. The realization of Beatrix Farrand’s wild garden at Bellefield has been a goal since the beginning of the adjacent walled garden’s revival. The original planting details do not survive, but a note identifying the contour and location of the wild garden on a surviving plan in the Farrand archive at UC Berkeley indicate the intent.</p> <p>A team of horticulturists, historians, and National Park Service staff have researched, budgeted, and devised a plan of action to create this garden. The wild garden will display an example of a natural design element that was an important feature of Beatrix Farrand’s design aesthetic. The garden will incorporate the use of native trees, shrubs, and plants as a way of championing Farrand’s early use of these species and connecting her to modern horticultural trends. Ultimately, the wild garden will connect the garden at Bellefield to the larger surrounding landscape and neighboring Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site, both increasing accessibility and improving visibility.</p>",

        "name": "Top Cottage",
        "notes": "Top Cottage\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/topcottage.htm\n\n<p>Franklin D. Roosevelt built Top Cottage for use as a private retreat where, after his presidency, he could write his memoirs and history. But world events intervened. FDR was re-elected for an unprecedented third and fourth term during a period of intense international crisis. The simplicity of Top Cottage belies its significance as a gathering place for the Roosevelts, world leaders, royalty, and the president's administration who convened in this restful setting to witness a world disintegrating into war and imagine a future with nations united in peace. </p> <h4>History of the Building</h4> <p>FDR began purchasing the property on which he would eventually build Top Cottage in June of 1935. Later that year he was discussing plans for its construction with his sixth cousin and close companion Margaret \"Daisy\" Suckley. Together, they refined and developed the concept for a simple and modest two-bedroom house over the next few years. By 1938, FDR had assembled a parcel of land that included the wooded hilltop plateau for the cottage as well as some buffers to the south and east to protect the serene setting. Architect Henry Toombs, with whom FDR had collaborated on earlier projects (including the Little White House at Warm Springs and Val-Kill Cottage), prepared the detailed construction drawings and specifications. Construction began later that summer and concluded in June 1939.</p> <h4>The Architecture and Furnishings</h4> <p>Top Cottage recalls the massing, materials, and simple detailing of Dutch colonial architecture of the Hudson Valley. The house is a one-and-one-half story, random-coursed fieldstone building with steeply pitched gable roofs. The west facade of the house extends in a concave pitch over an open, full-width porch.</p> <p>The primary interior space is the living room, which occupies the entire first floor of the central block and is organized around a large stone fireplace. FDR furnished the room with the things that reflected his interests, family history, and his long public career and presidency, including replicas of furniture owned by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson. Framed prints documented the scenic beauty of the Hudson Valley and American political traditions. The room feels spacious, with a plastered cathedral ceiling, four large windows, and sliding glass doors that open onto the porch, allowing views out into the wooded landscape and the Hudson River Valley in the distance.</p> <h4>Accommodating FDR's Disability</h4> <p>FDR's plan for Top Cottage eliminated a number of mobility barriers traditionally present in residences of the period. With its primary spaces on a single floor and its ground-level exterior entries, the cottage plan accommodated the president's wheelchair. Once over the small lip at the entries, FDR could move freely from room to room in his wheelchair and onto the expansive porch. An earthen ramp, believed to be original to the house, provides access between the porch and the lawn. </p> <h4>A Retreat for Allies During Turbulent Times</h4> <p>Roosevelt's use of Top Cottage as the setting for the final event in the carefully organized royal visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1939 is typical of how the Roosevelts employed personal space to foster relationships with world leaders and Washington colleagues. FDR's well-documented personal style of governing softened distinctions between official state business and social entertainments. Hosting the royal couple not only strengthened the relationship between FDR and George VI, but also the relationship between the United States and Britain, a relationship which would be instrumental in fighting the world-wide threat of fascism. </p> <p>Following the very public opening of Top Cottage with the royal picnic of 1939, FDR's use of the cottage took on a decidedly more private character. Numerous visits by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, American military officers and ambassadors, and European royal families in exile transpired here without the audience gathered to witness the king and queen's visit. Subsequent visits to Top Cottage from other government officials and international personalities, included Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Crown Princess Louise of Sweden, Queen Wilhelmina and Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, Princess Martha of Norway, and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King. </p>",

        "notes": "Walled Garden at Bellefield\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/walled-garden-at-bellefield.htm\n\n<p>The walled garden at Bellefield is a delight for the senses by one of America’s most celebrated landscape architects, Beatrix Farrand (1872-1959). Renowned for the private estate gardens she designed for East Coast society and some of the most prestigious private universities and colleges, Bellefield represents a gem of American garden design and one of Farrand's very few surviving private commissions.<br /> <br /> In 1911 Thomas Newbold asked his cousin Beatrix Jones (later Beatrix Jones Farrand) to design a garden adjacent to his newly rennovated house at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bellefield.htm\">Bellefield</a>. Farrand had been exposed to several well-known architects and landscape designers. She was well-acquainted with Charles Follen McKim, the architect who redesigned Bellefield (they had previously traveled together in Scotland). Farrand was influenced by several well-known landscape architects and garden designers early in her career including Charles Sprague Sargent, William Robinson, and Gertrude Jekyll. The garden at Bellefield was one of her earlier residential design commissions.<br /> <br /> The new garden stretched south from a terrace attached to the house and was enclosed by a stone wall and hemlock hedge. Farrand divided the garden into three garden rooms defined by gravel walks, long planting beds, and areas of open lawn. Farrand laid out the garden in forced perspective so that the sequentially smaller garden rooms extending away from the house appear farther away, creating the impression of a much larger garden. Farrand was sensitive to the existing trees at Bellefield and designed the garden around a mature elm tree that was the only asymmetric element within the garden walls. Farrand’s basic theme of an enclosed formal garden surrounded by an informal wild garden recurs in her later work on a grander scale, notably at Dumbarton Oaks. <br /> <br /> The planting beds along the garden gravel walks and lawn area were filled with layers of profuse blooms with low vegetation spilling over the vertical stone edging and taller plants standing adjacent to the garden walls. The original plans indicate the outline of a natural or wild garden beyond the walled garden area that incorporated several existing trees. The vegetation in this area served as a transition to the surrounding lawns and tree clusters and likely included several new flowering trees, which are evident in historic photographs.<br /> <br /> Descendants of Newbold donated Bellefield to the National Park Service in 1976 to provide a protective buffer for the adjacent Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site. The garden was carefully put to bed until 1993 when a group of local citizens formed the Beatrix Farrand Garden Association to implement a restoration in partnership with the National Park Service. The restoration has resulted in a stunning display of composed borders washed in pink, white, blush, cream and grey, and mauve and purple, and surrounded by vine-traced stone walls and clipped hemlock hedges. While Farrand’s original planting plans for Bellefield do not survive, a team of landscape designers and gardeners based the restoration on historic photos and planting schemes from comparable Farrand gardens created at the same time.</p>",

Among the centennial programs was a thrust to identify locations important to the state's history. In 1917, Spencer County's centennial commission requested the assistance of older residents of the county in determining the exact location of Thomas Lincoln's cabin. Twenty such residents assembled on the historic property and pointed to a site they believed to be correct. A marker was erected on the site on April 28, 1917. </span></span></span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"> </span></span><br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"layout-grid-mode:both\">Placement of the bronze cabin site memorial was one of the more notable achievements in the effort to memorialize the Lincoln site. After deciding that it would be inappropriate to construct a replica of the Lincoln cabin, the state hired architect Thomas Hibben, a native of Indiana, to design a suitable monument to mark the site. The state planned a bronze casting in the shape of the historic cabin sill and hearth, to be surrounded by a stone wall. The area was to be formally landscaped. The project was ultimately subcontracted to a company in Munich, Germany.</span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"layout-grid-mode:both\">In May 1933, a Civilian Conservation Corps crew located the historic hearthstones, which were situated in a T-configuration and comprised three layers of stones measuring roughly 18 inches square and 5-6 inches deep. The crew, under the supervision of Horace Weber, excavated the 300 hearthstones, constructed a stone wall around the site and landscaped the grounds. After numerous delays the bronze casting was finally placed on the site in July 1935.</span></span></span></span></p>",

It was caused by the settlers' consuming dairy products or meat of cows that ate the white snakeroot plant, which had the toxin temetrol. Cows often roamed in woods and underbrush, where the white snakeroot grew. Most of those in the Little Pigeon Creek community with milk sickness became deathly ill, but they had no idea what was causing the fatal disease. Nancy Hanks Lincoln was the mother of Abraham Lincoln. She died when she was 35 of milk sickness on October 5, 1818. Abraham Lincoln was just 9 years old when his mother died. Nancy Lincoln was buried next to their closest neighbor, Nancy Rusher Brooner. Nancy Brooner had also become ill and died from milk sickness. Nancy Lincoln, took care of Nancy Brooner, but Nancy Brooner died two weeks before Nancy Lincoln died. Nancy's maternal aunt and uncle, Elizabeth and Thomas Sparrow, with whom she had grown up, also died of the illness and were buried nearby. The area became known as Pioneer Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Reflection Questions</em></span></p> <ul> <li>Photographers and Videographers capture still photos and/or video of the site</li> <li>Journalist ask an Interview Question while<i> </i>On The Move to the next stop: <i>“Where are your ancestors buried?” “What famous burial sites or national cemeteries have you visited?” “Have you visited Lincoln’s tomb in Illinois?” </i></li> </ul>",

        "notes": "Lincoln Living Historical Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/lincoln-living-historical-farm.htm\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Courier New\"\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"\">Ask most people who have visited Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial what they remember most of their visit here, nine out of ten would say something about the Living Historical Farm. Let’s face it, for most visitors the farm <u>is</u> Lincoln Boyhood.<br /> While it seeks to represent the earliest period of occupation here, the farm is actually the most recent addition to the park. It was not part of the state’s original development plan, which was much more concerned with the creation of a commemorative park, as evidenced by the construction of the two memorial halls and the cabin site memorial. It was not even part of the National Park Service’s initial development of the site, which envisioned the Exhibit Shelter as the primary point for interpreting the Thomas Lincoln farm. In fact, in terms of planning and development, the Lincoln Living Historical Farm was almost an afterthought. The story of its creation is a good illustration of how changing perceptions of our history have shaped the way in which it is interpreted.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Courier New\"\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"\">Early development of the park was influenced by the traditional commemorative view of history, that is, it was designed to serve as a memorial to Abraham Lincoln and his mother. This was to be a place where visitors could “remember” the early life of a great American. To simply <u>be</u> in this place where Abraham Lincoln grew up was thought to be enough. But by the late 1960s, the general view of history began to change. Larger changes in society, placing more emphasis on the “common” man, began to take place. People were, generally speaking, less satisfied to simply “remember,” they wanted to know more about what life was actually like for the average person, and what it was like for “great Americans,” like <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:city>, before he became “great.” One way in which this new interest manifested itself in the field of interpretation was in the development of the “living history farms.” The idea was to create, or re-create, places where the history of typical people could be interpreted.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Courier New\"\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"\">In 1966, the National Park Service became involved in this effort when it began working with the Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution in a joint venture to establish a nationwide system of farms representing a variety of regions and time periods. NPS Director George Hartzog was an early proponent of the idea and, following a visit to the park in 1968, selected Lincoln Boyhood as one of the sites for such development. It was a popular idea, both with Superintendent Al Banton, who began making plans, and with Congressman Winfield Denton, who helped obtain the necessary appropriations.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Courier New\"\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"\">At Hartzog’s direction, historian Ed Bearss completed an extensive research report that laid the groundwork for the development of the farm at Lincoln Boyhood. Based on it the location of the buildings, the orchard, the fields, and the kitchen garden were determined.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Courier New\"\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"\">In February 1968, clearing of the site began. In March, a construction crew of ten men, all local residents, some of whom were skilled in log construction, were hired. Progress on the project was hastened by the decision to use logs from existing structures in <st1:place w:st=\"on\"><st1:placename w:st=\"on\">Spencer</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st=\"on\">County</st1:placename></st1:place> that would be dismantled, transported to the site, and then reassembled, though not necessarily in their original configuration, as the farm buildings. In all, three structures were used to build the existing cabin, smokehouse, chicken coop, and barn. They were the Reisz barn, from just west of Chrisney; the Bryant house, from near Gentryville; and the <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Butler</st1:place></st1:city> house, from between <st1:city w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Grandview</st1:place></st1:city> and Rockport, which was supposed to have been 125 years old.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Courier New\"\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"\">On <st1:date day=\"11\" month=\"3\" w:st=\"on\" year=\"1968\">March 11, 1968</st1:date>, the footing for the cabin fireplace was begun. An excavation was made, gravel was put down, and heavy stone, some of which had been taken from the rubbish heap from the construction of the new addition to the visitor center, were placed in the bottom. Over the next several weeks, despite some harsh winter weather, the buildings quickly began to take shape. As much as it was possible to do, the work of cutting and shaping and fitting the logs was done using traditional hand tools, including the cutting of the front cabin door opening with a </span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Courier New\"\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"\">cross-cut saw. By April 26, the construction of the first four structures was complete. In the spring of 1969, the carpenter shop was added and the farm attained the appearance that it has today.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Courier New\"\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"\">The presence of the buildings, though, did not make the farm “living.” That effect was achieved by the addition of interpreters in pioneer clothing who “worked” the farm using historically authentic tools and methods. Early interpretation was intentionally unstructured so as to more closely depict a daily routine of life. That pattern has continued, largely unchanged, until today.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Courier New\"\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",\"serif\"\">In the years since its creation, the Lincoln Living Historical Farm has become a solidly entrenched part of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial. In successfully re-creating for visitors a sense of what life was like on the <st1:state w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Indiana</st1:place></st1:state> frontier of the 1820s, the farm has helped to personalize this great figure of American history and to make him more approachable. In so doing, it has helped make Abraham Lincoln someone we can relate to and understand. That’s what interpretation is, and should be, all about.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <em>History Highlights for Reflection Tour:<br /> <br /> The Lincoln Living Historical Farm does not retain any of the original structures from Abraham Lincoln's time but was built to depict a typical farm of 1820s Indiana.The Farm contains several buildings; a log cabin, carpenter shop, barn, smoke house, and chicken coop. There is also a kitchen garden, herb garden, and crop fields.Everything the Lincolns raised was either totally consumed or recycled. Nothing was wasted. They derived their living from the land and forest around them. When the farm is staffed, staff members dress in period clothing to demonstrate the daily activities at the farm, the same things the Lincolns did when they lived here. Examples of the chores are: chopping firewood, milking the cow, and feeding the horses, chickens, sheep and cow, cooking, sewing, quilt-making, working in the garden and fields, splitting rails, and riving shingles, plowing, planting, cultivating, and harvesting of the crops.<br /> <br /> Reflection Questions:</em></p> <ul> <li>Photographers and Videographers capture still photos and/or video at the site.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Journalist ask an Interview Question while<i> </i>On The Move to the next stop: “<i>What would you enjoy about life on the farm?

Thomas Lincoln came from a long line of farming frontiersmen. Life on the frontier had its challenges. Due to title disputes, Lincoln lost land in Kentucky on three occasions. In 1816, Thomas Lincoln decided to move his small family to Indiana. Because he could buy government land with a clear title and because slavery, which he opposed, was illegal in Indiana, Lincoln looked forward to a fresh start. Sixteen miles northwest of the Ohio River, just south of Little Pigeon Creek in a region of towering hardwoods, plentiful game, and good water, Thomas Lincoln chose a quarter-section (160 acres) of land for a home site.<br /> <br /> Thomas Lincoln chose this quarter-section because of the spring which served as a fresh water source. Thomas Lincoln built his homestead just 300 yards from this spring. The spring would later be known as the Lincoln Spring. On February 20, 1830, Thomas Lincoln sold his farm and moved the family to Illinois, where Abraham would spend his next 30 years. The spring continued to be as source of water for the many people who later settled in the area as well as for the railroad line that was built near the site.</p>",

It was decided that a suitable memorial should be erected for Nancy.<br /> <br /> From 1922 to 1938, the State of Indiana hired Olmsted Brothers to design a memorial site. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr ensured the landscape retained a strong North/South axis, allowing for processional and contemplative experiences. This axis would connect the gravesite of Nancy Hanks to a visitor center and open court.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. took the lead in developing a plan to simplify the area around Nancy Hanks’ gravesite, whose landscape had been through many design changes over the years. A cruciform arrangement combining a main allée with plant beds was established, providing a “strong spiritual imagery”.<br /> <br /> Before briefly leaving, Olmsted Jr. proposed reforesting part of the site to provide a backdrop for the design. By 1983 Olmsted Jr. was called back to Spencer County, Indiana. The site needed a building facility and so Olmsted Jr proposed placing those buildings at the southern end of the allée.",

Thomas had actually lost 3 farms. Thomas knew that Indiana had been surveyed and platted by the US Government so land disputes were very rare. Indiana was laid out in 40 acre sections.

The knoll that Thomas Lincoln picked for the homesite was an excellent spot, allowing the cabin to stay dry during the rainy season. Just West of the cabin site was a living spring of water. Abraham recollected later in life that after reaching Indiana “an axe was put in his hands at once; he was almost constantly handling that most useful instrument.” The Lincoln’s quickly began to carve a life for themselves out of the wilderness. Lincoln in later years stated that that time period “was one of the most arduous bits of work I did in my youth.”<br /> <br /> Highlight Questions</span></p> <ul> <li> <p><span style=\"color:#7f8c8d;\">Student Photographers and Videographers capture still photos and/or video of the site.</span></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><span style=\"color:#7f8c8d;\">Student Journalist an Interview Question while<i> </i>On The Move to the next stop: <i>“What was difficult about your move?” “What was difficult about your challenge?” “What did you learn about new things.” What did you learn about yourself?\"</i></span><i></i></p> </li> </ul>",

They intended to memorialize important episodes in Lincoln's life by the placing of some memento, preferable a stone, along a certain trail where one will be led to appreciate the \"stepping stones\" in Lincoln's career. This trail, known as the Trail of Twelve Stones, became a unique way to review some of the major events in Abraham Lincoln's life. Small bronze tablets are located near each stone along the trail. The tablets briefly explain the events in Lincoln's life associated with each of the memorial stones.<br /> <br /> Beginning just east of the Cabin Site Memorial, twelve historic stones are arranged in chronological order at irregular intervals. There are several shaded, stone-bench rest areas for your convenience.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#7f8c8d;\"><em>History Highlights for Reflection Tour:</em></span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#7f8c8d;\"><em><strong>Stone 1</strong><br /> “Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, then in Hardin, now in the more recently formed county of Larue, Kentucky.”<br /> For his first seven years, Abraham, with his sister Sarah, and his parents Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln lived in Kentucky.<br /> This stone was brought here from Lincoln’s birthplace farm (the Sinking Spring Farm) located near Hodgenville, Kentucky.</em></span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#7f8c8d;\"><em><strong>Stone 2</strong><br /> “He (Thomas Lincoln) removed from Kentucky to what is now Spencer County, Indiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new home about the time the State came into the Union.”<br /> In December 1816, the Lincoln family moved to the 160-acre Indiana farm you are now standing on. Here, the Lincoln family lived for 14 years. Between the years 1917 and 1934 this stone monument (donated by the citizens of Spencer County) marked the location of the Lincoln cabin, 100 yards west of here.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 3</strong><br /> As a teenager in Indiana (Abraham lived here from age 7-21), young Abe worked at many different jobs including that of clerk in a localstore. One store, owned by William Jones, was located three miles west of here.<br /> This stone is from the foundation of that building.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 4</strong><br /> Abraham Lincoln’s stepmother, Sarah Bush Johnston Lincoln, said that “newspapers were<br /> had in Indiana as early as 1824 and up to 1830 when we moved to Illinois. Abe was a constant reader of them.”<br /> Sixteen newspapers were published in Indiana during the mid-1820s. How many of these<br /> papers reached the Lincoln family is not known. Certainly, occasional copies of the Vincennes Western Sun, the Corydon Gazetter, or the New Harmony Gazetter passed through Lincoln’s hands.<br /> Before the Lincoln family’s departure from Indiana to Illinois in March of 1830, the family “passed through Vincennes, Indiana, where they remained for a day.” There Abraham visited the Elihu Stout Print Shop and viewed a printingpress for the first time.<br /> This stone is one of the foundation stones from the Vincennes Western Sun<br /> newspaper building.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 5</strong><br /> “Abraham stopped indefinitely and for the first time, as it were, by himself, at New-Salem.” - A. Lincoln<br /> From 1831 to 1837, Lincoln resided at New Salem, Illinois, supporting himself as a clerk, mill hand, soldier, storekeeper, postmaster, and surveyor. In 1832, Lincoln bought a half-interest in a store with William F. Berry. “They opened as merchants; of course they did nothing but get deeper and deeper in debt.” Lincoln’s career in “high finance” did not last long. Berry died, leaving Lincoln solely responsible for the store’s debts. By October 1833 “the store winked out.”<br /> This stone is one of the foundation stones from the Lincoln-Berry store.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 6</strong><br /> By the 1840s Abraham Lincoln was an up-and-coming young lawyer in the Illinois capital of Springfield. There, Lincoln met a charming young Kentucky woman, Mary Ann Todd.<br /> “In November 1842 he married Mary, daughter of Robert S. Todd, of Lexington, Kentucky. They have three children, all sons -- one born in 1843 [Robert], one in 1850 [William], and one in 1853 [Thomas]. They lost one, who was born in 1846 [Edward died in 1850].” - A. Lincoln<br /> These bricks are from the spacious, girlhood home of Mary Todd which was in Lexington, Kentucky.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 7</strong><br /> The Executive Mansion (The White House) was the Lincoln family’s home from March 1861 until the President’s assassination in April of 1865. For the most part, Lincoln must have found White House life difficult. On a typical day Lincoln rose at 7 a.m. and worked for two hours before having breakfast with his family. From 9 a.m. to 1-2 p.m., Lincoln opened his doors to officials and ordinary citizens. At 4 p.m. he took a daily carriage ride with his wife. The Lincoln’s dined at 6 p.m. The White House had no telegraph service, so after supper, Lincoln usually went to the War Department to read the telegrams from the battle front. After the “war news,” Lincoln often returned to his office and worked until 11 p.m.<br /> This stone was at one time a part of the White House.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 8</strong><br /> President Lincoln’s “Summer White House” was the Anderson Cottage, at the National Soldiers Home, three miles from the Executive Mansion. During the summer and fall of 1862, 1863, and 1864, the Lincoln family resided there to escape the steamy conditions in Washington, D.C. While in residence at the Anderson Cottage in 1862, President Lincoln wrote the Emancipation Proclamation.<br /> This stone was a part of the Anderson Cottage, Abraham Lincoln’s “Summer White House.”<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 9</strong><br /> “Four score and seven years ago...” - A. Lincoln (exerpt from Gettysburg Address)<br /> On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln spoke briefly at the dedication of a national cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Today his remarks - The Gettysburg Address - are known and cherished by millions as an unchallenged example of patriotic eloquence.<br /> This boulder was brought here from the Civil War Battlefield at Gettysburg.<br /> (Note: President Lincoln did not stand on this stone at Gettysburg. He spoke from a wooden platform especially constructed for the dedication.)<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 10</strong><br /> “With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.”<br /> These were some of the words pronounced by Abraham Lincoln when he made his second inaugural address on March 4, 1865.<br /> This stone was a part of the Old Capitol building in Washington, D.C., from where Lincoln made his historic speech.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 11</strong><br /> On the night of April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was shot while attending a play at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. Shortly afterwards, the mortally wounded President was taken across the street to the Peterson House, where he died at 7:22 a.m. the next morning.<br /> This piece of sandstone is part of the original column which helped to support the front porch of the Peterson House, the house where Lincoln died.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stone 12</strong><br /> Following the most elaborate and expensive state funeral in our country’s history, the body of Abraham Lincoln was transported by railroad to Springfield, Illinois, where he was buried in Oak Ridge Cemetery on May 4, 1865. Ground for the construction of a suitable memorial to Lincoln was broken in 1869, four years after the President’s death. This, the original Lincoln Tomb, was dedicated on October 15, 1874. Due to uneven settling of the earth under the tomb, a complete reconstruction of the structure was performed between 1899 and<br /> 1902.<br /> This carved stone is called the Culver Stone, named after its donor, J.S. Culver, the contractor for the Lincoln Tomb reconstruction. Culver had this excess piece of granite carved to serve as a headstone for Lincoln’s mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln. Dedicated October 1, 1902, the stone marked Nancy’s grave until 1933 when it was moved to this location to mark the end of the Trail of Twelve Stones. The headstone in the cemetery near here had marked Lincoln’s mother’s grave since 1879.<br /> <br /> Reflection Questions</em></span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"color:#7f8c8d;\">Photographers and Videographers capture still photos and/or video of the site.</span></li> </ul> <ul> <li><span style=\"color:#7f8c8d;\">Journalist: ask others in your group an Interview Question while<i> </i>walking to the next stop: “<i>What is the coolest thing you learned today?” “What did you enjoy most about spending time in the park?” “What will you want to show others when you bring them to visit the park?” </i></span></li> </ul> <p> </p>",

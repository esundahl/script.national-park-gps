Gaston Motel is a cornerstone of the civil rights district in Birmingham. Built by prominent African American businessman and entrepreneur, Arthur George (A.G.) Gaston (1892-1996), provided first-class lodging and dining in Birmingham, Alabama, to African American travelers from 1954 onwards.<br /> <br /> During the campaign to desegregate Birmingham, leaders from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) took up residence in the A.G. Gaston Motel. From April through May of 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph D. Abernathy, Fred L. Shuttlesworth, and others gathered in Room 30, also known as the \"War Room,\" to plan and strategize. Besides resting and strategizing, the hotel was the site of constant activity associated with the campaign, including press conferences held regularly within the courtyard that were extensively documented and broadcast by journalists.<br /> <br /> A.G. Gaston modernized and expanded the motel in 1968, adding a supper club and other amenities. Business declined in the 1970s and in 1982 Gaston converted the motel into housing for the elderly, which functioned until 1996. <br /> <br /> The property was vacant until 2017, when it was declared a key feature of Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument. The building is co-owned by the National Park Service (NPS) and the City of Birmingham. The partners intend to renovate the building so that it appears as it did during the 1963 Birmingham Campaign. As of Spring 2021, exterior renovations of the NPS-owned portion of the building are complete, including installation of a Gaston Motel sign. Visitors are welcome to sight-see around the exterior of the Motel. Plans for interior renovation are underway. ",

Vann's successor, Richard Arrington, Jr., Birmingham's first Black mayor, committed his energy and public funds to pursuing Vann's vision. The city acquired property in the area where the 1963 marches and demonstrations originated. Portraying the past in a healing manner, while also embracing the truth, serves as guiding principles for the Institute. <br /> <br /> In the words of the Founding President, Odessa Woolfolk:</p> <blockquote> <p align=\"left\">The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute signifies that Birmingham does not hide from its past. It acknowledges that where once the city housed two people, Black and White, unknown to one another except through the painful thread of segregation, Birmingham now embraces its past, neither forgetting nor dwelling on it, but using it to foster understanding.</p> </blockquote> <h4>Exhibits </h4> <p>The permanent exhibitions are a self-directed journey through Birmingham's contributions to the Civil Rights Movement and the pursuit of human rights across the globe. These are available to visit at all times of the year.</p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>Orientation Theatre: Experience post-Civil War Alabama through the early 1920s and meet the Black men and women who helped build the steel and rail industries that put Birmingham, Alabama on the map.</li> <li>Barriers Gallery: Confront separate water fountains and segregated schools in one of many displays reminding us that Birmingham was a city divided into two worlds in the early 20th century.</li> <li>Confrontation Gallery: Hear what was said behind closed doors during the Civil Rights era in flashbacks to the echoed voices of white and Black people living through these tumultuous times.</li> <li>Movement Gallery: Relive the history of America’s Civil Rights Movement between 1955 - 1963 in four unique theatrical depictions of seminal moments including “Birmingham the World is Watching.”</li> <li>Milestones Gallery: Photographs bare witness to the 1960s demonstrations at Kelly Ingram Park, the tragic bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, and the historic Selma to Montgomery March.</li> <li>Human Rights Gallery: Understand the struggle for equality as an enduring contemporary challenge reflected in movements for human rights beyond Birmingham’s city limits, throughout the U.S., and around the world. </li> </ul> The exhibit space also hosts a number of traveling and special exhibits. Multimedia exhibitions, such as the Oral History Project, can be found on-line. Contact the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute for more information.",

        "notes": "Kelly Ingram Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/kelly-ingram-park.htm\n\n<p>During the first week of May 1963, Birmingham police and firemen attacked civil rights demonstrators, many of whom were children, in the streets bordering this park. The violence raised a nationwide public outcry, hastening integration in America's most segregated city.</p> <p>Birmingham, site of the first mass beatings of Freedom Riders, was selected by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) for a massive protest campaign. Kelly Ingram Park (historically known as West Park), was an assembly point for participants in the SCLC's Project \"C,\" (for Confrontation)--sit-ins, boycotts, marches, and jailings designed to end segregation in Birmingham. Under the on site direction of SCLC President Martin Luther King, Jr., and local SCLC affiliate Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, department stores were targeted for boycotts and protest marches organized. Dr. King was arrested and held in solitary confinement for three days, during which he wrote, smuggled out of jail, and had printed his \"Letter from Birmingham Jail,\" a profoundly moving justification for the moral necessity of non-violent resistance to unjust laws.</p> <p>When police filled the jails with mass arrests and depleted the ranks of adult demonstrators, the SCLC called on the city's children to join the protests. On May 2, under orders from Public Safety Commissioner Bull Connor, police arrested 600 child picketers (some as young as six years of age); by the next day, 1,000 children had been jailed. In the days that followed, firemen blasted the protestors, including children, with high-pressure fire hoses, and police used their nightsticks indiscriminately. Police K-9 units loosed their dogs into crowds of peaceful demonstrators, pinning down one woman and severely wounding three teenagers. One young bystander was whirled around by a policeman into the jaws of his German Shepherd. An Associated Press photographer standing nearby captured the incident, which quickly became the symbol of the unrest in Birmingham.</p> <p>Fearful of a race riot and worried about lost business, local businesses made a \"pact\" with the SCLC, but Alabama's Governor Wallace disavowed any settlement and Bull Connor urged whites to boycott the stores involved. To prevent any violence that would undermine the agreement, President Kennedy ordered 3,000 Army troops to the outskirts of the city. Local merchants removed their \"whites only\" signs and desegregated their lunch counters. The newly-elected mayor repealed the city's Jim Crow laws and eventually desegregated the library, city golf courses, public buildings, and finally the schools.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong><em>Visit the National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects//travelweshallovercome/index.htm\">We Shall Overcome</a> travel itinerary to learn more about </em><em>the civil rights movement themes and histories.

        "notes": "Sixteenth Street Baptist Church\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/sixteenth-street-baptist-church.htm\n\n<p>On Sunday morning, September 15, 1963, the Ku Klux Klan bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four girls. This murderous act shocked the nation and galvanized the civil rights movement.</p> <p>Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley were dressed in their \"Youth Sunday\" best, ready to lead the 11:00 adult service at the church, which since its construction in 1911 had served as a pillar for Birmingham's African American community. Only a few minutes before the explosion, they had been together in the basement women's room, excitedly talking about their first days at school. The bombing came without warning.</p> <p>Following the tragic event, white strangers visited the grieving families to express their sorrow. At the funeral for three of the girls (one family preferred a separate, private funeral), Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke about life being \"as hard as crucible steel.\" More than 8,000 mourners, including 800 clergymen of both races, attended the service. No city officials braved the crowds to attend.</p> <p>News stories circulated about symbolic incidents that occurred at the time of the bombing. For example, the image of Jesus' face was knocked cleanly out of the only surviving stained-glass window in the church's East wall, and the church clock stopped at exactly 10:22 a.m.</p> <p>The deaths of the children followed by the loss of President Kennedy two months later gave birth to a tide of grief and anger - a surge of emotional momentum that helped ensure the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.<br /> <br /> In January 2017, it was named a part of the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument by President Barack Obama. In October 2019 the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church was chosen for inclusion in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> for its enduring connection to the black freedom struggle. <br /> <br /> Today, visitors can walk in the basement where the 4 little girls gathered before the bomb detonated. Now, exhibits cover the walls, providing information on the history of the church, Jim Crow, segregation in Birmingham, and the lives of the children that were so suddenly and horrifically torn away. Sitting in the pews, visitors can appreciate the majesty of the enormous pipe organ. At the back of the church is the Wales Window - a gift from the country of Wales to the church after the terrorist attack on September 15, 1963. The stained glass image depicts a Black man with his arms spread wide, one hand pushing away, symbolizing the Black community's efforts to stop oppression and injustice. The other hand is palm-up and open, symbolizing the unfathomable ability to forgive in the face of so much hate. Outside the building, a commemorative plaque delineates the exact location the dynamite detonated all those years ago. Docents lead visitors on guided tours to the many spots of significance in and around the church. Pending completion, visitors soon will be able to enter a new, state-of-the-art museum exhibit in the former parsonage.<br /> <br /> <em>The African American Civil Rights Network (AACRN) recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation.

Its current building was erected in 1904. Beyond serving as a space for community and worship, St. Paul UMC has also played a critical role in the pursuit of civil rights.<br /> <br /> In 1956, just after the current church building was erected, St. Paul served as the site of meetings to integrate Birmingham buses. During Project \"C\" (for \"conflict\") in the spring of 1963, St. Paul UMC hosted meetings and training sessions in nonviolent civil disobedience for demonstration participants. Great personal restraint was needed to face violence with peaceful protest. These trainings were instrumental to achieving the goals of Project C, also known as the Birmingham Campaign. Also during Project C, St. Paul UMC served as the mustering point for the Palm Sunday Children’s March in 1963, which ended with police, dogs, and fire hoses aggressively dispersing the nonviolent marchers under the eye of national media. Images of snarling dogs attacking children participants, some as young as 6, served as an inflection point for a nation grappling with racism's legacy. Notoriously callous Eugene “Bull” Connor, the Commissioner for Public Safety, led the police forces that day. Laveeda M. Battle, parishioner at St. Paul UMC, points out the juxtaposition between Connor’s faith and actions: </p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{c62c7a97-afd9-4a42-9d76-60ef50afec0b}{34}\" paraid=\"891417443\">Here we had children marching from a Methodist church for equality and we had a United Methodist as the Commissioner over public safety, siccing dogs and having fire hoses turned on children. </p> <p paraeid=\"{c62c7a97-afd9-4a42-9d76-60ef50afec0b}{44}\" paraid=\"1159695792\">- Laveeda M. Battle </p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{c62c7a97-afd9-4a42-9d76-60ef50afec0b}{50}\" paraid=\"1983773895\">Eventually, the church-led efforts to desegregate Birmingham rippled across the nation. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed in large part due to Project C and the faith-driven individuals and institutions, banded together in the belief that a better society could be built.<br /> <br /> Today, St. Paul UMC still serves as a place of worship and continues to host events promoting civil rights. Visitors can sit in the pews and marvel at the stained glass windows. Of particular interest is the design in the far left corner, dreamed up by a middle-school student to represent the story of the Civil Rights Movement and the faith that guided it. Descend into the basement where Movement participants met to strategize desegregation efforts, and where civil rights leaders such as Dr. King encouraged action. Ask the parishioners about their experiences during the movement - many will tell you riveting accounts of what they lived and breathed through during this historic pursuit of civil rights in the Deep South.</p>",

Then under the leadership of Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth, the church and its leader served as linchpins in the 1961 Freedom Rides and 1963 desegregation efforts in Birmingham. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c3af123-e83a-41c2-be91-de0da6047140}{88}\" paraid=\"780043893\">In 1956, Rev. Shuttlesworth and other ministers formed the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) when the state prohibited the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from operating in Alabama. The Church was one of sixty active members in the ACMHR and served as ACMHR headquarters from 1956-1961. Weekly mass meetings provided an outlet for emotional testimony, soul-lifting music, impassioned preaching, and fundraising. In the face of unspeakable violence and hatred, The Historic Bethel Baptist Church leaned on its faith to fan the flames of a movement that would eventually desegregate one of the most racist cities in the nation. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c3af123-e83a-41c2-be91-de0da6047140}{124}\" paraid=\"1629896257\">White supremacists bombed the Church and parsonage 3 times. One of the bombings took place in 1956 on Christmas night, with Shuttlesworth and his family inside. When Shuttlesworth and his family emerged from the rubble unharmed, he and his followers took this as a sign that God was with them. The next day, as planned, Shuttlesworth, other members of the ACMHR, and over 200 other African Americans rode in the white sections of city buses to protest segregation in transportation. Despite the efforts of white supremacists to stamp out the church-led Movement through intimidation, civil rights activism grew in Birmingham and eventually paved the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c3af123-e83a-41c2-be91-de0da6047140}{158}\" paraid=\"1626914775\">Today, parishioners attend services in a new church built a block away, but the original church is maintained as a historic site that welcomes visitors and stands as a testament to the accomplishments of the Modern Civil Rights Movement. The historic site, including its guardhouse and parsonage, are National Historic Landmarks. Visitors can sit in the same pews as movement participants and watch a short documentary on the life of Rev. Shuttlesworth and the civil rights movement. A marker outside the building commemorates the spot where white supremacists planted a bomb intended to kill Shuttlesworth as he slept in bed. Tours that wind through the historic buildings and around the grounds help visitors envision what life was like in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the courage it took for a church, a family, and a neighborhood to stand behind a belief that life could and should be better. </p>  <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

This mill marked the beginning of large scale industry in Whitinsville. Paul Whitin and Sons built this structure as a cotton mill in 1826. The Brick Mill originally employed 40 workers, most of whom were from the village. It was expanded in 1830 and employed 146 workers at the height of its operation in the early 1840s.<br /> <br /> By 1845, Whitin cotton manufacturing had outgrown this mill. The company constructed a much larger mill, and John C. Whitin began using the Brick Mill exclusively for machine production and repair. This was the beginning of the Whitin Machine Works, which eventually dominated the town.<br /> <br /> Today, the Brick Mill is operated by Alternatives, a nonprofit that works with people with developmental disabilities. They restored the mill to its current state.</p>",

Ballou and his followers attempted to create a utopian community based upon the practical application of the tenants of Christianity. This community outlived most of its utopian counterparts of the 1840s, and the community served as the basis for the company town that the Draper's constructed in the century that followed. Also within the park, you'll find the beaten front door step and boot scraper, the only remnants of the original farmhouse the first Hopedale settlers called home. The spirit of hope that inspired these Practical Christians is evident in the town's name — Hopedale — which they chose for their fledgling experiment in communal living.</p>",

The hay that grew in these fields provided the energy for the livestock to do their work.  When the Blackstone Canal was opened in 1827, horses pulled the barges up and down the canal. After the canal closed, horses were still used for transporting goods from the trains, to and from the mills. The hay was also used at the Kelly barn to support the milking process.",

In 1941 Owens-Corning bought the building and reopened it as a Fiberglas manufacturing plant and Research & Development lab.

This Draper brother had a passion for finding innovative technology to make the production of cloth more efficient. He led the company's charge to become the nation's leading producer of machines for the cloth-making industry. The more idealistic Ebenezer, who had started the business as a member of the original Hopedale community, eventually left town. For him, finances came second to the fraternal order.<br /> <br /> Even without Ebenezer, the Drapers ran one of the most successful textile production companies in the world. Although their business got its start in the Little Red Shop, the Drapers’ ambition quickly outgrew their small, unassuming workshop. Over time, new buildings were constructed all over Hopedale, including a large brick complex that eclipsed all others in town.<br /> <br /> During the 1880s, Draper produced and sold more than six million new high-speed spindles to textile companies. By the 1890s, the Drapers dominated the nation's loom-making business.<br /> <br /> Workers in Hopedale manufactured every piece of the machines they used, including the nuts<br /> and bolts. Some processed raw steel in the foundry. Other laborers innovated and made new<br /> technologies, such as the bobbin battery, that would change the weaving world. At its height of production, the Draper Corporation employed more than 4,000 workers. For many years, their home base was a massive facility located opposite the present-day Draper museum.<br /> <br /> Many community institutions were built with money from the Draper business. But this era of<br /> prosperity did not last forever. After World War II, the Draper family slowly divested themselves of most of their town properties. The corporation was also acquired by an outside owner, Rockwell International. They closed the large plant on Hopedale Street in 1978.<br /> <br /> After decades of vacancy, demolition of the Draper complex began in August 2020 and<br /> continued through 2022. During your visit, you may see some signs of the factory that was once here. Most visitors will have to imagine what this huge presence was once like, however, in the space of its vacancy.",

He was a blacksmith, a patriot, and a man who married well. Fletcher was also part of the team that established the first cotton mill here. Throughout Whitinsville, there are many buildings with a connection to Fletcher’s family and particularly his descendents, including the forge, brick mill, stone mill, and large machine works complex that are all within close proximity to the homestead. However, this is one of only two buildings from the 1700s that still stand in town.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{191}\" paraid=\"17\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{195}\" paraid=\"18\">From this location, we can begin tracing the rise of manufacturing in Whitinsville. When we think of the Industrial Revolution, it can be tempting to imagine a quick change. But the modern system of manufacturing came into being over time. The growth that Fletcher and his family saw from within this home was incredible and expansive—but it was not rapid, or simultaneous. One of the people raised in this home could have scarcely guessed just how important she would be in reshaping this farming community. Continue learning about the development of Whitinsville, and the alliances built between a few local families, by visiting the Old Brick Mill complex, located across the street.  </p>",

Historian Thomas R. Navin argued that “it was Betsey Whitin whose force of personality dominated the firm and held it unified.” Near the end of her life, and in response to growing conflict between her sons, Betsy split the family business in 1864, giving her sons Paul, Jr., Charles, James, and John control of different holdings. By that time, the family had several properties here in Whitinsville and elsewhere in Northbridge and Uxbridge. Overall, the more successful operation that grew out of Whitinsville was the Whitin Machine Works. That enterprise came out of the 1826 partnership between Paul Whitin Sr. and his sons Paul, Jr., and John C. Whitin. After Paul Sr.’s death in 1831, Paul Jr. and John would run the textile business for decades. Under the watchful eye of Betsy Whitin, their textile machine shop would grow into the largest in the world. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e68f279-a31d-4f18-a50e-8621dec10a8f}{119}\" paraid=\"89\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e68f279-a31d-4f18-a50e-8621dec10a8f}{123}\" paraid=\"90\">While building a mansion in town, John C. and his brother Charles P. Whitin also ordered the construction of the building you see on the street corner today. This Town Hall served a practical function and solidified the importance of the village to Northbridge overall. It was dedicated in honor of Betsy and Paul Whitin, whose children certainly left a lasting mark on this land.  </p>",

The water running over the dam is from the Mumford River, a tributary of the Blackstone River. It was far from inevitable that this place would become a base for industry.

Some of the implements they made were likely for local farmers, for most colonists who settled around the Mumford were involved in agriculture.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{247}\" paraid=\"26\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{251}\" paraid=\"27\">On December 24, 1771, James Fletcher married Margaret Wood, whose father, Ezra Wood, owned rights to the falls on the Mumford River. Soon after, the Fletchers’ home was constructed (at 1 Elm Place) and James, a blacksmith by trade, purchased an ironworks forge. This operation ran for years while James and Margaret raised their children, including daughter Betsy. Her marriage to Paul Whitin would grow the family’s enterprise even more.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e9058913-cf6d-4d81-9e3e-48c774beaf36}{6}\" paraid=\"28\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{e9058913-cf6d-4d81-9e3e-48c774beaf36}{10}\" paraid=\"29\">While building their life together, there were major changes underway, downriver. Paul and Betsy’s 1793 nuptials took place in the same year that Slater Mill, the first successful cotton spinning mill in the United States, opened for business in Pawtucket, RI.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e9058913-cf6d-4d81-9e3e-48c774beaf36}{18}\" paraid=\"30\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{e9058913-cf6d-4d81-9e3e-48c774beaf36}{22}\" paraid=\"31\">When 16-year old Betsy married Paul, it was the start of a long-lasting partnership, forged in iron. The Whitins’ ten children would expand their father and grandfather’s business operation, making tools such as scythes and hoes. At the time of James Fletcher’s death, in the 1830s, an entire village bore the name of his son-in-law, Paul Whitin. Keep exploring to learn about the vital role that Betsy played in keeping the business together, even if that meant dividing entire villages as family assets.  </p>",

The natural world and its wonders remained difficult for mill workers to grasp. The Draper family, the owners of the Hopedale Manufacturing Company, sought a place of recreation for their workers. After years of trying to squeeze every bit of productivity out of their limited water rights, the company had created a massive reservoir used to power their mills. To prevent development around the banks of their mill pond and to give their workers a place of recreation, the company undertook an ambitious park development project around their mill pond. The Draper’s hired noted landscape architect Warren Henry Manning to design their new park. Over the next decade, Hopedale spent $2,500 a year on developing approximately 1,000 acres of land into a public park. More than 4 miles of winding forest trails were created. Picnic areas, tennis courts, a bathhouse and a boat house were built. Sand was brought in and an artificial beach was created on the shores of the mill pond.<br /> <br /> An annual field day event, hosted by the company was held on the new park grounds once a year. The company even developed a small peninsular along the lake with mill houses. The “Lake-Point Development” as it came to be known held 10 two-family houses that offered mill workers water-front property. This small community, adjacent to the parklands and mill pond became a model of suburban planning.

At first, this mill doubled the company's capacity. Over time, the complex continued to expand adding additional buildings to help in the production process. Much of the Western Mill Complex was condemned and demolished in the early 20th century. Two of the buildings still remain. One, the former storehouse, became the North Smithfield Public Library in 1966. Its rubble-stone construction shows us what the old Western Mill complex looked like.",

He was a second-generation employee. At the end of his service, upon his return to Whitinsville, Kazarian no longer wished to work in the foundry, a hot and difficult job that paid less than other “skilled” positions. Another employee asked Kazarian, “it was good enough for your father, wasn’t it?” But the world, and Kazarian, had been greatly changed by the war. </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{166}\" paraid=\"135\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{170}\" paraid=\"136\">During the war, with men like Kazarian away, women in town had unprecedented opportunities to earn good wages at the company. They made steam engines and other products for the government in huge quantities and were granted an E for Excellence award multiple times. The end of the war did not bring immediate stability or an interest in returning to the status quo. A heightened interest in unionization among workers, and a successful union vote, led E. Kent Swift—the last of six generations of Whitins to run the company— to resign from his position near the end of World War II. In 1946, J. Hugh Bolton became President. This was not the end of the Whitin Machine Works, but it was the end of Whitin investment; they withdrew their financial stake and sold their town properties.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{186}\" paraid=\"137\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{190}\" paraid=\"138\">At a time when some wore 50 Year Club pins showing their many years of service to the company, others took to challenging the Whitin Machine Works. A long strike was led by workers in 1946. After the resolution of the strike, the company continued under Bolton’s leadership for two decades more. Then, in 1966, the company was sold to White Consolidated Industries. It was shuttered in 1976, the year of the nation’s bicentennial.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{200}\" paraid=\"139\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{204}\" paraid=\"140\">From the beginning, Whitinsville was forged and repeatedly changed by people who experienced war.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{212}\" paraid=\"141\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{216}\" paraid=\"142\">Traveling around this community, we can see the seeds of the Whitin dynasty planted during the American Revolution.

The original two-story mill, with its octagonal corner towers and crenelated battlements, accommodated 200 workers and was devoted exclusively to the production of textile machinery. The mill was expanded decade by decade as the company came to dominate the manufacture of machinery for picking, carding, and spinning cotton and wool. Additions to the plant included machine shops, foundries, and specialized structures that ultimately gave it a floor space of 1,750,00 square feet. This towering structure at the center of the village stands as a testament to the Whitin empire which dominated the global production of textile machinery until the mid-twentieth century.<br />  </p>",

It originally stood across from the Whitin Machine Works and was moved in 1870 to make room for Whitin's second, and grander, mansion.<br /> <br /> Across the street to your left stands Oakhurst, built in 1890 by Chester Lasell, son of Josiah Lasell and Jane Whitin, daughter of John C. Whitin. Chester Lasell succeeded his father as president of Whitin Machine Works. He bred some of the finest race horses in the country and entertained guests, including President Taft and Booker T. Washington at the home.<br /> <br /> Just down the street is Whitin Park. This was the site of John C. Whitin's second mansion, a 32-room Victorian structure that stood at the top of this landscaped estate. Built in 1875, the estate boasted three greenhouses, several swan ponds, and trees imported from all over the world.

From this spot, bankers printed approximately $2.7 million dollars of national currency. For many years, the bank was directed by members of the Whitin family and/or high-level executives of the Whitin Machine Works. Shortly after this bank was constructed, this part of town changed from a crossroads to the square you see today. In the years following the creation of the square, Aldrich High School was built at 14 Hill Street (in 1890). Construction for the large Village Congregational Church, located next to the bank, began in 1897.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{32}\" paraid=\"115\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{36}\" paraid=\"116\">For the people who frequented these streets, The Whitin Machine Works was more than a place to work. The wealth generated through this company made it possible to fund the town’s schools, churches, town hall, library, and recreational facilities. An article in the Boston Sunday Post from 1929, in the last summer before the Great Depression, noted: “Whitinsville is something more than a mere industrial centre. It is one of the model villages of the world.” Francis McCool, who lived in the village, considered the balance of power in Whitinsville and saw motive for making a “model” place to live. He would argue that the Whitins “did a lot of good for people…but don’t forget, the control was there.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{52}\" paraid=\"117\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{56}\" paraid=\"118\">A remarkable number of people stayed in Whitinsville for the better part of their lives, all for the relative stability of work at “the shop.”  </p>",

Russell and William B. Waddell who joined Majors in an attempt to gain a government contract to supply western forts.<a href=\"#2\">[2]</a> Already an experienced Santa Fe Trail dealer, Majors had the knowledge and equipment, while Russell and Waddell had the capital, to secure the government contract. For a short time, the company had a “virtual monopoly of the army freighting business in the west and southwest.”<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a> <br /> <br /> The 300-acre farmstead was dissected by the westernmost US border, making part of the property outside US jurisdiction and, thus, untaxable. The company’s barns, mule sheds, grazing lands, wagon and blacksmith shops, and other business-related entities were located on the portion of property located in the Kansas Territory.<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a> A caravan camp was used to load the heavy freight wagons which would travel the trails.<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a> <br /> <br /> The home was built in 1856, most likely using the labor of enslaved people.<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>  The “T” shaped floorplan with recessed front porch makes it a unique iteration of the Greek revival style in Kansas City.<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>  Today, it is one of the oldest buildings in Kansas City, as one of only 4 pre-Civil War buildings left standing.<a href=\"#8\">[8]</a> Though the house remains, many of the other original structures are gone and the land has been divided into distinct plots. Among the lost structures were living quarters for the 16-17 people enslaved by the Majors’.<a href=\"#9\">[9] </a><br /> <br /> In 1930 Louisa P. Johnston, Majors’s great grand-daughter, travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the house abandoned. She bought the house in 1932 and, for the next forty years, worked to preserve the property. In 1984 the Alexanders Majors House Museum was opened to the public for tours and events. In 2010 the house partnered with the John Wornall House and Museum to create one nonprofit dedicated to preserving both properties.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(8201 State Line Road (east side of road near 85th Street), Kansas City)<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.wornallmajors.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <br /> <br />   <div> <p id=\"ftn1\"><em><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Marc Simmons, Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers (Santa Fe, NM: Ancient City Press, 1984), p. 61.</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Martha Kusiak, “Alexander Majors House,” National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form.

The site marks the western end of the Arrow Rock ferry, with another landing on the other side of the river. The ferry played a significant role in shepherding traffic westward, including traffic on the Santa Fe Trail. They continued using this ferry until 1828 (when it was no longer used for significant, long-distance Santa Fe Trail travel) and for many years thereafter. A cabin housing the ferry master formerly existed here, and the former trail ascended the hill (along a present-day road trace), after which it continued west across the prairie.</p> <h3>Arrow Rock Bluff</h3> <p><br /> For generations, Arrow Rock Bluff was a significant landmark on the Missouri River for American Indians, explorers, and early westward travelers. The limestone bluff first appeared on a 1732 French map as pierre a fleche, which means the “rock of arrows.” As a landmark on the river, it guided westward travel by water and wagon for trade and settlement.</p> <blockquote> <p><br /> “Our company crossed the Missouri near the Arrow Rock Ferry on the first day of September 1821…”<br /> -William Becknell</p> </blockquote> <p>The Arrow Rock is part of the Santa Fe Trail story.

The New Fort represented an attempt to continue trading with Plains Tribes following the end of the Mexican War. The operation was shortlived, and William Bent sold the structure to the United States Army, which located a military garrison there under a new name. Both of these forts played a role in the development of the Santa Fe Trail, the destinies of the Plains Indians, and the future of Colorado.</p> <h3>Bent’s New Fort (1853-1869)</h3> <p>William Bent abandoned his old fort (present-day <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bent-s-old-fort-national-historic-site.htm\">Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site</a>) in 1849. Lacking satisfactory offers to purchase it, Bent is believed to have burnt much of the fort to keep it from falling into the hands of the Army or his competition. To continue his trade with the Plains Tribes, Bent built a new fort of stone in 1853. Based on Cheyenne recommendations, he located this new fort overlooking the Arkansas River at Big Timbers, near present-day Lamar.<br /> The new fort had several advantages over the old fort, including its stone construction, simple rectangular design, and lack of adobe. Bent no longer needed to hire labor to apply adobe every season, and the durable nature of stone added to its protection. With trade no longer profitable and the construction of Fort Wise nearby in 1860, Bent leased his stone fort to the Army, which used it as a post quartermaster & commissary and Indian Agency office.</p> <h3>Fort Wise (1860)</h3> <p>Fort Wise was made possible through the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty, which offered Plains Indians annuities and recognition of their land in exchange for allowing uncontested passage along the western trails and the establishment of forts. Named in honor of Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise, Fort Wise served to protect travelers and transportation along the Santa Fe Trail between Fort Larned in Kansas and Pueblo, Colorado.<br /> <br /> The Army situated the fort on lands adjacent to the Arkansas River in 1860, just west of Bent’s New Fort. Fort Wise lacked a protective wall or barricade, instead locating numerous barracks and offices in a square around a central parade ground. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Governor Wise led Virginia’s secession from the United States. The U.S. Army renamed the military post Fort Lyon in mid-1862 to honor of General Nathaniel Lyon, the first United States general killed in the Civil War.</p> <h3>Fort Lyon (1860-1867)</h3> <p>Fort Lyon encompassed both the former Fort Wise and Bent’s New Fort, as both offered advantages to the Army. As a way station along the Santa Fe Trail, Fort Lyon served as a base for U.S. Army patrols and a rest stop for travelers. In 1864, Colonel Chivington used the fort and its troops for the attack on Sand Creek. He uttered his infamous outburst, “<em>Damn any man who is in sympathy with Indians!</em>” inside the quartermaster office of Bent’s New Fort.<br /> <br /> Detachments of the 1st and 3rd Regiments Cavalry, Colorado (U.S.) Volunteers led by Colonel John Chivington marched overnight from Fort Lyon to reach a village of peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho at Sand Creek at dawn on November 29, 1864. The 40 mile ride took about 10 hours and allowed the volunteers to attack the village with complete surprise. The attack resulted in the death of approximately 230 men, women and children.<br /> <br /> Fort Lyon’s low position near the Arkansas River rendered it vulnerable to flooding and disease. A large flood in 1867 undercut many of the buildings. In June 1867, the U.S. Army leased land near Las Animas, Colorado, and transferred the post there, making the new military post the second to bear the name Fort Lyon. By William Bent’s death in 1869, the fort near Lamar lay abandoned and neglected, its stones later scavenged for use in local buildings.</p> <h3>The Site of Bent’s New Fort today</h3> <p>Because of its significance to trade along the Santa Fe Trail and its role in the Sand Creek Massacre, the National Park Service worked with the landowner and other partners to open the site of Bent’s New Fort to the public in 2013. This public-private partnership provides access to the site, where visitors can walk a short trail, read interpretive wayside exhibits, and gaze across the scenic Arkansas River Valley.</p> <h4>Driving Directions</h4> <p>To reach Bent’s New Fort Site, take U.S. 50 to County Road 35, approximately 10 miles west of Lamar or 25 miles east of Las Animas. Turn south on County Road 35 for one mile to County Road JJ (T Junction). Turn east (left) and drive ¼ mile, turning south (right) onto County Road 35.25 for ¼ mile to the Bent’s New Fort parking area. A walking trail and interpretive exhibits are available; however, no public facilities exist at the site.</p>",

William and Charles Bent, along with Ceran St. Vrain, built the original adobe fort in 1833 for trade with local Native American tribes and trappers for buffalo robes. Situated along the northern bank of the Arkansas river in what is now southeastern Colorado, the fort quickly became the center of the expanding holdings of Bent, St. Vrain & Company. Soon, it was also an important stop on the Santa Fe Trail’s mountain route and a center for commercial, social, military, and cultural exchange. <br /> <br /> The fort brought together trappers from the southern Rocky Mountains, Anglo-American travelers from Missouri and the east, Hispanic traders from Mexico, and Native Americans, primarily from the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche, and Kiowa Tribes. In addition to trading prospects, the fort also provided weary travelers, such as those following the Santa Fe Trail, with a place to get needed supplies and rest. During the war with Mexico in 1846, the fort became a staging area for Colonel Stephen Watts Kearny's \"Army of the West.\" Disasters and disease caused the fort's abandonment in 1849.<br /> <br /> Although the original fort no longer stands, at Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site the fort has been reconstructed and is open to the public. The site preserves the resources associated with the Bent–St. Vrain trading empire and provides visitors with the opportunity to explore the trading post’s complex history. <br /> <br /> After your visit, if you are heading West, you have the unique opportunity to stop at Comanche National Grassland and retrace a piece of the Santa Fe Trail at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sierra-vista-interpretive-site-comanche-national-grassland.htm\">Sierra Vista Interpretive Site</a>.

Because of the presence of salt in the water, animals often licked the ground nearby where salt had risen to the surface. Thus, the area was called a “salt lick,” later to be named Boone’s Lick after the two men who settled and opened a salt works there.  <br /> <br /> Salt was an incredibly important resource, and thus, Boone’s Lick was important for Native Americans, and later, Euro-American settlers in the central Missouri River area. In 1806, brothers Nathan and Daniel Morgan Boone (sons of famous frontiersman Daniel Boone) began using the salt lick to extract salt which they sold in St. Louis. The brothers built a sizeable operation using a boiling method. <br /> <br /> The route to the salt lick was originally a Native American trace but had been cut and widened to accommodate increasing traffic. The road, which became known as Boone’s Lick Road, led from the St. Louis area to Franklin, MO (south of Boone’s Lick). The terminus of Boone’s Lick Road became the start of the Santa Fe Trail in 1821, creating a continuous path between St. Charles and Santa Fe.<br /> <br /> The area near Boone’s Lick became known as “Boone’s Lick Country” and was a major site for Westward emigration in the 1800’s.

Troops were assigned to the Little Arkansas and the Stone Corral area in April 1865. It was called Station Little Arkansas. Company G, Third Wisconsin Cavalry, were the first troops to be stationed at the Stone Corral. By early May, 93 men were stationed at the post, most of them from the 2nd U. S. Volunteer Infantry. In June 1865, the 13th Missouri Cavalry was present. There were 185 enlisted men and five officers from the 13th Missouri Cavalry and the 2nd U. S. Volunteer Infantry. In June, 1865, four men were killed by American Indians near Station Little Arkansas. A cholera epidemic also claimed eight men at Station Little Arkansas. All were buried near the south end of the breastworks in the Cottonwood Grove Cemetery at Station Little Arkansas. Later the bodies were exhumed and moved to the Fort Leavenworth Cemetery in 1888 or 1889.<br /> <br /> Peace talks and signing of peace treaties with the American Indians occurred in the fall of 1865. It appears troops were withdrawn from the Little Arkansas post late in 1865. This peaceful situation did not last long as soldiers were again stationed at the Stone Corral site in 1867. At this time the camp was called Camp Grierson, to honor Colonel Benjamin Grierson of the 10th Cavalry. In 1867, the camp was occupied from May to November by Company C of black troops of the 10th Cavalry. This company of some seventy troops constructed dugouts for protection from the American Indians and the weather in the riverbanks of the Little Arkansas. They erected breastworks above the dugouts for protection, which are still visible today.<br /> <br /> During the summer of 2005, a stone was found in a nearby foundation of a fire damaged house that was inscribed with the name of Andrew Welsch of Co. E, 13th MO Cavalry.

Just to the south, the Arkansas River formed the border with Mexico. Traders and travelers required accommodations, supplies, and protection. The Ranch at Cimarron Crossing was established in 1866 by William and Frank Hartwell and several other investors to meet those needs. Later, it was operated by Robert Wright, one of the founders of Dodge City, and A.J. Anthony.  At full force there were 12 armed men at the Cimarron Crossing station.<br /> <br /> The ranch sat in the midst of a vast open plain, covered only with cactus on the higher ground and with grass in the river bottoms as high as a man on horseback. Buffalo could be seen in any direction, and for an hour at a time the river might be heard roaring in the night from the crossing of great herds. Wolves could be heard from darkness until dawn.<br /> <br /> Many Native Americans, such as the Cheyenne, viewed settlements such as the ranch as intrusions onto their homelands. Tension between settlers, traders, and the military increased, including an attack on a wagon train crossing here in June 1867. In 1868, the ranch was abandoned due to the continuous threat of attack from Native Americans.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Cimarron Crossing Park is located on the south side of Cimarron, KS, along the banks of the Arkansas River.)</p> <p>The Cimarron City Park is one of the most beautiful parks in Southwest Kansas.

The Quivira were farmers who built and lived in grass huts in the area. They created trails that would later become parts of the Santa Fe Trail as they travelled west to trade corn and other crops with nearby tribes. <br /> <br /> Almost three hundred years before the initial journey on what would become the Santa Fe Trail, a Spanish conquistador and his men traveled along the trails created by tribes for hunting and trading. Fransicso Vasquez de Coronado travelled here in search of the legendary “Seven Cities of Gold.” His quest led him from Mexico into what we know call Kansas. Though he did not find the Cities of Gold, he did encounter the Quivira. <br /> <br /> Years later, American traders from Missouri followed nearly the same route as Coronado to trade with the people of the newly formed country of Mexico. By the time the route became the Santa Fe Trail, the Quivira had moved south, but American traders encountered other indigenous people as they travelled the trail. <br /> <br /> The Coronado-Quivira Museum has many items from the three cultures—Quivira, Spanish, and American. You will see a model of a grass lodge in which the Quivira lived. You will also see chain mail and other artifacts believed to have belonged to Coronado or his men.

This was considered the “jumping off point” for proceeding westward, out onto the prairie. This is the location of Moore’s Ranche which served variously as a mail station, US Post Office (1860-1866), general store, and hotel. <br /> <br /> An extra day was usually spent at the crossing to repair wagons and other equipment in preparation for continuing westward. The stream channel was relatively deep. It had steep banks that required excavating “cut-downs” or ramps for the wagons, and double or triple teams were needed to pull the wagons up the ramps (one team could consist of as many as 6 yoke, i.e. 12 oxen). If possible, the stream was crossed immediately upon arrival so the crossing could be completed before a rain storm might cause the creek to rise and delay crossing, perhaps for days. <br /> <br /> Sometime prior to 1857, George Smith established a road ranche (equivalent to today’s convenience store) just south of the crossing; it was labeled as a “hotel” on the 1857 General Land Office survey plat. In 1858 he sold his ranche to brothers Abraham Atlantic and Ira Moore, and Smith moved east to establish Lost Spring Station. The ranch at Cottonwood Crossing became known as Moore’s Ranch and was in existence throughout the Santa Fe Trail Era.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (From Durham, KS, take 5<sup>th</sup> St west out of town and then continue westward on the paved road (which becomes 285<sup>th</sup> St) approx. 1.3 miles.)</p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/cottonwood/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

This council, which was attended by three U.S. commissioners and the chiefs of the Great and Little Osage Indians, resulted in a treaty that - in return for an $800 payment - gave Americans and Hispanics free passage along the Santa Fe Trail through Osage territory. This meeting was also the namesake of Council Grove, a trailside community that was founded in the late 1840s, because of the mile-wide grove of hardwood timber in the area.<br /> <br /> A protective canopy east of the Neosho River bridge protects the stump of the Council Oak. Before it blew down in a windstorm in 1958, the oak was approximately 70 feet high and measured 16 feet around.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (U.S. Highway 56 (E.

There was a toll bridge about 150 yards upstream during the 1860s. About 150 yards above the post, the creek was spanned by a bridge 8 feet wide and 30 feet long. Dr. Asahel Beach and his son, Abijah, established a supply ranche (trading post) here in the 1850s. This area was also known as Beach Valley.<br /> <br /> William Mathewson -- the original \"Buffalo Bill\" -- was at Cow Creek (Beach Valley) ranch from its beginning days up to 1862. In 1860, he hunted buffalo to supply meat to settlers of Eastern Kansas whose cattle herds had been reduced by droughts in 1859 and 1860. Mathewson along with two other men, survived an disputewith American Indians which lasted three days, July 20, 21, and 22, 1864. Five hundred American Indians attempted to advance, but Mathewson, along with the other men, kept them at bay.<br /> <br /> One month later, in August 1864, William Mathewson married Elizabeth Inman, a native of Yorkshire, England. It is said that Mathewson did not bring his bride to Cow Creek ranch until she had become expert with rifle and revolver. By all accounts she was a courageous woman, operating the ranche while Mathewson was away serving as guide for Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt's expedition against the Plains Indians.<br /> <br /> Perhaps the best-known surviving feature of the Cow Creek Crossing area is Buffalo Bill's hand-dug well. The well, with a Daughters of the American Revolution marker to the north of it, is still there.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (3 miles west of Lyons, Kansas on Highway 56 and 1 mile south on 12th Avenue)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/Cow-Creek-Crossing-Brochure-Nov%202012.pdf\">Read more: Cow Creek Crossing (Beach Valley) brochure by the Santa Fe Trail Association</a></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

One was killed; the murderer fled. The dead man, friendless and unknown, was wrapped in a blanket by the townsmen and buried where he fell with his boots on. So began Boot Hill. For six years Dodge City had no official cemetery. Persons dying who had friends, enough money, or sufficient standing in the community were buried at Fort Dodge. Others, penniless or unknown were buried where it was convenient to dig a hole.<br /> <br /> Boot Hill, now a part of Dodge City, is the most famous burial ground in all Western lore, even though it was only used until 1878. Two schools were built atop Boot Hill before the Spanish-style City Hall was erected in 1929, which still stands today. <br /> <br /> In front of this historic place stands a cowboy statue. It was created by Dr. O.H. Simpson, a pioneer dentist. Joe Sughrue, and early day lawman, was the model. The marker on the base of the statue commemorates the frontier days of the cattle drives: “On the ashes of my campfire this city is built.”</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (The Old City Hall Monuments are located at 501 W.

It was originally established as Camp Mackay on August 8, 1850. The fort’s main purpose was to protect Santa Fe Trail travelers from hostilities of local Native American tribes, whose historic lands the travelers were crossing. On June 25, 1851, a newly built fort was officially named Fort Atkinson. The fort was built of sod and was soon dubbed by the soldiers quartered there “Fort Sod,” and later “Fort Sodom.” Field mice were reportedly quite a problem for the troops. Lieutenant Henry Heth, commanding officer, requisitioned a dozen cats from Fort Leavenworth to cope with the problem.

At this point in their journey, many of the passing wagons needed maintenance and repairs to continue, which they could find at Fort Mann. The Plains tribes opposed the construction of Fort Mann on their lands and its occupation by outsiders, and so conflict arose. As a result, in May of 1847 all but ten of the teamsters left the Fort. The rest followed in June after a particularly intense attack. Abandoned, the Fort fell into disrepair, passing travelers stripping it of wood for cooking. The Indian Battalion of Missouri Volunteers were formed in September in part to once again occupy Fort Mann. The battalion’s destructive interactions with the Pawnee and infighting amongst the men at the Fort created significant controversy that led to an investigation. The Fort was again abandoned by the summer of 1848. In 1850 Fort Atkinson was built a few miles east.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (A few miles West of Dodge City)</p> <p>Fort Mann no longer stands.

The Corps of Discovery first passed through the area on June 23, 1804, although no mention regarding the site’s suitability for a fort was noted in the journals. At the time, Clark only documented an island that was then across the river from the later site of Fort Osage. However, when he returned in 1808 as a brigadier general in the Louisiana Territory militia and U.S. agent for Indian Affairs, Clark referenced his initial un­documented impression of the location, writing that he “examined the Situation and the points of a Small Island which is opposit, found the River could be completely defended and Situation elegant, this Situation I had examined in the year 1804 and was delighted with it and am equally so now, […] and fixed on the spot for the fort and other buildings.” In 1810, as Nicholas Biddle prepared the expedition journals for publica­tion, he interviewed and corresponded with Clark in order to elaborate on details within the text. Based on information provided by Clark at this time, the first edition of the journals, published in 1814, revised the original June 23, 1804 journal entry to insert the text: “Directly opposite on the south, is a high command­ing position, more than seventy feet above high-water mark, and overlooking the river, which is here but of little width; this spot has many advantages for a fort, and trading house with the Indians.” Following aban­donment in 1827, archeologists rediscovered the fort’s foundations in the 1940s. It was then reconstructed to portray the circa-1812 appearance.</p>",

During the first few years, Fort Union's mounted troops patrolled the trail. Later, the fort provided escorts for mail stages.

At the southeast and northwest corners there were hexagonal, two-story towers, with two sets of loop holes for rifle ports. These loop holes were arranged in sets of three on a side, and presented a face opening of two inches wide by 16 inches high that widening in the wall to a breadth of about 16 or 18 inches on the inside.

Gunsight Notch is just two miles from the Kern Ruts which are some of the best preserved ruts on the trail! </p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Two miles from the Kern Ruts)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Seth Hays, great-grandson of Daniel Boone, was Council Grove’s first permanent settler. He came here in 1847 to trade with the Kaw (Kansa) Indians, who purchased guns, blankets, flour, and tinware from him. About 1857, he replaced his log store with this frame building, which served citizens and travelers as a trading post, courthouse, post office, printing office, and meeting and social hall.<br /> <br /> Business was lively in Council Grove: in a four day period in 1860, the Kaw Indians spent $15,000 here and across the street at the Conn Store. The Santa Fe trade became increasingly lucrative. In 1863, Hay’s former partner, G. M. Simcock, estimated that $40 million in freight was hauled in ox- and mule-drawn wagons through the town.<br /> <br /> In addition to supplies, the Hays House offered meals and rooms to weary traders on their eight-week trip between New Mexico and Missouri. The Kansas Press described the accommodations in 1859 this way:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Those who have occasion to stop at Council Grove, on the Santa Fe Road, will do well to ‘put up’ with Charles A. Gilkey [Hay’s hotel clerk]…mine host of the Hayes House. [They]…cannot but help feeling quite at home.”</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(112 W.

Prominent Mexican trader Don Antonio José Chávez, who made his fortune raising sheep and investing in mining and freighting, was murdered by Missouri ruffians during a trip on the Trail. <br /> <br /> Don Antonio José Chávez made two mistakes in 1843 as he set out from Santa Fe for Missouri: the caravan left too early in the season and with too few men. The caravan originally numbered 20 men, two wagons and 55 mules. However, after bitter cold caused frostbite and killed most of the mules, 15 men deserted on the plains. These events put them at a disadvantage when they encountered the Missouri marauders who intended to job the caravans from Mexico loaded with goods and money. <br /> <br /> When the Missourians encountered the Chávez caravan, they captured the traders and marched them away from the wagons so the loot could be divided among the criminals. The leader of the gang decided the group should kill Chávez, and afterward, they found his money belt containing 39 gold doubloons.

Wornall Home\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/john-b-wornall-home.htm\n\n<p>Richard and Judith Wornall located their 1858 home within sight of the main road that led south from Westport and headed toward a Santa Fe Trail junction in what is today south Kansas City. With a homestead of nearly 500 cultivated acres, the Wornalls were in a position to help outfit overland travelers with needed provisions. The cliché “it takes a village” was the reality when you envision thousands of westward migrants descending upon the western Missouri frontier each spring, all of whom needed supplies and foodstuffs to last them for up to a six-month overland journey.<br /> <br /> In 1843, Richard and Judith Wornall, and their two sons, John Bristow Wornall and George “Thomas” Wornall, moved to Westport, Missouri. In the late 1850s Wornall chose the site of his new showplace carefully—it was two hundred feet away from the main road that lead [sic.] south from Westport and headed toward the Santa Fe trail. Wornall purchased nearly 500 acres of land from John McCoy and soon sold the land to his sons. <br /> <br /> Thomas died of cholera on the western plains in 1849, and John became the sole titleholder. After Judith died in 1849, Richard Wornall returned to Kentucky. John built the house in 1858. The homesite was subsequently subdivided and the original homestead remained in the Wornall family until the 1970s when the Jackson County Historical Society saved, restored, and opened the home as a museum.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (6115 Wornall Rd., Kansas City, MO)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.wornallmajors.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The city grew from an 1835 Land Grant from the Mexican government to become the largest city in the Southwest, at least for a time. Long before, the area had a rich and vast history with the Paleo-Indians and the Anasazi and Mogollon cultures. The Santa Fe Trail went through the old original settlement plaza, in the center of town, which was a key trading spot on the Santa Fe Trail. For eastern traders, Las Vegas was the town toward the end of the Trail. For western traders, it was first town after leaving Santa Fe.<br /> <br /> During the 1846 Mexican-American War, General Stephen Watts Kearny, came down the mountain route and marched his army to the central plaza. On top of a flat roof, he announced that Las Vegas was now the property of the United States. Upon becoming part of the United States, Las Vegas also became the largest community in the Southwest and housed some of the most wanted rebels. <br /> Santa Fe railroad tracks reached Las Vegas on July 1, 1879, and the first train entered the city three days later. Las Vegas served as the railhead (and eastern trail terminus) for the last few months that the Santa Fe Trail served as a long-distance route.  <br /> <br /> Today, Las Vegas boasts of more than 900 registered historic structures and many Santa Fe Trail sites. You can have a picnic at the historic Las Vegas Plaza and learn about Santa Fe Trail and local history at the Santa Fe Trail Interpretive Center. Craving even more history? The City of Las Vegas Museum and Rough Rider Memorial Collection on Grand Avenue has a wealth of information on local topics and features artifacts and archives on Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders. For a taste of railroad history, visit the 19th century Train Depot on Railroad Avenue.

Major Bennett Riley, in the year of 1829, commented that the Little Arkansas was about ten feet wide with steep banks of fifteen feet high. The bottom of the stream was very muddy. Major Riley's military detachment of dragoons shoveled down the banks to the river to make it passable for the wagons to cross. Some early groups of travelers placed stones in the muddy river bottom to improve the crossing. Some of these stones are still there and can be seen during dry periods when the level of the water in the stream is very low.<br /> <br /> This crossing became a major overnight stop and camping area due to problems with making the deep crossing. The crossing would be made upon arrival of a wagon train later in the afternoon just in case an overnight rain would flood the area. When the valley was flooded, a wagon train may have to wait for a few days until the flooding subsided. A wagon would typically be pulled by 8 to 10 oxen or mules. To help pull the wagons through the muddy river bottom, an additional team or two from other wagons would be hitched in front creating double and triple teams to pull the wagons.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(The Little Arkansas Crossing and related sites are located 5 miles south of Windom KS.

In 1859, George Smith established a road ranche in Sec. 20 about a mile to the southwest of the “original” Lost Spring, but soon lost it in a poker game to Jack Costello. Not long after, Costello acquired a partner in the station, Thomas Wise. The road ranche was a station operated for the contractors transporting mail between the Missouri River and Santa Fe. The station, which was located close by this site, included a hotel, and provided meals, supplies, and a place of entertainment for travelers.<br /> <br /> The station gained a reputation for catering to the rougher element including visitors such as “Bloody” Bill Anderson in 1861 (who later became notorious as Quantrill's lieutenant). There are numerous legends about events that supposedly occurred at Lost Spring Station, but few can be confirmed with primary documentation. A US Post Office named Lost Spring was operated at the station 1861-1864. <br /> <br /> Activity on the Santa Fe Trail between the Missouri River and the Great Bend of the Arkansas River greatly diminished in 1866 when the railroad reached Junction City, Kansas. Costello sold out to Wise in 1868. Wise and Costello were active in establishment of the Town of Marion and organization of the County of Marion. <br /> The station took its name from its proximity to the “original” Lost Spring on Lyon Creek a mile to the northeast. Over the years, however, the spring a few yards northwest of the station on Cress Creek came to be known as “Lost Spring” because of its proximity to Lost Spring Station. In 1908, the Marion County Old Settlers organization and the Shields family erected a large granite marker to commemorate the station. A blue and white metal sign at the site contains misleading information about the site, but a new historic interpretive sign was erected adjacent to the granite monument in 2010.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(From the Town of Lost Springs, KS, go west on 340<sup>th</sup> St approx. 2.4 miles.)</p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/cottonwood/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The Corrumpa Creek, just within present-day New Mexico, was a welcomed refreshment for weary trail travelers.  If coming from Missouri, travelers were guided to Corrumpa Creek by the site of Rabbit Ears Mountain, an indispensable landmark and sign of much needed resources. Amidst the loose sandy banks of the creek, a natural rock shelf provided easy passage at what came to be known as McNees Crossing. <br /> <br /> The crossing bears the name of a young trader who, along with a fellow traveler named Monroe, rode ahead of their caravan and stopped to rest at the crossing in 1828. While napping, the two men were shot by American Indians in view of the approaching caravan.  McNees passed away and was buried at the crossing while Monroe survived the thirty-mile journey to Upper Spring before passing. While burying Monroe, the travelers were approached by a group of six American Indians who likely had no knowledge of the shooting. Josiah Gregg’s account of the incident suggests, “It is more than probable . . . that the Indians were not only innocent but ignorant of the outrage that had been committed, or they would hardly have ventured to approach the caravan.” Angered and seeking revenge, a traveler shot at the unaware American Indians, leading to more gunfire and the death of five people. In Gregg’s words, it was a “dreadful catastrophe.” <br /> <br /> Three years later, in 1831, Gregg attended an Independence Day celebration at McNees Crossing. The celebration may be the first of its kind held in present-day New Mexico. A marble marker erected by the American Legion in 1921 commemorates the 4th of July event. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p>Location (Located on New Mexico Highway 406, 3.5 miles west of the Oklahoma state line, then 1.5 miles south of the small community of Moses, NM, 88415.  On a private ranch road, approximately 1 mile after crossing Corrumpa Creek/N.

Short lived, this rail line carried passengers between the Independence-Wayne City River Landing and Independence Square. This innovative mode of transportation was not a locomotive nor horsepower, but it was a wheeled coach, or wagon, pulled along rails by Missouri mules.<br /> <br /> This ‘train’ was powered by two mules, one in lead of the other. Construction had begun in 1848. The track was made of steel-faced wooden timbers laid lengthwise, just as iron rails were later used. The wheels of the cars, too, were of wood.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (214 W Maple Ave., Independence, MO)</p> <p>The train terminated at Independence Square at a station once located where Dave’s Deli is today (2015) and a historical marker commemorates this historic, local fact with national significance.

        "notes": "New Santa Fe Cemetery Trail Ruts\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/new-santa-fe-cemetery-trail-ruts.htm\n\n<p>When William Becknell and his party made their consequential first trip on the Santa Fe Trail, it is likely that they passed through the New Santa Fe area, and perhaps crossed the ruts that are still visible in the New Santa Fe Cemetery. Located at the westernmost border of the US, New Santa Fe (now part of Kansas City, MO) was a gateway to the adventure and challenges of trail travel.Thus, the area was a significant transition point on the trail. It was a place for outfitting and loading for travel west. It was also a place where goods and silver from Santa Fe could be unloaded and distributed. <br /> <br /> When emigrant traffic began to grow in the 1840’s, trails to Oregon and California shared this path with the Santa Fe Trail. Thus, these trail swales saw not only heavy commercial traffic, but significant emigration traffic. Because it was, for several years, the last stop in the US, it was an important milestone for those leaving behind what they knew for a chance at a new life. After the discovery of gold in 1848, many “49ers” also used this path on their way to find wealth in the gold fields. <br /> <br /> By the late 1840’s, a stage stop on this route called “New Santa Fe” offered several amenities: a post office, two general stores, an inn, a shoe shop, drugstore, blacksmith, and saloon. Seeing the success of the area, Dabney Lipscomb platted the town of New Santa Fe in 1851. Conflict on the Missouri-Kansas border in 1860 prior to the Civil War disrupted traffic on the trail and led to a decline in the town. <br /> <br /> By the time the New Santa Fe Cemetery was designated as a burial ground in 1880, trail traffic had dissipated, but the ruts may have still served as a road for cemetery visitors. Though the cemetery post-dates significant trail traffic, it helped protect the ruts from the fate faced by most in the area. As Kansas City grew, the town of New Santa Fe was dismantled and replaced by modern development. The swales in the cemetery are a unique historical remnant amongst the surrounding urban environment.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (122nd Street and State Line Road, Kansas City, MO)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> The New Santa Fe Cemetery now sits in the heart of a residential neighborhood developed in the 1980’s. Spanning the cemetery’s entrance is a delicate metal sign that reads “New Santa Fe.” A historical marker and an informational exhibit sit on either side of the entrance and explain the history and importance of New Santa Fe and the trail ruts. The ruts are met on both sides by burial plots intentionally spaced to leave the ruts undisturbed. The ruts are visible as depressions in the grassy land. The cemetery also features mature trees, and weathered gravestones from the late 1800’s.  </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.newsantafe.org/\">More site information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail </a></h2> <p> </p>",

The site also represents the earliest official government documentation of any location on the Santa Fe Trail. The first wagons ever carried over the Santa Fe Trail crossed here at Nine Mile Point. In 1821 William Becknell forged the Santa Fe Trail when he led a small group of men on horseback from frontier Missouri to Mexico’s northern colonial outpost, Santa Fe.<br /> <br /> The very next year, in 1822, again bound for Santa Fe, Becknell led a larger group of men and three wagons loaded with trade goods west on the trail through Nine Mile Point here. These were the very first wagons ever taken on the Santa Fe Trail. In 1823 surveyor Joseph Brown and his crew surveyed the western border of the young state of Missouri.<br /> <br /> Starting in the center of the mouth of the Kansas River, Brown and his men measured the state line southward, erecting sod markers at each mile point. As they reached this location just over nine miles from their start, Brown recorded in his field notes “…to a trace leading from Fort Osage toward Santa Fe.”<br /> <br /> The trace that Brown noted was created by the three historic wagons of William Becknell that had come through this location at Nine Mile Point the previous year. In 1825 Joseph Brown returned to this area as a government surveyor ; this time as the surveyor of the Santa Fe Trail, working with the leader of that George Sibley.<br /> <br /> This survey once again brought Brown through Nine Mile Point, but this time not as a boundary surveyor but as the surveyor of a highway between nations.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (78th and State Line Road, Prairie Village, KS)</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.pvkansas.com/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/36/641\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Settlers and travelers riding the trail between Santa Fe, NM and Independence, MO passed right by the remnants of Pecos Pueblo. Long before Europeans entered this country, the pueblo village of P`ǽkilâ (Pecos) was the juncture of trade between people of the Rio Grande Valley and hunting tribes of the buffalo plains. After Spanish colonization, a successful Pueblo revolt, and recolonization, the population of Pecos Pueblo was decimated. In the 1830s, the last remaining Pecos people migrated permanently to the Pueblo of Jemez where the Pecos traditions live on.<br /> <br /> In 1862, the area surrounding the ruins of Pecos Pueblos was the setting of what some call the Gettysburg of the West – the Battle of Glorieta Pass. During the battle, Union and Confederate troops utilized the Santa Fe Trail, the heart of the conflict occurring within a two-mile stretch of the Trail. The Confederates campaigned to take control of the West, which would have greatly improved their chances of success. However, in just three days of tough fighting, the Union Army ruined the Confederate plans and sent them retreating back southwards. The Union retained control the American Southwest for the rest of the Civil War. Today, you can visit the Glorieta Pass Battlefield at Pecos National Historical Park. Additionally, you can visit one of the famous stops along the Santa Fe Trail – Kozlowski’s Stage Stop and Trading Post. Here, weary travelers rested, a day’s ride from Santa Fe, and explored the ruins of the mission church and pueblo.<br /> <br /> After you finish visiting the park, there are many other Santa Fe Trail sites you can visit nearby. Head west to Santa Fe and you can see the Palace of the Governors, the Santa Fe Plaza, and sites at the end of the Trail. Head east and you can explore the charms of the historical trail town of Las Vegas and the adobe remnants of the largest 19th century military fort in the region at Fort Union National Monument.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (1 Peach Drive, Pecos, NM 87552)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/peco/index.htm\">Pecos National Historical Park</a></h2>",

Apprehensive, he requested a military escort as far as Fort Zarah. It wasn’t granted. When Huning caught sight of Plum Buttes, a Santa Fe Trail landmark with 100-foot sand dunes and wild plum bushes, his worst nightmare came true.<br /> <br /> Huning knew that the area between Cow Creek and the Big Bend of the Arkansas River was dangerous. On this particular trip, he had his mother-in-law and her youngest son, Fritz, in the caravan. The attack came from the southeast. Huning shot the leader, dividing them into two parties. One swept through the center of the train driving four wagons, including his mother-in-law and her son, off the road until they stalled in the deep sand about 200 yards away. Both of Huning’s relatives died during the attack.<br /> <br /> As soon as the American Indians left, Huning and the remainder of the party continued to the trail campsite at Big Bend on the Arkansas River. Later, he accurately established the point of attack as being near Plum Buttes: \"about midways between Cow Creek and the Big Bend of the Arkansas and about fifteen miles from Fort Zarah, twenty five miles from Little Arkansas, and about thirty five miles from Fort Harker.” Huning further states that the attacking party appeared to be members of three tribes: Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Arapaho.<br /> <br /> Huning returned to the site of the ambush and removed the bodies, which were buried temporarily near Fort Zarah. The next spring on his annual trip east, Huning moved their bodies to Ellsworth, Kansas.</p> <p><strong>A Different Perspective</strong></p> <p>American Indians were threatened by traders and travelers on the Santa Fe Trail, who were entering their lands and using their resources. This is not the only story of its type on the trail; there was ongoing conflict throughout the trail era.</p> <p><strong>Plum Buttes</strong></p> <p>Plum Buttes, was an important landmark for travelers of the Santa Fe Trail, as they could be seen immediately after crossing Cow Creek. Ultimately they were destroyed by the same force that built them, the Kansas wind.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Private)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/Ralphs-Ruts-and-Plum-Buttes-Massacre-Nov2012.pdf\">Read More: Ralph's Ruts & The Plum Buttes Massacre brochure from the Santa Fe Trail Association </a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Visible across the prairies in present-day Oklahoma and Eastern New Mexico, the mountain was a vital landmark for guiding weary, disoriented travelers and a sign that restorative water, grazing grass, and wood were near. <br /> <br /> Part of the Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field, Rabbit Ears was formed by basaltic lava flow, creating a challenging terrain ranging from level plain to rocky ridges and ravines. Travelers were rewarded for navigating the topography with necessary resources and respite. Three major campsites exist near the mountain: McNees Crossing, Rabbit Ears Creek Camp, and Turkey Creek Camp. If resources were plentiful, travelers would stay in the area a few days to rest and replenish their energy before continuing their journey. Westbound travelers still had around 200 miles to travel before reaching Santa Fe. <br /> <br /> Rabbit Ears Mountain is a double-peaked formation created by past basaltic lava flow. The irregular peaks rise above a midgrass prairie. Some accounts suggest the two peaks look like rabbit ears (leading to its name), but most historical accounts attribute the name to Chief Orejo de Conejos (Rabbit Ears) who was killed on the mountain in a battle with Spanish colonizers in 1717. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (North West of Clayton, New Mexico)<br /> Today, Rabbit Ears Mountain is part of private land, but visitors can view it from other accessible places: Clayton Lake State Park, McNees Crossing, Kiowa National Grasslands, and the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway. </p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.claytonnm.org/rabbitearmountain\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Hathaway, filed a homestead claim in 1878 for this land. While breaking sod on the northeast forty acres of this quarter, John and his sons plowed up a pistol, a watch, pieces of hardware from burned out wagons, and bits of broken ironstone china—grim evidence of the notorious Plum Buttes Massacre.  <br /> <br /> Here at the Hathaway homestead are some of the most pronounced and fine Santa Fe Trail ruts to be found along the full length of the Santa Fe Trail. These have become known among trail buffs and historians as \"Ralph's Ruts.\" These forty acres of rolling grass have been saved from the plow because Ralph's grandfather discovered it was to sandy to become satisfactory cropland. Having been left in the native sod the ruts have been well preserved. One unique feature of these ruts is that there are seven, instead of the four that you find at most rut sites. This is probably due to the sandy soil at this location. The ruts became so deep and the layer of loose sand offered so much rolling resistance to the wagon wheels that from time to time some of the drivers simply moved over to one side and made a new path parallel to the others. The trail ruts are still present for another one-half mile on the farm owned by Ed and Carolyn Hathaway Kern, across 4th Avenue.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Ralph's Ruts are located 4 miles west of Chase, Kansas on Highway 56 and 3/4 mile north on 4th Avenue.

Ray’s blacksmith shop fashioned the accessories they needed to walk 800 miles southwest to Santa Fe or 2,000 miles west to Oregon or California: horseshoes; wagon wheels and other hammered and forged parts; even cookware and yokes for oxen. <br /> <br /> The Raytown Historical Society Museum interprets both of these vital supply outlets with a re-created general store and blacksmith shop complete with original artifacts that help tell this aspect of overland travel. From here, the meandering trail (Blue Ridge Boulevard), will take you to the next stop that 19th century travelers would have passed—and possibly stopped for a respite—the Archibald and Sallie Rice Home.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (9705 E. 63rd Street Raytown, MO)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.raytownhistoricalsociety.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

This site was first settled in 1836 by Archibald Rice and family. They built the still standing, Gothic-Revival farmhouse in 1844, a homestead and campsite on the Santa Fe Trail. It served as a jumping off point for emigrants on the Oregon and California trails and is mentioned in many emigrant diaries as a popular campsite and a place where they could purchase food. The trails passed along the north and west side of the home. In addition to the home, several log structures were built on the property in the mid-1800s. The one that still stands, Aunt Sophia White's Cabin, was built in the 1830s.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (8801 East 66th Street, Raytown, Missouri)</p> <p>The current property owner offers public access, interpretation, tours, and events. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.rice-tremonti.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=BDF8AA56-815F-4CF5-AFFD-8B5AA061D934\">Exhibit Audio Description available</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The route was pioneered by Missouri trader William Becknell, who left Franklin, Missouri in September 1821. Others before him had been arrested by Spanish soldiers once they neared Santa Fe, and most had been hauled south toward Mexico City to serve lengthy prison sentences. Becknell, however, was pleasantly surprised to find that Mexico had overthrown the Spanish yoke, and the new Mexican government – unlike their predecessors – welcomed outside trade. Not surprisingly, others got into the trade soon after Becknell returned, and by 1825 goods from Missouri were not only being traded in Santa Fe, but to other points farther south as well. Some traders used the so-called Mountain Route, which offered more dependable water but required an arduous trip over Raton Pass. Most, however, used the Cimarron Route, which was shorter and faster but required knowledge of where the route’s scarce water supplies were located.</p> <p>From 1821 until 1846, the Santa Fe Trail was a two-way international commercial highway used by both Mexican and American traders. Then, in 1846, the Mexican-American War began, and a few months later, America’s Army of the West followed the Santa Fe Trail westward to successfully invade Mexico. After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the war in 1848, the Santa Fe Trail became a national road connecting the more settled parts of the United States to the new southwest territories. Commercial freighting along the trail boomed to unheard-of levels, including considerable military freight hauling to supply the southwestern forts. The trail was also used by stagecoach lines, thousands of gold seekers heading to the California and Colorado gold fields, adventurers, missionaries, wealthy New Mexican families and emigrants.</p> <p>In 1866, just a year after the Civil War ended, an unprecedented period of railroad expansion began in the new state of Kansas. Within two years, rails had been laid all the way across central Kansas, and by 1873, two different rail lines reached from eastern Kansas all the way into Colorado. Because the Santa Fe Trail hauled primarily commercial goods, this railroad expansion meant that the trading caravans needed to traverse increasingly short distances. During the early 1870s, three different railroads vied to build rails over Raton Pass in order to serve the New Mexico market. The winner of that competition, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, reached the top of Raton Pass in late 1878. Additional track mileage further shortened the effective distance of the Santa Fe. Then, in February 1880, the railroad reached Santa Fe, and the trail faded into history.</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

When Anglo-Americans arrived in about 1850, they brought the Plaza to its current size—about one city block—and enclosed it with buildings facing the Palace of the Governors.<br /> <br /> Located at the center of Santa Fe, the Plaza has been the site of a number of significant gatherings and events. During the early 1900s, it became a hub of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">suffrage</a> activity as demonstrators organized, gathered in public, and petitioned local political leaders. The Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CU) was one of the most active groups. Because of this, they were labeled as labeled “aggressive” and “militant” for their tactics by contemporaneous newspapers and historians. The state’s constitution made it almost impossible to pass a suffrage amendment or referendum, requiring a three-fourths majority at an election and a two-thirds majority in each of the state’s counties. As a result, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/new-mexico-and-the-19th-amendment.htm\">New Mexico</a> suffragists focused their efforts on the passage of a national amendment.<br /> <br /> Many offices and residences overlooked the Plaza, including the Catron Block, the law offices of U.S. Senator Thomas Benton Catron. On October 21, 1915, the New Mexico branch of the CU gathered at Senator Catron’s residence. They called for Catron’s support of the national <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/susan-b-anthony.htm\">Susan B. Anthony</a> constitutional amendment. Catron was a boss of the Santa Fe Ring, New Mexico’s first political machine. He was a strong and vocal opponent of women’s suffrage. His was a significant hinderance to the movement. In the November 21, 1915 issue of <em>The Suffragist</em>, the weekly publication of the CU, a delegation can be seen standing with Catron outside of his home.<br /> <br /> The Santa Fe Plaza was also the home to the Second Governor’s Mansion, commonly referred to as the executive mansion. After state governors stopped living in the Palace of the Governors in 1907, they resided in a new building on the plaza that resembled the White House. In 1952, this residence was demolished. During its occupation, particularly during the governorship of Washington E. Lindsey, the Governor’s Mansion hosted several women’s suffrage meetings due to the first lady’s involvement with the women’s clubs of the state. Members of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage even met with Governor Lindsey to press their demands for women’s enfranchisement.<br /> <br /> While the surrounding buildings have undergone many changes over the years, the Plaza itself remains. The Santa Fe Plaza was designated as a National Landmark on December 19, 1960 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.<br /> <br /> <em>The content for this article was researched and written by Jade Ryerson, an intern with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.</em></p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p><em>Albuquerque Morning Journal</em>. “Suffragists Prepare for Legislature.” November 24, 1918.

The ferry at Arrow Rock was a convenient method for crossing, making the “Rock of the Arrows” an important landmark. Travelers like Becknell who used the ferry would then climb up the bluff and fill their water stores at the Santa Fe Spring. Also known as Big Spring and Arrow Rock Spring, the spring was a quality source of water for travelers heading West.  <br /> <br /> In 1829 after the town of Arrow Rock was started (originally called New Philadelphia), Burton Lawless granted free use of the spring, which was on his land, to the newly established town. In the 1930’s WPA workers built recreational amenities in the area including picnic tables, a bridge, a swimming pool, and a wooden canopy over the Santa Fe Spring.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (In Arrow Rock State Historic Site, just south of Arrow Rock village, Saline County. The spring is accessed via a walking trail.)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> The Santa Fe Spring is in a protected natural area that is heavily wooded and lush during Spring and Summer. There is a wooden bridge crossing the spring and a stone bench. A concrete spring house designed to direct the spring’s flow is situated on one side of the natural spring bed. A wooden canopy is situated over the spring house.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://mostateparks.com/park/arrow-rock-state-historic-site\">More site information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

At the Santa Fe Trail Tracks we catch a glimpse of the memory of traders crossing the Trail in search of opportunity. For 60 years, this prairie sod was torn by the hooves of mules, oxen, and horses, and compacted by the weight of the large freight wagons they pulled. <br /> <br /> Plains Indians crossed this path as well, the land their home. Cheyenne, Apache, Kiowa-Apaches, and Arapahoe Indians roamed here. As more and more Santa Fe Trail travelers passed through the lands of the Plains Indians, an uneasy tension developed. Friendly trade, wary suspicion, plunder, or bloodshed could result from any encounter.<br /> <br /> Soldiers and temporary fortifications protected trading caravans as early as 1847, but isolation and lack of supplies led to their abandonment by 1854. Fort Dodge, established in 1865, was the area’s first permanent fort. You can still visit the Fort today. With its construction came a series of changes that eventually made it impossible for Plains Indians to live their traditional way of life.<br /> <br /> The site of the Santa Fe Trail Tracks also contains the remains of the Eureka Irrigation Canal (Stoule Canal). Built in the 1880s by Asa T. Soule, a prominent Dodge resident, the canal is seen as an engineering marvel of the 19th century. The canal was intended to irrigate farmlands north of Dodge City, but failed when a prolonged drought and similar projects lowered the Arkansas River’s water level.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (North side of US Hwy 50, 11 miles west of Dodge City)</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/learn/historyculture/dodge-city-ruts-exhibits.htm\">More Site Information (Exhibits)</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

George Sibley, an Indian agent who was commissioned to survey the trail in 1825-27, included Sapling Grove on his list of campsites. Sapling Grove was the rendezvous point for the Bidwell-Bartleson group, the first caravan of families to head west on the trail in 1841. Overnight travelers camped on the hill where Comanche Elementary School now stands. This 21-acre park was known in recent years as Comanche Park.

        "notes": "Stone Corral\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/stone-corral.htm\n\n<p>Sometime during 1858, a trading post was established at the Stone Corral. In February of 1859, the Kansas Territorial Legislature passed an act to authorize William T. Williamson and others to build a bridge at the Little Arkansas crossing. The legislature set the toll rates as follows: wagon or vehicle, 50 cents; each large animal, 10 cents, each small animal and person, 5 cents; man and horse, 10 cents. The earliest known somewhat permanent operator of a ranch at the Little Arkansas crossing was William D. Wheeler.<br /> <br /> Wheeler, with the help of others, may have built the Stone Corral that existed on the site of his ranch. The original Buffalo Bill, William Mathewson, had a trading post here for a short time. Some believe that the soldiers who occupied the site in 1865 and in 1867 did the work, but there are references to the corral prior to 1865, when troops were first stationed there. The stone used for the construction of the Stone Corral was quarried from an outcropping of rock about one mile west of the Stone Corral location. The corral was described as an excellent example of dry masonry, the walls being so perfectly laid and the sandstone slabs so carefully placed together that little or no light could be seen through any place. There was a small stone room built into one corner of the corral. The walls were about eight feet high and perhaps thirty inches thick. The corral was 300 to 400 feet long east and west, or perhaps northeast to southwest, and about 200 feet wide. The north wall had one or two openings about 10 inches up and down, and two feet long on the inside, tapering to about 10 inches square on the outside. A gateway at the southeast corner of the corral allowed wagons and livestock to enter.<br /> <br /> William Wheeler disappeared after May 1864. Prior to 1872, American Indians burned the bridge over the Little Arkansas in an unsuccessful attempt to stop travel on the Santa Fe Trail. Nathan A. C. Bean was the first to officially settle on the Stone Corral site in the 1870's, living in the corral for several months. According to Bean, eight to as many as thirty wagons regularly camped within the walls of the Stone Corral enclosure. Early in the 1870's Mr. Bean began selling stone from the walls of the corral. Some of this was used to build a school house a mile south and three quarters of a mile west of the Stone Corral location. Known as Stone Corral School, the building is still standing though it hasn’t been used in many years. Some of the stone was hauled to Nickerson for the construction of a railway roundhouse. Early settlers in the area used some of the stone to line water wells and build foundations for the homes and farm buildings that were being constructed in the area. Within a few years nearly all the stone was gone and the land was cleared for cultivation.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (30th Rd., between P Ave. and O Ave., South of Windom, KS)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/The-Little-Arkansas-Crossing-Brochure-August-2014.pdf\">Santa Fe Trail Association Little Arkansas Crossing Brochure</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

This crossing came to be known as Walnut Creek Crossing, an important milestone on the Santa Fe Trail. Wagons would often be forced to stop and set up camp along the river banks to wait out flooding. Allison and Boothe saw this site as the perfect spot for a trading post to sell essentials to wagon trains and Native Americans.<br /> <br /> This “ranche” was a large building made of logs. It was the first attempt at building by Americans west of Council Grove. The Walnut Creek Crossing had several owners over the years.  <br /> <br /> You can still visit the Walnut Creek Crossing, to this day. The site is located in Great Bend (Barton County), south of Highway 56.

After the traffic stopped, vegetation slowly reclaimed the muddy and barren ground of the trails, creating the swales that are still visible today.

Wright, a director of the Dodge City Town Company, early day businessman and civic leader. For eight years following 1859, Wright worked as a trader and contractor, hauling grain and cutting hay and wood for military posts along the Santa Fe Trail. He had 3 road ranches on the trail and was one of the last owners of the ranch at the Cimarron Crossing from 1866 - 68. He was also the owner of the sutler store at Fort Dodge.<br /> <br /> He became a major business man in Dodge City and the Rath and Wright store was the main business in Dodge City supplying first the buffalo hunters and then the cattle men and their drovers. Wright served as mayor and as a state representative from 1875 - 1883. In 1883, Wright purchased 19 plus acres of treeless swampland north of the Arkansas River from the town company. Wright intended to give the city the land as a park. He and Peter Mootz, a nurseryman, planted cottonwood trees and filled in the channels. In 1900, the city took ownership and the park was named in Wright's honor. The park has expanded to 61 acres and is the main park in Dodge City.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Wright Park is located at 71 N 2nd Ave, Dodge City, KS, 67801.)</p> <p>At Wright Park today, not only can you find peace under the shade of tall trees and at the Liberty Garden, but you can also find excitement visiting Wright Park Zoo, the playground, and skatepark.

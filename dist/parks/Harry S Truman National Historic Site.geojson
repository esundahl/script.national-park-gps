A grassroots network of willing partners, volunteers, and locations serve as the Freedom’s Frontier Board of Trustees, the coordinating entity for the heritage area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{245}\" paraid=\"8\">Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area has a distinct landscape of rivers, hills, valleys, soils, and vegetation. In the 1800s, before the nation expanded across the continent, the western border of Missouri was the American frontier. To its west, Kansas was known as a permanent Indian Territory for both the Plains Indians and other tribes who were forcibly sent to the region following decades of land disputes. Since river travel ended at the Kansas border, this area became a major jumping-off point for pioneers heading west on extensive networks of trails. Traders, miners, and emigrants secured necessities and purchased provisions, and prepared for long overland treks.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{251}\" paraid=\"9\">In 1854, political tensions between Missouri and Kansas resulted in a violent border war as the Kansas territory sought statehood and debated the legality of slavery. At the time, Missouri was a slave state, and the issue of Kansas entering the Union as a potential “free state” ignited years of turmoil. The violent conflict between slavery proponents and abolitionists in the war known as “Bleeding Kansas” (or “Border War”) focused national attention on Kansas sovereignty and territorial law. This was one of the nation's most widely debated political crises in the years leading up to the Civil War. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed in 1854 left the territory's future status in the hands of settlers. The struggle for freedom was at the forefront of the Border War, and in the Civil War that followed. Although the Fugitive Slave Law made assisting runaway slaves a hanging offense in Kansas Territory, abolitionists continued to help slaves escaping from Missouri by the Underground Railroad.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{16}\" paraid=\"10\">After the Civil War, hundreds of African Americans came to settle in Kansas as part of the \"Exoduster Movement\" in the 1870s. Through the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, African Americans in both states continued the struggle for freedom from inequality and segregation during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights eras. One of the heritage area’s most well-known civil rights stories is found in the landmark Supreme Court case known as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas which ended legal racial segregation in public schools in 1954. Today, Freedom’s Frontier National Heritage Area continues to advocate for equal freedoms for all Americans.  Visit, explore and learn about the nation’s enduring legacy and struggle for freedom through the shared stories of courage, conflict, and hope for reconciliation as told across their broad landscape.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{69}\"

Not only was Truman the thirty third president of the United States, he was also instrumental in the preservation of the Santa Fe Trail. <br /> <br /> Truman served as president of the National Old Trails Road Association from 1926 to 1948. In the mid-1920s, Truman was tasked with determining the official route of the National Old Trails Road, which included the Santa Fe Trail. Between 1926 and 1927, he traveled the Santa Fe Trail many times for this purpose.<br /> <br /> Eventually, the road ran coast to coast and was developed for car travel.<br /> During this time, Truman also traveled the route several times to select the locations for the 12 DAR Madonna of the Trail Statues. This series of statues was dedicated to the spirit of pioneer women in the United States and were commissioned by the National Society of Daughters of the American Revolution (NSDAR). Many of these statues still stand today along the Santa Fe Trail.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Harry S Truman National Historic Site includes the Truman Home in Independence, Missouri, and the Truman Farm Home in Grandview, Missouri.

The visits became more frequent when he got his own machine, the 1911 Stafford automobile.  In the first three months, he put 5,000 miles on his car, the car was used to take his father to medical appointments and to visit Bess in Independence.  Harry wasn’t the only Truman interested in driving the Stafford.  He would teach his sister Mary Jane to drive. It was on her first solo trip with the car that she ran it into the entrance gate.  In a letter to Bess, he described the accident and said “The gate looks rather sickly. I am very thankful that she hit the gate instead of a stone post. She took it a sideswiping lick and yanked it off the hinges. I suppose she must have been going too fast and didn't straighten up the wheel soon enough after making the turn.” <br /> <br /> Harry Truman had big responsibilities on the farm, but he was also very active in the community.  He joined the Mason’s and started a new lodge in Grandview, MO.  He was a member on the Hickman Mills School Board.  He had his first introduction to politics when he took over as road overseer after his father passed away.  <br /> <br /> Eventually he would pass these gates in 1917, leaving the farm in his Stafford to rejoin the National Guard and fight in France during World War I.   ",

Before the pump was installed, there was a well. The water was drawn up by a windlass and bucket.  <br /> <br /> In 1912, the Trumans installed a pump, similar to the current pump.  The original pump was painted white by Harry Truman.  In a letter to Bess on May 21, 1912 he wrote “I gave the pump a good coat. I did that because it stands immediately in front of the back door, and in one of those horribly dark nights I was telling you of when the Nolands were here I was endeavoring to get out of Ethel's way in a hurry and collided with the pump. I dislocated my specs and gave myself a black eye. For this reason I decided to paint it white. Now it can be seen on the darkest nights.” <br /> <br /> Harry Truman’s mother said \"It was on the farm that Harry got his common sense. He didn't get it in town.\"  ",

At the time, Bess was raising chickens in her backyard of 219 N Delaware. Her chickens were struggling with lice and Harry Truman offered his mother's method to remove the lice.   <br /> <br /> “Mamma gave me her prescription for dipping chickens and it's a dinger I tell you. She says it won't hurt the chickens and if it don't it sure ought to get the other fellows. She takes twist tobacco and steeps it in hot water as if you were making tea. Put in cold water enough to cover the hen and make it the right temperature. Then she puts in a tablespoonful of melted grease. She says she puts her hand over the Chicken's bill and eyes and then souses him good. Young and old alike can go through this process without harm. She says she takes four twists of tobacco to one bucket of water. Now if you can get a clear idea of that recipe it is more than I can after reading it. But it will make chickens healthy, although I wouldn't fancy the job of dipping them. Be sure and pick a warm day to do it.” ",

        "notes": "Truman Farm Home\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/truman-farm-home.htm\n\nThe Young Farm, now called the Truman Farm, was the farm of Harry Truman’s maternal grandparents, Solomon and Harriet Louisa Young.  The Young’s laid claim to the initial 80 acres of land in 1844.  The land was ideal for grazing and growing crops like wheat and corn. As the Young family grew so did their land, at one time the Youngs had around 2,000 acres.  <br /> <br /> The original farm home was built in 1867 close to the current farm home location.  Martha Ellen Young Truman, Harry Truman's mother, grew up on this farm and helped her father plant the grove of maple trees in front of the farm home.   <br /> <br /> The Truman family moved to the family farm when Harry Truman was four years old.  John A Truman, Harry’s father, became a partner on the farm. Harry Truman discovered his love of reading while living on the family farm. When he was 4 years old his mother taught him to read using the family bible.  He learned to ride his horse, a Black Shetland pony, that he would ride to accompany his father on his rounds.  He explored the pastures accompanied by his cat Bob and dog Tandy.  The farm provided Harry Truman with wonderful days and great adventures.  In 1890, the Truman family would leave the farm and move to Independence so the children could receive proper schooling.   <br /> <br /> In October 1894, the original farm home burned down and the Young's constructed the existing farm home in sections from 1894-1895.  First, they built the middle section, then added on the front and back sections, completing the home we see today. <br /> <br /> The Trumans moved back to the farm in 1905 to help Grandma Young farm the land. A year later, Harry Truman left his banking job in Kansas City to help his family on the farm.  He left behind the modern conveniences of city life like running water, plumbing, and electricity.  He had never farmed a day in his life.  The years Harry Truman spent farming were during the golden age of American agriculture. <br /> <br /> The Trumans raised horses, mules, chickens, Shorth horn cattle, and Hampshire hogs. The garden was just behind the home where they grew asparagus, apples, peaches, grapes, blackberries, strawberries, and a small kitchen garden.  In the field behind the home was the Solomon Young barn, a granary, hay barn, a small barn, a hog shed, outhouse, icehouse/coalhouse, and smokehouse.  None of these structures remain.   ",

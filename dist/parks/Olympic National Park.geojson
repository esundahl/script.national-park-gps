In between are gentler rolling sections with multiple boardwalks and short bridges<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 2%<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain/Loss:</strong> Less than 25 feet<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking along parking area<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>The Ancient Groves Nature Trail departs from a roadside pullout approximately 8.8 miles up the Sol Duc Valley Road. Though short in length, the trail has many ups and downs at steep grades. It traverses through a beautiful old-growth forest, and has a brief section along the edge of the bluff overlooking the river.<br /> <br /> From the parking area, the trail runs beside the road at a level grade for 100 feet before dropping into the woods to the right. The trail continues for 170 feet of fluctuating steep downhill, with 10-18% grades, to a level boardwalk followed by gentle grades for the next 130 feet. Running along a gentle hill for 50 feet at grades under 7%, the trail meets an intersection and leads to the right towards the river. The next 170 feet is uphill at varying grades from 9-13%. This is followed by a moderate downhill for 265 feet. The trail crosses a short bridge before dropping down a steep 45-foot hill to reach the section above the river.<br /> <br /> The trail continues uphill along the river for 220 feet with some steep sections, particularly when climbing back up to turn left away from the river. The next 370 feet are a gentle rolling downhill through the forest. A steep section of trail climbs at 12% before a second bridge crossing at 1,585 feet, approximately half-way along the trail.<br /> <br /> From 1,585 feet to 1,840 feet the trail rolls up and down through the forest. At 1,625 feet, there is an intersection with a second access point to the trail that originates from another road pullout past the recommended starting point. Continuing to the left, at 1,840 feet there is a 185 foot stretch of steep downhill with grades ranging from 10 to 20%. Crossing another section of boardwalk, the trail fluctuates grades for 110 feet with brief steep sections up to 20%. From here, 430 feet of rolling downhill trail with some steep sections leads back at the intersection. At the intersection, the trail to the right retraces back to the parking area.<br />  ",

There are three cross drains in this set of stairs.<br /> <br /> At the bottom of the staircase, the trail continues downhill obstacle free at 9% grade, dropping to under 5% grade before the start of another staircase at 585 feet. The second staircase consists of 29 stairs with tread 3-4 feet deep. The stairs end at a bridge that crosses over to the bedrock above the beach. To reach the beach, it is a Class 3 scramble (use of hands may be required by some to navigate down the rock to the beach) down the beach where one can enjoy views of rock outcroppings and Deception Island.<br />  ",

While it is not a part of Olympic National Park, it is popular with locals and visitors alike for its hiking and bird-watching.<br /> <br /> From the refuge: \"At <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Dungeness/\">Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge</a> one of the world's longest natural sand spits softens the rough sea waves to form a tranquil bay, fertile tideflats, and beaches of sand and gravel. Here wildlife find food, a place to rest, and protection from winds and pounding surf. Recognizing the area's importance to wildlife, President Woodrow Wilson declared Dungeness Spit and its surrounding waters a National Wildlife Refuge in 1915. Dungeness is one of over 500 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System. A network of lands set aside specifically for wildlife, the System is our living heritage, conserving wildlife and habitat for generations to come. Dungeness NWR is open to the public year-round. Hiking, wildlife watching, and photography are popular activities on the Refuge. There is also an adjacent campground, Dungeness Recreation Area, which is managed by Clallam County <a href=\"http://www.clallam.net/Parks/Dungeness.html\">(click here for campground information)</a>. <br /> <br /> \"Some areas are closed seasonally or permanently to protect sensitive species. Pets, bicycles, kite flying, frisbees, ball-playing, camping, and fires are not permitted on the Refuge as they are a disturbance for the many migrating birds and other wildlife taking solitude on the Refuge. West of Sequim on Highway 101, turn north on Kitchen-Dick Road. Continue 3 miles (4.8 km) to Dungeness County Recreation Area. Pass through the recreation area to reach the Refuge parking lot.\"<br /> <br /> The refuge is open from 7 a.m. to half an hour before sunset, and closing times are posted daily at the trailhead. There is an entrance fee of $3 per family or group (up to 4 adults), payable by cash or check.</p>",

Look for young Coho salmon as you cross Taft Creek, then wander through a wonderland of moss, trees, and ferns - including an iconic moss-draped archway. The trail is just 0.8 miles (1.3 km) long, but you may be tempted to stay for hours!<br />  </p> <hr /> <h4>Full Accessibility Description:<br />  </h4> <p><strong>Length:</strong> 5,515 feet, 1.04 miles; Loop: 4,535 feet, .86 miles<br /> <strong>Surface Type:</strong> Compacted gravel<br /> <strong>Typical Trail Width:</strong> Between 3 and 6 feet<br /> <strong>Typical Running Slope:</strong> First 400 feet: under 5%; remainder fluctuating uphill and downhill with numerous steep grades, typically less than 50 feet in length, ranging from 7-25%, interspersed with gentle stretches<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 2%<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking immediately across from park information boards<br /> <br /> <strong>Description</strong>: The Hoh parking area has five van-accessible parking spaces. Head towards the information boards that are visible from the accessible parking spaces. A trail intersection, 310 feet from the boards, leads to a sign indicating where the Hall of Mosses trail starts. At this intersection, follow to the left for another 450 feet and then turn right at the next trail intersection. The next 10 feet of trail cover a 5-10%-grade increase to the 30-foot bridge over Taft Creek. There is an 8-inch step off the far end of the bridge onto sloping ground for 10 more feet.<br /> <br /> At 650 feet, the trail narrows to 4 feet wide and climbs at a steep 9-14% grade. There is an exterior handrail along the trail starting at 650 feet and ending at 900 feet. The trail turns to the left and continues uphill at steeper grades from 17-22% for 70 feet, before reaching the start of a loop that circles through a forest of bigleaf maple trees. Turn left at the intersection and continue uphill. From 970 feet to 1,020 feet is the steepest part of the trail at 24% for 30 feet, followed by 20 feet at 12%.<br /> <br /> From 1,020 to 1,050 feet, the trail goes downhill at a 15% grade, followed by another 40 feet downhill at 9%. Following a small step down at 1,110 feet, the grade drops to under 5% for the next 700 feet. At 1,805 feet there is a 200-foot spur trail to the left. The spur, under 5% grade, is fenced on either side and ends at a fenced area with views of a group of moss-covered bigleaf maples. Continuing back along the main trail from the spur, the trail remains under 5% grade to 2,210 feet. Those seeking the least-strenuous version of this hike may wish to go back along the same route at this point, as the east side of loop is more rugged than the portion already traveled. The trail begins to climb uphill at 10-14% grade from 2,210 feet to 2,990 feet. From 2,990 feet to 2,390 feet, the trail continues uphill, fluctuating from 7-14% before reaching a 30-foot stretch dense with large roots. There is a brief, level spot at 2,440 feet before a 16% uphill increase that includes 6 steps interspersed with roots and rocks.</p> <p>The trail remains rocky and begins sloping back downhill at 9-12%, interspersed with a few gentler areas to 2,645 feet. From 2,645 to 2,735 feet the grade sharply increases to 20%, then reduces to 8% from 2,735 to 2,810 feet. Continue down 7 stairs at a 10% grade to 2,850 feet. This concludes the most difficult section of the east side of the loop. There are many amazing sights along the remainder of the loop, including examples of mature trees grown from nurse logs and fallen giants on the trail side. The trail tread again becomes wide, smooth and under 5% grade from 2,850 feet to 3,355 feet. At 3,355 feet there is a 30-foot downhill at 15-20% with numerous roots and rocks. From 3,385 to 3,900 feet, grades remain under 5% until reaching five stairs climbing a 15% grade increase for 45 feet. From 3,945 feet the trail is again smooth and level until a 25-foot uphill increase of 10-12% at 4,380 feet. The final gentle stretch extends from 4,405 feet to 4,500 feet. At 4,500 feet, continue down a steep hill at 20-25% grade to reach the beginning of the loop. Retrace the initial approach to return to the parking area at 5,515 feet.</p>",

The trailhead is at the end of the road, just 1.3 miles (2.1 km) past the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center. Overflow parking is available at Picnic Area B.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h4>Full Accessibility Description</h4> <strong>Length:</strong> 8,600 feet, 1.63 miles<br /> <strong>Surface Type:</strong> Asphalt pavement<br /> <strong>Typical Trail Width:</strong> 8 Feet<br /> <strong>Typical Running Slope:</strong> First 2,700 feet under 5% with one 150 foot stretch from 7-9%. From 2,700-8,550 feet very steep with many sections 15-20%.<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 1%<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain/ Loss:</strong> First 2,700 feet: net gain 10 feet, maximum gain/ loss 20 feet. Entire Trail: 645 feet<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking immediately across from the trailhead<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>The Hurricane Hill trailhead is at the end of the Hurricane Hill Road, 2 miles past the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center. The trail starts at the northwest corner of the parking area and contours to the south side of the hill offering spectacular views of the Olympic Mountains. At the top, there are also views to the north of Griff Peak, Vancouver Island and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.<br /> <br /> Initially the trail goes downhill for 400 feet at a gentle grade under 6%. From 400 to 750 feet, the trail proceeds uphill. This stretch is at 7% with a steeper 150-foot stretch in the middle at 8-9%. The trail levels out at the top and is under 2% grade for the next 650 feet. At 1,400 feet, the trail heads downhill around a curve at less than 5% grade for the next 300 feet. The trail is on a steeply-cut bank through this section with exposure to a considerable drop on the outside edge. Those affected by heights may wish to remain on the inside edge of the trail.<br /> <br /> The trail continues through gradual ups and downs under 5% until 2,450 feet. From 2,450 to 2,700 feet the trail again goes downhill at about 6%. This is a good location to consider turning back. It is a strenuous hike past this point. From 2,700 to 3,700 feet, the trail is extremely steep with grades ranging from 10 to 18%. The trail continues uphill to its terminus at the top of Hurricane Hill, alternating between moderately steep and extremely steep grades as follows:<br /> From 3,700 to 3,900 feet, grades range from 4-6%<br /> From 3,900 to 4,300 feet, grades range from 8-11%<br /> From 4,300 to 5,700 feet, grades range less than 8%<br /> From 5,700 to 8,200 feet, grades range from 10-18%",

Drive carefully and keep an eye out for rocks and wildlife on the road! In winter, the road may be closed certain days (it is generally plowed on weekends as weather allows), and all vehicles are required to carry tire chains in case of icy road conditions.<br /> <br /> The road to Hurricane Ridge leads up 17 miles (27.3 km) into the subalpine ecosystem of Olympic National Park, reaching an elevation of 5,242 feet (1,600 meters) at the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center. Along the way, the Heart O' the Hills entrance station, campground and trailheads are five miles (8 km) up the road, and there are several scenic pullouts with spectacular views of the mountains, forests and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.<br /> <br /> The road may close with short notice due to rapidly changing weather conditions. Fog, falling rocks and wildlife along the road are potential hazards year round, and snow, avalanches and the plowing schedule affect winter opening. Drive safely and always check at the Visitor Center for the latest road and weather updates, or call 360-565-3131. It is very dangerous to stop your vehicle in the road to look at wildlife, so if you must stop, please use a pullout.</p>",

The trailhead is at the end of a .2-mile gravel road. The parking area is gravel with no defined parking spaces. The Big Cedar itself is just 110 feet from the trailhead. The trail circles the tree to the left and continues east into the lush coastal forest. Please resist the urge to climb on this ancient giant. The trail is wide and stable, but the edges slope off steeply where the trail goes around the tree.<br /> <br /> After the tree split in 2014, a trail was constructed that continues 690 feet into the forest and has a loop, or lollipop, ending that runs adjacent to another impressive cedar. The “lollipop” ending narrows to 3-foot width, is crowned, and has steep slopes on both sides where substantial gravel fill was added to even the grade. The trail is typically under 5% grade, with one brief section at 6.5% grade in the center. The lollipop portion of the trail narrows to 3 feet and the gravel slopes off steeply on either side. Wheelchair users should exercise caution if navigating the loop. The loop is 285 feet in circumference. The north side has a 6% grade for 105 feet.

From kiosk start to the homestead, less than 5%<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 1% (the first bridge has a cross slope of 4% for the last 15 feet)<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>This loop trail may be travelled in either direction: Following the Maple Glade Trail going left at the first junction, and then left again at 1,050 feet when reaching the sign for the Kestner Homestead Trail; or starting at the information kiosk. Starting from the Maple Glade Trail, it is .77 miles to the homestead. After leaving the Maple Glade Trail, the trail rolls up and down through a forest heavy with maple trees, and the tread is generally clear of obstacles. There is a 40-foot bridge at 1,125 feet, followed by 2 slightly steep sections (10 feet at 7% at 1,560 feet and 30 feet at 6-8% at 1,710 feet) before reaching a mossy bench at 1,710 feet. From the bench, there is a gradual hill for 290 feet at up to 7% grade. At 2,080 feet, the trail narrows to 3 feet. There is a 30-foot 8-10% downhill at 3,770 feet followed by a 25-foot bridge at 3,715 feet. The boundary of the Kestner Homestead is at 4,075 feet. From this point back to the kiosk at the parking area the trail is mostly flat.<br /> <br /> The first 170 feet of trail through the homestead is clumped with grass followed by a 110-foot section where the trail is all grass. Turning right at the homestead residence, the trail follows the original entrance road past the orchard for 500 feet before crossing a bridge over Kestner Creek. The decking of the bridge is pending replacement and a 2-foot-wide path of expanded metal is in place the length of the bridge to provide secure footing. Continuing around the gate at the end of the bridge, the trail turns right just before reaching the North Shore Road. From here it is 1,840 feet back to the trailhead kiosk at the parking area. There is a short stretch after turning along the road that is 3-feet wide and there is an adjacent ditch. Wheelchair users should exercise caution. There are roots that rise 2” above the trail tread at 5,800 and 6,490 feet.<br /> <br /> For those wishing to visit the homestead on a less-strenuous hike, depart from the trailhead kiosk and return the same way. This is a 1.1-mile round trip.",

The interior of the Lodge was decorated with Native motif on the ceiling beams. Later, Sally provided basketweaving demonstrations while her family entertained the visiting tourists with singing, dancing and drumming. Additionally, long intricate canoes carved by Chief Howeattle provided exciting races on the lakefront of the Lodge.<br /> <br /> \"During the late 1920s, huge barbecues were held in the summer on the beach in front of the lodge. The crowds were entertained by foot races, water sports and square dancing on Fred Halbert's dance pavilion (R.H. Jones, A History of Lake Quinault Lodge, 1997). Many of these same activities persist today. Harvest Moon, Quinault Ambassador and master basketweaver is a frequent guest at the Quinault Lodge. Collaborative Interpretive signs provide tribal heritage and artistic works, with geologic, scientific and historical perspectives of the area on the Lakefront shoreline trail.

Trail brochures for the Maple Glade Trail and the Kestner Homestead Trail are available at the bottom of the 30-foot ramp. The Maple Glade brochure describes forest elements at 13 marked points along the trail. 200 feet farther down the trail, proceed right at the junction to follow the brochure in numerical order.<br /> <br /> The Quinault Rain Forest receives over 12 feet of rain annually. Portions of the trail may be flooded between the months of October and May, but the summer months are typically dry, and so is the trail. The rain contributes to escalated vegetation growth, so each side of the trail typically has low vegetation growth in the gravel surface, but it is still firm. Despite the gentle grade of the trail, the weather conditions make it difficult to maintain in accessible condition, so wheelchair users should proceed with caution.<br /> <br /> Continuing from the junction, the trail proceeds for 2,370 feet through a quiet forest of mossy bigleaf maple trees, braided with stream channels, before looping back to the junction. The grade is gentle for the entirety of the loop and crosses numerous short wooden bridges. There are multiple locations along the trail where bridge ends, tree roots, and trail construction features rise 2 inches above the trail tread. At 425 feet, there is a cut through a downed tree with a 4-inch step. At 1,530 feet, continue to the left at the Kestner Homestead Trail junction to complete the loop. There is a trailside bench at 1,685 feet. The roughest stretch of trail is from 2,010 to 2,090 feet where there are two 8-foot sections of numerous crisscrossed exposed tree roots, followed by a 45-foot section where flooded has caused a 10-inch deep, 18-inch wide rut down the middle of the trail. When back at the first junction, go right to return to the parking lot.",

The first peoples created complex cultures around canoe journeys and salmon cycles. Then came Spanish, English, Russian and American explorers in search of territory and shipping lanes. As the country developed, the region’s ports began to bolster trade of vast natural resources, and naval installations came to guard the continent. <br /> <br /> Washington’s coastline is rich with historic buildings and vessels, museums, and archival collections, and the maritime industry remains a foundation of the region’s economy today. Shipyards, container ports, cruise ships, tugs, and marinas full of small and large pleasure craft are as much a part of this NHA’s inheritance as historic ships or lighthouses.   <br /> <br /> To read the Maritime Washington National Heritage Area management plan, click here. <br /> <br /> The vast diversity of this living landscape can be divided by geographic regions:  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{94}\" paraid=\"11\">Olympic Peninsula </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{100}\" paraid=\"12\">The Olympic Peninsula is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound’s Hood Canal. The Olympic Mountains rise prominently in the interior. Historic ports, coastal communities, and traditional tribal lands rim this boxy landmass. Home to Olympic National Park, the peninsula features the longest stretch of publicly-owned and undeveloped shoreline on the Pacific Coast, and closely resembles the shoreline inhabited by the tribes before Europeans arrived. Olympic National Park is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, designated for its ecosystem diversity, while the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary lies offshore, distinguished for its educational opportunities.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{106}\" paraid=\"13\">Puget Sound </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{112}\" paraid=\"14\">A complex inlet of the Pacific Ocean and the third-largest estuary in the United States, Puget Sound comprises many waterways, basins, and bays, including Seattle’s brackish Lake Union. For millennia, the sound connected the Northwest people to the sea – for travel, trade, sustenance, protection, and recreation. Today, Puget Sound is home to maritime industries, military bases, small coastal communities, the cities of Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and the state capital Olympia. The Kitsap Peninsula and enchanting islands lie in the interior of Puget Sound, with the Hood Canal between them and the Olympic Peninsula.    </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{118}\" paraid=\"15\">Northern Coast </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{124}\" paraid=\"16\">Along the western edge of Skagit and Whatcom Counties lies Washington’s northern coastline, a series of protected bays stretching north to the Strait of Georgia, which separates Vancouver Island from mainland Canada. The traditional aquaculture, fishing, and sea trade economies remain important in this region. Continuing a centuries-old tradition, northern coastal cities like Bellingham still provide jumping-off points for journeys to Alaska through the Inside Passage.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{130}\" paraid=\"17\">Salish Sea Islands </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{136}\" paraid=\"18\">Three Northwest water bodies – the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, and Canada’s Strait of Georgia - are together called the Salish Sea. The over 400 islands that lie in these waters are the ancient homelands of native tribes and habitat for some of the region’s most diverse marine wildlife. This varied island environment– including Whidbey Island, one of the largest islands in the contiguous United States, and the San Juan archipelago— contains some of the most remote and rugged places in this region, as well as active ports and popular vacation destinations. </p>",

Cirque Rim Trail 4-foot width<br /> <strong>Typical Running Slope:</strong> Center of parking to overlook: 12-13% for 190 feet reducing to 6-7%. Cirque Rim Trail: 12-20%. Big Meadow Trail: Less than 5%, except for 9% for last 100 feet to east intersection<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 1%<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain/Loss:</strong> Less than 50 feet<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking immediately across from the trailhead<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>There are three trail access points on the north side of the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center parking area. The trail with the least grade and the widest tread begins from the center of the parking area. The trail is steep for the first 190 feet with the grade tapering off for the remaining 210 feet to an overlook with views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Vancouver Island and the San Juan Islands on a clear day.<br /> <br /> Starting shortly before the overlook, the Big Meadow Trail runs east for 900 feet across the meadow to an intersection with the Cirque Rim Trail and the High Ridge Trail. The Big Meadow Trail grade remains under 5% for 800 feet and then increases to 9% downhill where it reaches the intersection of the Cirque Rim Trail and the High Ridge Trail. For the least strenuous option, consider turning around at the <em>Growing Gradually</em> interpretive exhibit and returning to the parking lot or overlook via the same route.<br /> <br /> The Cirque Rim Trail departs to the east from the overlook. The 4-foot-wide path follows the rolling contour of the northern slope at grades of 12-20% for 1,670 feet before meeting up with the intersection of the east end of the Big Meadow Trail and part of the High Ridge Trail. From here, the trail continues down a hill for 140 feet to reach the east end of the parking lot. To return to the center of the parking area via the Big Meadow Trail, follow the trail as it climbs a gradual 9% grade for 100 feet and then levels out to less than a 5% grade over the remaining 800 feet of trail leading downhill to the parking area.</p>",

It will also require fording the large river, so it may only be suitable for later season hikes when the flow is lower. 2.4 miles (3.9 km) up Queets River Trail, just before Coal Creek, there is a small side trail to the left that leads 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to one of the biggest Douglas-fir trees in the park, a humbling giant at 212 feet (65 meters) tall and 14 feet (4.2 meters) in diameter!</p>",

All of the beach access trails at Kalaloch descend from the top of the bluff to the beach. They are generally steep and constructed to weather the 8.5 feet of annual rainfall. Winter ocean swells typically rearrange the beach logs at each location, so conditions at the point where the trail reaches the beach are constantly subject to change.<br /> <br /> The Ruby Beach parking area is a sloped gravel lot with two vault toilets in the center. There is an accessible viewing area overlooking the ocean on the north end of the parking area, with a lower section of rail for wheelchair users on the left-hand side. Vegetation may obscure the view at sitting height.<br /> <br /> The Ruby Beach trail is the only beach access wide enough for a wheelchair to reach the beach. Be advised that the trail is steep, has multiple drain dips and there is a drain across the trail at the halfway point that is 3-6 inches deep. The trail starts on the west side of the overlook and runs approximately 300 feet downhill at 10-20% to the first switchback, which is wide and has a trailside bench. There are 3 drain dips in the top of this section placed 50 feet apart. Continuing downhill at grades of 8-16%, there is an angled drain dip 50 feet below the switchback that forms steep cross slopes, and a wood cross drain at 365 feet that creates a 12-inch wide, 3-6-inch drop. The grade remains steep at 7-16% until 510 feet, where it drops below 5% for the remainder of the trail. There is a spur access to the beach at 575 feet. At 675 feet, the trail narrows to 3 feet before ending at the beach at 735 feet.",

The view of the cascades is lovely year-round, but if you hope to see fish, look for Coho salmon in September and October, or steelhead trout from late March through May. These anadromous fish (meaning they live in both fresh and salt water) are born in the Sol Duc River, but spend most of their lives in the Pacific Ocean before returning home to spawn. Fishing is not allowed near Salmon Cascades. If you plan to fish, be sure to check the park fishing regulations for appropriate areas, limits, and equipment limitations. Please also be aware that to protect the fish resources, much of the park is only open to catch and release fishing.<br /> <br />  </p> <hr />  <h4>Full Accessibility Description</h4> <strong>Length:</strong> 190 feet to viewing platform<br /> <strong>Surface Type:</strong> Compacted gravel<br /> <strong>Typical Trail Width:</strong> 6 feet<br /> <strong>Typical Running Slope:</strong> Less than 5% with one 12-foot uphill to the viewing platform 7-11%<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 2%<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain/Loss:</strong> Less than 25 feet<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking along parking area.<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>The primary purpose for this trail is to provide access to a viewing platform that is perched above Salmon Cascades on the Sol Duc River. In late summer/early fall, coho salmon can be seen leaping out of the water as they make their way upriver to spawn. The trailhead is at approximately milepost 7 on the Sol Duc Road. There is a van-accessible parking space immediately in front of the trail, and a picnic table and accessible toilet available to the right down a gravel walkway.<br /> <br /> The trail proceeds into the woods at grades under 5%. At 100 feet there is a root in the center of the trail that creates a slight hump, but runs in-line with the trail, and can be easily navigated around. At 140 feet, the trail arrives at an intersection. The viewing platform is 50 feet further to the right from the intersection, including a brief steep climb for 12 feet at 7-11%. Continuing straight from the intersection, the trail narrows to a 2-foot width. The first 35 feet climbs at steep grades up to 15% then levels out, ending at a 2-3 foot drop off near the river.",

At 445 feet, there is a short, narrow bridge. On the ocean (west) side of the loop, grasses and berry vines often grow densely along the trail. There are also numerous roots crossing the trail, some on the west side 8-10 inches. At 565 feet, the trail meets the Beach 1 Trail. Turn left to return to the parking area.

This is a great place to look for the fascinating phenomenon known as \"nurse logs\" - fallen trees which provide a place for new seedlings to grow. You can see them at every stage, from the new-fallen log with brand new baby trees sprouting on it to the rows of centuries-old trees whose \"nurse log\" has long since rotted away, leaving them standing in a perfectly straight line, called a colonnade.

From the information boards, proceed forward for 310 feet to an intersection. There is a bench on the left at 200 feet. At the intersection, go to the right. At 350 feet cross the 30-foot bridge. The trail narrows from 6 feet to 3 feet after the bridge. From 400 to 455 feet, the trail climbs at 14-17% grade to another intersection. The Hoh River Trail is to the left. Proceed to the right for the Spruce Nature Trail. Continue downhill for 50 feet at 8-11% grade, followed by 30 feet of uphill at 6-8% to reach the start of the loop trail. Turn left and continue uphill at 14-17% grade incline. At 640 feet, there is a staircase with nine stairs. The steps are 4-6 inches high with long treads between, sloping upward at 8-11%. At the top of the staircase, continue uphill at a maximum grade of 10% for 750 feet, completing the longest continuous climb of the trail.

It winds through old growth forest to a bridge over the North Fork Skokomish River with only a 200-foot elevation gain. A spur trail leads to a huge fallen cedar.<br /> <br /> This trailhead also accesses the Four Stream and Shady Lane Trails, described below.<br /> <br />  </p> <hr />  <h4>Full Accessibility Description</h4> <h4><strong>Four Stream Trail</strong></h4> <p><strong>Length:</strong> 1,645 feet, .31 miles<br /> <strong>Surface Type:</strong> Compacted gravel<br /> <strong>Typical Trail Width:</strong> 6-8 feet<br /> <strong>Typical Running Slope:</strong> Under 5%, except the last 200 feet which has some brief steep sections up to 16%<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 2%, trail is crowned (higher in the middle than on the edges)<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain/Loss:</strong> Less than 25 feet<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking along parking area.<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>The accessible portion of the Four Stream Trail runs along the southern bank of the Skokomish River, and ends at a river overlook at 1,645 feet. The trail narrows and continues beyond that point. The Staircase parking area by the ranger station has one accessible parking spot at the west end of the parking lot. Cross the bridge over the Skokomish River. The trailhead sign will be visible from the west end of the bridge. From the trailhead sign, the 8-foot-wide compacted gravel trail dips down and back up in the first 140 feet, in which 2 sections under 20 feet reach 8% grade. From here, the trail continues at grades under 5%. At 690 feet, there is an intersection with the Big Cedar Trail.<br /> <br /> Continuing forward to the right, passing a pullout with a view of the river at 910 feet. At this point, the trail narrows to 6 feet. At 930 feet there is a 50-foot stretch at 6 to 8% grade. The trail continues at under 5% grade with another pullout at 1,150 feet before rising to another river overlook. From 1,360 to 1,390 feet the grade varies from 8-10%, increasing to a max of 16% for 25 feet. Beyond this is a gentler section with grades of 7-15% from 1,450 to 1,490 feet. After twenty feet under 6%, there is a final steep section from 7-11% from 1,510 feet to 1,525 feet. The grade is under 5% for the final approach to the overlook which is at 1,645 feet.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4><strong>Shady Lane</strong></h4> <p><strong>Length:</strong> 4,410 feet, .84 miles (trailhead at end of bridge to Four Stream Road trailhead)<br /> <strong>Surface Type:</strong> Compacted gravel<br /> <strong>Typical Trail Width:</strong> 2 feet<br /> <strong>Typical Running Slope:</strong> First quarter of trail is rugged with numerous very steep sections 20-40% grade. From 1,050 to 3,940 feet mainly under 6% grade with occasional steep section 12-17%. Final 500 feet starts with an 85-foot section at 30-35% grade and is then mostly under 6% grade with a few 10-foot sections at 15% grade<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 2%, trail is crowned (higher in the middle than on the edges)<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking along parking area<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>From the Staircase parking area, across the bridge over the Skokomish River, the trailhead is identified by a sign on the left-hand side at the far end of the bridge. The next 310 feet of the trail is compacted gravel 3 feet wide. The first 20 feet of this stretch of trail descends from the bridge at a steep 16% grade, decreasing to 8% to 50 feet, and then leveling out to less than 5% grade to 310 feet. The tread then becomes quite rocky to 430 feet, with cross slopes up to 4%.<br /> <br /> At 425 feet, there is a steep informal trail down to the river’s edge. At 430 feet, 2 steps lead up to a 2-foot wide, 40-foot-long bridge. The trail width remains at 2 feet for the remainder of the trail. From the end of the bridge to 1,050 feet, the trail follows the contours of the river along a steep slope that has been impacted by several slides. There is a short spur trail to an old mine shaft on the far side of the bridge.<br /> <br /> The trail continues to the left, proceeding downhill at grades up to 10% to 500 feet. A water bar runs across the trail at 515 feet before the trail begins uphill to cross the slide area. From 555 feet to 570 feet, there is a rugged stone staircase with 6 steps. The trail continues downhill again at grades up to 18% to a 25-foot level section that is held in place by a large log. Beyond the log, the trail climbs uphill at 10% and then steepens to 20% grades with 2 stone steps in the middle from 675 feet to 695 feet before again going downhill at 14-20% to 765 feet. Going uphill again at 10% from 765 to 790 feet, the trail reaches a second bridge, 25-feet long. Beyond the bridge, the trail runs downhill with sections of exposure to a 15-foot drop on the river side, before dropping steeply through a section of bedrock from 830 to 855 feet.<br /> <br /> The next section continues downhill at 20% grade with many roots in the trail from 875 feet to 900 feet. From 900 to 935 feet, the climb increases to 40% grade before becoming more gradual to 985 feet and switching again to downhill at 20% grade to 1,050 feet. From this point on, the trail enters the forest. There continue to be steep sections and periodic roots and rocks in the trail, but they are interspersed with long gentle sections under 6% grade that weave between impressive old-growth cedar trees.<br /> <br /> From 1,050 to 1,830 feet, the trail meanders through the woods at grades under 6%. At 1,830 feet, there is a 15-foot downhill at 17% followed by a brief uphill around a large fallen tree. At this point, the trail fluctuates downhill at up to 17% grade to 1,975 feet, followed by gentler downhill under 7% grade to 2,220 feet. From 2,220 to 2,535 feet, alternating gentle ups and downs in the trail under 6% lead to a root-heavy downhill at 14% for 25 feet. Beginning uphill again, gentle grades run to 2,695 feet at 9% before beginning downhill again. The next stretch of trail covers grades under 6% to 3,710 feet, and one 12% from 2,775 to 2,815 feet.<br /> <br /> There is an intersection with an unofficial trail to the river at 3,710 feet. This is a good point to turn around, if returning to the Staircase parking area, as the remainder of the trail is a climb up to the Four Stream Road trailhead. If continuing, proceed to the right from the intersection. From 3,940 to 4,025 feet there is a very steep 30-35% climb. The remainder of the hike is uphill at gentle grades, interspersed with a few 10-foot sections at 15%. Arrive at Four Stream Road at 4,410 feet.</p>",

        "notes": "Medano Creek\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/medano-creek.htm\n\n<p>Medano Creek is a popular seasonal stream enjoyed by all ages. On this page you'll learn what to expect month-by-month in an average year, and how the rare phenomon 'surge flow' works. You can also link to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grsa/planyourvisit/medano-creek.htm\">current and forecast creek conditions, and a video about the creek</a> showing surge flow waves.</p> <h3>Medano Creek Month-by-Month in an Average Year</h3> <p><strong>April</strong> is the second snowiest month of the year at Great Sand Dunes, but there are also some sunny days with highs in the 60s F. Spring is the windy season throughout the southwestern United States, especially afternoons, though mornings are usually calm. The creek begins to trickle down as the snow on the Sangre de Cristo Mountains melts. By late April the creek may be a few inches deep. Cottonwood trees and willows along the creek are not yet leafed out.</p> <p>Late <strong>May</strong> is near the peak of Medano Creek's annual flow. While it is still springtime and winds may arise, especially in the afternoon, May temperatures are generally moderate, with highs in the 60s-70s F. However, snow is still possible at this elevation in May! Trees and bushes along the creek leaf out. There may be some \"no-see-ums\" (tiny biting gnats), but mosquitoes are rarely out in May. Late May and early June are the best opportunity to experience \"surge flow\", where waves up to about 20 inches (50 cm) high flow down across the sand. In wet years with good peak runoff, children can float down the waves on flat inflatable toys. Water comes out of the mountains cold, but warms up significantly when the sun shines on it for a few hours as it spreads across the sand. <span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\"><em>Because of the creek's popularity, late May and early June weekends are extremely crowded, with long lines of traffic, overflowing parking lots, a crowded beach, and full campgrounds. If possible, plan your visit on a weekday this time of year.</em></span></p> <p><strong>June</strong> brings warmer temperatures for water play and generally pleasant conditions the first week of June. <span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\">But <em>as the creek becomes much lower and warmer around the second week of June, mosquitoes emerge in large numbers.</em></span> Move away from vegetation, to the far side of the creek to avoid the worst of the mosquitoes: they don't like open sand, but prefer to be near shady bushes and trees. By late June, the water level will be fairly low, only 1 or 2 inches (1-5cm). <span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\"><em>Because of the creek's popularity, late May and early June weekends are extremely crowded, with long lines of traffic, overflowing parking lots, a crowded beach, and full campgrounds. If possible, plan your visit on a weekday this time of year.</em></span></p> <p>In <strong>July</strong>, unless there are significant ongoing rains, the creek will begin to retreat back toward the mountains, drying up at the main visitor area near the Dunes Parking Lot. It will continue to gently flow (1/2\" - 1\" deep) along the eastern edge of the dunefield, near the Castle Creek picnic area. Castle Creek is accessible by high clearance 4WD vehicle on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grsa/planyourvisit/medano-pass-road.htm\">Medano Pass Primitive Road</a>. Visitors without 4WD may also access the creek in late summer by hiking approximately 2 miles (3.5 km) up the creekbed from the Dunes Parking Lot, or approximately 0.7 miles (1km) from the Point of No Return parking area. Mosquitoes usually disappear after the water retreats. July is the warmest month at the park, with average highs in the low 80s F.</p> <p>In <strong>August and September</strong>, the creek will likely be completely gone from the main visitor area near the Dunes Parking Lot. It may continue to gently flow (1/2 to 1 inch or 1-2cm deep) along the eastern edge of the dunefield, near the Castle Creek Picnic Area. Castle Creek is accessible by high clearance 4WD vehicle on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grsa/planyourvisit/medano-pass-road.htm\">Medano Pass Primitive Road</a>. Visitors without 4WD may also access the creek late summer by hiking approximately 2 miles (3.5 km) up the creekbed from the Dunes Parking Lot, or 0.7 miles (1km) from the Point of No Return parking area. Mosquitoes typically disappear along with the creek.</p> <h3>Surge Flow - A Rare Phenomenon</h3> <p>Medano Creek is one of the few places in the world where one can experience <em>surge flow</em>, a stream flowing in rhythmic waves on sand. Three elements are needed to produce the phenomenon: a relatively steep gradient to give the stream a high velocity; a smooth, mobile creekbed with little resistance; and sufficient water to create surges. In spring and early summer, these elements combine to make waves at Great Sand Dunes. As water flows across sand, sand dams or antidunes form on the creekbed, gathering water. When the water pressure is too great, the dams break, sending down a wave about every 20 seconds. In wet years, waves can surge over a foot (30 cm) high!</p>",

        "notes": "Medano Pass\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/medano-pass.htm\n\n<p>Medano Pass was likely the historic route used by Zebulon Pike in January 1807 as he led an expedition to explore this region. Today Medano Pass is primarily traveled by 4WD vehicle, on a rough 22-mile road connecting Great Sand Dunes with the Wet Mountain Valley and Colorado State Highway 69. Passable only in the warmer months and only with high-clearance 4-wheel-drive vehicles, it gives access to Medano Pass (elevation 10,040’) and Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. This road crosses areas of deep sand, traverses Medano Creek nine times, and passes through excellent habitat for bighorn sheep. Average driving time for the entire primitive road is about 2.5 - 3 hours. Reduce tire pressure to about 20 psi if the sand is dry and soft. A free air station is available near the south entrance to the road in warmer months between the hours of 7AM and 9PM. If you reduce pressure, you will need to reinflate using your own air compressor before driving over rocks in Medano Canyon. Drive through creek crossings slowly to avoid drowning your engine.</p> <h3>Mileage Chart</h3> <p><strong>Set your odometer to zero at the western entrance of the primitive road to follow along with this guide.</strong><br /> <strong>0.0</strong> End of Paved Road: start of Medano Pass Primitive Road.<br /> <strong>0.2</strong> Garden Creek: flows until mid-summer<br /> <strong>0.5</strong> Buck Creek: intermittent stream<br /> <strong>1.0</strong> Sawmill Creek: flows until mid-summer.<br /> <strong>1.1</strong> Point of No Return: 4WD vehicles ONLY past this point.

These sites are indicated with a brown post and camping symbol, and are numbered by approximate road mileage from the Park/Preserve boundary to Medano Pass. Numbers in parentheses are approximate road mileage from Medano Pass down to the Preserve/Park boundary. <em>Roadside car camping is only permitted in designated sites in the national preserve. Vehicle access to these sites is only available late spring through fall, depending on snow, creek, and road conditions.</em>These designated sites are free of charge and first-come, first-served. All 21 sites fill on summer weekends.</p> <h3>Camping Regulations for Medano Road Campsites</h3> <ul> <li>Camping is permitted in designated, marked sites only in the national preserve. No permits are necessary.</li> <li>Tents must be located within 40 feet of the front of the bear box at each site.</li> <li>Pets must be leashed or restrained at all times.</li> <li>Fires only in existing fire rings; put out completely with water. Gather dead and down firewood 4” or less diameter.</li> <li>No off-road driving. Vehicles must be highway-legal in Colorado. Park only in designated campsites or parking areas.</li> <li>Secure food, coolers, toiletries, and trash from black bears. Lock them in the bear boxes provided at most sites.</li> <li>All trash, including orange peels, egg shells and toilet paper, must be removed. Bury human waste 6” deep.</li> </ul> <h3>Mountain Bikes and Fat Bikes</h3> <p>Standard mountain bikes can ride on the Medano Pass Road from its southern entrance to Point of No Return, a 1 mile trek. Beyond that, soft sand conditions require <strong>fat bikes</strong> (mountain bikes with extra wide tires for sand). Fat bikes are permitted on the Medano Pass Primitive Road, both for day use and for overnight camping in Medano Canyon. Check current sand conditions before riding; if sand gets too soft and dry, travel may not be possible. <em>Bikes are not permitted off-road. </em>You will be sharing the road with vehicles, some traveling at higher speeds in order to make it through sandy sections. For your safety, listen and watch carefully for vehicles as you ride.<br /> <br /> There are no bike racks along the road, but you may secure your bike onto fire grates provided at campsites, or to signs at parking areas.</p>",

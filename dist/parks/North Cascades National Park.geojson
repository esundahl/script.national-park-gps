There was once a suspension bridge over the gorge and there are a few remnant metal components on the forest floor, as well as the concrete abutments that anchored the bridge. Parts of the trail can be wet and muddy in spring and early summer.

It was homesteaded by Bill Buzzard in 1889 and then by the Buckner Family who lived there from 1910 until 1970. Now a historic district as part of Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, there are over 50 acres of apples trees and 15 buildings, representing the 1880s to the 1950s. Explore historic structures and farm equipment, views of McGregor Mountain and surrounding peaks, and the Stehekin River. Some buildings are closed to visitors for preservation. To learn the story of the Buckner Family, borrow a self-guided tour booklet found at two locations in the orchard (near the entrance next to a large concrete foundation and near the Buzzard Cabin).<br /> <br /> The National Park Service maintains Buckner Orchard as a working apple orchard today. If visiting during late summer or early fall, pick ripe apples to enjoy a taste of the orchard.<br /> <br /> Access the orchard by walking the 0.3 mile Buckner Lane immediately on the left (south) after crossing Rainbow Creek from Stehekin Landing. The trail follows the century-old hand-dug irrigation ditch that is still essential to the life of the orchard.

The trail climbs moderately to Howard Lake before it starts to switchback relentlessly. The hike is mostly forested in the beginning, with rocky outcrops offering occasional views. A good viewpoint lies approximately 2.9 miles (4.7 km) and a 2,100 foot climb (640 m) up on the trail from High Bridge, providing a great day-hiking destination.<br /> <br /> As you continue upward, the forest eventually begins to thin, giving way to talus slopes and more views. Seven miles (11.3 km) up the trail, Heaton Camp lies in a subalpine forest at 7,000 feet (2,130 m). Hikers who make it to this elevation can enjoy a bird's eye view of the Stehekin River Valley and the surrounding peaks, with all of the Glacier Peak Wilderness rising to the south. <br /> <br /> From Heaton Camp the trail continues for a short distance for continued great views, then the trail ends at an enormous talus slope. The summit looms 1,000 feet (330 m) above. Reaching the summit requires a hand-and-foot scramble up the talus slope and along exposed rocky ledges. Route-finding skills are essential. The most used route starts at the top of the talus field to the left of the summit. Look for faint, intermittent red arrows painted on the rocks marking the best way to proceed. A radio repeater is visible on the summit, providing a good landmark for those attempting to negotiate the summit route.<br /> <br /> <br /> To attempt the entire hike as a day trip, consider camping at High Bridge or Tumwater camps, backcountry permit required, before or after your trip. Shuttle layover times may not give most hikers time to complete the hike.<br /> <br /> The top 2 miles (3 km) may be under snow until August; check with rangers for current conditions.

Along the trail are many interpretive signs about the history, culture, and resources of Stehekin, along with descriptions of native trees and plants.<br /> <br /> The McKellar cabin was built in the early 1930s by Jack Blankenship, a local craftsman who built many homes and buildings in Stehekin, including the Golden West Lodge (now the Golden West Visitor Center) and the “House that Jack Built.” The McKellar cabin is typical of Stehekin log homes that date back to the late 1800s, using logs cleared from the site of the house.<br /> <br /> On the trail, visitors can find examples of conservation practices that connect Stehekin’s past Native American plant use and homesteading methods to the present. Learn about how log cabins were built, how people got their water, and how they disposed of their waste. Visitors will see remains of past utility structures and can read how it compares to Stehekin life and operations today.<br /> <br /> The trail runs next to buildings that are still being used as private residences.

Both a lower and upper viewpoint are a short walk from the parking lot. The lower viewpoint is wheelchair accessible.<br /> <br /> What had to happen for Rainbow Falls to roar down into Stehekin Valley? The answer lies in the different types of glaciers that carved these mountains and what was left behind.<br /> <br /> Taking turns during great ice ages during the past 2.6 million years, ice from both a massive continental glaciers stretching from an ice sheet in Canada and from smaller local valley glaciers shaped the mountains, valleys, and what became Lake Chelan. The ice from the continental ice sheet entered Stehekin Valley by flowing down through Rainbow Creek Valley above you. This massive ice sheet in Stehekin Valley cut more deeply than glaciers in smaller tributaries and as a result, tributaries like Rainbow Creek were left as hanging valleys.<br /> <br /> As the ice melted away, ancient Rainbow Creek became blocked by massive leftover boulders and gravel from the lobe of the continental ice sheet. The creek blindly cut through the rubble before it tumbled over the edge of a hanging valley to free fall to the Stehekin Valley floor, creating the waterfall we see today.",

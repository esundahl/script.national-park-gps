These trails can be accessed from the Mountain Creek Lodge (at the base of the tram at Pipestem Resort State Park).</p> <h4><br /> <strong>Directions to Trailhead</strong></h4> <p>The Bluestone Turnpike Trail is best accessed via one of two West Virginia State Parks that lie at each end, Bluestone State Park to the north and Pipestem Resort State Park to the south.

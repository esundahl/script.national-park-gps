North of the bridge was the White section, with a golf course, pool, and many fields and courts. South of the Bridge was the Black section, a much smaller area with only courts and fields. Anacostia Park during this time was a clear representation of the failure of “separate but equal”. Segregation in Anacostia Park ended in 1949. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3581bfbc-8e54-488b-9e1a-81a488cffd02}{185}\" paraid=\"982161653\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{3581bfbc-8e54-488b-9e1a-81a488cffd02}{189}\" paraid=\"783562066\">The 11th Street Bridge first opened in 1965. Its construction coincided with the Interstate Highway System introduced by President Eisenhower. DC followed the trend of improved urban planning and infrastructure happening nationwide. In 2009, the bridge underwent a major renovation almost 50 years since its initial construction. The DC Department of Transportation (DDOT) replaced the bridge. At the time, it was the most expensive project they ever completed with an estimated cost of over $450 million dollars. This bridge is one of several bridges that connect DC on the east and west sides of the Anacostia River. From the bridge, it overlooks Anacostia Park to the north and south. It is where the political boundary lines for DC wards 6 and 8 meet. The bridge is 931 feet in length. On the eastern side of the bridge, 11th street ends and becomes Martin Luther King Avenue. </p>",

You can do a 7.8 mile loop by crossing the Anacostia River and riding along the west bank or the river. You can also continue along the trail north to Bladensburg Park in Maryland, or south by going across one of the bridges into downtown DC to the Capitol Hill and Navy Yard neighborhoods.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{cbf3787d-d303-45ec-a1fa-ee27859c2d6f}{97}\" paraid=\"947513966\">Local attractions along the trail in Anacostia Park include the Anacostia Park Pavillion, where you can rent roller-skates from Memorial Day until Labor Day. The Anacostia Pool, tennis courts, basketball courts and many athletic fields provide the opportunity for sports and recreation. The trail connects other nearby areas to explore including the Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens, River Terrace Park, the Maine Avenue Fish Market and Wharf, Nationals Park, Historic Anacostia, and the Bladensburg Marina Park.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{cbf3787d-d303-45ec-a1fa-ee27859c2d6f}{103}\" paraid=\"44808534\">The newest portion of the riverwalk trail that extended Benning Road NE to the Bladensburg Trail was completed in 2016.

Led by Walter W. Walters, the veterans set up camps and occupied buildings in various locations in Washington, DC. The largest camp was a shantytown here on the Anacostia Flats, across the river from Washington's Navy Yard. By summer, at least 20,000 people had joined the camps. When a bill to give the veterans their payment early failed in Congress, many of the protesters moved on, but many also stayed, so President Hoover sent in the army - led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur - to push them out on July 28. The camp was still inhabited by about 10,000 people, who were driven off by the cavalry with tanks and tear gas while infantry set fire to the shanties. DC's hospitals were overwhelmed with the wounded. Deemed an operational success for the army, the political fallout was a disaster for President Hoover, who lost his re-election bid later that year.</p>",

The Seafarers is the oldest African American yacht club in the country. It was founded by Green, an art teacher in DC Public Schools, who enjoyed building boats in his free time. At first his application for the land was ignored, but after help from civil rights leader Mary McLeod Bethune, he was able to establish the club and rent the space. The Yacht Club is still thriving to this day and was an early advocate for stewarding the river. ",

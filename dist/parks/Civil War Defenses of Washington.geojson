Visitors frequently came to see them. The 15-inch Rodmans weigh about 49,000 pounds, and required 300 to 400 soldiers to move them up the bluff from river to fort. The balls fired by the smooth-bore Rodmans weigh 500 to 600 pounds and took about fifty pounds of black powder, a type of gunpowder.</p> <p>It was a special occasion each time the big guns were fired. On February 27, 1864, three shots were fired from the 15-inch Rodman. Crowds of visitors beheld the occasion. Again, on April 1, 1864, a large party from Washington came to witness the workings of the big guns. The Rodman was fired at a 25-degree elevation at a range of three miles. Because the guns put off an intense concussive force, it was noted that observers would raise their toes and open their mouths to lessen the effects.<br /> The cannon closest to the river is of particular importance. Engraved on its 15-inch muzzle is 'No. 1' and the initials 'TJR'. The 'No 1' is in reference to the fact that this cannon was the first produced by Cyrus Alger and Company. The initials are of the individual who inspected the gun, in this case Brigadier General Thomas J. Rodman who also designed the weapon. </p>",

With a combined total casualty figure of over 900 killed or wounded during the engagement, 40 of the Union soldiers who fought and died bravely in defense of the capital.

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. </p>",

Together with Fort Kearney and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-reno.htm\">Fort Reno</a> to the west, it controlled the country roads between Rockville Pike and Rock Creek Valley.</p> <p>It was built in 1861 by the 4th New York Heavy Artillery and named for the regiment's commander, Colonel Gustavus A. DeRussy. Fort DeRussy was sited upon high ground on the west bank of Rock Creek to control movement along and across the valley. The fort coordinated its fire with Fort Stevens on the east and Fort Kearny on the west. It was built originally in the shape of a trapezium, armed with 7 guns, and afterwards expanded to mount 11 guns and mortars, including a massive 100-pounder Parrott rifle located at reshaped northeastern angle</p> <p>The fort was heavily engaged during the Battle of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-stevens.htm\">Fort Stevens</a> on July 11-12, 1864. Fort DeRussy's provided battery support to Fort Stevens to the northeast and also engaged rebel infantry north of the Defenses of Washington.. Altogether, Fort DeRussy had 11 guns and mortars which fired a total of 109 rounds to aid in the defense of Fort Stevens. Its 100-pounder Parrott rifle was the largest piece of artillery in the engagement, and was very effective in checking the Confederates' advance. It had a range that reached nearly all the way to Silver Spring, Maryland, and could destroy large bodies of troops.</p> <p>Fort DeRussy is in a good state of preservation. The parapet which consists of high earth mounds with openings where guns were mounted, and the deep ditch (dry moat) around the parapet, remain in clear and distinct outline. Also, there is visible evidence of where the powder magazines were located inside the fort. Near the fort, on the outside, well-defined rifle trenches extend in each direction.<br />  </p>",

Constructiobn commenced between Ocotober and December of 1861, and \"completed\" in the spring of 1862. The fort was built to protect a critical Ridge<br /> Road (Alabama Avenue) intersection and was supported by Forts Meigs and Chaplin to the north and Fort Davis to the south.<br /> <br /> Fort DuPont was a regular hexagonal redoubt, designed for 14 guns, 12<br /> firing through embrasures. Fort Dupont had six sides, each 100 feet long, protected by a deep moat and trees felled side-by-side with branches pointing outward. It was named for Flag Officer Samuel F. Dupont, who commanded the naval victory at Port Royal, South Carolina, in November 1861.<br /> <br /> It was never a strong work and in 1862, a commission studying the Defenses of Washington noted that a deep ravine to the west of the fort should be covered by a blockhouse. At other times, traverses to cover the sally port, magazine and rifle pits to the cover approaches were recommended.</p> <p>In April 1864, Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer, advised the abandonment of Fort Dupont. The army officially abandoned the fort in 1865. The grounds reverted to its original landowner, Michael Caton. </p> <p>Although its garrison and guns never saw battle, Fort Dupont served as a lifeline of freedom. Runaway slaves found safety here before moving on to join the growing community of \"contrabands\" in Washington. The barracks and guns are gone, but the fort's earthworks can still be traced near the picnic area on Alabama Avenue.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the National Capital Planning Commission acquired the old fort and surrounding land for recreation. A golf course was constructed and as the city grew, golf gave way in 1970 to the sports complex along Ely Place that now includes tennis and basketball courts, athletic fields, a softball diamond, and an indoor ice rink.  Once where soldiers viewed farmlands, park visitors now grow fruits and vegetables in the community garden.</p>",

Stanton appointed a commission to examine the efficiency of the Defenses of Washington. The commision evaluated each of the forts, and made recommendations for improvement. Toward the end of the account, one gap was noted in the defensive arrangement:</span></p> <p>\"The commission furthers their opinion that the Defense of Washington cannot be considered complete without the defense of the river against an enemy's armed vessels. Foreign intervention would bring against us always in superior naval force on the Potomac, and we are, even now, threatened with Confederate iron-clads fitted in English Ports. The Commission believe on Jones' Point near Alexandria, a battery of six guns of the heaviest caliber, say four 200-pounders and two 15-inch guns in casements, and by constructing a battery of ten guns and a covering work on the opposite shore of the Potomac, at the near Roziers Bluff. An examination had been made, revealing a most favorable and strong position on that side, easily communicated with by water. Surveys are in progress.\"</p> <p>The suggestion of the committee was accepted, and the work on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fofo/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Fort Foote</a> began at Rozier's Bluff in 1863. </p> <p>The grand earthwork was first constructed in 1863 by the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, commanded by Colonel William Seward, Jr. The site, together with Battery Rodgers in Alexandria, Virginia, was designed for river defense. Their massive 15-inch Rodman guns (Columbiads) and 200-pounder Parrott rifles possessed the firepower to penetrate enemy ironclad ships. The Federal engineers had perfected earthwork construction around Washington D.C. by this point in the war. Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer Defenses of Washington, described the two sites as \"model works.\"Fort Foote was named in honor of Rear Admiral Andrew H. Foote, who distinguished himself in the actions against the confederate forts on the Mississippi Rivers and died of wounds on June 26,1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote's guns became a tourist attraction for government officials, military officers, and well-connect civilians, who traveled on river transports from the city to the Maryland shoreline to see the 49,000 lbs Rodmans test fired. General Barnard invited President Abraham Lincoln to visit the fort in late 1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote remained an active military installation until 1874. The U.S. Army performed a number of tests and experiments with cannons, carriages, and stone magazines at the site. <br /> <br />  </p> <p><span> </span></p>",

Barnard, Chief Engineer, \"the chain of works (ten in all) from Fort Meigs to Fort Greble occupies the summit of the ridge between the Eastern Branch and Oxon Creek from almost all points at which, in this distnace of 6 miles, an enemy can bring batteries to bear upon the navy-yard or arsenal.\"<br /> <br /> Fort Greble was constructed as an octagonal redoubt with a perimeter of 350 years. Construction began in September 1861, but was not formally complete until 1864. The fort mounted 17 cannons and mortars. The earthwork was named in honor of Lieutenant John T. Greble, killed at the Battle of Big Bethel in Virginia on July 10, 1861. </p> <p>The two sites were located on densely wooded land, thereby providing sufficient lumber for the construction of the Fort Greble. Their plateau locations enabled them to lay down a withering cross-fire between them. To deter the possible advance of the enemy through the wooded hills surrounding the sites, civilian construction gangs cleared paths which could be raked from the guns of the forts</p> <p> </p>",

The earthwork was built to guard the approaches to Benning's Bridge, which crosses the Anacostia River.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was irregularly shaped with nine sides, and a perimeter of 354 yards. This fort was located less than mile east of Benning's Bridge and commanded the approaches to the bridge from Bladensburg via the Eastern Branch Road, and from Upper Marlboro by way of Benning Road.</p> <p>Over the next four years it underwent extensive repair and modification. The major problem with the fort was that it sat atop a rounded hill, and approaches to it were not visible from the parapet. To fix this problem 400 yards of rifle pits were constructed to cover its approaches. Structures were built that would provide a full range on which to attack oncoming troops (bastionets). These structures were projected from three angles of the exterior slope of the ditch (counterscarp) to provide reverse and covering fire for the exterior slopes. After Early's raid in 1864, the engineers laid abatis and constructed rifle trenches toward Anacostia River in order to prevent a flanking movement from that side.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was one of the later forts to be abandoned. At the end of the Civil War, Fort Mahan was named among the 11 works that occupied commanding positions and should be retained for a skeleton defense of the city. However, it was abandoned and reverted back to the Manning family. Mary Manning claimed damages in 1864, and in 1865 bought the abatis around the fort for $31 at public auction.</p> <p>Structures that were built at Fort Mahan included a guard house, at least two barracks, officers' quarters, a mess house, stables and some sheds.</p> <p><span>Fort Mahan was named after Dennis Hart Mahan. who was an American soldier and educator. In 1824, he graduated from West Point. He taught taught civil and military engineering at the Military Academy, and became an authority on military engineering. His works include: Complete Treatise on Field Fortifications (1836), Summary on the Cause of Permanent Fortifications and of the Attack and Defense of Permanent Works (1850), and An Elementary Course of Military Engineering (2 vol., 1866–67). </span></p>",

Construction began in 1861. When Fort Marcy was completed, it had a perimeter of 338 feet and mounted 18 guns, a 10-inch mortar and two 24-pounder Coehorn mortars.</p> <p>The hill on which the fort is located was known as Prospect Hill. Originally the fort was called Fort W.F. Smith after Major General William F. Smith, the troops of whose division began construction of the work. His division crossed Chain Bridge on the night of September 24, 1861, and immediately commenced construction of Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen. The 79th New York Highlanders, the 141st Pennsylvania and the Iron Brigade also helped complete the work in the fall of 1862. A force of about 500 contrabands were employed. The 152nd New York worked on the entrenchments, which are still in a very good state of preservation. The site of Fort Marcy is near the location where the famous, but bloodless duel between Henry Clay and John Randolph was fought in 1826.</p> <p>The fort was not entirely completed until the fall of 1862. It is a relatively undisturbed fort and was named in honor of a native of Massachusetts, the Honorable Randolph B. Marcy, a distinguished soldier, father-in-law, and Chief of Staff to Gen. George B. McClellan. Detachments of the 4th New York Heavy Artillery, 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and the 130th Pennsylvania infantry were among the troops that performed garrison duty here during the war. An interesting incident of history is that the body of troops, which afterwards became famous, and the \"Iron Brigade\" was originated at this fort in the summer of 1861. It was composed of the 19th Indiana, the 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin Regiments. The 24th Michigan was added to the brigade soon after the battle of South Mountain. These regulars remained together until the close of the war.</p> <p>After the Civil War ended Fort Marcy was returned to its original owners, the Vanderwerken family. The land remained in the Vanderwerken family until after World War II, when the DeLashmutt family purchased the property.</p> <p><span>\"</span>Thoughts on Fort Marcy,<span>\" is a poem written by Lillian Money-Read that was published in the </span><em>The Washington Post</em><span>, April 12, 1936.

        "name": "Fort Reno",
        "notes": "Fort Reno\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/fort-reno.htm\n\n<p>Fort Reno was originally named Fort Pennsylvania, and was built during the winter of 1861 shortly after the disastrous defeat of the Union Army at the First Battle of Manassas. Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard, Col. of Engineers, U.S. Army, was in charge of construction of the defenses around Washington. Barnard chose the location of Fort Reno for its strategic importance in guarding the Rockville Pike (present day Wisconsin Avenue). Being the highest elevation in the city (429 feet above sea level), Fort Reno also served as a forward outpost and signal station for detecting enemy movement near the northern part of the city.</p> <p>Constructed by the 119th Pennsylvania Regiment, the fort's name was later changed to Fort Reno in 1863 in memory of Major General Jesse Lee Reno, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of South Mountain, September 14, 1862. <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Originally rather small, Fort Reno was enlarged and strengthened with an advanced battery 300 yards north from the highest ridge, across from what is now Fessenden Street and along 39th Street. This advanced battery had eight 12-pounder guns and a magazine, a covered walkway connected it to the main fort to the south. A double line of rifle trenches was added to strengthen the position.</span></p> <p>Eventually, the fort was the largest and strongest of those defending the capital with a dozen heavy guns, three Parrott siege guns and nine 27-pounder barbette guns. A strength of three thousand men of the First Brigade made Fort Reno the stronghold of the northern defenses of the capital.</p> <p>In July 1864, due to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's insistence that troops be moved from the defenses to reinforce his army at Petersburg, Fort Reno was under-manned, as were all of the defenses around the city. Hearing from spies that the capital was poorly defended, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Gen. Jubal A. Early to attack from the north. Around noon Monday, July 11, 1864 (before the Battle of Fort Stevens), Fort Reno was the first of the defenses to view Early's advance near Rockville, Maryland. The lookouts from the signal tower at Fort Reno saw clouds of dust, and then Confederate army wagons moving toward the city.</p> <p>During Early's assault of Fort Stevens on July 11th and 12th, 1864, the heavy guns of Fort Reno lent little support value, as there was a fear the long range guns would hit the Union Army's advanced pickets. One of the shells that was fired from Fort Reno by a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle traveled 3.5 miles north of the fort, killing four Confederates where the present day Bethesda Naval Hospital is located in Bethesda, Maryland. Due to Fort Stevens being reinforced on July 12, 1864, it was never taken by the Confederate army, nor was the capital city ever reached.</p> <p>During the fighting of July 10-12, 1864, small squadrons of soldiers from Forts Reno and Stevens had advanced into the countryside north of the city to fend off the invaders. A few Confederates were taken prisoner and brought back to camps where they were held until transfer to a central prison. Early's army retreated back across the Potomac River near Leesburg, Virginia, and Washington breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>After the close of the war, the forts (Reno included) were slowly dismantled and abandoned. Most of Fort Reno could be seen as late as 1892, but the fort and battery at the north end were eventually graded down for the construction of a water reservoir. Today the site is bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Fessenden Street, Belt Road, and Chesapeake Street, NW.</p>",

Originally called Fort Massachusetts by the soldiers from that state who constructed the fort, it was later named after Brig. Gen. Isaac Ingalls Stevens, who was killed at the Battle of Chantilly (Ox Hill), Virginia, September 1, 1862.<br /> <br /> By the summer of 1864, the great bulk of Union troops in the east were engaged in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/index.htm\">siege operations around Petersburg, Virginia</a>. In fact, when Ulysses S. Grant moved south in the Spring of 1864, he stripped Washington, DC, of many well trained troops to add weight to his offensive. As a result, in July of 1864, there were only 9,000 troops to defend the city, down from over 23,000 the year before. Those that were left were primarily poorly trained reserves. Robert E. Lee was desperate to reduce the pressure on his forces around Petersburg, and so decided to send General Jubal A. Early and about 20,000 troops to strike at Washington which spies had reported was poorly defended.<br /> <br /> On June 12, Early began his march north from Petersburg and by July 9, was at Frederick, Maryland, where he demanded and received $200,000 to spare the city. On the same day, Early <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/index.htm\">defeated Union Gen. Lew Wallace at the Monocacy River</a>. In the light of later events, Wallace's defeat after a stubborn fight became a victory for the Union because he was able to delay Early's advance for a day. On July 10, Early encamped at Rockville, Maryland, only 10 miles from Fort Stevens.<br /> <br /> Reacting to this threat to Washington, Grant ordering the 1st and d 2nd Divisions of the 6th Corps and part of 19th Corps to the capital on July 7. The veteran units reached Fort Stevens arrived off the Potomac River around noon on July 11 as Jubal Early's lead elements advanced toward the capital.<br /> <br /> Over the following several days, Early probed Fort Stevens and its environs but never mounted a full-scale attack. Union reinforcements had reached Washington and Fort Stevens just in time.<br /> <br /> Located atop the parapet of Fort Stevens is a commemorative stone dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>. On July 12, 1864, the President stood atop the parapet to observe the fighting and came under fire from Confederate sharpshooters. It is the only time in American history in which a sitting president came under direct fire from an enemy combatant.<br /> <br /> In the years to come, many individuals would claim the honor of advising the President Lincoln to come down from the parapet. The most notable was a young officer named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. His remarks to the president were short and straightforward: \"Get down, you damn fool!\" Holmes would eventually serve as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902-1932.<br /> <br /> Each year, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cwdw/planyourvisit/anniversary-of-the-battle-of-fort-stevens.htm\">anniversary of the Battle of Fort Stevens</a> is commemorated with special programs, living history, and more.</p>",

The earthen citadels that encircled the capital had long been abandoned by Federal soldiers. Peace, posterity, and the ploughshare returned much of the landscape to its pre-war condition, including Fort Stevens, site of the famed battle in July 1864. Early preservation efforts included the installation of a sign marking the spot where President Abraham Lincoln was under fire on July 12, 1864.<br /> <br /> Fort Stevens' eroding earthworks were a lasting testament to the Defenses of Washington as the Brightwood neighborhood developed around it. <br /> <br /> As part of the McMillan Plan, a comprehensive planning document for the development of the monumental core and the park system of Washington, D.C (first written in 1902 by the Senate Park Commission), the proposed Fort Drive Parkway consisted of \"a new drive-way through the suburbs of Washington to be called 'Fort Drive,' and include in its winding ways some of the most important of the fortifications which served as the Defenses of Washington during the rebellion . . .\"<br /> <br /> Rapid urban expansion and budget restraints, including the First World War and Great Depression, affected the full development of the parkway; however the Federal government was able to acquire most of the Fort Drive right-of-way between 1929 and 1932, and the forts/batteries managed by the National Park Service today.<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) accomplished a great deal of work on the fort parks. The CCC established nine camps in the Washington D.C. area, including one, established on October 23, 1933, at Fort Dupont Park. The CCC activities at Fort Dupont included erecting buildings for workers to live and eat in, cleaning up foot and horse trails, performing minor road construction, putting in a sewer, and constructing a two-car garage, carpenter shop, and toilet room. The CCC also performed \"forest protection,\" including cleaning up dead and fallen lumber, burning brush, grubbing stumps, cleaning up the dump, and disposing of trash at forts Stanton, Bunker Hill and Mahan, and doing general cleanup at forts Totten and Foote. At Fort Stevens, the CCC undertook a restoration, reconstruction, and landscape project; costing $25,000. The workers rebuilt the western portion of the fort parapet, using cement \"falsies,\" as one author called them, \"instead of logs and planks,\" because they would last longer.<br /> <br /> The work at Fort Stevens was completed in 1938. It was the only fortification restoration project. Today, Fort Stevens Park is managed by the National Park Service (Rock Creek Park).</p>",

Joining the National Park Service in 1946, the park continues to protect the Potomac River.</p> <hr /> <p>Fort Washington was the only fort protecting the approach to Washington, D.C. at the time of the War of 1812.</p> <p>When a British invasion fleet entered the Cheseapeake Bay in the Summer of 1814, the American Secretary of War did not believe Washington D.C. a valuable enough target to warrant a British attack, and so he declined to make adequate preparations for the defense of the nation's capital. </p> <p>Fort Washington was left understaffed and ill-equipped while British troops landed and engaged American defenders at Bladensburg, Maryland. After routing the Americans, British forces entered Washington and burned its public buildings. Fort Washington (sometimes referred to at the time as Fort Warburton), was soon abandoned and destroyed in order to prevent its capture by the enemy. </p> <p>After the conclusion of the War of 1812, the United States recognized the need for a more thorough and modern coastal defense system, and many new masonry forts were constructed. Fort Washington, recognized as the key position defending Washington D.C., was repaired and updated, and remained an active defensive works until well into the twentieth century.</p>",

The artillery could punch through the 10-inch, or 25-centimeter, hull in an ironclad Confederate ship. <h3>Tactile caption (tactile not shown)</h3> Feel the mass of a 15-inch, or 35-centimeter, cannon ball.

The gunner called out orders for the crew below to adjust the aim: “Left. Stop. Elevate!” The wheels of the massive gun turned toward its target. Pulling a long lanyard ignited the friction primer.

In 1861, the Union capital city was an easy target if Confederate ships sailed up the Potomac River. In just two years, a protective ring of over 60 forts sprouted around the city. Fort Foote, perched here on Rozier’s Bluff, was built with haste in eight months. The fort’s claim to fame was its high-tech coastal artillery—but its cutting-edge cannons were never tested in battle.<br /> <br /> “We are putting up an extensive water battery…which may be an object of interest to you: the excursion on the water is pleasant & the locality a beautiful one.”<br /> - John G. Barnard, Engineer, US Army to Abraham Lincoln, August 13, 1863 <h3>Inset map caption:</h3> Fort Foote is the southernmost defensive site. The Union also built 93 gun batteries, 20 miles, or 32 kilometers, of rifle pits, and 32 miles, or 51 kilometers, of military roads around its capital.",

On Fort Foote’s flat hiking trails, you can follow Lincoln’s footsteps and conduct your own inspection.<br /> <br /> “The site selected for the fortification is a very steep bluff 100 feet, or 30 meters, high, 4 miles, or 6 kilometers, from Alexandria, 8 miles, or 13 kilometers, from Washington … It was to be the only defense between Fort Washington and the District line. It proved to be one of the very largest of the cordon of forts which encircled the city.” - Alfred Seelye Roe, Union soldier and historian <h3>Image caption:</h3> The fort’s namesake is Rear Admiral Andrew Hull Foote, who died in 1863. He is known for his heroic actions on the Mississippi River. <h3>Image caption:</h3> Students and scouts used the site in the early 1900s.

In the classic story of plant succession, lichen spores carried on the wind are among the first life forms to return to the barren landscape after the glacier ice melts away. Landing on rocks, the lichen spores anchored themselves to the rock, and began to break down the rock surface making it possible for mosses to find purchase. Moss further breaks down the rock into soil making it possible for flowering plants and trees to move in. Alder helps put nitrogen into the soil making it possible for bigger trees to grow, like quick growing willows and cottonwoods. Later, spruce seeds germinate in the alder-leaf litter and, once they emerge into sunlight, they also grow rapidly. The spruce trees grow to great heights and will eventually crowd out the other trees. This process of each organism preparing the land for the one that follows is called succession. However, it is not always as systematic as that. If a spore or seed arrives in an area and finds what it needs to live, it will grow.</p>",

Much of the waters around the Beardslees are non-motorized from 5/1-9/15 and some islands deems critical wildlife habitat are off-limits for landings and/or close approaches by anyone for part or all of the year.

Forming a backdrop to the area are two coastal mountain ranges, the stark glaciated Barbazon Range and the heavily vegetated Deception Hills. Beyond these tower the highest coastal mountains in the world, the Fairweather and St.Elias Ranges. Less than twenty miles from the Gulf, 15,300 foot Mt. Fairweather rises prominently over the area.</p> <p>Five miles from sea, the Alsek River breaks into meandering channels fanning out over an 80 square mile delta, know locally as Dry Bay. The name \"Dry Bay\" derives from the fact portions of the delta became dry at ebb tide and when river levels are low. The Alsek is becoming shallower due to silting and glacial rebound which causes the land to rise.Where large ocean-going cannery tenders could sail 60 years ago, Dry Bay fisherman must navigate carefully or risk running aground in small skiffs.</p> <h3>Sport Fishing and Hunting</h3> <p>Sport fishing and hunting remain popular activities in Dry Bay for local residents and visitors alike. Unlike National Parks where hunting is prohibited, the taking of game, in accordance with state laws and federal regulations, is <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/planyourvisit/hunting.htm\">authorized within the Preserve</a>. Sportsmen may utilize any of the three lodges that provide accommodations, or make reservations for the Park Service public use cabin located on the banks of the East Alsek River.

Numerous tidewater glaciers in the region contributed to the ice-choked conditions of the strait, forcing the ship to deploy longboats from its deepwater anchroage at Port Althorp. The men aboard these longboats, commanded by Lt. Joseph Whidbey, sought refuge from the ice in side bays as they pushed their way inland. Aboard <em>Discovery</em>, Cptn. Vancouver described the following report of the longboats' July 11th explorations:<br /> <br /> \"[In one bay] the party advanced nearly in a north-west direction about 2 leagues, where their further progress was nearly stopped by shoals, rocky islets, and rocks, extending across the branch, which decreased to about a mile in width, and for the space of about two miles, was occupied by these iselets and rocks...\"<br /> <br /> Captain Vancouver named a prominent point adjacent to this bay <em>Point Dundas</em> after Henry Dundas, Secretary of State for War under King George III of England. The bay itself remained without an English name until 1879 when it was named Dundas Bay, apparently after the point, by William H. Dall of the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey. In 1900, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/alaska-cannery-dundas-bay-cannery-glba.htm\">Dundas Bay Cannery</a> was built and operated on the bay's shore until its closure in 1931. The remains of the cannery can still be found here.<br /> <br /> Today, Dundas Bay remains a popular destination for boaters to explore the shoals, rocky islets, and rocks first described by Cpt. Vancouver in 1794.",

It is possible that this pond is in the process of changing into \"muskeg,\" which is a spongy, wet bog. As muskeg is highly acidic, it is difficult for things to grow.

Studying the mountain peaks, some are rounded on top, while others have jagged, sharp peaks. Some of the rocks exhibit deep scratches that were etched by past glaciers. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/nature/anatomy-of-a-glacier.htm\">Learn the anatomy of a Glacier on our website.</a><br /> <br /> This is a young landscape, only about 100 years old. Before that the land was locked under a massive glacier. That thick glacier would have rounded off the lower peaks, while those sharp peaks would have been sticking up above the glacier, like islands of rock. You can read the landscape to see the height of the glacier in the past. Look up to the place where rounded rock gives way to jagged peaks – that was the height of the glacier, about 1 mile thick.<br /> In some ways, a glacier is Nature’s bulldozer, pushing and reshaping everything in its path. Clearing the landscape and preparing it for future stories. <br /> <br /> The valleys tell the story of glacial carving. As glaciers grow they slowly flow down the mountains picking up rocks and debris along the way. These imbedded rocks act like a giant rasp grinding away the mountains at the sides and below the glacier.  <br /> As the climate changes and the glaciers lose their source of snow, it will retreat back into the mountains, leaving behind a wide U-shaped valley. In many cases, the valley becomes a river system, and the river carries debris out into the waterway, forming a delta of land. <br /> <br /> Traveling through Glacier Bay, other marks upon the land tell the tale of glacial carving.</p> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/geology/glacial-landforms.htm\">See more on Glaciers and Glacial Landforms. </a></h4>",

Glaciers are made from snow – lots of snow. The Gulf of Alaska, one of the stormiest places in the Pacific Ocean is just 30 miles to the west of the glacier bay fjord. Between the fjord and the ocean is one of the highest coastal mountain ranges in the world – the Fairweather Mountains. Now imagine what happens when those Gulf of Alaska storms filled with ocean moisture crash into a 15,000 foot mountain range - snow flies, lots of it. An estimated 100 to 150 feet or 30 – 45 meters of snow fall each year on the Fairweather Range. The combination of low temperatures at high altitude and the massive amount of snowfall creates a condition where the ice and snow does not melt away in the summer months. Year after year snow builds up and compresses into solid ice – Glacier Ice.<br /> <br /> Now, there is a third vital component – time. Time for the snowflakes to amass and compress into ice. Time for the dense, compact ice to overflow and move downhill by the force of gravity. Time to form rivers of ice. <br /> <br /> Glaciers are essentially rivers of ice. They creak and groan as they move downhill. Some reach the ocean at sealevel, called tidewater glaciers, where they break off and form icebergs. Others flow in valleys or cling to mountainsides. <br /> Glacier Bay has thousands of glaciers, all remnants of the one massive sheet that covered Glacier Bay 300 years ago. The number of glaciers in Glacier Bay is decreasing, due to the continued diminishing of glacial ice as global temperatures rise, reducing habitat condusive to the formation of glaciers.</p>",

The rock type - slightly metamorphosed limestone with high concentrations of dolomite - inhibits vegetation growth. With limited vegetation, we an see the clues to Gloomy Knobs geologic past. Long, grey, wavy, layered lines indicate that this rock formed underwater. In fact, fossil remnants indicate that this rock formed on the ocean floor in the tropical equator! Through plate tectonic action, the rock journeys northwest, smashed into the north American continent, and was pushed above sea level. Other stripes indicate another geologic event - the gouges, grooves and scratches, called striations, are evidence of glaciers flowing over Gloomy Knob and carving scratches in the rock like sandpaper scratching wood.</p> <h4>Flora and Fauna</h4> <p>The lack of vegetation reveals clues to Gloomy Knob's history, though there is enough to support an animal uniquely adapted to the rocky cliffs - mountain goats. Their flexible hooves and strong legs help them balance and leap along the cliff ledges. The glacially carved cliffs provide protection from their predators, bears and wolves. Nanny goats will have their kids in the early summer along protected cliff ledges, though by late summer mountain goats typically move to higher mountains for the alpine vegetation. The mountain goats are particularly vulnerable to climate change, since they rely on cool temperatures and accessible alpine vegetation. As temperatures warm, as the temperatures warm, plants become less nutritious and tree growth reduces alpine habitat. Yet, the cliffs of Gloomy Knob offer extraordinary habitat under the water too.</p> <h4>Underwater World</h4> <p>The steep vertical cliffs plunge underwater, creating habitat for a unique plant - cold-water coral. Imagine forests of coral fronds, over 2 meters tall, waving in the ocean current, catching the abundant plankton in these productive waters. The coral provides refuge for a wide variety of fish. The depth of this fjord - nearby the depth is 1300’ - combined with the dramatic ocean tides and the fresh-water melt from the glaciers creates a dynamic ocean environment that supports a diversity of life.</p>",

It splits at lower elevations, with a substantial amount of ice flowing across the border into what is now known as Glacier Bay. The Grand Pacific is the main glacier credited with carving out Glacier Bay. In the past 250 years it has receded to the head of Tarr Inlet, where the terminus is no longer tidewater. The ice has been thinning for the past few decades. The western two thirds of the ice in the terminus of the Grand Pacific Glacier now comes from the tributary Ferris Glacier. Rock debris from landslides and medial moraines cover much of the lower ice. Where this rock debris is more than an inch thick, it insulates the ice, slows melting and results in a thicker ice mass than where the ice is clean. In many areas on the glacier, the debris is more than three feet thick. / John Muir named the glacier in 1879. At that time the massive ice face reached south to what is now known as Russell Island. When Harry Fielding Reid visited the bay in 1892 he discovered that the front of the glacier had receded so far it had split into three different glaciers. He retained the name, Grand Pacific, for the most northernly glacier. He named the middle glacier, Johns Hopkins. In 1899, those aboard the Harriman Expedition named the smallest most southernly glacier the Reid.</p>",

Land that once was within the tidal zone is now high and dry. Where grasses once predominated, spruce trees now tower. Early settlers called the town Strawberry Point.</p> <p>Historically, the area was used by the Tlingit people for seasonal harvesting and smoking of salmon. The first successful homestead patent was issued in 1923, although settlers were present here as early as 1917. According to historical records, through \"hope and hard work,\" several families successfully homesteaded here. The U.S. Postal Service renamed the town in 1925, when the first Post Office was established here.</p> <p>Today, the community of Gustavus spreads across the rising flatlands, with the hub of the spokes at Four Corners. A unique community of interesting people, Gustavus offers a full range of accommodations and plenty of adventures for travelers.The surrounding mountains make a wonderful backdrop to the surprisingly flat terrain. With a year round population of approximately 450 people, Gustavus is a small Alaskan town surrounded by breathtaking scenery and extensive wilderness.<br /> <br /> <em>*Location Note:</em> The lat/long location chosen for this point is the Gustavus airport.

These stumps are left over from forests that thrived prior to the last ice age. As the glacier that carved Glacier Bay advanced, these trees were sheared to their stumps, covered by thick ice and sediment, and then exposed once more as the glacier retreated.</p> <h3><em>The oldest interstadial stump found in Glacier Bay is a 9,400-year-old specimen from upper Muir Inlet</em></h3>   <p>Glacier Bay is the largest known repository in North America of interstadial wood from the Holocene period—the geological epoch that began at the end of the Pleistocene about 11,700 years ago and continues today. Delving into this storehouse of data, the researchers seek to reconstruct the paleoclimate and the highly complex sequence of glacial advance and retreat during the Holocene in the Glacier Bay region. A 1,500-year-long “master” chronology from Prince William Sound correlates well with chronologies from Glacier Bay. Tree-ring records from living trees have been correlated with meteorological records from Sitka dating back to the 1830s. Data suggests that at least six cycles of glacial advance and recession have occurred within the last 5,200 years in Glacier Bay. Probably none of these except the neoglacial (most recent) advanced all the way to the mouth of the bay. Advance and retreat in the west and east arms of the bay occurred asynchronously. Almost all the interstadial wood in Glacier Bay is Sitka spruce or western hemlock. The oldest in situ (rooted in place) interstadial stump found in Glacier Bay is a 9,400-year-old specimen from upper Muir Inlet. The Sitka spruce had been growing for 200 years when it was buried in sediment deposited by advancing ice. Twigs found in Reid Inlet were dated to 13,770 years ago.<br /> Dan Lawson is a researcher studying past ice ages and interstadial wood. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/historicglacieractivityinglacierbay.htm\">Read a summary of his work in Glacier Bay here.</a></p>",

The true story has been lost, but this spot is special for a jaw-dropping number of reasons:</em></h3> <h4>The view of Johns Hopkins Glacier</h4> On a clear day, this spot unveils one of the most stunning vistas in the park, Johns Hopkins Glacier surrounded by peaks of the Fairweather Mountains. In this narrow inlet, majestic mountains rise tall, glaciers tumble to the sea, and icebergs dot the waters. It’s magnificent. <h4>The geology</h4> From Jaw Point you can practically see the geographic creation of Alaska, a landscape driven by immense energies. This is a result of the area's position astride the active collision zone between the North American and Pacific plates. This major plate boundary, the Fairweather-Queen Charlotte Fault system cuts across Glacier Bay's western edge. For over 50 million years, the Pacific Plate and Yakutat Microplate have been moving northwest along this fault boundary and plowing obliquely into the North American Plate at about the speed your fingernails grow, or about 50 millimeters per year.Generally, during this collision, the Pacific plate has been forced under the North America plate, but occasional “bits” such as island arcs, pieces of sea floor, fragments of continental margin have been scraped off one plate or the other, shattered, and smeared along the leading edge of North American plate. These geologic bits are called “terranes.” Four such terranes have accumulated in a largely northwest-southeast pattern to form the Glacier Bay region. At Jaw Point you can see several kinds of rocks in close proximity, the “suture zone” where two terranes met. <h4>Harbor Seal Nursery Entrance</h4> Harbor seals haul out on the ice bergs in front of Johns Hopkins Glacier to give birth and nurse pups. These icy platforms are a safe perch for mothers to raise their young. If boats traveled among the ice bergs and scared the seals, mothers and pups could be separated. To protect harbor seals, all vessels, from kayaks to cruise ships, travel no further than Jaw Point until after the pups are weaned in mid-summer. Jaw Point is a memorable spot for Glacier Bay visitors, whether they come for the geology, the views, the wildlife, or all three.",

The ice front extends under sea level, to a depth of approximately 200 feet, where an underwater moraine protects the deepest extent of the glacial ice like armor against the warm ocean water. Formed from numerous tributary glaciers, the length of Johns Hopkins glacier is about 12 miles from the source in the Fairweather Mountain peaks. The tributary glaciers contribute rocks scraped off the mountainsides along the main glacier. These stripes of rock, called lateral moraines, join at glacial intersection, creating racing stripes along the length of the glacier, called medial moraines. The debris in these moraines can be seen in the ice face and extending up-glacier as prominent black bands. This debris is transported in and on the ice and released either by melting of the ice face or calving of icebergs into Johns Hopkins Inlet. Melt-water from the glacier is discharged from submarine tunnels located near both the eastern and western edges of the glacier, carrying ground up rock referred to as glacial flour, creating a design of muddy brown fresh water mixing with the clearer salt water. Sometimes this water emerges at the inlet surface as fountains. Black legged kittiwakes are commonly seen diving, floating, and feeding where the meltwater upwells along the ice face and harbor seals are often seen basking in safety on top of the ice bergs throughout the inlet.</p>",

Descending as an arm from the Brady Icefield, Lamplugh's glacial ice is becoming increasingly susceptible to ice loss as temperatures rise due to anthropogenic climate change. Another noticeable impact of changing climate is the black blanket of a landslide covering Lamplugh glacier a few miles from its face. In 2015, a massive landslide dropped approximately 120 million metric tons of rock onto the glacier. The weight of rock altered the \"internal plumbing\" of meltwater within the glacier, impacting ice flow. The flow of ice still carries the burden of rock down to sea level, where the debris will be deposited.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Lamplugh is fed by the Brady Icefield, which lies east of the Fairweather Range. As temperatures warm and snow levels rise, the Brady Icefield accumulation areas appear to be shrinking year after year. Lamplugh's face is receding by calving in the central and eastern parts of its ice face at rates estimated to be around 50 to 100 feet per year. The western third of the terminus is grounded, and only at the highest high tides does saltwater reach the western-most edge of the ice face. A large subglacial stream flows from the central part of the terminus, often creating large caves in the face of the glacier. Such subglacial streams discharge large volumes of sediment-rich water into the fjord, filling the small embayment at ice's edge with brown and tan milky water. Since 2010, outwash has built up extensive mudflats along the entire face of the glacier. Wildlife, such as moose, bear and marmots, are occasionally seen traversing in front of the glacier, utilizing the new land. Pioneer plants and shrubs are covering the land recently exposed by diminishing ice.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> In Glacier Bay, it is difficult to separate the natural from the human caused in such a complex place such as this. We know that, examined from a global perspective, the melting of the glaciers may pose serious challenges for our species and others in the future. And yet, in this sanctuary of Glacier Bay, we can still stand in awe of nature’s power to heal and regenerate in the face of dramatic change.</p>",

The glacier is picturesque in setting, carving a steep valley through towering mountain peaks, and ending dramatically at the edge of the sea. Since it reaches all the way to ocean water, Margerie Glacier is referred to as a tidewater glacier, defined as a glacier that interacts with ocean saltwater. Margerie glacier is about 21 miles long, originating in the Fairweather Mountain Range at elevations exceeding 9000 feet. Due to the abundance of snow in the mountains and the steepness of slope, the ice of Margerie Glacier flows relatively quickly, estimated to flow about 2000 feet per year, or about 6 feet per day. The glacier does not expand out into the fjord since it rests on an underwater ledge, so the ice falls into the ocean in a process called calving, breaking into icebergs. The icebergs become resting spots for harbor seals, sea otters, black-legged kittiwake gulls and other birds.<br /> <br /> Where the ocean water is disturbed by meltwater streams and calving icebergs, flocks of black-legged kittiwake gulls swarm and glean small fish from the surface. In recent decades, Margerie’s terminus was relatively stable in position, maintaining an equal balance of ice growth through snow accumulation in the mountains and ice loss due to melting in lower elevations and calving. However, in 1998 the northern third of the terminus began a noticeable recession, forming a small embayment within the ice face.<br /> <br /> Over the past several years, this part of the terminus has thinned and the embayment has expanded. In 2017, this section experienced dramatic changes with deep embayments and a large mass of bedrock now exposed. Also of note is new bedrock exposed along the sides of the glacier, as the glacier diminishes in height. Margerie, like all glaciers, changes in response to its environment, local interactions with ocean water, regional influences of snowfall, and global temperature changes. The view of Margerie Glacier is constantly changing, different from moment to moment, sculpted by daily calving and seasonal flow.</p>",

The first moose was spotted here in the late 1960s. Despite their tremendous size (bulls can weigh 1,600 pounds and cows 1,300 pounds), they can appear and disappear in thick brush with surprising stealth. Moose are usually solitary, except for cows with calves and during the fall rutting season. Cows give birth in the spring to one or two small, reddish calves. A calf will stay with its mother for two years before the cow drives it off as she prepares to have more young. Their diet includes willow leaves, grasses, herbs, and aquatic vegetation.

After spending a few field seasons here he was amazed and awestruck by this wild intact landscape. He described it as a place where “Mountain, glacier, water, forest, and animal life combine to make an ensemble unexcelled”. He and the Ecological Society of America petitioned President Calvin Coolidge to make Glacier Bay part of the new National Park Service, as a National Monument in 1925.

Towering over the tall trees of Bartlett Cove at the Glacier Bay park headquarters, Mount Fairweather is unmistakable from over 70 miles away. <h4>Elevation Statistics</h4> Measuring 15,266 ft. in elevation, Mount Fairweather is the 6<sup>th</sup> most prominent peak in North America, making it one of the largest coastal mountains in the world. When seen from sea level, the peak rises to a staggering summit, making tall mountains look like foothills beneath it. Mt Fairweather is the 18<sup>th</sup> tallest mountain in North America by elevation. It is the tallest peak in the Canadian province of British Columbia, since it sits on the boundary line between the USA and Canada. <h4>Climbing History</h4> The first ascent of Mount Fairweather was completed in 1931 by a team made up of  Allen Carpe, W.S. Ladd, Andy Taylor, and a new member Terry Moore, after a failed attempt in 1926. The mountain was not summitted again until 1958, when the Canadian Centennial Expedition completed a successful climb: Paul Binkert, Fips Broda, Joe Hutton, and Walter Romanes (June 26) Paddy Sherman, David Blair, Dennis Moore, and Russell Yard (June 27) completed the climb on back to back days. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/historyculture/fairweather.htm\">See a list of successful summits on our website. </a>",

But they may help other trees survive by becoming \"nurse logs”, which play an important role in forest ecology. On the forest floor, the dense cover of ferns can impede the growth of new trees. Downed trees can provide an excellent perch for seedlings to take root. Also, by falling the dead tree opens up space in the forest canopy allowing light to reach the forest floor. As the logs decay, their accumulated nutrients become available to young trees and moss that also grows on the log helps retain water. Eventually nurse logs will rot away altogether, but by then the younger trees growing out of them may have extended their roots into the soil so they can survive on their own. In some places you will find rows of trees growing around seemingly hollow spaces where nurse logs once existed.</p>",

In fact, it is only the beginning, for life is eager to blanket the barren land left by a retreating glacier. This is the story of plant succession. Imagine being on the bare landscape outside your window to watch this story be revealed. You may want to get comfortable because to grow a forest many decades are necessary.<br /> <br /> The landscape has been scraped bare. The first thing you would notice is rock, sand, and silt. You would feel the cold, hard rock and hear the cry of arctic terns nesting among the cobbles. After a few years, you will start to notice lichens attached to the rocks and the yellow Dryas flowers spreading out from a fissure where the seeds were able to catch hold and put down roots.<br /> <br /> In about 80 years, you would be resting in the green shade of alder trees. Alders are a pioneer plant, able to supplement their need for nitrogen by extracting this element from the air. In winter, alders drop their leaves, creating soil for yet larger plants. No longer will you hear Arctic terns, but in its place the springtime song of warblers.<br /> <br /> Two-hundred years from now, Sitka Spruce trees will dominate the land. Their towering growth will cast shade year-round in the forest, providing a cool retreat for wildlife. The ground is now soft, with thick layers of moss covering the rocks and boulders. The air is saturated with the fragrance of leaves and flowers accompanied by the song of the varied thrush floating throughout the forest.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/nature/succession.htm\">See plant succession in pictures, and learn more about plant succession in Glacier Bay, here.</a></h4>",

The calm waters provide safe anchorage and the size of the cove and its beaches invite exploration. On the western end of the inlet Reid Glacier spills down from the Brady Icefield. Named for Harry Fielding Reid, one of the first scientists to study how glaciers move, this glacier moves slowly enough that expert mountaineers can traverse it to reach the Brady Icefield and peaks of the Fairweather Mountains. Visitors to the shore and beach meadows immerse themselves in a landscape of change. Hardy pioneer plants like dryas, silverweed, fireweed, lupine, and strawberries cover the valley sides. Some willows and alders have crept in, but larger trees like spruce and hemlocks are mostly absent. An exception are the large spruce trees at the inlet’s entrance, planted by early homesteaders.</p> <h4>History</h4> <p>Reid Glacier and Inlet are named for Harry Fielding Reid, an American geologist who visited Glacier Bay in 1890 and 1892. During his first visit, Reid focused on mapping and study of the Muir Glacier. On his second trip, he turned his attention to glaciers in what is now known as the West Arm of the bay. At the time he was a faculty member at the Case School of Engineering. He later joined the faculty of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, and the focus of his work turned from glaciers to earthquakes. He is considered America’s first geophysist. Reid named many features in the bay, but the glacier that bears his name was named by members of the Harriman Expedition that came to the bay in 1899. The glacier flows from the Brady Icefield and is no longer considered tidewater other than at extreme high tides.<br /> <br /> In the mid-1920s, Joe and Muz Ibach found gold in the mountains above the inlet and later built a cabin on the shore. They had a more substantial cabin on Lemesurier Island, just outside the mouth of Glacier Bay. The Ibachs worked their claim intermittently through the 1940s.</p>",

Traveling through the narrow channel between the island and the mainland be on the lookout for wildlife on the broad, open alluvial fan of the eastern shore. During the Little Ice Age, Russell Island was under thousands of feet of ice. The weight of all that ice pressed the earth’s crust into the mantle.

Birds such as the <strong>Glaucous-winged gull <em>(Larus glaucescens) </em></strong>are a common sight in the bay, and some remain through winter. Rare birds such as the <strong>parakeet auklet </strong><em><strong><strong>(</strong>Aethia psittacula)</strong></em> have been seen in Glacier Bay as well. For a full list of birds in the park, check out the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/nature/glacier-bay-bird-checklist.htm\">Glacier Bay bird checklist</a>, and remember to print it and bring it with you on your next voyage into the bay! <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-marble-island.htm\">South Marble Island</a> is a fantastic place to find numerous different species of seabirds. South Marble Island is a sensitive nesting area for many seabird species, including ground-nesting crested puffins. Gulls, murrelets, loons, cormorants, jaegers, and phalaropes are just a few of the species that can be found in Glacier Bay. Why are seabirds so prevalent here? Sitakaday Narrows is the pinch point that all water must pass through to enter or exit Glacier Bay with the tides. Combined with an area of shallow water, water becomes very turbulent in Sitakaday Narrows, stirring up nutrients and fish that seabirds depend on, making it an extremely productive ecosystem. <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/nature/birds.htm\">Learn more about the birds of Glacier Bay </a></h4> <br /> <em>*Location note:</em> The location chosen for seabirds is for illustrative purposes only.

At the head of Tarr Inlet, visitors come face to face with the Grand Pacific and Margerie glaciers. The Grand Pacific is the main glacier credited with rapidly advancing all the way to Icy Strait hundreds of years ago, effectively carving out the bay. Other glaciers fed into this one main glacier, which was named by John Muir. Now greatly receded, the Grand Pacific is a shadow of its former self. It is largely covered with debris that comes from the Ferris Glacier which feeds in from the west. The active face of Margerie Glacier offers a stark contrast. Ships often linger at the head of this inlet to observe the Margerie and to possibly see it calve. Look for harbor seals poking their heads curiously out of the water or hauled out on ice floes. Kittiwakes, herring gulls and glaucous-winged gulls are common. Sharp eyes might see puffins in the water. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the inlet was named for Ralph Stockman Tarr, professor of physical geography at Cornell University, who visited this fjord in 1911.

The glacier that overran the Tlingit Homeland eventually receded. As it did so, a great weight was removed from the Earth's crust and as a result the land began rising in much the same way the surface of a cushion rises after you’ve been sitting on it. This is called isostatic rebound or post-glacial rebound. Today, the land in Glacier Bay is rising at a rate of about 1.5 inches per year -- faster than anywhere else on the planet.<br /> <br /> Notice the U.S.G.S. benchmark on top of this rock. It was placed here in 1966. Today it sits about five feet higher than it did then. Also, if you look across the cove, you’ll notice a point which juts out into the bay.

The interface of glaciers and ocean water is dynamic and complex. Compared to glacial ice, seawater is warm and highly erosive. As waves and tides undermines some ice fronts, great blocks of ice up to 200 feet may break off or \"calve\" and crash into the sea. The explosive sound, towering splash, and subsequent waves can be spectacular.<br /> <br /> Icebergs may last a week or more. They provide perches for bald eagles, cormorants, and gulls, as well as haul-outs for harbor seals and sea otters. When passing close by, passengers can hear splashes and crackles as melting water drips and the ice deteriorates. The ice pops and sizzles as it releases ancient air first trapped between the delicate snowflakes and then frozen in under pressure – a phenomenon called “bergie seltzer.” Colors betray a berg's nature or origin. White bergs hold many trapped air bubbles. Blue bergs are dense and are likely recently calved. Greenish-blackish bergs may have calved off glacier bottoms. Dark-striped brown bergs carry morainal rubble – rocks that the glacier acquired on its journey down the mountain.</p> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/nature/glaciers-soundscape-gallery.htm\">Want to HEAR a glacier in action?

They use the bark to tan seal and deer hides and carve spoons, dip-net poles, spear shafts, and halibut hooks from the wood. The inner bark is a treasured sweet dessert. In early spring, hemlock branches are submerged in spawning locations to provide a structure for herring to lay their eggs, a Tlingit delicacy.",

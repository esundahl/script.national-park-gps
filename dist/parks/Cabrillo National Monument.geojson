        "notes": "Ballast Point\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/ballast-point.htm\n\nBallast Point is a small peninsula with a large history. Located on the larger Point Loma Peninsula, not far from Cabrillo National Monument, it is deeply intertwined with our park’s history. It has been part of the Kumeyaay Tribe’s homeland since time immemorial and was the site of a seasonal—and possibly permanent—village where Kumeyaay people gathered marine resources such as fish and shellfish from the waters and intertidal zones of San Diego Bay.<br /> <br /> On September 28, 1542, explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo entered San Diego's harbor, which he named San Miguel, and likely landed at Ballast Point. It was the first visit of a Euro-American to present-day California. Cabrillo recognized San Diego's maritime resources, declaring it to be \"a closed and very good port.\" <br /> <br /> In 1769, colonists from Mexico (then part of the Spanish empire) began sending settlers to present-day San Diego. As explorers from the British Empire began to visit San Diego, these colonists recognized the importance of coastal defenses to their sovereignty and built Fort Guijarros on Ballast Point in 1795. This fort held 10 cannons, one of which can be seen by visitors at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-town-san-diego-state-historic-park.htm\">Old Town San Diego State Historical Park </a>. On two occasions, American smugglers who traded illegally in San Diego were confronted by cannon fire from this fort, but when the US military invaded in 1846 the fort had been abandoned for 10 years and US Marines took its cannons to attack Mexican forces in Old Town.<br /> <br /> In 1834, Richard Henry Dana, a sailor turned memoirist, visited Ballast Point, which was then home to a hide tanning industry that produced leather. He claimed that, “For landing and taking off hides, San Diego is decidedly the best place in California. The harbour is small and land-locked, there is no surf; the vessels lie within a cable's length of the beach, and the beach itself is smooth, hard sand, without rocks or stones. For these reasons, it is used by all the vessels in the trade, as a depot.” In the next decade, an interracial whaling industry would also emerge in this area, with whalers of diverse backgrounds hunting and processing the Gray whales who once came to San Diego Harbor to mate and give birth.<br /> <br /> After San Diego became part of the United States, the fort became a ruin.Circumstantial evidence exists suggesting that some of the fort’s bricks were used to build the foundation of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-point-loma-lighthouse-grounds.htm\">Old Point Loma Lighthouse</a>. The US Army began adding new coastal defenses to Ballast Point in the 1870s, part of the Fort Rosecrans defense complex that also included much of the park. In 1890, a lighthouse was constructed on Ballast Point, but it was decommissioned and demolished in 1957. Today, Ballast Point retains its maritime heritage. It is home to a Coast Guard Base and is the home port for nuclear submarines. While it is not open to general visitors, one can gain a sense of this area from the lookout at Cabrillo National Monument. <p> </p> <p> </p>",

        "notes": "Bayside Trail - Trailhead\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/bayside-trail-trailhead.htm\n\n<h4>Trail Information (Western side - Class 5, Eastern side - Class 3)</h4> <p>The Bayside Trail is a 1.86 mile moderately trafficked out and back path, that starts as a black paved road and eventually turns into a gravel trail. It takes you past plants, animals, historic military installations, and spectacular views. The western side of the trail is a Class 5 trail while the eastern side is a class 3 trail.<br /> <br /> The Bayside Trail immerses you in the scents and sights of native plants; from the bright red fruits of the Lemonade Berry (<i>Rhus integrifolia</i>) to the brilliant and fragrant yellow flowers of the California Bush Sunflower (<em>Encelia californica</em>). Plants, and the sandstone ravines, provide vital habitat for many animals. During your hike, you may see many different species of reptiles, birds, small mammals, and insects.<br /> <br /> Halfway down the trail, you will see two large drab colored buildings on your left. During World Wars I and II, military facilities on the Point provided vital coastal and harbor defense systems. The first structure houses a large searchlight. During war time, it was wheeled out on tracks and hooked up to a concrete electrical box on the edge of the cliff. Once illuminated, it would search the sky for enemy aircraft and the sea for enemy vessels.At the end of the trail, you will see a small peninsula to the North. This little piece of land that juts out into the bay is known as Ballast Point and it’s where historians believe Cabrillo became the first European to step foot on what is now the west coast of the United States.</p> <h4><b style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem;\">Access and Safety</b></h4> <p>The trailhead for the Bayside Trail starts between the lighthouse grounds and the Visitor Center area, shortly before you arrive at the lighthouse grounds. There is approximately a 340 feet (104 meters) elevation change over the course of the trail and parts of it are on dirt, slightly uneven terrain, and there are occasional steps. Please make sure to wear sunscreen, wear proper footware, and bring enough water before attempting the trail.</p>",

You may notice a strip of ocean that is lighter in color near the horizon. This is the marking of the kelp forest in the Cabrillo State Marine Reserve.<br /> <br /> The kelp forest provides an essential resource to the area and is one of the reasons why it is a protected marine reserve. “Kelps” are a class of brown algae that can grow to large sizes. They attach to the ocean bottom, and many have flotation devices to buoy themselves to the water’s surface. Several marine algae species can be found in the intertidal area, but the most impressive are the large forests of kelps that grow in water about 25 to 70 feet (8 – 21 meters) offshore. You can see roughly where they grow by looking for the brownish, smooth areas on the water’s surface. In Point Loma the kelp forest is dominated by giant kelp (<i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i>), which grows up to 150 feet (46 meters) long!<br /> <br /> Organisms ranging from sea urchins to Gray Whales can be spotted in this habitat. Although this forest is underwater, it has just as much biodiversity as forests on land. Many species found in the kelp forest can also be spotted in our tidepools.<br /> <br /> <b>Access and Safety</b><br /> Not wheelchair accessible.<br /> <br /> Please make sure to wear sunscreen and bring enough water before attempting the trail.</p>",

It is the final resting place for more than 120,000 Americans who died as long ago as 1846. The cemetery was established in 1882 as part of Fort Rosecrans and the oldest interments were relocated and reburied here. Due to limited space, casketed remains stopped being accepted in the late 1960s, but burials still exist here for cremated individuals, but all available spaces were allocated in 2014.<br /> <br /> The cemetery emerged as part of Fort Rosecrans, San Diego’s first US military base, which most of our park was once a part of. Shortly after the United States conquered California in 1848, the government identified the strategic value of Point Loma and declared the entire area a military reservation where coastal defenses would be developed. The first installation was at Ballast Point where the Spanish and Mexican governments also had a coastal fort. Fort Rosecrans--named after a Civil War general--grew slowly over time with few defensive facilities until the 20th century.<br /> <br /> By the time of World War I, several hundred service members served at Fort Rosecrans and its large gun batteries were oriented to face and protect the coast. World War I generated a large expansion of Fort Rosecrans with many new buildings and facilities, but by 1940 its population had declined to only 287 soldiers. World War II breathed new life into the Fort with large gun emplacements, searchlights, bunkers, and other coastal defenses being built on the coast, including in our park, which was temporarily off limits to the public due to the war. During the war our park was a hub of military activity with jeep and survival training conducted within its current boundaries and soldiers quartered in parts of the park including the Old Point Loma Lighthouse.<br /> <br /> In 1947, the US Army declared Fort Rosecrans surplus and a decade later it was turned over to the United States Navy. Naval operations had already existed in this area prior to this transfer; the Nav Electronic Laboratory began operations in 1945 and the Submarine Group, San Diego was created in 1946. Visitors to our park will pass through part of this still functioning Naval Base and the National Cemetery before the enter our park. Even when you are in our park, you will be in the former Fort Rosecrans, as the park itself was created from the fort’s prior land.",

Cabrillo led the first European expedition to set foot on what would become the west coast of the United States, and the first to chart the coast of California.<br /> <br /> The original Cabrillo statue at the site was made by Portuguese sculptor Alvaro DeBree. It was donated to San Francisco in 1939 for the Golden Gate International Exposition, but eventually wound up here, at the monument. Over time, the marine climate and weather of Point Loma eroded the original statue to the point where most details showed visible wear.<br /> <br /> Funded by a generous donation from San Diego resident Marian Reupsch, Portuguese sculptor Joas Chartes Almeida carved an exact replica of the original statue out of a more resistant stone, and it was installed in 1988. The new statue stands here, overlooking San Diego Bay, while the original statue was eventually relocated to Ensenada, Mexico. Today, the statue continues to commemorate the voyage of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo and his exploration of California.<br /> <br /> In addition to remembering Cabrillo’s story, the monument is a place to experience many other stories of Point Loma. The Kumeyaay, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse, World War II coastal defenses, San Diego’s native coastal sage landscape, tidepools, whale migrations, the local kelp forest, and more all have a story to tell here!</p> <h4><b>Did You Know?</b></h4> <ul> <li>Cabrillo started his voyage in Navidad, Mexico (modern day Barra de Navidad). That is over 1,200 miles (1,931 km) away, as the crow flies! That’s quite the trip! It took him 103 days to reach the site of modern-day San Diego Bay.</li> <li>After Cabrillo's death, his crew possibly made it as far north as the Rogue River in Oregon. That’s just shy of 2,000 miles (3,219 km) away from where they started! Imagine beginning a voyage at a sunny beach in Mexico and making it as far as the cold and wet pacific northwest!</li> <li>The original plans for the monument called for a towering statue at the site of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse!</li> </ul> <h4>Learn More</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/historyculture/juan-rodriguez-cabrillo.htm\">Read about the life and voyage of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo!</a></p> <h4><b>Access</b></h4> <p>The statue viewing area is down a short walking path just off the traffic circle in front of the Visitor Center.</p> <p> </p>",

This is a great spot to watch or learn about coastal wildlife. Here you can learn about the Gray Whale migration, our tidepools, and the kelp forests off Point Loma.Each winter, the Pacific Gray Whales pass by the western overlooks of Cabrillo National Monument. After spending the summer feeding in the food-rich waters of the Arctic, the whales swim south along the coast to the bays of Baja California, where they mate, give birth, and nurse their young. Along the way, they pass Point Loma and Cabrillo National Monument, where you can witness their annual winter journey.<br /> <br /> From here you can also see the the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/nature/tidepools.htm\">Rocky Intertidal Zone of Cabrillo National Monument</a> during low tide. Ours is one of the best protected Rocky Intertidal areas in California! The best time to visit the tidepools is during the winter and early spring months, when good low tides occur during park hours. The tide usually covers the tidepools when the park is open, from late spring to early fall.<br /> <br /> Just offshore is also a whole underwater forest! “Kelps” are a class of brown algae that can grow to large sizes. They attach to the ocean bottom, and many have flotation devices to buoy themselves to the water’s surface. Several marine algae species can be found in the intertidal area, but the most impressive are the large forests of kelps that grow in water about 25 to 70 feet (8 – 21 meters) off shore. You can see roughly where they grow by looking for the brownish, smooth areas on the water’s surface. In Point Loma the kelp forest is dominated by giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), which grows up to 150 feet (46 meters) long!</p> <h4><b>Whale Watching Tips!</b></h4> <ul> <li> <p>Look for the Blow or Spout - these spouts are created when warm, moist air exhaled from a whale’s lungs meets the cool air at the ocean’s surface. They can be up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) high and each one is visible for about 5 seconds! These can be seen from here even without binoculars.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look for the tail! Gray whales typically spout 3-5 times before taking a big breath for a deep dive. Before their deepest dive, gray whales often display their 12-foot fan-shaped flukes, or tails. The weight of the tail above the whale’s body helps the whale dive deep.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look for a breach and splash. Sometimes gray whales hurl themselves out of the water and plunge back in with a huge splash. This is called breaching. Breaching is a rare occurrence, as these whales are trying to conserve as much energy as they can during their long migration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look for large white boats with a lot of people onboard. These are whale watching boats. Find one of these and you are almost guaranteed to see a whale spouting nearby.</p> </li> </ul> <h4><b>Access</b></h4> <p>The Kelp Forest and Whale Overlook is accessed by a small concrete loop trail that starts just south of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse grounds.</p>",

La Jolla is also an excellent place to see the underwater world when the tide is low. The life that you might sea include sea anemones, crabs, limpets, octopi, sea stars, sea slugs, sea hares, and barnacles. The La Jolla coastline is designated an ecological reserve so you cannot remove anything from this area, living or dead. <br /> <br /> Tidepools can be found throughout the La Jolla coastline, from Dike Rock near Scripps Pier on the north to Windansea Beach on the south. Please plan for appropriate clothing and footwear on your visit. Shoes with good gripping soles are best, as rocky areas become slippery with water and algae. Closed toe shoes are recommended. Sandals or flip flops are strongly discouraged due to their inability to provide a good grip on the slippery rocks.<br /> <br /> Another place worth visiting on the La Jolla coastline is she Children’s Pool. This unique beach was created by Ellen Browning Scripps, a wealthy local philanthropist, who worried about the risk to local beachgoing children. Scripps paid for a breakwater to be constructed around the site of today's Children's Pool Beach to provide a safe place for all children to enjoy the ocean. The same environmental factors that made it attractive to young children also made it attractive to young harbor seals, and in the 1990s harbor seals began colonizing this area.

At Mission Trails, visitors can hike 65 miles of trails that hug wild canyons and climb to mountaintops. Stunning vistas and colorful wildflowers await, including the summit of Cowles Mountain, the highest peak in San Diego and the most popular hike in the park.<br /> <br /> Hiking is not the only activity available at Mission Trails; numerous trails also accommodate horseback riders and mountain bikers. Park staff and volunteers are on hand to offer guided nature walks to visitors. And if you feel like spending the night, you can also camp at the Kumeyaay Lake Campground.<br /> <br /> Mission Trails also has a long and rich human history. The Kumeyaay people have called this area their home since time immemorial and park exhibits provide information and displays about their long and ongoing history. Spanish colonization began in 1774 and the main mission in San Diego was located near this park and adjacent to the Kumeyaay village of Nipaguay. To water their crops and provide drinking water for their mission, the Spanish colonizers coerced Kumeyaay people to build the Mission Dam between 1809 and 1815. This dam can still be toured and is located in the northeast portion of the park.<br /> <br /> Much of the park was mission property until 1846, when it was granted to Santiago Arguello—a local politician and military officer—by the Mexican government. After the conquest of California by the United States, Mission Trails had numerous uses including ranching, granite mining, and farming. Granite mined from Mission Gorge was used to construct the breakwater in San Diego Bay that can be seen from Cabrillo National Monument. This area also served as a military training zone where artillery and tank training occurred for World War I and other training including live fire occurred during World War II. Unexploded ordnance remains a hazard in the park to this day because of this training.<br /> <br /> In 1960, the military area that is now Mission Trails Regional Park was declared surplus to military needs. The City of San Diego acquired substantial amounts of this land and began the process of converting it to the park it is today. The park was established in 1974 and has grown through several acquisitions into a massive and beloved public space. ",

This new lighthouse has much in common with its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-point-loma-lighthouse-grounds.htm\">Old Point Loma Lighthouse</a>. Firstly, the initial keeper of the light was Robert Israel who had served for 18 years at the old lighthouse. Secondly, it was extremely close to the old lighthouse and also used a third order Fresnel lens powered by kerosene. This lens, which was ruby-colored was considered so beautiful that its creator entered it in the Paris Exhibition of 1889 where it won a gold medal for its beauty and quality.One major difference, however, was its location. The Old Point Loma Lighthouse is located on a cliff 400 feet above the water. In the marine atmosphere, that often meant that fog and clouds would interfere with the light from the lighthouse itself reaching the ships out at sea. This new location would prevent any similar functionality issues.<br /> <br /> While the citizens of San Diego celebrated its first lighting on February 3, 1891, lighthouse keeper Robert Israel nursed a grudge. His son and the son of the assistant lighthouse keeper had accidentally wrecked the boat that the lighthouse service provided for them several years earlier and the lighthouse service had deducted its cost from his salary. Israel felt that this was unjust and despite several official protests, he was ignored. Within the first year of the lighthouse’s opening, Israel was no longer regularly cleaning the lens or the grounds of the lighthouse and within a year of opening he quit after nearly 20 years attending to lighthouses in Point Loma.<br /> <br /> The lighthouse knew many changes in appearance and function over the years. In 1894, it was painted white (it was originally brown), a fog warning was added bin 1913, and in 1933 its lamp was changed to electricity and its red glass was removed. In 1939, the US Coast Guard took over all lighthouses and all keepers became members of the military. In 1973, the job of keeper was made unnecessary through automation and in 1997 the old Fresnel lens stopped rotating and was replaced by a new beacon.The New Point Loma Lighthouse is now a residential area for Coast Guard officers and it is off limit for public visitation. Its original Fresnel lens, however, is observable at our park in the lighthouse history exhibits in the Assistant Lighthouse Keepers Quarters. You can also see it in the film ‘Top Gun’ where it served as the location for a scene where Tom Cruise’s character, Maverick, went to meet with his mentor, Viper, who lived in one of the homes on its grounds. ",

The flagpole was erected by Lighthouse Keeper Jenkins, who operated the lighthouse from 1867 to 1871. The ruthless wind meant that he would only raise the colors on special occasions and holidays. Currently, a 38-star flag is flown, representing the number of states in the union during most of the time that the Israel family operated the lighthouse.Next to the flagpole is a cellar door that leads to the basement of the lighthouse. This part of the house was also accessible by a separate spiral staircase located in the kitchen. The basement has the same floorplan as the 1st floor of the lighthouse. When boys reached the age of 10, they left the second-floor bedroom shared by all the kids and moved into the basement. Being much cooler than the rest of the house, this area was also used to store food and other supplies.  Thank you for listening to the Old Point Loma Lighthouse audio tour given by Cabrillo National Monument.

Its light guided ships from November 15, 1855 until March 23, 1891. Unfortunately, its height was a double-edged sword. When foggy, it was difficult to see the light at all. As such, it was shut down and the keeper was relocated to a new lighthouse located closer to the water.<br /> <br /> This Lighthouse sported a 3<sup>rd</sup> order Fresnel lens that stood 462 feet (141 meters) above the water, at the top of the tower. The theoretical maximum visibility was close to 31 miles (50 km), if you were observing from 30 feet (9 meters) above the waterline! The light was fueled by burning Sperm Whale oil. For most of its life, it projected a solid line of light in 360 degrees. In April of 1889, it was briefly converted to a fixed light that alternated red and white flashes every minute.<br /> <br /> After it shut down in 1891, the light remained dormant until sunset on the lighthouse’s 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary - November 15, 1955. Then, for the first time in over 60 years, the tower was alight again – but this time with an electric lightbulb! It was only for show, not as a navigational aid, but it was still a momentous occasion.<br /> <br /> Today, the Old Point Loma Lighthouse stands watch over San Diego, sentinel to a vanished past. If you have a chance to look inside inside the lighthouse, this past comes alive! The National Park Service has refurbished the interior to its historic 1880s appearance.</p> <h4><b>Did You Know?</b></h4> <ul> <li>The position of Lighthouse Keeper was one of the first federal jobs available to women with pay equal to their male counterparts!</li> <li>There were some far out reports of the lighthouse’s visibility – in 1855, the captain of the steamship <i>Golden Gate</i> reported that they could see the light from 39 miles (63 km) away! George Davidson’s <i>Directory of the Pacific Coast</i> (first published in 1858)<i> </i>suggested that the light could be seen 28 to 31 miles (45 to 50 km) away depending on how high above the sea you were making the observation.</li> </ul> <h4><b>Learn More</b></h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/historyculture/the-lighthouses-of-cabrillo-national-monument.htm\">Read about the history of the Lighthouses of Point Loma</a></p> <h4><b>Access</b></h4> <p>The Assistant Keeper's Quarters and an adjoining restroom are wheelchair accessible.<br /> <br /> Additional restrooms are available down a flight of stairs at the comfort station on the hillside west of the lighthouse.The first two floors of the old lighthouse are normally open to the public and are accessed by small flights of stairs. Some interior stairs are of non-standard height.<br /> <br /> The top of the tower is only open for special events a few times a year. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cabr/planyourvisit/open-tower-days.htm\">Check for upcoming Open Tower Days</a></p>",

When the Israel family lived in the lighthouse, the closest town (now known as “Old Town San Diego”) was a 4-hour horse and buggy ride away. Food, water, and supplies had to be rationed carefully. Due to the location of the lighthouse from the nearest town, supplies were limited and only delivered every three months. Most lighthouses were in isolated areas so the challenges the Old Point Loma Lighthouse Keepers faced were not unique. To supplement the food they got from town, the kitchen garden was planted with seasonal vegetables and herbs providing a fresh source of food and vitamins. In addition to her assistant keeper duties, Mrs. Israel managed to keep tomato vines growing at the lighthouse.

So how did this family living in a remote area in the coastal desert get access to fresh water?As you exit the lighthouse, walk down the front steps. In front of you, you will see a fenced area called the catchment basin. Before the catchment basin was created, the family would collect rainwater and moisture from the fog using gutters to guide it from the roof into containers. The catchment basin was built to create additional surface area for the water to condense and collect on—giving <b>more</b> opportunity to collect even more water. The construction of a cistern, a waterproof area to store collected water, was completed in 1883. This cistern was the only source of fresh water for the lighthouse. Even though the family had the means to collect rainwater, rain events were infrequent, and water had to be used sparingly.",

The Kumeyaay Tribe has lived in this region since time immemorial and, though Spain first claimed ownership of this territory in the 1540s, their first settlers did not arrive until 1769 when they established a mission not far from today’s Old Town. In the 1870s, San Diego’s center moved to its current downtown location to better take advantage of the city’s harbor. As a result, many of the historic structures found here escaped the development pressures faced at older settlements throughout California. The state park, created in 1968, contains a mix of authentic restored structures and accurate reproductions that provide visitors with a vivid sense of what life was like in early San Diego.<br /> <br /> One family who lived in Old Town during its heyday were Robert and Maria Israel (born Maria Machado), who served as lighthouse keepers at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-point-loma-lighthouse-grounds.htm\">Old Point Loma Lighthouse</a> in our park for 20 years. Robert was a Mexican War veteran and skilled chairmaker who moved to Old Town in 1851 and worked a wide variety of jobs including saloon manager, justice of the peace, jailhouse keeper, and marshal. Maria and Robert lived in Old Town until 1871, when they moved to what is now Cabrillo National Monument. Maria's family had deep roots in Old Town. Her father, José was deployed to San Diego by the Spanish military in 1781; he ended up owning several ranches and became a city councilman in the 1830s. Maria's family had lived in San Diego since its Euro-American colonization began. The Machados were an enormous family with 15 children including Maria. Maria's oldest sibling, Juan, had an even larger family of 19 children and his landholdings included Ballast Point, not far from the lighthouse his sister would later tend. The large Machado family left a major imprint on San Diego's early history and their descendants can be found in our region to this day.<br /> <br /> Among the many attractions in Old Town are museums like the Wells Fargo Museum which details the history of finance, the Gold Rush, and stagecoach transportation in 1800s California. The Seeley Stable contains historic stagecoaches and wagons that give visitors a sense of how transportation operated in San Diego's early years. Casa de Estudillo recreates the life of San Diego's elite during the 1820s. Other house museums include the James McCoy House, home of California's first sheriff, the Robinson Rose house, which served as a prison, school, and surgical operating room as well as a residence, and several homes where Maria Israel’s family lived such as Casa Machado Silvas and Casa Machado y Stewart which contain early 1800s furnishings. The Whaley House, built by Thomas Whaley in 1857 and reputed to be the most haunted house in San Diego due to the trials and tribulations that the Whaley family suffered, is also a major attraction.<br /> <br /> Old Town's well-manicured grounds are a pleasant and atmospheric place to stroll and take in regular free entertainment such as mariachi bands and the Ballet Folklorico dancers at an outdoor stage. The park also features numerous restaurants, craft vendors, and souvenir shops where visitors can refresh themselves or purchase period objects or clothes. <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",

Walking barefoot results in the risk of cuts or injury to visitor. Rocks are slippery due to algal growth and visitors should proceed with caution.<br /> <br /> The tidepools are accessible to explore only at low tide. Guests are encouraged to check the San Diego tidal calendar before visiting. The best time to see low tides at the park are during the fall and winter months. In spring and summer, the water level is above the tidepools during park hours. The Rocky Intertidal Zone is one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet. During your visit, you may see plants and animals such as hermit crabs, sea stars, algae, mussels, and barnacles. Everyone plays a part in preserving this ecosystem. You can help the park preserve this resource by packing out any trash you bring, not pulling organisms off of rocks, not removing any rocks or shells, and watching your step as you explore!<br /> <br /> <b>Did You Know?</b></p> <ul> <li> <p>The Owl Limpet (<i>Lottia gigantea) </i>is a snail with a low-profile, white, black, and brown shell and a strong muscular foot that attaches to the rock. These animals can be found throughout the rocky intertidal from Washington to Baja California, Mexico, and are the largest of the Pacific Coast true limpets, growing to about 4 inches (10 cm) in length.</p> </li> <li> <p>---Owl Limpets are something called sexually dimorphic, which means all Owl Limpets start life as males and, when they reach a certain size, turn into females! Can you find an Owl Limpet? See if you can find both sexes: Any individual over approximately 4 cm is a female, and individuals smaller than that are males!</p> </li> <li> <p>California Brown Sea Hares (<i>Aplysia californica</i>) are soft-bodied sea slugs that on average grow to be 12-15 inches (40cm) in length. California Sea Hares are often a mottled dark red-black color due to their red algae diet. A sea hare fits its namesake well and can be identified based on their heads that appear to have bunny ears!</p> </li> <li> <p>Hopkins’ Rose Nudibranchs (<i>Okenia rosacea</i>) are only 2-3cm long but they are hard to miss due to their bright pink, frilly papillae swaying in the water.</p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Accessibility: </b>Not wheelchair accessible.<br /> <b>Resources:</b><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/nature/tidepools.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/nature/tidepools.htm</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/nature/tidepools.htm#PrepareForVisit\">https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/nature/tidepools.htm#PrepareForVisit</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/nature/tidepools.htm#ProtectingTheTidepools\">https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/nature/tidepools.htm#ProtectingTheTidepools</a></p> <p> </p> <br />  ",

Each year over 350,000 people visit the tidepools, one of the best protected rocky intertidal areas in California. The best time to visit the tidepools is during the fall and winter months, when we get our great low tides during park hours. During spring and summer, the tide is usually covering the tidepools when the park is open. Please read <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/nature/tidepools.htm#PrepareForVisit\">Prepare for Your Visit to the Tidepools</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cabr/learn/nature/tidepools.htm#ProtectingTheTidepools\">Protecting the Tidepools</a> before your visit so you will be aware of what to expect.<br /> <br /> Note that everything in the park is protected. This means you cannot collect rocks or shells, pick flowers, etc. We ask that you leave everything where it is. Please do not pick up any animals as that can hurt the environment they need to survive. We ask that you do not turn over rocks or stack the rocks.<br /> <br /> Please plan for appropriate clothing and footwear. Shoes with good gripping soles are best, as rocky areas become slippery with water and algae. Closed toe shoes are recommended. Sandals or flip flops are strongly discouraged due to their inability to provide a good grip on the slippery rocks.<br /> <br /> Pets are allowed on the trail as long as they are on a 6 foot or shorter leash. Please do not go off trail with your pets. They are also not allowed in the tidepools. Please pick up after your pets.",

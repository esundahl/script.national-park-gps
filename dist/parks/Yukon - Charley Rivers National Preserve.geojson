The Charley River basin is a focal point for scientific study of subarctic ecosystems that range from river bottoms to alpine habitat. The preserve provides habitat for populations of fish and wildlife, including but not limited to peregrine falcons and other raptorial birds, caribou, moose, Dall's sheep, grizzly bears, and wolves. Visitors are attracted to the remote and challenging floating conditions the Charley River offers, as well as opportunities for float hunting, fishing, and other recreational pursuits such as wildlife viewing.</p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yuch/planyourvisit/floatingthecharleyriver.htm\">Learn about floating the Charley River</a></h3>",

In its heyday, the City of Eagle served as judicial and transportation hub for interior Alaska, and adjacent Fort Egbert as the military and communications center. Eagle began as a fur trading post around 1880. When gold was discovered at nearby American Creek, a small mining camp was established at Eagle. The rush of gold seekers to Canada’s Klondike in brought national attention to Eagle. The prime site along the Yukon River a few miles from the Canadian border was an ideal location for the development of the City of Eagle. Fort Egbert was established as a control station and headquarters for interior Alaska in 1899 adjacent to Eagle.<br /> <br /> Today, the Bureau of Land Management and Eagle Historical Society and Museums manage several of the historic buildings of Eagle. In addition, many of the historic homes are privately owned. A joint BLM/NPS field office is located in Eagle and can provide the visitor with more information on Eagle as well as nearby Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve.</p> <h4><br /> Additional Information</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit-us/search-details/14535/2\">Visit Fort Egbert in Eagle, Alaska</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951p00916616d&view=1up&seq=1\">Eagle - Fort Egbert: A Remnant of the Past, BLM</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.eaglehistoricalsociety.com/\">Eagle Historical Society</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yuch/learn/historyculture/eagle-city.htm\">Yukon Charley Rivers National Preserve - Learn about Eagle's history</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/akso/history/PDF/NHL-Goldrush.pdf\">Alaska Goldrush NHLs: The Stampede North</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=2704ba41-0107-4c07-8a9d-e2231f72a6e2\">National Register of Historic Places - Official Nomination Form</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p>",

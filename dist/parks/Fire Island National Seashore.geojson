What they called the horse barn stood just south of Robinson’s barn. That went down just before I came here... We used the barn part to shear the sheep in and keep hay in [the] winter. Had to cart a load or two in every week or so it was so small.”<br /> <br /> - Charles H.

The Merrifield sheep barn and the Robinson Barn, for cows, were massive two-story barns that towered over the barnyard.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{d5258e13-c8cc-4dd0-ba8a-5f751949494b}{131}\" paraid=\"1656628654\">The “New Barn” on the right was built from the salvaged wood of an earlier larger barn. In 1898 John Gelston Floyd Jr. had a windmill erected on the roof of that barn with a water tank in the loft to provide running water to the house.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{d5258e13-c8cc-4dd0-ba8a-5f751949494b}{161}\" paraid=\"1312371872\">Throughout the generations, the barns were also a favorite space in which to play hide-and-seek. Recalling her childhood in the 1840s, Sarah Floyd Turner wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{d5258e13-c8cc-4dd0-ba8a-5f751949494b}{181}\" paraid=\"1933602824\">“Nick with his eyes blind-folded counted out one-hundred, while the others, scampered like rabbits through the manger. Some had the courage to cross long beams that bridged the lofts together, stealing like cats over a span of twenty feet, with a deathly depth below, others burrowed in the hay or hid in the horse stalls, while some hung onto rafters and beams among the swallows nests, awaiting the signal from Nick….Peals of laughter resounded from floor to rafters as each was made to hide and seek in turn, till the cows came home and the setting sun warned them to flee from the barn before the dreaded bull took possession with the cows.” </p> </blockquote>",

This would have been a bustling site filled with cattle, crops, carriages, and people. All of the buildings that stood here were tended to by workers, from enslaved and indentured servants in the 18th and early 19th centuries, to immigrant and local labor in late 19th and 20th centuries.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2ae9068-74d4-47c3-82e1-a2878b85fcb0}{218}\" paraid=\"288742207\">Charles H. Ross, who served as the estate’s caretaker from 1876 to 1913, described his life on the farm in a brief memoir. Through his recollections, we learn about staff employed by the Floyds in the home and throughout the site. His descriptions help us to understand the roles, skills, and personalities of his fellow workers. When he started at the Floyd Estate, Ross remembered that John Gelston Floyd, Sr. lived in the house on his own. In his old age, John, Sr. relied on the help of the Carmen family who lived in the rooms above the kitchen. He explained:</p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{17b32751-1679-424c-9a59-5f26161b419c}{41}\" paraid=\"1381097311\">“There was a colored family in the kitchen. Elijah Carmen and Charity, his wife, and five children. Charity did the cooking. Elijah did the chores around the house and helped on the farm. Mr. and Mrs. Nicoll Floyd came out here in the summer, and Charity cooked for them and used the old brick oven to bake goodies in.” </p> </blockquote>",

Oat, flax, wheat, rye, and other grains were the dominant crops here and throughout Long Island in the early 19th century. In his 1804 ledgers, Nicoll Floyd II recorded selling just 10 bushels of Indian corn and 20 bushels of corn. But, by the mid 19th century corn had grown in popularity. In 1860, John Gelston Floyd Sr. wrote that he expected to produce 5000 bushels of corn in the year.  </p>",

Windows were cut into the structure to let light into the old shop, as boxes for tools and nails began to litter the space. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4ee4257f-c154-4f0b-a02e-e181e97012ec}{11}\" paraid=\"2052360398\">Over his 37 years at the Floyd Estate, Ross experienced the changes of the estate, from the decline of the working farm to the use of the estate for gathering friends and family together in the summer sunshine. He spent much of his time here building and repairing the equipment he needed to manage livestock. For Cornelia Floyd Nichols, the shop became forever associated with Charles Ross.

We hope that you enjoyed your time exploring this incredible place. From atop the secondary dune we can see clearly the desert-like swale, the primary dune, and the vast Atlantic Ocean. To the west you can see Point ’O Woods and other Fire Island communities. To your east stands a short but remarkable little American holly tree.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-8f76a88a-7fff-89dc-f7a3-4bcb824f6884\">Compare this holly to the ones you saw in the heart of the forest and you may recognize the effects of salt spray pruning. Where before the trees stood tall, now they are short and stubby. You may even notice their windswept or hedge-like appearance, as though someone came here and trimmed its top off. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-8f76a88a-7fff-89dc-f7a3-4bcb824f6884\">For over three-hundred years the Sunken Forest has stood as a profound and unique example of the resilience and adaptability of life on a constantly shifting barrier island. There are lessons to learn from this everywhere we look. You need only to keep your eyes open.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-8f76a88a-7fff-89dc-f7a3-4bcb824f6884\">Proceeding from here visitors may choose to go back the way they came, or to proceed forward into the swale. Be warned that the swale can be quite hot on sunny summer days. Once you are in the swale you will notice a concrete walkway. You may head left to return to the bathrooms near where we began, right to head back towards the heart of the forest down the longer loop, or straight out onto the ocean beach. Wherever you go we hope you will take time to listen to and enjoy this marvelous place. We also encourage you to visit the Sailors Haven Visitor Center to speak to a ranger, or even join one on a public tour!</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-8f76a88a-7fff-89dc-f7a3-4bcb824f6884\">Remember, Fire Island National Seashore is your national park.

Today the Unkechaug Nation is centered nearby at the Poospatuck reservation. Poospatuck, meaning “where the waters meet,” is one of the oldest recognized sovereign Native American reservations in the United States. Over the centuries the Unkechaug have fished, farmed, hunted, lived and worked on this land.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19fcff96-8264-496d-b9da-e05a8e635772}{64}\" paraid=\"21471750\">When European colonists arrived in the 17th century they utilized a complex legal system and foreign bureaucratic procedures to dispossess Indigenous Long Islanders of their land, conferring ownership to individuals and making claims to large areas such as the Manor of St. George, patented originally to William “Tangier” Smith. While the land that would become the William Floyd Estate was originally deeded to the Unkechaug in perpetuity from the Manor of St. George, it was later sold by the Smith family to William Floyd’s grandfather, Richard Floyd II. </p> <p paraeid=\"{19fcff96-8264-496d-b9da-e05a8e635772}{90}\" paraid=\"1376217041\">Soon after purchasing the more than 4,000 acres of land in 1718, laborers for the Floyd family began the back-breaking work of clearing fields, constructing ditches, planting and tending crops, and doing the innumerable agricultural and domestic jobs that were required to establish and operate a farm of this scale. This work was largely performed by indentured and enslaved people until slavery was abolished in New York in 1827 and indentured servitude was phased out by the Floyds in the mid 19th century. Immigrant wage labor entered the mix in the 1840s and continued into the 20th century. As you walk through the land, look for the ditches and mounds that continue to mark the edges of long abandoned fields, the “lopped” trees that were bent over to create living fences, and the cleared fields that once grew corn, rye, wheat, and clover.  </p>",

From this location, the home was not only protected from the harshest winds and storms, but it also provided the family with a view of activities in the lower acreage, Moriches Bay, and Fire Island. Enslaved Blacks developed the lower acreage into an elaborate grid of cultivated fields, pastures and ponds. The farm prospered through the late 18th century and early 19th century, as William Floyd and his son Nicoll employed the skilled labor of enslaved Blacks, free and indentured Indigenous people from the neighboring Poospatuck reservation, and free day laborers.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3a87064e-a240-49e2-ac4e-f57f824ee887}{13}\" paraid=\"1613328374\">When the Floyds scaled back and eventually abandoned farming in the late 19th century, they maintained the fields and trails for recreation and hunting. John Treadwell Nichols, husband of William Floyd’s great-great-granddaughter Cornelia, was Curator of Birds and Fishes for the Museum of Natural History in New York. For John and his son David, the estate was an invaluable resource for the study of birds and animals. While you wander the estate, you might even come across a box turtle that was marked and tracked by John, David, and even now National Park Service staff.  </p>",

It is a phonetic spelling of the word “Pightle,” which referred to a small enclosure near a house or a piece of land in an open field. It initially served as the headlands to the agricultural fields and pastures of the lower acreage, a brief break in the landscape between the manicured lawn of the family home and the commercial enterprise of the working farm. By the 1860s, however, the Floyd family chose to give up farming in favor of careers in politics and law. As the house became a summer retreat for hunting and entertaining guests, the Pikle became a borderland for the forest that grew up around the home. Today, it continues to serve as a haven for wild birds and animals.  </p>",

But, as the family grew and needs changed, each generation put their mark on the home, whether this was by adding new rooms or changing the function of already established spaces. </p> <p paraeid=\"{90ee9454-4d85-4920-8486-8aa46693dfff}{46}\" paraid=\"546982494\">William Floyd inherited the home, wealth, and status of the family when he was just 20 years old. Roughly a month after proclaiming his support for independence in July 1776, William Floyd and his family were forced to flee their estate as British forces moved to occupy the grounds. Redcoats quartered in the Old Mastic House for the duration of the Revolutionary War as Long Island remained a royalist stronghold. According to family lore, “Unka Steve” an enslaved man from Barbados was entrusted with staying behind to observe and report on the occupation of the estate.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{90ee9454-4d85-4920-8486-8aa46693dfff}{108}\" paraid=\"1457700930\">In 1783, Floyd returned to the estate with his family and began the work to restore the estate which was in disrepair after its occupation by the British. Floyd’s 1792 portrait shows the updated and expanded home, with a new main hall and parlor as well as east and west service wings. When Thomas Jefferson and James Madison visited Floyd in 1791, they would have seen a stately manor house and a thriving productive farm. </p> <p paraeid=\"{90ee9454-4d85-4920-8486-8aa46693dfff}{156}\" paraid=\"865784271\">William Floyd left the estate to his son Nicoll in 1803 when he moved with his second wife and two young daughters to Westernville, NY.

Look around and you’ll notice the stout gray and green patches of Beach Heather, lush bushes of Beach Plum, or even the scrubby form of Pines and Cedars.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-8cc5b20d-7fff-19c1-fe61-670c6cf42715\">The “swale”, as this area is called, is the open space between the primary and secondary dune line. Swale’s on Fire Island host a variety of plant species which are often associated with Long Island’s coastal environments. Many of these plants are not as well adapted to the harsh conditions of the ocean beach as American Beach Grass, but they are still quite hardy. As the American Beach Grass primes the environment by constructing protective dunes and forming soil through decomposition, they are succeeded by the plants we see here. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-8cc5b20d-7fff-19c1-fe61-670c6cf42715\">“Succession” refers to the gradual process of change in an ecosystem brought about as one community of plants is replaced progressively by another. On Fire Island we can travel through time through different stages of succession as we move from the ocean to forest. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-8cc5b20d-7fff-19c1-fe61-670c6cf42715\">Most of the plants which call the swale home are well-adapted to its unique conditions. Swales can be hot spots. Situated between the two dune lines, swales often lack a comfortable breeze. Swales are also sunnier environments, as the white sandy faces of the two dunes refract light into the swale like a sun reflector one might use to tan on the beach. Because of this, swales are arid and desert-like habitats, sometimes even supporting cacti and other desert-like species.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-8cc5b20d-7fff-19c1-fe61-670c6cf42715\">One iconic swale plant is Bayberry. Bayberry bushes have several unique adaptations designed to help them survive in the sunny swale. They are easily identified by the presence of the small whitish berries to which they owe their name. Observe the berries closely and you will see a thin coat of wax which helps the berry to retain moisture. As wax is hydrophobic, water is unable to escape the berry, preventing them from shriveling up in the hot sun. This wax has been used traditionally in the production of special “bayberry candles” often associated with good fortune when burnt on cusp of the new year. </b></p>",

Past the little Indian reservation of Poospattuck…through the spring mudpuddles of 'Oak Arch', into Squirrel Lane and up the little rise onto the lawn.

They often intermarried, raised children, worshipped, ate, farmed, and celebrated together.  </p>",

Their cabin, along the banks of what became known as Lon’s Creek, was an informal gathering spot for the community of Black and Indigenous workers traveling between the Poospatuck Reservation, other cabins for enslaved and later free workers, and the estate. Long after his death in February 1860, Lon’s Creek continues to bear his name.  </p>",

While cattail is considered native to this region it is considered invasive in some places. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-4931e9a7-7fff-034e-9bd9-847ebf4df175\">Throughout the world, species of cattail have been made useful to people in many aspects of life, from agriculture, to building material, and even as biofuel! Native Americans, who were the first to visit Fire Island, had many uses for this plant. The seeds from its punks can be used as tinder to start fires and as insulation. Its stalk, roots and rhizomes can be eaten outright, or used to produce flour for making bread and other baked goods.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-4931e9a7-7fff-034e-9bd9-847ebf4df175\">The abundance of cattail, as well as oysters, clams, and even seals on Fire Island meant that Native American Tribes such as the Unkechaug of Poospatuck often visited and made use of the island and it’s resources. The Unkechaug were famously skilled whalers who launched their boats from these shores. Since long before the arrival of European colonists, this land has been a home and haven to many.</b></p> <br />  ",

Looking closely to brush before you and you may see its decaying trunk and skyward roots. The holly tree that once stood here came down during Superstorm Sandy in October of 2012. It’s collapse is a troubling sign. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-00e18d30-7fff-fef8-7182-4d15be6e2cf5\">Tree’s falling in forests, of course, is not uncommon. In fact, trees collapsing due to illness or other factors is an important part of the natural life of forests. Decaying trees, branches and leaves enrich the soil of the forest, providing food for the plants which would grow up in its place. As trees fall they open up holes in the canopy overhead, allowing light to reach down to plants where it could not before. This allows young trees and saplings to grow in its place. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-00e18d30-7fff-fef8-7182-4d15be6e2cf5\">The natural replacement of one tree with another is part of the process that fuels the succession we talked about before. In stable “climax communities” when an adult tree dies it is replaced by its own young. For reasons we outlined at our last stop this process is being interrupted. You may notice, for example, sapling Black Cherry trees growing in this holly’s place. Black cherries, though tasty to us, are not particularly popular with deer. Their leaves are packed with cyanide and likely to upset their stomachs when eaten. This results in what is called “selective grazing” where herbivores actively shape an ecosystem by eating some things and avoiding others. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-00e18d30-7fff-fef8-7182-4d15be6e2cf5\">Black cherries, while native to this area, are common on Fire Island, thus the rare maritime holly forest is slowly being replaced by a more common habitat, representing a loss of global biodiversity.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-00e18d30-7fff-fef8-7182-4d15be6e2cf5\">But why did this tree fall in the first place? Recall when we discussed the rising water table, and thinning “vadose zone” while visiting the freshwater bog. Look below the boardwalk and you may see standing water beneath the holly tree’s roots. For many years this tree grew up in dry soil. By the time the tree collapsed, it’s soil was inundated with water which likely contributed to “root rot” and it’s eventual fall.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-00e18d30-7fff-fef8-7182-4d15be6e2cf5\">All around the Sunken Forest water is appearing in places where it did not before. Scientists in the park have been observing this phenomenon, monitoring the water table and testing it for salinity from sea water. It appears as though the water table on Fire Island is rising in concert with sea-level rise, one very troubling symptom of anthropogenic, or human-cause, climate change.</b></p>",

While there is plenty of water to the south in the Atlantic Ocean, that water is too salty to drink. The same is true of the brackish water north in the Great South Bay. In light of this, the location in front of you is a critical site for wild animals, as this is part of Fire Island where the island itself dips low enough for fresh rain water to collect. Because of this, this site is an excellent place to observe wild animals such as birds, butterflies, turtles and other creatures.You may also see an interesting assortment of plants such as blueberry and cranberry. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-29b767b5-7fff-8ecd-c0f2-53a2abc55059\">While these small wetlands are critical to the ecosystem of the Sunken Forest, there are some indications of trouble ahead. Over the last sixty years many of these small bogs have appeared to be growing, spreading throughout the forest as the “vadose zone”, the dry space between the water table and the surface of the ground, appears to thin. This thinning has already impacted the ecology of the Sunken Forest, killing some trees and spreading species that were once uncommon here. The tall bushes of groundsel in front of you were once much less prevalent then they are today. Now, as more water appears throughout the forest, groundsel is a more common sight. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-29b767b5-7fff-8ecd-c0f2-53a2abc55059\">Fire Island is always changing, and this dynamic nature is part of what makes it so unique. The Sunken Forest, however, is among Fire Island’s more stable systems. It exists within a delicate state of balance that has persisted for centuries, allowing for the growth of an assortment of trees and other plants that make this such a rare habitat. Today, however, there is evidence of various forces that are actively upsetting this balance. </b></p>",

You are probably familiar with holly. It’s pointed leaves, and the bright red berries of the female plants are often associated with the holiday season. Look closely at the bark and you may also notice its slight greenish hue, and the odd eye-like knots that adorn its surface. Those eyes are, or course, not eyes at all, but the remnants of old branches shed from the tree in a process called “self-pruning.”  </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-b0db69a2-7fff-5585-9696-c982e0a4fbb4\">Ilex Opaca, or American Holly is a broadleaved evergreen native to the Northeastern United States. Though it is hardy, it is not a particularly salt-tolerant plant and so, rarely occurs in this density as close to the ocean as we are now. Protected from the salt spray by the tall set of primary and secondary dunes, these trees have beaten the odds and grown in a most unlikely spot.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-b0db69a2-7fff-5585-9696-c982e0a4fbb4\">There are, unfortunately, signs of trouble in regard to this rare stand of holly trees. Look out to the ground and you may notice almost no young saplings or adolescent holly. Over the last sixty or so years the Sunken Forest has undergone a dramatic transformation. What was once a thick understory is now relatively barren, a worrying sign for future generations. But, what happened to all of the young holly?</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-b0db69a2-7fff-5585-9696-c982e0a4fbb4\">You may be surprised to hear this, but holly saplings are popular food items for herbivores such as deer on Fire Island. Though it’s leaves are sharp and painful in mature holly, young saplings feature soft and juicy leaves. As a result of overgrazing, due in no small part to the exceedingly large population of deer on Fire Island, an entire generation of holly trees is missing from the forest. This means that if and when an adult holly tree dies or is knocked over, its children are no longer there to replace it.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-b0db69a2-7fff-5585-9696-c982e0a4fbb4\">But how can the deer be having this impact on the Sunken Forest only now? The unfortunate answer lies in our hands. There are estimated to be as many as three to four times as many deer on Fire Island then can survive here on their own based on the island's acreage. This unusually dense population appears to be the result of illegal or accidental feeding. Whether they are rummaging through garbage pails, or taking food from the hands of visitors, deer often become sickly or unhealthy from this process. Even still, many survive and reproduce at much higher rates than you would expect in a wild space. As a result of their proliferation, the Sunken Forest and many other habitats on Fire Island have been placed in jeopardy.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-b0db69a2-7fff-5585-9696-c982e0a4fbb4\">What can you do to help both the deer and the Sunken Forest? Above all it our goal to ensure that we keep wildlife wild. This means that under no circumstances should we feed or interact with wild animals such as deer. We must also take care to secure our food and garbage away from deer. With this in mind we can all do our part to take care of this environment holistically, ensuring the health and safety of the deer, the holly, and all of the other plants and animals which make this place unique. </b></p>",

Around here it often referred to as “Juneberry”, though you may also hear it identified as “Serviceberry”, “Shadblow”, “Shadbush”, or “Shadtree.” </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-cfef19f1-7fff-d4a4-9238-aea53aa18b03\">The first name, Juneberry, is likely the easiest to remember and to identify. “Juneberry” comes from the fact that its berries, quite tasty though containing large seeds, often appear and rippen throughout the month of June. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-cfef19f1-7fff-d4a4-9238-aea53aa18b03\">The name “Shadblow” is often tied to a fish called shad which, like salmon in the pacific, travel from the ocean up rivers like the Hudson in order to lay their eggs. Fishermen would use the appearance of flowers on “Shadblow” in early spring to know when the shad run had begun. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-cfef19f1-7fff-d4a4-9238-aea53aa18b03\">The last name “Serviceberry” is among the more interesting names for this tree. Various accounts suggest that the appearance of its flowers in the early spring are often associated with the thawing of winter ice in the ground. This is important, especially up north, when ground ice can prevent the digging of holes. As a result of this tree's timing, it is often planted in front of funeral homes and in graveyards to help indicate the time of year when thawing ground ice allowed for the digging of graves and hosting of funeral “services”. This, of course, is just one of several stories associated with the name “serviceberry.”. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-cfef19f1-7fff-d4a4-9238-aea53aa18b03\">You may notice the odd little holes in this tree. These holes were created by a small woodpecker called a “yellow-bellied sapsucker.” Sapsuckers, as their name implies, poke holes into the side of trees in order to drink their sap.</b></p>",

The location where you now stand exists largely on the outskirts of the Sunken Forest, where fresh water bogs give way to freshwater and saltwater marshes. These marshes are dominated not by trees, but by an assortment of species which are well adapted to growth within habitats which feature consistently wet soil. Native species you may spot from here include swamp rose mallow, blueberry, and some strains of native phragmites. However, most of what you see growing here, these tall cornstalk-like grasses, are of a non-native and potentially invasive variety of phragmites.</b></p> <p> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-da5a9a61-7fff-112c-6b56-97bf6687496d\">Phragmites Australis, or common reed, is a tall and hardy wetland grass broadly distributed and found throughout many parts of the world. Though it’s status is a subject of debate, in many places throughout North America it is considered non-native and even invasive. In the same way that an invader takes over the territory of another group of people, an invasive species aggressively takes over the habitat of a native species. In the case of Phragmites Australis, this takeover is the result of its aggressive root system, its tall overcrowding stalks, and the release of a corroding substance called “gallic acid” by the plant as it decays. </b></p> <p> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-da5a9a61-7fff-112c-6b56-97bf6687496d\">Most of this Phragmites Australis is itself something of a colonial artifact, likely introduced by Europeans during the early to mid-stages of expansion into North America throughout the late 17 and early 1800s. It was often used within the hulls of ships as ballast material, or alternatively as thatching on the roofs of houses. Everywhere European ships landed, Phragmites Australis followed. </b></p> <p><br /> <b id=\"docs-internal-guid-da5a9a61-7fff-112c-6b56-97bf6687496d\">Today Phragmites Australis is closely observed and maintained by the National Park Service, especially in areas where it appears to be expanding. Here in the Sunken Forest Phragmites Australis is considered somewhat naturalized, having replaced native stains of Phramites Australis that came before. Recent DNA evidence suggests that some strains of Phragmites Australis actually predate European colonization, though these strains are usually less common and less aggressive.</b></p>",

From Beach Grass to Bayberry, Pitch Pine to Black Berry Cherry, each plant that has grown on Fire Island has helped to pave the way for what you see here. Look above at the flat canopy overhead and you may start to understand why this place is so unique. Where else on Long Island can you listen to the crashing of ocean waves beneath a canopy of towering trees?</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-a50ae438-7fff-edbc-2635-b593ba2a6c91\">This forest exists in a delicate state of balance. As waves on the beach crash, they toss salt into the air forming what is commonly referred to as “Salt Spray.” To humans salt spray can be quite pleasant, it’s what gives the beach that familiar summer smell, but salt spray can have a harsh effect on plants, sapping their leaves of precious water. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-a50ae438-7fff-edbc-2635-b593ba2a6c91\">As that salt spray travels across Fire Island, carried across by the ocean breeze, it sweeps through the swale and other plant communities. Most of these communities are somewhat adapted to that constant exposure to salt spray, but here in the Sunken Forest the trees are not. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-a50ae438-7fff-edbc-2635-b593ba2a6c91\">So then, how do these trees manage to grow in an environment which is normally so inhospitable to them? The answer lies in the set of ancient dunes you see before you. Here at Sailors Haven we are lucky to have not only a robust and healthy set of primary dunes, those tall hills of sand you saw when you began on the beach, but also a vast system of secondary dunes. It’s this double dune system which acts as a shield, protecting the forest from the effects of salt spray exposure. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-a50ae438-7fff-edbc-2635-b593ba2a6c91\">Though the dunes work to protect the forest from most of the salt spray, containing it upon the beach and within the swale, some of that salt spray continues to sweep above the canopy of trees you see overhead. As it does it actively trims or “prunes” the trees in an effect we call “salt spray pruning.” Pay attention to the height of the trees as you walk through the Sunken Forest. You will notice that as you rise closer to the top of the dunes, the trees will shrink, and as you sink below the dunes the trees will grow. It is as if a “salt spray ceiling” sits above the forest preventing its upward growth. This creates the “Sunken” effect to which this forest owes its name, as the trees appear to have sunk into the dunes they grow upon.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-a50ae438-7fff-edbc-2635-b593ba2a6c91\">When it comes to salt spray, however, it is not all destruction. Even as the salt trims the tree tops, potentially killing the forest if the dunes were to suddenly vanish, that same salt spray is what enables this forest to grow here at all. You see, Fire Island and the Sunken Forest are young ecosystems. Their soil is sandy and thin. Even still, were you to investigate the soil of the Sunken Forest you would find it packed with minerals and nutrients brought in by that same salt spray. Those minerals and nutrients act as food for the trees. Without this delicate balance, this forest would not be here for us to enjoy.</b></p>",

It is easily identified by its three distinct leaves. Look closely and you’ll notice single-lobed leaves, double-lobed leaves which look similar to mittens, and triple-lobed leaves which look a bit like a dinosaur's foot.

While it is no longer very commonly used, having been linked to carcinogenic properties, everything from its roots to it’s leaves were once traditionally been used for medicinal, culinary, and aromatic purposes. It’s many uses made it an extremely valuable plant to the economy of colonial America and the early United States.</b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-43043351-7fff-84e5-7852-0b9a4e3b5f07\">Perhaps most popularly sassafras was once commonly used in the production of root beers and teas. Its dried and ground-up leaves are also an important ingredient in traditional Louisiana-based creole cooking. Oil extracted from its leaves and bark were used in many products for its aroma.

In addition to artificial reduction and other related management policies we believe it is possible to restore balance between the deer and this environment, but only if we are careful to respect wildlife and keep it wild. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e0b4427-7fff-6570-0d1a-edee7c6e4ea7\">As to climate change it is important to remember that human produced greenhouse gases like CO2 are contributing most to the planet's warming, producing a “heat trapping blanket” which envelopes the earth's atmosphere. By reducing carbon emissions from greenhouse gases, and by maintaining and even cultivating habitats like this we could work to offset these effects. It may feel like an overwhelming task, but the future remains unwritten. </b></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e0b4427-7fff-6570-0d1a-edee7c6e4ea7\">Though there are concerning signs of decline due to climate change and due to human interaction with the island’s deer, our scientists are actually quite hopeful. They believe that with respect and proper management, this forest can continue to shade us for years to come.</b></p>",

        "notes": "The Sunken Forest at Sailors Haven\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-sunken-forest-at-sailors-haven.htm\n\n<p>Fire Island's Sunken Forest is a rare ecological community. This type of maritime holly forest is found behind well-established sand dunes along the Atlantic coast from New Jersey to Massachusetts. According to the New York Natural Heritage Program, the Sunken Forest was ranked as \"globally rare,\" meaning there are few remaining occurrences of this assemblage of plants throughout the world.</p> <p>Today you can easily visit and explore this rare habitat from May to October, when ferries run from Sayville on Long Island to Sailors Haven. Throughout the year you may stroll along the boardwalk, although facilities (restrooms) and other services are not available when ferry service is not operating. </p> <h3>How did the Sunken Forest get its name?</h3> <p><br /> The Sunken Forest is dominated by American holly (<i>Ilex opaca</i>),<i> </i>some of which are estimated to be up to 300 years old. Other trees in this forest canopy include the sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>), shadbush or juneberry (<i>Amelanchier canadensis</i>), and other hardwoods. Oaks and black cherry also grow one in the Sunken Forest. However, none of these trees will grow taller than the unique double dune system which protects them. The forest is \"sunken\" behind the dunes.</p> <h3>How old is the Sunken Forest?</h3> <p><br /> The process of succession leading to a climax forest stage can take thousands of years, but most likely took around 300 years in the Sunken Forest.<br /> <br /> Sometime between 200 and 300 years ago the site of the Sunken Forest was an area of bare, windblown sand. But, it was soon invaded by the seeds of pioneering dune plants, like beach grass.<br /> <br /> Woolly beachheather and seaside goldenrod were probably the next plants to grow in this area. These plants not only pioneered, but helped stabilize the habitat by trapping blowing sand.<br /> <br /> There are virtually no nutrients to be derived from windblown sand, so pioneer species got their nourishment from the air, wind-borne minerals from the sea and from land.<br /> <br /> As plant communities became established, they added organic material to the sand, and gradually conditions were created that enabled increasingly diverse plant associations to grow. Early pioneer species then disappeared or declined as species such as post oak, black cherry, and highbush blueberry took hold.<br /> <br /> Over time the black cherry-oak-blueberry-red cedar-pitch pine community was almost entirely replaced by the holly-sassafras-juneberry maritime forest we see today. A core taken from one American holly in the mid-1970s indicated that it began to grow about 1804 -- the year Lewis and Clark started their western expedition!</p> <h3>The Sunken Forest Preserve</h3> <p><br /> First protected from development in the early 1950s by a concerned group of private citizens, a roughly 50-acre tract of beach, dunes and ancient holly forest just east of Point O'Woods was gradually cobbled together through a fundraising campaign spearheaded in 1952 by the Wildlife Preserves, Inc, and The Nature Conservancy. The Sunken Forest Sanctuary was officially dedicated as the Sunken Forest Preserve in 1960. The entrance plaque can still be seen along the western trail entrance.<br /> <br /> In May 1966, the Sunken Forest Preserve, Inc. donated the property to the recently established (1964) Fire Island National Seashore, under the condition that the property shall always be maintained in its natural state and operated as a sanctuary, and that no public road or highway shall be built through it.</p> <h3><br /> Getting to Sailors Haven/Sunken Forest</h3>   <p>Find directions to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fiis/planyourvisit/sailorshaven.htm\">Sailors Haven</a> and the (seasonal) schedule for <a href=\"http://www.sayvilleferry.com/\">Saville Ferry</a>.</p> <h4>Take a Field Trip or Join a Park Ranger-led Tour</h4> <p>Tours are offered for school groups and visitors from May through October.

In 1774, he was appointed a representative for New York in the 1st Continental Congress. It was in this capacity that on July 6, 1776, he dared to sign the Declaration of Independence. It was act of treason, and an act that set the country on its path to independent and democratic rule. His granddaughter, Julia Floyd Delafield recounted his story of the signing, \"When they were about signing the paper Gen'l Floyd was talking with ---- a man of feeble frame and delicate health.

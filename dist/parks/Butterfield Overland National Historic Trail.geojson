Alongside the road is a long berm, a narrow hill or ledge along the edge of the road created when during the building process. Erosion from weather and use has made the berm very high in some places and can be easily seen today. <br /> <br /> The Cross Hollow site is a landmark on the old Springfield, Missouri to Fayetteville, Arkansas Road created in the 1830’s. This road is now known as the Old Wire Road due to it being the route for the first telegraph wire in the region.  The Cross Hollow area was well known to early travelers and is noted in some journal entries as X Hollow.  All of the Cherokee detachments that did not turn to the west in the vicinity of Little Sugar Creek in Benton County would have traveled the old road through Cross Hollow.  <br /> <br /> The Taylor Detachment came through Cross Hollow March 20, 1839.  William Isaac Irvins Morrow, a physician traveling with the Taylor detachment, mentions in his journal: “March 20, 1839 Wednesday 20th Cloudy & cool – traveled 15 miles to the X Hollows, eat dinner at Homeslys & came on 5 miles to Fitzgerald’s...”  An earlier treaty party detachment, a group of Cherokee who moved west in 1837 before the forced removal of the Cherokee Nation in 1838-1839, led by B.B Cannon came through the area in December of 1837 camped here at Cross Hollow.<br /> <br /> Cross Hollow is a special site on the Old Wire Road.

The Fitzgerald’s took advantage of their location by establishing an inn and tavern on their farm. By the late 1830s it was a well-known stop for travelers. It became a supply source for many of the Trail of Tears Cherokee removal detachments in the late 1830s.<br /> <br /> All of the detachments that did not turn west in Benton County north of here would have passed by the Fitzgerald Farmstead. One of the detachments was mentioned by William Isaac Irvins Morrow, a physician traveling with the Taylor detachment, who noted the Fitzgerald farm in his journal:</p> <blockquote> <p>March 20, 1839. Wednesday 20th Cloudy & cool – traveled 15 miles to the X Hollows, eat dinner at Homeslys & came on 5 miles to Fitzgeralds in company with Cox Fields Hemger & George D. Morrow. A mean house.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Some Cherokee moved west before the forced removal in 1838-1839 that became known of the Trail of Tears. B.B Cannon, a disbursing agent who accompanied an earlier group kept a journal recording that they used much of the same route, passing by Fitzgerald Station, and receipts show numerous purchases from John Fitzgerald in December of 1837.<br /> <br /> Most Cherokee detachments next took a road to the southwest from Fitzgerald’s and travelled through the small settlement of Shiloh on their way to their destination in Indian Territory. Some of the detachment leaders travelled south into Fayetteville as well.<br /> <br /> John and Mary Fitzgerald played an important role as they were witness to Cherokee removal and sold needed provisions to the weary and often sick Cherokee.

Formed thirty four million years ago when magma entered an older limestone formation and then cooled, the Hueco geology emerged as weather eroded away the limestone and carved the odd sculptural hoodoos seen today. Hollows, known as huecos, populated the rock surfaces, catching rainfall where microhabitats developed and supported a diversity of plants and animals.</p> <p>The presence of water in this Chihuahuan Desert environment also drew humans following the end of the last ice age. Hunter-gatherers crossing the region found the huecos to be a reliable source of water, leaving designs painted on the rocks as they passed through. Many of these pictographs survive and perhaps the most compelling are those left by a group of people we call the Jornada Mogollon. Rather than just passing through, the Jornada hung around, occupying the Hueco site starting sometime around 1150 A.D. They built pithouse structures, planted simple crops, fashioned stone tools, and painted animals, birds, and large-eyed storm deities across the rock surfaces. The Jornada also painted more than two hundred “masks” or face designs, considered the largest known assemblage of pictographic “masks” in the country, beneath rock overhangs, within boulder shelters, and at other odd and hidden places throughout the site. This well-preserved (and protected) collection of pictographs is part of the Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site, administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and can be seen on guided and self-guided tours. The Historic Site also offers camping, hiking, and some of the best bouldering and rock climbing in the state.</p>",

Highlighting such surnames as Domínguez, Armendariz, Apodaca, Peña, López, Nuñez and Holguin, the cemetery documents over a century of life and death in the 17th-century settlement of Socorro del Sur, located on the southern segment of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, locally known as the Mission Trail. The cemetery only tells part of the fascinating survival story of the Socorro Mission of Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción (Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception) and the community it has served for more than 300 years.<br /> <br /> St. Michael has since been widely revered as Socorro's protector -- especially after the mission's survival as another flood raged through the area in 1872. However, the end of commercial activity on El Camino Real when the railroad arrived in the 1880s did not spare the community. Nor was it spared the modern development of the 20th century that further fragmented the area. Yet in the 1990s, when years of trapped moisture and deterioration threatened to destroy Socorro Mission, various powers intervened to ensure its protection.<br /> <br /> The community launched a full-scale church restoration that resulted in the making of 22,000 adobes to stabilize walls, repairs to the bell tower, and conservation of cherished interiors. After seven years of work, St. Michael resumed his place beside the altar, and the doors of Socorro Mission opened to new generations. With every new baptism or graveyard burial at Socorro Mission today, the story of Socorro del Sur and the legacy of El Camino Real carry on.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(328 S.

In 1788, the site was the chosen spot to locate a strategic military stronghold on New Spain’s western frontier. Soldiers from San Elzeario (also San Elceario), a decommissioned Spanish fort in Guajoquilla, Mexico (present-day Chihuahua), occupied the new presidio to defend area residents and El Camino Real caravans from Apaches. Like the fort it replaced, the new presidio was named in honor of San Elzear, the French patron saint of soldiers.<br /> <br /> Today, the presidio chapel continues to anchor San Elizario as an active parish. Four vertical bells and four horizontal buttresses bring an imposing symmetry to the relatively small building, which is set in a frame of low masonry walls and a dramatic sweep of front steps. The stark white building paints a picture of purity and stability in an ever-changing world. Despite centuries of change, El Camino Real, today’s Glorieta Road, still leads residents and visitors to and from the chapel at the old presidio.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (1556 San Elizario Road, San Elizario, New Mexico)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/texas-presidio-chapel-of-san-elizario.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The old stone walls stand today as a testament to the spirit of change that early travelers, station keepers, and stage drivers carried as they passed this way over a century and a half ago.</p> <h4><strong>The Pinery Trail</strong></h4> <p>Travel the short 0.75 mile path from the Pine Springs Visitor Center to the ruins of the old Pinery Station, once a favored stop on the original 2,800 mile Butterfield Overland Mail Route. The trail is paved, rated easy, and wheelchair accessible. Pets are allowed on leash.</p> <h4><strong>Preservation of the Ruins</strong></h4> <p>The ruin is fragile; climbing on the walls can destroy this piece of history. It is preserved by the National Park Service as a window to the past, in the relatively unchanged, rugged setting that stage riders and Mescalero Apaches saw more than one hundred years ago. With the help of careful visitors to protect it, this historic location will continue to reflect the spirit of courage and adventure which commanded the senses of long-ago travelers, and still stirs in those who ride this route today.</p> <h4>On the Butterfield Trail</h4> <p>“In the bright moonlight, we could see the Guadalupe Mountains, sixty miles distant on the other side of the river, standing out in bold relief against the clear sky, like the walls of some ancient fortress covered with towers and embattlements.” Waterman L Ormsby, the only through passenger on the first westbound stage of the Butterfield Overland Mail, wrote these words in September of 1858 as he approached the Guadalupe Mountains. Upon arriving at the Pinery Station at Guadalupe Pass he wrote; “it seems as if nature had saved all her ruggedness to pile it up in this form of the Guadalupe Peak.”<br /> <br /> The Pinery was one of approximately 200 way stations and relay posts along the 2,800-mile Butterfield Overland Mail route, which made biweekly runs from St. Louis to San Francisco. Prior to the Butterfield, mail to California left the East Coast by boat, traveled around the southern tip of South America, and then all the way back up to California. The Butterfield Overland Mail traveled an average of 120 miles per day, making the cross-country route in a maximum of 25 days. In addition to carrying mail, the Butterfield stage carried passengers who were squeezed into three rows, often times three abreast with their knees interlocked, baggage in their laps, and mailbags under their feet. For the passengers, this could be 25 days of pure torture. It was a long, exhausting journey with all too infrequent stops. Passengers suffered through cramped conditions, rough roads, extreme heat in the summer, intense cold in the winter, and the ever present threat of an Indian attack. At one point in his journey Ormsby wrote, “Our driver’s ambition to make good time overcame his caution and away we went, bouncing over stones at a fearful rate. To feel oneself bouncing now on one hard seat, now against the roof, and now against the side of the wagon was no joke.” Upon arriving in San Francisco, one passenger remarked, “I know what Hell is like. I’ve had twenty-four days of it.”<br /> <br /> The Pinery Station, named for nearby forests of pine, had the distinction of being the highest station on the route at 5,534 feet. Nearby Pine Springs supplied all the water needed for horses, drivers, and thirsty travelers. When Ormsby arrived in 1858, the Pinery consisted of little more than a heavy, pine timber corral and a couple of tents. Shortly after Ormsby passed through, a high walled rock enclosure was constructed that protected three limestone walled rooms, a blacksmith shop, and a water tank. The station maintained a change of horses and provided meals of venison pie and baked beans to stage drivers and weary travelers. After the meal, the first weary travelers jolted slowly down the pass on their rough-riding stage. Shortly after sunset, near the base of Guadalupe Pass, the westbound coach from St. Louis pulled alongside the eastbound from San Francisco. The excited passengers and drivers exchanged comments about their history-making encounter. For the brief space of a converstaion, the ends of the continent were connected. But there was mail to deliver; and the stages rolled on as contracted.<br /> <br /> The Pinery was one of the most isolated stations on the Butterfield route. It was also one of the most spectacular, being located in the heart of the rugged Guadalupe Mountains. Despite the discomforts Ormsby experienced as he passed through the Guadalupes, he still had the time to marvel at the grandeur of these mountains and to appreciate the beauty of this rugged landscape. Today in our fast paced world of high speed transportation and wireless communications, the Guadalupe Mountains still endure as a wilderness.</p> <h4><strong>Operations at the Pinery Station, 1858</strong></h4> <p>When the conductor, his driver, and their sole passenger made their first call at the Pinery, there was little to see: a stout corral built of pine that had been cut and hauled from the mountains above, and the tents that housed the station keeper and his men. But two months later the station consisted of a high-walled rock enclosure protecting a wagon repair shop, a black smith shop, and the essential replacement teams of fresh horses. Three mud-roofed rooms with limestone walls offered a double fireplace, a warm meal, and a welcome retreat from the dusty trail of the plains below.<br /> <br /> Pinery Station was built of local limestone, in a fortress like pattern. High rock walls formed a rectangular enclosure with a single entrance. The three mud-roofed rooms were attached, lean-to fashion, to the inside walls, which afforded safety and protection from Indian raids. These walls, built of limestone slabs and adobe, were 30 inches thick and 11 feet high. The station's water supply came from Pine Spring through an open ditch to a tank inside the station. A stockade of heavy pine posts protected the main entrance on the south. In the southeast corner of the enclosure, a thatched shelter covered the wagon repair shop and smithy. Livestock were kept in the stone-walled corral on the north end.<br /> <br /> There was more activity about this station than one might suspect. The station keeper was Henry Ramstein, a surveyor from El Paso. He supervised six to eight men who worked as cooks, blacksmiths, and herders. Four times a week the distant sound of the conductor's horn announced the arrival of the mail coach with up to nine passengers. Express riders dashed through at all hours, road crews stopped off, and tank wagons filled up at Pine Spring, rolling on to fill water tanks along the dry stretches. Freighters and mule pack trains added to the passing traffic.<br /> <br /> There were fearful moments, as when an army scout brought word that Indians were sighted in a nearby canyon. All stock was quickly herded inside the station, bars were secured across the entrance gate, and every man stood ready with his Sharp's rifle. At times, soldiers were garrisoned at the Pinery to guard against Indian attacks, which led to stories that this ruin was once a government fort. There was also news of tragic happenings. On one occasion a rider reported that the three men who had built this station were murdered with axes at a mail station in Arizona by three of their helpers. Their construction foreman, St. John, was still living, but had suffered an axe blow that severed his arm. On another occasion an express rider brought news of an Apache attack in Arizona which stopped the mail and left the station keeper and a passing emigrant family massacred.<br /> <br /> The Butterfield Mail Coach continued to come through the Pinery for 11 months until August 1859, when this route was abandoned for a new road that passed by way of Forts Stockton and Davis. The new route better served the chain of forts along the southern military road to El Paso, and was better protected against Indian attacks. A total of ten stations were abandoned along the Guadalupe route and 16 were added along the \"Fort Trail.\" But long after its abandonment, the old Pinery Station continued to be a retreat for emigrants, freighters, soldiers, outlaws, renegades, and drovers. It is now a fragile remnant of an early endeavor to span the continent with the first reliable transportation and communication system ever attempted.</p>",

        "notes": "Wire Road\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/wire-road.htm\n\nThe Wire Road, which runs through Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield, has a colorful history. Thousands of years ago, buffalo and other wildlife created natural paths across the Ozarks. Native Americans established migratory routes on these trails including the current Wire Road. French trappers, Spanish explorers and settlers from Tennessee and Kentucky used the route to access new areas and resources like iron, zinc, lead, timber, and stone. A portion of another Native American route, the Trail of Tears, lies just outside Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield, a remnant of the tragic era of forced removal of tribes including the Cherokee.<br /> <br /> By 1836, the young Missouri state government had established a formal road between Springfield and Fayetteville, Arkansas. Emigrants of European descent soon settled in the Wilson’s Creek area on the rich bottomlands near this main thoroughfare.In 1846, Joseph Burdin began carrying mail on a route from Springfield, Missouri, to Fayetteville, Arkansas, using a two-horse stage. One of the stops was the home of postmaster and farmer John A. Ray, who lived near Wilson’s Creek. The Ray farmhouse, which stands in the national park today, continued as a mail stop when John Butterfield founded the county’s first transcontinental mail service – the famed Butterfield Overland Mail Co. Between 1858 and 1861, Butterfield stagecoaches spirited mail and passengers from St. Louis down to Arkansas and on to California on a 2800-mile journey lasting 25 days (traveling day and night). John Ray’s home was the first unscheduled stop for Butterfield coaches after leaving Springfield. But the coming of railroad and telegraph ended the overland stages.<br /> <br /> Telegraph revolutionized communications during the Civil War. The U.S. military installed telegraph wire along the road from Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis to Fort Smith, Arkansas. The Union depended on telegraph communications, and when Southern troops or sympathizers cut telegraph lines, Federal troops often responded by burning homes near damaged lines. On August 10, 1861, John Ray sat on the front porch of his home on the Wire Road and watched smoke rise from fighting in his cornfield during the battle of Wilson’s Creek. His wife and children hid in the cellar during the fighting. Though the home survived and none of family was injured, their life changed dramatically, as the home became a field hospital and they lost much of their produce and livestock to soldiers. Over the next four years of the conflict, the Wire Road, also known as the Military Road, served as a major corridor for supplies and troops between Arkansas and Missouri. The road remained a mail route and Ray continued as postmaster until 1866.<br /> <br /> Today, the “Old Wire Road” no longer connects one point to another, but traces may be found on farmland, in conservation areas and at Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield. You can step onto the Wire Road in front of the John Ray Home at Tour Stop 2, and also may walk down the tour road a short distance west, where a marked walking trail continues along the old Wire Road route. The Wire Road trail also crosses the tour road near Tour Stop 5.",

        "notes": "Ysleta Mission\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/ysleta-mission.htm\n\n<p>Today at the mission, the community’s unique integration of Indian tradition with Christian religion is expressed in a profusion of Native motifs—rain clouds, corn stalks, baskets, blankets and more—that flow through the church’s neoclassical interiors. The display is an unexpected contrast to its Spanish Colonial Revival facade with sparse architectural décor. The cultural, architectural and spiritual juxtapositions reflect the disparate influences that have impacted Ysleta Mission during the more than 300 years since residents first made their way down El Camino Real to face an unknown future in El Paso del Norte (present-day Juárez, Mexico) in New Spain.<br /> <br /> Ysleta del Sur is one of various Indian communities established in the region following the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, when many Tiwa, Piro, Tompiro, Tano and Jemez Indians fled south from New Mexico with embattled Spanish settlers. The Tigua had left Isleta Pueblo, which was founded as a Spanish Franciscan mission after the Spanish colonization of New Mexico in 1598. Many Isletans stayed at the pueblo following the revolt. When Spaniards made a failed attempt to reclaim New Mexico a year after the revolt, additional Isletans joined their retreat back down El Camino Real to join the Tigua settlement on the south banks of the Rio Grande. Some of the Native Americans feared the revolt and chose to follow the Spaniards south, while others where forced to retreat to El Paso del Norte.<br /> <br /> As members of a federally recognized tribe and sovereign nation, the only Indian pueblo in Texas, Ysleta del Sur’s native peoples maintain a strong presence in the lower El Paso Valley. Despite the modern development of many tribal lands, and ongoing legal disputes over land titles, Ysleta Mission remains a spiritual hub of the Tigua. Inside the mission today, statues of St. Anthony and Kateri Tekakwitha, the Catholic Church’s sole American Indian saint, share close quarters. Outside, El Camino Real runs along Socorro Road to the east and parts of Alameda to the west. Ysleta del Sur’s complex cultural landscape endures, distinguishing it as a place where missions and roads may rise and die, but history prevails.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (131 S Zaragoza Rd, El Paso, TX)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> Onsite facilities include the church, an adjacent school, gift shop, and administrative office.<br /> <strong>Exhibits</strong><br /> Several historical markers are located near the front of the church.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/texas-ysleta-mission.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

        "notes": "Big Spring\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/big-spring.htm\n\nBig Spring was one of Missouri's first state parks. It was a state park from 1924 until 1969 when the people of Missouri donated it, along with Alley and Round Spring State Parks to the National Park Service to become a part of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. A gift from Missouri to America.<br /> <br /> The Big Spring area contains the Big Spring of course, but also a campground, a picnic area, a dining lodge, trails and housekeeping cabins. The area is known as the CCC historic district as many of the structures were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps when it was a state park. <br /> <br /> The Big Spring is sometimes called America's biggest spring. In reality there are three contenders for that title: Big Spring, Idaho's Snake River Spring Complex and Florida's Silver Spring. Since the flow from springs varies with local rainfall, any of these three might be biggest on any given day depending on the weather in Missouri, Idaho and Florida! The truth is they are all about the same size.<br /> <br /> In any case, at an average daily flow of 286 million gallons of water, Big Spring is an awesome sight and a geologic wonder. Underground passages carry water from as far as 45 miles away to emerge at the spring. Studies have shown that the water is carrying a load of dissolved limestone equivalent to 70 tons a day! This dissolved rock gives the spring its color and is also carving out a huge conduit underground. Should the spring ever go dry, a huge cave will be the result.<br />  ",

Once called the “Spring of the Summer Sky”, it displays a vivid deep blue color that is attributed to its depth and mineral content. The color changes hue based on storm run-off and amount of available light penetrating its surface. At 310 feet it is the deepest spring in the state.<br /> <br /> For perspective, the Statue of Liberty could be placed in the spring and only her torch would be visible above the surface. Early surveyors tried to measure the spring by tying an anvil to a rope and lowering it down into the spring’s depths. At a certain point, pressure caused the anvil to hover rather than sink further, so surveyors kept feeding vast amounts of rope and concluded the spring was bottomless. The 17-acre area around the spring is designated as a Missouri Natural Area for its outstanding biodiversity and aesthetic beauty.<br /> <br /> This natural area is managed by the Missouri Department of Conservation, while the Current River and surrounding area are administered by the National Park Service, as part of Ozark National Scenic Riverways.  ",

The road is very steep and rough, it is not recommended for trailers or large motorhomes. There is no admission fee for Devils Well and the area is open every day, during daylight hours. There is a motion activated light that will come on if you are standing on the viewing platform. You may wish to bring your own flashlight or spotlight, however.<br /> <br /> A 4.6 mile foot trail leads from Devils Well to Cave Spring on the Current River. Water from Devils Well has been traced to the outlet of Cave Spring. By walking the trail, you can see where the water in Devils Well goes. It's a moderately strenuous hike.",

Walter, son of a Prussian German immigrant, was a progressive thinker. He was the first in the neighborhood to introduce both barbed and woven fence wire and a refined breed of milk cow. He sawed logs into boards for his house and out-buildings, and routinely saved \"good boards\" for use in building coffins for his neighbors. He frequently ground corn free for neighbors \"on starvation,\" i.e. those who could ill afford to leave him the customary toll of grain.</p> <p>Klepzig Mill is a type of building referred to in the vernacular as a \"sawmill house.\" It was a building type that tended to replace log construction after the arrival of sawmills in a locale. A sawmill house could be erected quickly and by only one or two people. Instead of stud-wall framing, vertical planks were nailed to a hand-hewn sill at the bottom and a sawn two-by-four plate at the top. The resulting wall panels, fabricated flat on the ground, were then raised into place. Battens might then be added to cover the seams. Foundations were often piers of uncut and un-monitored native stone.</p> <p>Klepzig Mill is not much to look at with its various accouterments and modifications-- cement spillway, scrap metal hinge from the hood of a Model \"A\" Ford truck, old corrugated iron roof. Still, it is in a spectacular setting, surrounded by the rhyolite rock of the \"shut in\" canyon made by Rocky Creek. It is a lasting testament to the hardships of every day life in the Ozarks in a time not so long ago.</p> <p>To reach Klepzig Mill take Highway H (east of Eminence and Winona) to Highway NN. You'll pass the sign for Rocky Falls, this is a pleasant stop also. Turn left on County Road #522. This can be muddy during the rainy season and is narrow, not recommended for large motorhomes or trailers. Klepzig Mill is less than a mile on the right. There is no sign or defined parking area, and it's easy to miss in summer vegetation, so watch carefully. It is also possible to hike to Klepzig Mill from Rocky Falls along the Ozark Trail, or park at the end of the pavement on NN and walk up the dirt road. (Don't block traffic!)</p>",

Few places in the Ozarks provide a glimpse of earth’s turbulent past as well as Rocky Falls. The reddish-brown rock you see here is rhyolite porphyry. It formed as molten rock deep within the earth and flowed onto the surface about 1.5 billion years ago. At the time, no living thing existed to see the awesome flow of glowing hot lava slowly advancing over the barren landscape.</p> <p>Normally, a stream eroding softer dolomite, a type of limestone, would make a wider valley for itself. Since the rhyolite is harder, the stream tends to stay within whatever cracks that it finds, deepening them only a little by erosion. Thus a“shut in” is formed where the harder rock has “shut in” the stream. Farther downstream, past the constricting rhyolite, the stream valley widens once again. This allows the stream to expand into a pool.</p>",

Yes, hospitals. Back in 1913, an Illinois doctor named C.H. Diehl bought Welch Spring for eight hundred dollars. Dr Diehl believed that the spring water had healing properties and that cool, pollen free air coming from the adjacent cave would be beneficial for people with asthma, emphysema, and tuberculosis, which together were called \"consumption\" at the time. He said that it worked for him, helping him with a chronic case of hayfever. To tap this clean air resource, Dr Diehl built a hospital over the mouth of the cave. Welch Spring, which flows from the cave, was dammed up so that water would close off the entrance. This was to force more air out through the cave opening into the hospital. In today's terms, it might be better called a \"health spa\" since there wasn't much in the way of formal medical treatment, just an invitation to breathe the fresh air of the cave.</p> <p>Dr Diehl was not blind to the scenic values of the region either. He hoped to run a thriving campground resort to supplement his medical fees with tourist dollars. In time his healing resort expanded to a few small cabins, a campground, a show cave and he even had an electric generator running off the spring. Visitors came from the local area and from as far off as Oklahoma and Illinois, but times were hard and travel to such remote places still difficult.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the hospital and resort were not a big success. Roads in the Ozarks were rough and unpaved, making it difficult to get into the Current River Country. Few tourists were willing to make the trip. The good doctor died in 1940, and his family did not have much interest in keeping up the resort afterwards, which soon fell into ruin.</p> <p>Was Dr Diehl just a man ahead of his time? In time, tourists did discover the Current River, over a million come to canoe, camp, hike and fish every year. As for his medical ideas, he wasn't out of step with his times. Many people at the time believed in the healing qualities of cave air and spring water. It was almost a cliché for people to take a vacation to \"take the waters\" at one spring centered resort or another. This was the heyday of the healing spas at Hot Springs, Arkansas among others. Years earlier a tuberculosis sanitarium had been built in Mammoth Cave, some three hundred feet underground. The hospital is a ruin today, but still stands next to the beautiful Welch Spring.</p>",

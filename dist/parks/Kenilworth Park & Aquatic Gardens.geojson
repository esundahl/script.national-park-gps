Shaw. The water gardens blended plant sales with aesthetic beauty. After 1912, Shaw's daughter Helen led the company. Together, family members and hired laborers dug ponds, planted, nurtured, and harvested aquatic plants. <br /> <br /> Along with being available for purchase by local residents, plant shipments were sent every week to New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. </p> <h3>A Floral Experience in Washington, D.C. </h3> <p>Thousands of blooming flowers drew hundreds of Washingtonians to these aquatic gardens on summer weekends during the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> Visitors came from all walks of life and included government officials, plant lovers and those who just wanted to picnic for an afternoon. <br /> <br /> President Woodrow Wilson and his wife, as well as First Ladies Florence Harding and Grace Coolidge frequented the gardens and became friends with the Shaw family.<br /> <br /> In 1938, a Washington Post reporter wrote: \"The ponds are separated by dikes with grassy paths, shaded by large trees making a picture of satisfying beauty. Acres of blooms reach away in all directions, the surface of the water almost entirely with foliage and blossoms of white, pink, rose, crimson and blue...\"</p>",

Conservation \nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/information-panel-birds-wetlands-and-conservation.htm\n\n<p>Anacostia River tidal marshes were far more extensive a hundred years ago than today. Marshes support amphibians, small fish and insects. This abundant aquatic life attracts herons, egrets, rails and other birds to feed. Over-hunting and draining of the wetland caused the decline of many bird species along the river. <br /> <br /> People dedicated to changing this trend included Paul Bartsch, a local bird watcher, conservationist and professor at George Washington University. The Smithsonian Institution published his study, <em>Herons of the Anacostia</em>, in 1903. <br /> <br /> Angry about losing so many birds to hunting, he and the National Audubon Society successfully lobbied Congress to pass some of the first nationwide laws protecting birds.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service, local governments and non-profit organizations continue restoring wetlands along the Anacostia River. As a result, many herons and egrets have returned.<br /> <br /> Effects are felt far beyond the Anacostia watershed as migratory birds use these wetlands as a stopover on their journeys.</p>",

An adult mussel can filter between 10 and 20 gallons of water a day. Mussels remove sediment from the water, depositing it on the river bottom. They also eat E. coli and other kinds of bacteria!<br /> <br /> Due to pollution and habitat loss, freshwater mussels are one of the most imperiled animals in the world.<br /> <br /> The Anacostia Watershed Society is working with partners like the National Park Service to restore the freshwater mussels of the Anacostia River. </p> <h3>The Unsung Heroes of the Anacostia River: Freshwater Mussels at Work</h3> <p>Notice the difference in water clarity between the two containers above. The left one contains live freshwater mussels. The container on the right has no mussels in it. <br /> <br /> Mussels can be hard to see as they spend their lives on the river bed. Shown here: Eastern eliptio. </p> <h3>What is a Freshwater Mussel?</h3> <p>Mussels are aquatic animals with soft bodies and hard, hinged shells. They remove excess nutrients like Nitrogen and Phosphorus from water. This promotes aquatic plant life that supports habitat for other animals. <br /> <br /> Visit www.anacostiaws.org to learn more about mussels and find out how you can get involved!</p>",

Under her guidance the gardens grew into one of the most extensive water plant businesses in the nation. By 1938, Shaw Gardens encompassed 42 ponds spread over nine acres and contained 500,000 plants. Widely respected, Fowler traveled the world to collect lilies and roots. The botanist and curator of the U.S. National Herbarium gave her a letter of introduction to directors of botanical gardens in the West Indies and South America. <br /> <br /> The business was progressive for its time. In addition to being woman-owned, Helen Fowler employed a number of local African American residents. She was the first woman in Washington, D.C. to have a commercial driver's license. <br /> <br /> Local women's organizations such as the YWCA and the Women's Improvement Club of Silver Spring, Maryland, recognized Helen's role as a business owner and invited her to speak on several occasions. <br /> <br /> \"Presiding over the whole establishment- ponds, pools, greenhouses, studio- is a woman, Mrs. Helen L. Fowler\" - 1935 article in the Washington Post. </p> <h3>From Commerce to Community</h3> <p>A proposed expansion of Anacostia Park by eminent domain, to include a seizure of the Shaw Gardens, sparked by a 19-year legal battle. <br /> <br /> Helen Fowler led the Shaw family in opposing this plan by the federal government. With public and political pressure weighing against her, Helen Fowler agreed to sell the gardens to the government in 1938, for $50,000.<br /> <br /> She lived on this property, serving as an authority on aquatic plants and advisor to the national park staff, until her death in 1957. </p> <h3>The Helen Fowler Water Lily (Nymphaea odorata)</h3> <p>In 1900, Shaw introduced a deep rose-colored water lily named after his daughter, Nymphaea odoratam 'Helen Fowler.'</p>",

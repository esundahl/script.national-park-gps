The modest 450-unit complex was hailed at the time as a cutting-edge example of worker housing. It was designed with winding streets, spacious yards, simple wood duplexes and fourplexes and a community center and park.Today, Atchison Village is a viable planned community that is a living part of the park. There is a park entrance sign as you enter the neighborhood.<br /> <br /> <strong>Note</strong>: Visitors may view the village during a driving tour.

However, many cannery workers were Italian, like its founders, and were affected by the new law designating Richmond a “defense prohibited zone.” As a result, many community elders lacked U.S. citizenship and were forced to move away from Richmond.

This area (bounded roughly by Cutting Boulevard, 45th Street, San Pablo, and the Santa Fe Railroad) held the most intense concentration of Japanese American families and their nurseries, which specialized in growing carnations, roses, and other cut flowers, primarily for the wholesale market.<br /> <br /> After Japanese Americans were forced to leave behind their homes and businesses in Richmond and incarcerated, many of their nurseries in were vandalized and fell into disrepair. A few, such as the Ninomiya’s in North Richmond, found friends or neighbors who cared for their nurseries on their behalf while they were imprisoned.<br /> <br /> However, a comparatively high percentage of the original owners were able to return and revive their nursery businesses in Richmond. After reclaiming their businesses, the Oishi and Sakai nurseries were operated by members of the original families until the properties were sold ca. 2006.<br /> <br /> This area has been redeveloped as housing and a park, featuring a handful of historic nursery buildings that were relocated and have been restored for adaptive reuse. The development, called “Miraflores,” holds a series of interpretive elements that tell the story of the nursery families and other aspects of community history.<br /> <br /> <strong>Note: </strong>None of the original greenhouses remain in this area. The location has been redeveloped into a park and housing. Visitors may explore the Miraflores Sustainable Greenbelt park trail. Please always be mindful while parking and exploring any area. </p>",

Kaiser provided child care for families working in his four Richmond shipyards during WWII. The child care centers he built with funding provided by the United States Maritime Commission incorporated progressive educational programming, and innovative curriculum and services including art classes, well-balanced hot meals, health care, and family counseling.One of the largest facilities in Richmond was the Maritime Child Development Center, opened in 1943. Completely restored and reopened as a multi-use building in 2011, today it houses a small exhibit by the National Park Service of a wartime preschool classroom. On regularly scheduled guided tours, visitors have the opportunity to explore the vital role of federally funded childcare in bringing women into the WWII work force. Tours are available by appointment as well.<br /> <br /> The Maritime Child Development Center was one of approximately 35 nursery school units of varying sizes established in the Richmond area during World War II in order to provide child care for women working in the Kaiser shipyards. In 2012, the Rosie the Riveter Trust, partnering with the National Park Service and many partners throughout the city and school district, completed a $9 million historic renovation of the building and won a LEED Gold for Schools award. The Trust now operates the building on behalf of the park. It houses a K-3 charter school, Richmond College Prep, and the Richmond Community Foundation, along with a National Park Service exhibit room which can be visited on scheduled tours.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Occasionally, the park offers guided tours of an historic classroom inside the building.

During the creation of the memorial, the National Park Service was invited to participate, and this partnership led to the founding of the National Park in Richmond, California.</strong></p> <p>Designed by visual artist Susan Schwartzenberg and landscape architect/environmental sculptor Cheryl Barton, the Rosie the Riveter Memorial: Honoring American Women's Labor During WWII is the first in the nation to honor and describe this important chapter of American history. Chairwoman Donna Powers led the campaign to establish the Memorial and the sculpture was commissioned by the City of Richmond and the Richmond Redevelopment Agency.<br /> <br /> The principal component is a walkway, the length of a ship's keel, which slopes toward the San Francisco Bay and aligns with the Golden Gate Bridge.The path is inscribed with a timeline about the home front and quotes from women workers sandblasted into white granite. Sculptural elements of stainless steel encountered on the walkway are drawn from ship's blueprints and suggest the unfinished forms of hull, stack and stern under construction. Two gardens - one of rockrose and one of dune grass - occupy the location of the ship's fore and aft hatches. Porcelain enamel panels on the hull and stack reproduce memorabilia and letters gathered from former shipyard workers during the course of the Memorial project, along with photographs of women at work in jobs across the nation.<br /> <br /> The panels, quotes and timeline illustrate the complex opportunities, challenges and hardships faced by women during the war years, including gender discrimination, hazardous working conditions, food rationing, and shortages of housing and childcare.<br /> <br /> Donna Powers was inspired to create the Memorial by two women in her family. Her mother-in-law Ruth Powers was a teacher at the Richmond shipyards daycare centers and her great aunt Clarissa Hicks was a riveter at Douglas Aircraft in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Their wonderful stories led her to ask other women around Richmond what their jobs and lives were like during WWII, and the project grew under the leadership of historian and cultural planner Donna Graves.<br />  </p> <h3>How to Listen to the Audio Program</h3> <p>The play button is the small sideways triangle on the left side of the audio player, below.

        "notes": "SS Red Oak Victory Ship\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/ss-red-oak-victory-ship.htm\n\n<h2>Historic WWII Ship</h2> <p><strong>Audio program available on this page in web browser or on the official NPS app. </strong><br /> <br /> The Victory ship <em>SS Red Oak Victory</em> was built in Richmond Kaiser Shipyard # 1, and launched on November 9, 1944. It was one of 414 Victories built during World War II, but one of only a few of these ships to be transferred from the Merchant Marine to the U.S. Navy. The Red Oak Victory served as an ammunition ship in the South Pacific during WWII. The ship was named for the town of Red Oak, Iowa, which suffered the highest per capita casualty rate of any American community during World War II.<br /> <br /> Following a fitting out period, the <em>Red Oak Victory </em>was loaded with cargo and departed San Francisco for Pearl Harbor on January 10, 1945. Red Oak Victory departed Hawaii on February 10 loaded with munitions needed in the Marshall and Caroline islands. Sent onward from Eniwetok, she arrived in Ulithi on February 28, 1945, and then began operating under Commander Service Squadron Ten. Operating out of the Philippines, the vessel issued cargo and ammunition to various ships in the fleet through the end of the war in August 1945. During a hazardous tour of duty in the Pacific, <em>SS Red Oak Victory </em>handled many tons of ammunition, supplying the fleet without a single casualty.<br /> <br /> Many Rosies recounted how important their jobs were in welding these ships and how careful they were in doing it. They realized the lives of their husbands, brothers and sons depended on the cargoes delivered by these ships. Victory ships were not supposed to last long--but the welds of the <em>Red Oak Victory</em> are still intact after 60 years. The Red Oak Victory is 455 feet in length, and armed with one five-inch/38 caliber gun; one three-inch/50 caliber gun, and eight 20 mm guns. The vessel was decommissioned in 1946 and returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission. <em>Red Oak Victory</em> was used by the Luckenback Steamship Company from 1947 through the 1950s, during which time the vessel went to Japan, Korea, Cuba, Pakistan, India, Singapore and Japan.<br /> <br /> The <em>SS Red Oak Victory Ship </em>is the last surviving ship built in the Kaiser Shipyards, and is owned by the non-profit Richmond Museum Association. Today, the <em>Red Oak Victory </em>remains a monument to the men and women who worked in war related industries as part of the World War II Home Front. In 1998, the ship was saved from the Naval Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay by a courageous group of men and women and has been under restoration since that time. When visiting, take the time to talk to the volunteers on boards the ship. If you are lucky enough to find one who actually served on Merchant Marine vessels during the war, find out what that life was like - ask them how they felt to be on board ships built by women.<br /> <br /> <strong>Note: </strong>The SS Red Oak Victory Ship is now oriented differently than what the photo depicts. <a href=\"https://redoakvictory.us/\">Tours of the ship </a>are offered by the Richmond Museum Association on Sundays from 10am-4pm. There is a $10 sugessted donation. Visitors may view the ship from the outside on days that tours are not offered. </p>",

At a weight of close to 230 thousand pounds, this crane is the only one left of dozens that were used to help build ships at record speed. The scale of it, is enormous, like a revolving boxcar sitting on massive legs as tall as a 10-story building. Whirley cranes were used to move very large and heavy components from place to place in the shipyard. The cranes could work alone or in unison and could manage enormous amounts of steel while lifting and moving large, prefabricated components into place during the assembly of ships. A single Whirley crane could lift up to 166 thousand pounds, alone.<br /> <br /> Today, Shipyard No. 3 is the only remaining shipyard of the four constructed in Richmond.

Several participants in the 1848 First Women’s Rights Convection in Seneca Falls, New York had already labored in the antislavery movement. The organizers and their families, the Motts, Wrights, Stantons, M’Clintocks, and Hunts, were active abolitionists to a greater or lesser degree. Frederick Douglass, noted abolitionist and former slave, attended and addressed the 1848 convention.</span></p> <p>Arguments for women’s rights came from experiences in the antislavery movement. As reformers, women developed organizational skills necessary for a successful social movement. They learned townie persuasively, raise funds, organize supporters and events, and to speak to large groups of men and women about important social and political issues. In the service of antislavery, many women found their voice.</p> <p>At the 1848 First Women’s Rights Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, drafted by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Elizabeth and Mary M’Clintock, was read and signed by 100 men and women. Claiming that “all men and women are created equal,” the signers called for extending to women the right to vote, control property, sign legal documents, serve on juries, and enjoy equal access to education and the professions.</p> <p>Today at Women’s Rights National Historical Park, the connection between the organizers of the 1848 convention and anti-slavery movement is incorporated into interpretive programs. The M’Clinock House in nearby Waterloo, a site on the Underground Railroad, offers a unique opportunity to learn about the relationship between these two reform movements of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>",

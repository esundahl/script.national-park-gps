        "notes": "Camp Tulelake\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/camp-tulelake.htm\n\n<p>The Camp was first built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1935, but later housed Japanese Americans in 1943 then German Prisoners of War from 1944 - 1946. It is located on Hill Road approximately two miles north of the Klamath Basin Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center.</p> <p>The site is currently closed to the public and can only be viewed from outside of the monument. Visitors are welcome to take pictures of the buildings and view the road side exhibits from outside the fence.</p> <p>Rangers are staffed between Memorial Day and Labor day at the visitor center. The visitor center is located 8 miles south of Tulelake CA along Hwy 139 at 44340 Hwy 139. Tulelake, CA 96134. We are the only driveway off the hwy between County Rd 113 & 176.<br />  </p> <hr /> <hr /> <h3>Camp Tule Lake History</h3> <p>Camp Tulelake was constructed in 1935 to house Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) enrollees. Of the many CCC camps in the local area, Tulelake is the only one still standing.Construction of the 23-building camp began in June by an advance group composed of civilian crews, a foreman, carpenters, and plumbers. The four remaining buildings include: a barracks, the kitchen/mess hall, the garage/storage/shop, and the paint shop.</p> <h4>Civilian Conservation Corps</h4> <p>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was established in 1933 by President Franklin Roosevelt to provide six months to two years employment and vocational training for young men ages 17-28. CCC enrollees were paid $30 a month, $25 of which was sent home or put into a savings account. The CCC program lasted more than nine years and enrolled a grand total of more than 2.5 million men.Enrollees at Camp Tulelake constructed a duck hospital, an administrative headquarters, the supervisor’s residences, and a lookout cabin on the bluff behind the Refuge Visitor Center. Mexican American stone masons constructed over 300 feet of rock wall around the Refuge Headquarters.</p> <h4>Camp Tulelake and the Klamath Reclamation Project</h4> <p>Together Camp Tulelake and Camp Klamath played a large role in the expansion of available land for the Klamath Reclamation Project. They built water control structures of timber and concrete, dug ditches, repaired ten breaks in the canal banks, and increased the Clear Lake reservoir's capacity by about 60,000 acre-feet.As enrollees left the camp to join the war effort the camp was closed during the summer of 1942.</p> <h4>Japanese Americans</h4> <p>Camp Tulelake became a makeshift jail when over 100 men from Tule Lake Relocation Center refused to complete the loyalty questionnaire. The men were first sent to county jails, but a judge determined that they had not broken any laws. The WRA, fearing others would follow the protesters’ example, then confined the men at isolated Camp Tulelake. It was several months before they returned to the reloaction center.<br /> <br /> While there, incarcerees completed $2,500 in repairs to the buildings, including installing new stove pipes, repairing the sewer systems, and repairing or replacing doors and electrical fixtures.<br /> <br /> After the Tule Lake War Relocation Center was converted into the Segregation Center, farm workers went on strike when a young farm truck driver was killed in a car accident. They demanded better working conditions, and that the food they grew would stay in Tule Lake—which was experiencing food shortages—rather than be shipped to other centers.To break the strike, 243 Japanese American workers were brought from other war relocation centers to bring in the harvest. They were eager to help with the farms’ harvest, especially when offered $1.00 an hour instead of the usual WRA rate of $12.00 a month. Housed in Camp Tulelake, the men never learned that the Tulean farmworkers had gone on strike over unsafe working conditions. The strike failed, and after a few months, the men returned to the other incarceration centers.</p> <h4>Italian and German Prisoners of War</h4> <p>With so many local men and women participating in World War II, the town of Tulelake did not have enough hands to bring in the harvest, so the Tulelake Growers Association petitioned the US Government for help.The federal government replied by sending 150 Italian Prisoners of War in May 1944. The Italian POWs converted the area to accommodate the German prisoners that would start arriving from Camp White (near Medford, Oregon) in June.The Italian POWs lived in tents in the town of Tulelake while they set up fences, barbed wire, latrines, water lines, guard towers, and search lights around the camp.At its peak in October 1944, the camp housed 800 German POWs who helped plant, tend, and harvest onion and potato crops. Without their help and hard work, local crops would not have been harvested before the harsh winter set in.POW’s lived and worked in the area until the camp was closed in 1946. Some even applied for the lottery of local homesteads, but none were drawn.</p> <h4>After the Camp Was Closed</h4> <p>In 1946 the Army transferred the camp back to the Fish and Wildlife Service. At this time three of the barracks were moved to the Sacramento Wildlife Refuge for staff quarters. One section of a building was converted into a muskrat skinning shed. This shed was converted into a covered lumber drying shed in 1963.During the 1950’s many of the buildings were used for storage, and the mess hall was converted into temporary housing.</p> <h4>Pacific Region Sign Shop</h4> <p>Located inside the north end of the remaining barrack, the Regional Sign Shop produced signs for all wildlife refuges in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada and Hawaii. Sign production started in May 1960 and continued until it closed in December 1974. During its operation the sign shop produced over 6,000 wood, metal, and colored signs.<br />  </p> <h4>Restoration Projects</h4> <p>Starting in 2006, the Klamath Basin Wildlife Refuge Association (KBWRA) received a “Preserve America” grant to begin stabilizing one portion of the barrack. With the help of local volunteers donating over 800 hours the KBWRA was able to re-level approximately 4,000 square feet of the floor, and replaced the deteriorated wood shingle roof with a temporary protective sheet metal roof.In an effort to restore the building to its original look, four windows were reinstalled to their original locations, a stone fire chimney was removed, and non-original interior walls were removed.</p> <p>Restoration work is ongoing.</p> <p> </p>",

The last groups of homesteaders were drawn in lotteries from 1946 to 1949.<br /> <br /> The pickle jar became the choice for homestead lotteries after the fish bowl became too small. The 1946 drawing held at the armory in Klamath Falls included one thousand three hundred and five names typed on the slips of paper, put into capsules and placed into this three gallon pickle jar. Only 86 names were drawn.<br /> <br /> This pickle jar was filled for the last time in 1949 in the American Legion Hall in Tulelake. Eighty six out of five thousand names were drawn.<br /> <br /> With these drawings they had to have drawings for them because there were so many more applications than there was plots of land available. In the halls was always full. There is always there full of people who are sitting in a desk, people, a lot of them on the edge of the seat, hoping that their name would be the next one drawn out. But the ones that were there, why, they let out a good yell. The tension was there and everybody was just waiting to because they knew it was an opportunity there. They were getting an opportunity for new life in a new community. And it was really something to see.<br /> <br /> When we got down there where we had guys that came next to us were navy. 'Course we were all army men, two Navy.<br /> <br /> The morning at the we went to move out on our site, when it snowd, and when I got out there close to it, I put the car in second gear and opened it wide open and headed out. And when I hit the yellow post-it, mark my land the phone to the right of it out on the land, And where it got stuck, that was home.<br /> <br /> We spent some time in the tent. The wind blew and mercifully that spring and that poor old tent, what kind of rock and it wasn't real, real comfortable. The dirt came in, of course, and we had our grain stored, our seed grain stored in the tent so it wouldn't get wet.<br /> <br /> Move on to the Korean War display.<br /> <br /> Members of our community served under the command of General MacArthur to help protect South Korea from conquest by North Korea, when war broke out in 1950.<br /> <br /> When I got to Korea, they put us in some high walled camps for a while. Then they were building the Quonset hut barracks after a fashion. We were being woken up at night, sometimes with the small aircraft flying over the runway, dropping hand grenades, which they call bed check Charlie. I never did figure out why they didn't go after that guy, but they just let him do it night after night, probably a couple of nights every week.<br /> <br /> Between August 5th, 1964, and April 30th, 1975, three point four million military personnel served in the Vietnam War.<br /> <br /> The minute that door opened and you started walking towards the tarmac, the heat was just beyond anything, I'd and I'm a Phenix, Arizona boy, and this was a heat like I've never experienced, the humidity was up 105 percent, was probably 108 degrees, and it was eight o'clock at night.<br /> <br /> I think there was one period of over three months that we weren't without any fresh meat or fresh vegetables. A typical breakfast was one spoonful of eggs. What are sort of green dehydrate would have been reconstituted out of powdered eggs at one spoonful of square dehydrated potatoes and possibly two little small Vienna sausages and one piece of bread without any butter or jam.<br /> <br /> Rarely ever did you get to see the bad guy because his whole mission in life was to just Pick at you and run. They said we lost the war. We didn't lose the war. We fought it the best way we could. We were just as proud and dedicated to our own brothers as they were. We were just dealt a different kind of card.<br /> <br /> The official end of America's direct involvement in Vietnam was April 30th, 1975.<br /> <br /> Step over to the farming and ranching display.<br /> <br /> Just as the United States is a melting pot of people from all parts of the world, so is this region. Sharing of education's travel experiences, agricultural knowledge and skills have created these diverse communities. <br /> Where have you found Nettles growing? You knew it was the finest soil. And as you know, we have lots of wild metals in this country, and it was also an indicator of water.<br /> <br /> I had my first job when I was seven and Ray was nine. We delivered papers in the morning and milk in the afternoon and we got along fine. But I always wanted to ever do was be a cowboy.<br /> <br /> The tractors gradually came in and replaced the horses in our area has a beautiful soil. Some of the best soil actually in the world.<br /> <br /> You should now be standing in front of our current issues. This concludes the indoor segment of your audio tour.

These have been recreated from actual petroglyphs.<br /> <br /> You are invited to visit Petroglyph Point, just southwest of the peninsula and about 10 miles south of Tulelake. Here is one of the largest panels of rock art in the United States.<br /> <br /> Next, meet Modoc Indian Ivan Jackson, descendant of Captain Jack. <br /> <br /> (Modoc language). Hello, how are you, my friend? My name is Ivan Jackson. The language I just spoke if of the ancient Modoc. Professional from all over the world, came here in the mid eighteen hundreds to study my people. Our real name in the Modoc dialect is (Modoc language) \"The people of the ancient time\". The language in the Basque country separates the Modoc culture from any other in the world. I welcome you to the world at the age of Modoc. (Modoc language)<br /> <br /> Step forward to learn about the Lava Beds.<br /> <br /> Known as the land of burnt out fires, the Lava Beds national monument occupies over forty six thousand acres on the northeast side of Medicine Lake Volcano. The landscape offers outstanding volcanic terrain and more than four hundred and thirty six lava tube caves. The greatest concentration in North America.<br /> <br /> In addition to its geologic features, the monument encompasses Petroglyph Point and the main battlefields of the Modoc War.<br /> <br /> Located about 12 miles southwest of here. The monument offers long and short hiking trails through very important geological and historical areas. Interpretive exhibits, lava tube caves and develop trails await your exploration. Further information is available in the museum's gift shop. <br /> <br /> Please continue to the immigrant trails display where you will find a map and pages from an immigrant's journal.<br /> <br /> It began as an unconnected series of trails used by Native Americans and was expanded in the eighteen twenties and thirties by fur traders. American explorations and westward migration began in the 40s in 1843. The first large wagon train made the five month journey on what was then known as the Oregon Road.<br /> <br /> The Applegate family was part of that first large wagon train. Two of their children drowned when a raft overturned on the Columbia River, making the Applegate brothers determined to find a safer route.<br /> <br /> The Applegate trail that followed the northern shore of Tulelake was blazed in 1846. It passed by Merrill, then across the southern shore of lower Klamath Lake and on to the Willamette Valley.<br /> <br /> That area was settled as a direct result of the the Appalachian Trail. Most days, 10, 12 miles is what they would make per day. And they basically they went waterhole to waterholes. For one thing, most people walk. Most people think that they they rode the wagons, that the wagons were not the kind of stogel wagons that are portrayed in the movies. These were much smaller wagons. And, you know, the box might be six or eight feet long at the most length, four feet wide. And oftentimes they would carry feed inside those wagons. It would be stacked when they came across grasses. They would cut the grasses and place them inside the wagons. And of course, they had their possessions in there. They used oxen, no horses.<br /> <br /> Move on to the display of the Modoc Indian War. You should now be standing in front of Gillems camp.",

The stronghold, the Modoc's one half mile square natural fortress of deep crevices and jagged boulders of molten lava is in front of you to the left. The Peace Commission's meeting place tent is to the right.<br /> <br /> Modoc in the Tulelake region in the eighteen forties, began objecting to an increasing stream of immigrants. Many pass through, but some stayed, and by the eighteen sixties had ranches or settlements in or near the basin. The Modoc felt crowded and threatened. The settlers feared the Modoc.<br /> <br /> Federal officials persuaded the Modoc to leave their land and live with their neighbors, the Klamath Indians.<br /> <br /> Though the tribes were similar and related, there was friction, so the Modoc returned to their traditional land on Lost River. Here Modoc leader Captain Jack wanted a reservation.<br /> <br /> Instead, settlers pressured the army to move the Modoc back with the Klamath Tribe. On November 29th, 1872, the cavalry from Fort Klamath entered the Modoc camp, ordering them to disarm and return to the reservation.<br /> <br /> Words, then shots were exchanged. One soldier was dead and seven wounded. The Modoc headed for the Lava Beds.<br /> <br /> At the same time, another band of Modoc, led by sub chief hooker Jim, was attacked. One Modoc was killed, so in their retreat along the north and east shores of Tulelake, the Indians killed every man they met. A total of 14. The Modoc met at the stronghold and waited.<br /> <br /> The army gathered strength, finally moving near and set up Gillems camp on January 16th, 1873. The next day, they attacked the stronghold, but because of the rough terrain and dense fog, the attack failed. The army suffered thirty seven casualties. Yet no soldier even saw an Indian.<br /> <br /> Modoc lost no one.<br /> <br /> The army reinforced while public opinion in the east forced the president to attempt reconciliation. A peace commission consisting of five men under General Canby was formed.<br /> <br /> Captain Jack's cousin, Toby Riddle, was married to a white man. She acted as interpreter.<br /> <br /> Little progress was made. The army was unable to promise Captain Jack a reservation.<br /> <br /> Captain Jack refused to surrender the Indians who killed the settlers. During a council in his stronghold, Hooker Jim and his followers taunted Jack into swearing he would kill Canby. At the next peace meeting, despite warning by Toby Riddle, General Canby and Reverend Thomas were killed, Meacham was shot and half scalped but survived when Toby Riddle yelled that soldiers were coming.<br /> <br /> Three days later, the Army attacked again, supported by mortars and howitzers.<br /> <br /> After two days of fighting, the Modoc situation was serious. They were cut off from water and harassed by shelling at night. During darkness, the Modoc withdrew and were loose in the Lava Beds.<br /> <br /> Pursuit brought more fighting and bloodshed.<br /> <br /> Hungry and divided by conflict over leadership, Modoc men, women and children began surrendering in small groups. For nearly five months the Modoc with fewer than 60 fighting men held off in Army 20 times their strength.<br /> <br /> It was the most expensive Indian war in the U.S.<br /> <br /> It was the only major Indian war in California.<br /> <br /> It was the only Indian war in which a general officer was killed.<br /> <br /> Continue on to view murals representing local landscapes.",

Klamath Basin grown potatoes were the focal point of the event. A modest barbecue was offered in the basement of the Merrill Community Hall. I<br /> <br /> n 1936. The tradition of crowning a queen began. And soon, the event included a barbecue, parade, displays, football game and a dance.

They had to make your own entertainment. They had dances, special events, special occasion, anything that can be celebrated. My dad used to tell me they used to have this the spring festival when the ice would break on the lake, they'd have a celebration for that. They would have all kinds of celebrations. They had the pioneer days, which started in the 30s. Pretty soon, the city started having regular celebrations there, 40 or 50 or 60, a diamond jubilee.

Ten years of redirecting water resulted in 11 homesteading periods. The town of Tulelake has a rich and colorful history from the early boomtown days following the first rounds of homesteading through the World War two years of a Japanese American internment camp and German Italian P.O.W. camp.<br /> <br /> It has been molded by veteran homesteaders, farmers, ranchers and merchants who collectively provide for its economy. Instead of giving up when things get tough, the citizens persevere and overcome to preserve an agricultural, rural lifestyle in a land full of history, beauty and wildlife.<br /> <br /> I had the greatest life growing up, hunting, fishing, working hard in a family with my dad.<br /> <br /> The schools pretty much followed the homesteaded. When a group of homesteaders that moved in, there's no time delay had kids of their own and there was no place for them to go to school. So they built a school or moved one in.<br /> <br /> And I had a job right after the interview because Mrs. Jacobini was leaving. So I was the teacher, the principal, the janitor, the art teacher, the music teacher, the PE teacher and every kind of teacher at our school. We had to make do. And when you do that, your kids become creative. And the milk cans were frozen over in the winter time and we had to chop the ice out of the milk cans to get the big dipper in, to get a drink of water. And you'd think the children would have gotten diseases, but they were healthy little rascals. They were never absent simply because they had to work too hard when they stayed home. So they'd rather come to school.<br /> <br /> When we got here in 1927, there was no little town of Tulelake. Yeah. Oh, I think the railroad probably was started, gone through and they had a plan for the Tulelake, but we had to go to town of Malin for groceries for the first few years. So they would actually put down a bunch of lumber to hold so their cars could drive through. They would all sink into the ground. So it's probably a lot of lumber up in the main street anyway.<br /> <br /> The town of Tulelake was a rip-roaring frontier town of all things. There were seven saloons and Tulelake at that time. This was at the end of the dustbowl days. And migratory labor came in Tulelake in great numbers at harvest time, especially for the potato picking.<br /> <br /> Up on the hill. Deer went past us and that touch the heart of the hunter. The church was made up, first of all, homesteaders, but everybody was very, very friendly, the whole area.<br /> <br /> And we had lots of community spirit in those days. Everybody got out in helped. And they had dances every Saturday night in the old Legion Hall where we started our school.<br /> <br /> Now exit the first maze in turn left into volcanoes and natural wonders.<br /> <br /> We invite you to take your time in this area to learn the processes that took place to create this landscape. Notice our spectacular geological formations, except for a few deposits of muddy sediment washed upon the basin floor, almost all the rocks in this region erupted as molten lava.<br /> <br /> There are 17 volcanoes in the subduction zone known as the Cascade Range, extending from British Columbia to northern California.<br /> <br /> Among them, Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier and Mount Shasta are some of the world's best known.<br /> <br /> Our own Medicine Lake volcano is the largest in size in the cascade range. The result is a landscape where a great variety of volcanic features can be seen in a relatively small area.<br /> <br /> Now enter the next maze on your left.",

Clear Lake, Tulelake, Lower Klamath Lake and Mece Lake host the more than 400 species of wildlife.<br /> <br /> I realize that we live in one of the finest places on the planet, and one of the reasons for me is the abundance of wildlife that exist here, And also this beautiful symbiotic relationship between the farmers, ranchers and and the wildlife as being caretakers of the wildlife, if you will. But this is the heart of the Pacific Highway, and it's the greatest highway we have in the entire United States. And autumn here it is a sight to see with with millions of geese and ducks. Just to be in a swirl of geese, snow geese, cacklers, Canada geese and ducks and Springer odd animals. One of the finest sounds and sites that you can ever experience in a lifetime. Many times growing up and even recently, I've seen the sun literally darkened down here by geese, thousands upon thousands of them.<br /> <br /> Now, exit and turn left into the reclamation section.<br /> <br /> Established May 15th, nineteen oh five by the Reclamation Service, the Klamath project encompasses about two hundred and ten thousand acres of farmland and thirty thousand acres in the Tulelake and Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuges.<br /> <br /> Included in the system are the Frank Adams Canal and then Brimmer Ditch, purchased by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1906.<br /> <br /> This was the twelfth reclamation project in the United States, but the largest of its time. Purposes included reclaiming land, storing and diverting water for irrigation and controlling flooding.<br /> <br /> The first water flowed to project lands on May 16th, 1907, while the Klamath Reclamation Project is very complex, its system is one of the most efficient in the world.<br /> <br /> The project initially cost the government fourteen point seven million dollars. That cost has been repaid by the users through their annual operation and maintenance bill. The economic benefits of the project continue to far exceed its original expense.<br /> <br /> Continue on to the World War One display.",

The Selective Services Act passed that same year, increased our military from 200,000 to almost four million.<br /> <br /> My dad was drafted into the Army and left on a ship to France. He was on the ship for 14 days. He was on guard duty. The full time is on. He never took his clothes off.<br /> <br /> And it was a trench warfare and the machine guns, everybody in the trench, and then somebody came along and developed a tank or could run over trenches on that jury. Warfare's evolve. commanding general Marine Corps with my dad's regimental commander. He's had a statement, that is Smedley Butler. And I always loved it. And it just they got us surrounded again. The poor bastards.<br /> <br /> The World War one years of 1914 through 1918 impacted our region as they led to the creation of a veteran's preference for homesteading.<br /> <br /> He returned to New York City and saw the Statue of Liberty, and he thought it was the greatest thing. He was glad to be home.<br /> <br /> Continue to the CCC camp.<br /> <br /> Formed in March 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, was one of the first of President Roosevelt's New Deal programs. It was a federal public works project to provide needed jobs.<br /> <br /> The CCC operated under the Army's control, camp commanders had disciplinary powers and corpsman were required to address superiors as sir.<br /> <br /> By September 1935, over 500,000 young men had lived in CCC camps. In all, nearly three million participated in the CCC. The discipline and experience gained soon proved helpful in World War Two.<br /> <br /> Locally, the CCC was very active, instructing most infrastructures that the Lava Beds National Monument and Tulelake National Wildlife Refuge.<br /> <br /> Now see the P.O.W. camp displayed behind you.<br /> <br /> During World War Two, the CCC camp on Hill Road, west of Tulelake was used to house prisoners of war. In May 1944 the first P.O.W.s to arrive were Italian. In June, German prisoners replaced them.<br /> <br /> The purpose of the camp was to provide workers to relieve the farm labor shortage.<br /> <br /> As the first P.O.W.s proved successful in their work, more were ordered with the number peeking at one thousand in September 1945. Tents on a vacant lot in Tulelake were also used to house them.<br /> <br /> We couldn't get help, and of course, they set the high school down and all the high school kids at work, and then we worked with German prisoners over there from the hill there to grab some Mexicans come in. There was another CCC camp down at Gillems camp on the edge, a little bit national monument and the tore this camp down and was one of their functions. And they were trucked back and forth to the camp there on the west side. And they took all the nails out of the board and bent them in a triangle so that if any vehicle tire ran over, it really popped up, and if you didn't get your front tire, you got your rear tire. This provided a tremendous problem over these German prisoners who would scatter these nails out of these truck.<br /> <br /> My mother was the crew boss at the time, and so my grandmother would be cooking lunch and there was never a single thing left.<br /> <br /> The last three hundred and eight prisoners departed the camp November 1945.<br /> <br /> Directly in front of you is our tribute to local war veterans.<br /> <br /> To our courageous men and women in uniform, past, present and future. Thank you. To you we owe our freedom.<br /> <br /> Now turn to your left and enter the third and final maze.",

The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.<br /> <br /> They were serious. They had air raid wardens. Every block, they had blackouts, they had anti-aircraft guns. Everything had come under ration, you had to have stamps for meat, for sugar, coffee, gasoline, clothes. I think we could buy one pair of shoes per year.<br /> <br /> Step over to Paul Christie.<br /> <br /> You have to go back to the time places, circumstances. These things happened. That after Pearl Harbor, people on the West Coast particularly were terrified Japanese was going to attack. People don't realize this, but our intelligence lost the Japanese fleet and they didn't know where they had gone, it was sometime around the Battle of Midway. And they thought the Japanese were headed for the West Coast. Gave us p38 lightnings and sent us down the Orange County Airport. Only five of us. We were defensive Southern California, and we will fly out from there. And every day we expected to see the state, the whole Japanese fleet out. We were six weeks out of flight school. We were flying airplanes we didn't know anything about. And to this day, I don't know if we had any ammunition.<br /> <br /> They were just building the hangars there because it was a B-24s. For some of them, we put tail turrets and some we had sideturrets and come to this and that and put a lot of oxygen lines. And we did everything on the planes.<br /> <br /> Our base had nothing but B-17 flying fortresses. Most of them had 13 guns to those 50 caliber. I was over there twenty seven months. When I came home I got to see my son for the first time.<br /> <br /> Move on to Hank Christianson.<br /> <br /> They shipped us out a few at a time on different ships, and I went on a converted freighter and by the way, over there, they were terrible storms. Ship, you know, real strongly to the right. And I have steel hill plates on my shoes, so I slept on the deck. Well, and it was I was going under the lights and I was on my back. I reached up and caught the lifeline on my hands that hung over the side of the ship. So I slowly worked my way down and waited to the lul of the storm and reached around the stanchion with one hand and got a hold the cable on the other side and reached up, got a hold of the station and slowly inch by inch pulled myself back up on the ship and I laid there. I had my arms around the cable on one side of that, my legs are all over on the other side. And I debated about whether trying to lay there all night until there was help in the morning. And then I thought, well, it was cold too, February, if a wave hit get me hypothermia, would I have to do something? So I decided to try to crawl on my hands and knees up to the hole. When we got back to the States, I took a roll call and they found that they were short eight people.<br /> <br /> Herman Bell speaks of Bird Fairclough.<br /> <br /> He first went to Africa and he told me, walk most of the way around the shoreline of Africa, then to Sicily and from Sicily he want to Anzio. And he laid on that beach for 63 days without a bath or anything. And then he went further into Italy and was sent up on a hill to clean out some some nest gunness up there. And Finally was shot through the arm and he went down into one of those cellar like things. And I just they just shot in there with their machine guns and the bullets were going everywhere. But then he said they didn't hit him with had his helmet on and held up pretty bad. And they said the next morning somebody said, anybody in there better come out because we're going to blow it up. And he said it was an American's voice. And he said, boy, don't I'm in here. And so they came in and got him and took him down and had his arm treated. And they said they were going to shipping out. And I said, no way, you're going to ship me out. He said, I know every one of those places, I'm going back up. So he cleaned out several places up there. So that made it safer. And he went a lot of medals and he earned every one of them.<br /> <br /> Paul Christie speaks of Al Kongslie.<br /> <br /> North African campaign al Kongslie landed with the troops to the south of Casablanca when the ships landed there and you marched all the way across North Africa to Tunisia. And even he fought for ground support for Patton. His orders and now as one of the troops that ambushed the German Hakone. And I was came in as ground support for Al and went all the way through the African campaign, And Cicilia came around and was in the Landingham DayDay and all of the war always Hartmut. Hitler and Tojo had to be stopped<br /> <br /> Dud Lemke.<br /> <br /> We had a cause because we knew the person we were fighting what his intent was.<br /> <br /> Continue to the mural of fourteen hundred and fifty two buildings.",

        "notes": "Tule Lake\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/tule-lake.htm\n\n<p>Tule Lake was one of the 10 camps operated by the War Relocation Authority (WRA) from May 27, 1942, to March 20, 1946 - the period of Japanese-American incarceration where 110,000 Japanese-Americans were forcibly removed from their homes and communities and incarcerated.<br /> <br /> Tule Lake became the largest of the 10 WRA camps, with a peak incarcerated population of 18,789 people, and a total of 29,840 individuals were incarcerated at Tule Lake over the lifetime of the camp’s operation. It comprised 7,400 acres and contained more than 1,700 structures. Nikkei were housed in more than 1,000 barracks, served by latrines, mess halls, and other communal buildings. The camp also contained a post office, a high school, a hospital, a cemetery, factories, railroad sidings, two sewage treatment plants, hog and chicken farms, water wells, and more than 3,500 acres of irrigated farmland. WRA facilities included 144 administration and support buildings. A prison-like atmosphere and lack of freedom was apparent with the 28 guard towers, multiple security fences, a military police compound, and a high security stockade and jail. Tule Lake was also the primary site where 6,000 Japanese Americans renounced their U.S. citizenship.<br /> <br /> Tule Lake was the last WRA camp to close, remaining in operation seven months after World War II ended. The administration of the center was returned to the Bureau of Reclamation on May 5, 1946. The dismantling of the segregation center occurred quickly. Barrack buildings were given and sold to new homesteaders in the Tule Lake Basin. In the early 1950s, plots of land within the camp boundary were auctioned by the Bureau of Reclamation to establish the town of Newell.<br /> <br /> Tule Lake survivors and their family members were ostracized and stigmatized as being “disloyal” by the general public and within Japanese American communities long after World War II. Deep rifts continue today among individuals and organizations within the Japanese American community due to the loyalty questionnaire. There is strong consensus among scholars that Tule Lake’s history is the “untold story” of the incarceration during World War II<br /> <br /> <strong>Tule Lake Sites</strong><br /> The <strong>Tule Lake Segregation Center</strong> area includes the original jail, stockade, and portions of the motor pool and post engineer’s yard. These features retain historic integrity and are essential for conveying the history of Tule Lake. This area is a National Historic Landmark and is owned and managed by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> The <strong>Peninsula/Castle Rock</strong> was within the boundary of the historic Tule Lake Segregation Center. Originally an island in Tule Lake, it contains an 800-foot bluff called Castle Rock by incarcerees. Atop Castle Rock is a replica of the cross that was placed there by Nikkei incarcerated at Tule Lake before it became a segregation center. The Peninsula is managed primarily for raptor and wildlife habitat. It is located in the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge and co-managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It is closed to public access.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camp Tulelake</strong> is a former Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp that was established in the 1930s. During World War II, after the CCC program ended, the camp was used to imprison more than 100 Nikkei from Tule Lake who protested and refused to answer the loyalty questionnaire. It was used again shortly after segregation to house Nikkei strikebreakers brought in from two other WRA camps to harvest the crops. The Tule Lake strikers had demanded better living and working conditions and refused to harvest. Between 1944 and 1946 the camp housed German and Italian prisoners of war who worked as farm laborers in the Tule Lake Basin<br /> <br /> <strong>Visiting Tule Lake</strong><br /> Begin at the Tule Lake Visitor Center, 8 miles south of the City of Tulelake on Hwy 139.

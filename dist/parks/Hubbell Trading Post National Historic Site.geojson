Its name comes from the family who built it in the years following the Civil War. It was originally the private residence, built in 1868, of James L. (Santiago) Hubbell, a merchant and trader; his wife Julianita Gutierrez-Hubbell; and their twelve children, all of whom were born in the house. Lorenzo, the third child, followed his father's trade and established the well-known <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hutr/index.htm\">Hubbell Trading Post</a> in Ganado, Arizona (on the Navajo Indian Reservation), a historic site that is now managed by the National Park Service. The Gutierrez-Hubbell house later served as a trading post, a stagecoach stop, and the local post office. This 5,700-foot, 150-year-old adobe hacienda features 28-inch-thick walls and 10-foot ceilings with pine vigas.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(6029 Isleta Blvd. SW, Albuquerque, New Mexico)<br /> <br /> <strong>Available Facilities </strong><br /> The property consists of the main house, which is surrounded by 10 acres of cultivated farmland.

        "notes": "Bird Key Wreck\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/bird-key-wreck.htm\n\nThe Brick Wreck is one of many wreck sites within Dry Tortugas National Park. These islands, shoals, and reefs have been the scene of nearly 300 shipwrecks. The proximity of these reefs to the nearby shipping lanes of the Gulf of Mexico has made them a natural “ship trap.”<br /> There is no specific information on the circumstances surrounding the wreck. All that is known is that the grounding and loss occurred sometime between 1857, the first date that the firebricks found on the wreck were manufactured, and 1861, the last date that the yellow construction bricks were produced for the Federal government. There were at least two types of brick found on the wreck. Unmarked yellow bricks matching those used in the construction of the major parts of Fort Jefferson were found, along with refractory bricks used to line the ship's firebox. The refractory bricks are dated and have \"Evens, Howard St. Louis\" markings, indicating that the ship could not have sunk before 1857.<br /> Remains indicate that it was a screw-driven, narrow-beamed, shallow-draft, flat-bottom steamboat of composite construction. The vessel had a large, six-foot, four-bladed wrought iron propeller with flared blade tips. The ship was driven onto Bird Key Bank with the engine running, whether by accident or intentionally. The bow struck the bank and \"accordioned,\" breaking the ship into two separate pieces. After settling onto the bank, the ship was salvaged, with removal of the engine and most of the ship's machinery. Further scattering of materials resulted from storms and hurricanes. <br /> <br /> Today, marine life is in abundance around Bird Key wreck. The paddle-like propeller and other remains provide a habitat for lobster, coral, and reef fish. This site is best explored by snorkeling in the shallow, 4-6 feet deep waters on Bird Key Bank. The wreckage and its associated coral are fragile. All shipwrecks, artifacts, and coral are protected within the park, please do not take or touch!",

However, a civilian was the most famous prisoner at the fort. After narrowly escaping the death sentence by a single vote, Dr Samuel A. Mudd was convicted by a military commission to a life of incarceration at Fort Jefferson. He arrived in July 1865 with three other conspirators in the assasination of President Abraham Lincoln. In four years, Dr. Mudd lived in several locations but he was kept on the second tier, above the sally port for most of his sentence. Mudd attempted escape but was caught and spent time in what is known as the dungeon. However, after chief surgeon Dr. Joseph Smith and four nurses died from yellow fever, Mudd helped treat many victims and increased overall morale at the fort. President Andrew Johnson later pardoned him in 1869. </p> <p paraeid=\"{125c3d9d-77b6-49d0-9e91-eb1e2f9f90a0}{6}\" paraid=\"1686176075\">During the period Fort Jefferson was used as a prison wooden partitions sealed off access to parade grounds along the second level.

        "notes": "Fort Jefferson\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/fort-jefferson.htm\n\n<p>Fort Jefferson was built to protect one of the most strategic deepwater anchorages in North America. By fortifying this spacious harbor, the United States maintained an important \"advance post\" for ships patrolling the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida. Nestled within the islands and shoals that make up the Dry Tortugas, the harbor offered ships the chance to resupply, refit, or seek refuge from storms.<br /> <br /> The location of the Tortugas along one the world's busiest shipping lanes was its greatest military asset. Though passing ships could easily avoid the largest of Fort Jefferson's guns, they could not avoid the warships that used its harbor.<br /> <br /> In enemy hands, the Tortugas would have threatened the heavy ship traffic that passed between the Gulf Coast (including New Orleans, Mobile and Pensacola) and the eastern seaboard of the United States. It could also serve as a potential staging area, or \"springboard\" for enemy forces. From here they could launch an attack virtually anywhere along the Gulf Coast.<br /> <br /> <b>A powerful deterrent</b><br /> <br /> Poised to protect this valuable harbor was one of the largest forts ever built. Nearly thirty years in the making (1846-1875), Fort Jefferson was never finished nor fully armed. Yet it was a vital link in a chain of coastal forts that stretched from Maine to California. Fort Jefferson, the most sophisticated of these, was a brilliant and undeniable symbol that the United States wanted to be left alone. Though never attacked, the fort fulfilled its intended role. It helped to protect the peace and prosperity of a young nation.<br /> <br /> During the Civil War, Union warships used the harbor in their campaign to blockade Southern shipping. The fort was also used as a prison, mainly for Union deserters. Its most famous prisoner was Dr. Samuel Mudd, the physician who set the broken leg of John Wilkes Booth.<br /> <br /> Abandoned by the Army in 1874, the fort was later used as a coaling station for warships. In 1898, the USS Maine sailed into history, departing the Tortugas on its fateful mission to Havana, Cuba. Though used briefly during both world wars, the fort's final chapter as \"Guardian of the Gulf\" had long since closed.</p>",

However, this lower level room in Bastion D served as a dungeon for prisoners being punished. Dr. Samuel Mudd was quartered in the bastion “D” cell after attempting to escape on a supply boat. Englishman and confederate soldier of fortune George St. Leger Grenfel had no regard for regulations or authority and was sentenced to the Dungeon on many accounts. Grenfel was described as “a ferocious looking man, six feet tall with a muscular figure and the appearance of a bandit.”</p>",

By the time the lighthouse was removed and approval for the new one was authorized, Fort Jefferson had been under construction for 30 years. The light was mainly used as a beacon, since the much stronger light on nearby more adequately, Loggerhead Key guided ships around the treacherous reefs.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{79cb2a76-75e8-467b-9ecf-a06abb90c42c}{170}\" paraid=\"1806915891\">Iron was used since brick could shatter and spread flying debris into the fort if hit by cannon fire. The use of iron also made it possible to build a sturdy, yet comparatively lightweight structure that required minimal surface area- important factors considering the tower’s location. The light house stands 37 feet above the terreplein and just over 80 feet from ground level below. The bottom tiers of the iron light house were built in a hexagonal shape. The top two tiers of the lighthouse are cylindrical, with an observation deck midway up and a windowed room at the top.   <br /> <br /> Harsh marine conditions of Dry Tortugas have affected the structural integrity of the harbor light. General maintenance and repairs were completed in 1930s, 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s. The most recent repairs in 2021 disassembled the lighthouse and removed it to an off-site facility for repair and complete rehabilitation. The Harbor Light was returned in 2022. </p>",

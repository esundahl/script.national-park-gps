        "notes": "Big Rock Candy Mountain Bike Trailhead\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/big-rock-candy-mountain-bike-trailhead.htm\n\n<p>The Big Rock Candy Mountain Loop Trail goes south through Marysvale Canyon and back through Long Valley. The portion through Marysvale Canyon is paved until you reach the Whistle Point Trailhead near the big Rock Candy Mountain Resort, where many amenities are available. From there the rest of the trail is unpaved trail and dirt roads until you return to the paved portion further north at the highway 89. ATVs are prohibited on the paved section but are allowed on the historical unpaved portion.<br /> <br /> Back in the early to mid-1800s, traders along the Old Spanish Trail reached a difficult decision when they approached this section of trail. They had to decide to take Long Valley or Marysvale Canyon, both having advantages and disadvantages. The canyon followed the river, which was a crucial resource for travelers and their mules but was extremely difficult to pass due to the thick vegetation and rushing water leaving little space for travel. Long Valley was open and easier to traverse but was longer and lacked water. Ultimately the pack mule caravans chose Long Valley because they could rejoin the river after only a day.<br /> <br /> The mountain itself was named after the song by Harry McClintlock in 1928. Known for its interesting caramel yellow color and beauty, this cluster of hills was named after a group of early Utah residents, who after hearing the song, placed a sign at the base where the Big Rock Candy Mountain Resort sits today. The same group named a nearby spring “Lemonade Spring,” which name has also stuck and is now a local popular spot.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(2727-2747 Sevier Hwy, Sevier, UT 84766)<br /> The trailhead is in Sevier, Utah, right next to highway 89. This section of the Old Spanish Trail follows the Northern route as pack mule traders traded good between Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Los Angeles, California. The trailhead has ample parking and restrooms, along with a trail sign and other interpretation providing information about the old railroad that used to run through the canyon.<br /> <br /> The paved path heads south through Marysvale Canyon and is five miles long. It is mostly downhill and is rated as easy. It follows right beside the river and provides a cool breeze and shade from the canyon walls depending on the time of day. Grasses, shrubs, and trees surround you for most of this portion of the trail. As you head down the path you can see an old tunnel that was used for the railroad but has now since been abandoned. <br /> <br /> The unpaved portion begins at the Whistle Point Trailhead near the Big Rock Candy Mountain Resort. This path is 19 miles long, rated as moderate to strenuous, and offers a harder challenge than the paved portion. The valley provides a more open space allowing for a wider viewshed of the area, especially at the valley overlook point indicated on the map. Vegetation is sparser here due to lack of abundant water, but shrubs and cottonwood trees are still prevalent.<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olsp/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.sevierutah.net/\">More Site Information </a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=04DBD07D-05D9-4060-B9C3-FBD5144488DF\">Exhibit Audio Description available</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olsp/index.htm\">Old Spanish National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

It is currently grouped with Cajon Summit to describe the area where a vital artery of the California interstate system, Interstate 15, descends into Los Angeles, after traveling east from Las Vegas. The Interstate 15 corridor through this area also serves as a part of the mother road, Route 66. <br /> <br /> During the Old Spanish Trail days, travelers who were exhausted after navigating Cajon Pass would luckily stumble upon the homestead of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/issac-slover.htm\">Isaac Slover and his wife, María Bárbara Aragón Slover, </a>who regularly assisted travelers on the Old Spanish Trail. Isaac opened his smokehouse and supplied the famished travelers with bacon and squashes, a feat of generosity that seems to have been a regular occurrence. New settlers found that the Slovers would help them survive until their own crops had been planted and harvested. <br /> <br /> The Mexican government was beginning to grow weary of outsiders, but Slover's eventual marriage to María Bárbara Aragón, his conversion to Catholicism, and his acceptance of Mexican citizenship provided him with the means to trap and trade freely along the Old Spanish Trail. They relocated to California's San Bernardino Valley in 1837, and--along with other New Mexican emigrants--founded the communities of Agua Mansa and La Placita de los Trujillos in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> <strong>Pacific Crest Trail</strong><br /> <br /> The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) traverses through Cajon Pass, with a section that parallels the Old Spanish Trail. This is a great opportunity to hike a portion of the trail, but should only be attempted by experienced hikers. Access is via Elliot Ranch OHV Road 3N22. <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sbnf/recarea/?recid=26527\">Please contact the San Bernardino National Forest for more information.</a></p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Cajon Pass is at the head of Horsethief Canyon, traversed by California State Route 138 (SR 138) and railroad tracks owned by BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad.

For generations people of faith have traveled to the site of El Santuario to ask for healing for themselves and others, and to offer prayers of petition and of thanksgiving for favors received. Following a long tradition of miraculous shrines, El Santuario is now one of the most important Catholic pilgrimage centers in the United States and one of the most beautiful examples of Spanish Colonial architecture in New Mexico.<br /> <br /> Today El Santuario de Chimayo, also known as Lourdes of America, attracts over 300,000 pilgrims from all over the Southwest and elsewhere each year. Thousands of pilgrims walk to El Santuario from Santa Fe and other starting points during Holy Week.<br /> <br /> Pueblo Indians have inhabited the Chimayo area since the 12th century, long before the initial Spanish conquest of New Mexico. When they arrived, the Spanish committed to converting the natives to Christianity, which became a major point of friction between the Catholic Church and the American Indians. In 1680, the Pueblo Indians revolted temporarily ending Spanish commitment to the region.<br /> <br /> The Tewa Indians named Chimayo as “Tsi-Mayoh,” after one of four sacred hills above the valley, which lies directly behind El Santuario de Chimayo. The Pueblo Indians believed that they shared their land with supernatural beings. The natives thought the healing spirits were to be found in the form of hot springs, which ultimately dried up leaving the healing earth. The Pueblo and Tewa used the site of El Santuario de Chimayo for healing long before Spanish occupation.<br /> <br /> In 1693, led by Diego de Vargas, the Spanish returned to reconquer New Mexico. The Spanish regained control of the area, creating a perpetual flow of Spanish and Mexican settlers to northern New Mexico. The returning and newly arrived Hispanic families dispersed along the Santa Cruz River and in the village of El Potrero, the future site of the shrine. By 1805, commitment to a miraculous Guatemalan image of Christ crucified known as Our Lord of Esquipulas had become popular in El Potrero.<br /> <br /> Devotion to Our Lord of Esquipulas originated at an early colonial shrine in Guatemala, at which the earth was said to be effective in curing illnesses. Franciscan friars spread commitment to this image of Christ crucified throughout Mexico and to New Mexico. The people of El Potrero passed on a series of legends concerning the apparition of Our Lord of Esquipulas from generation to generation in the Chimayo area. According to the most popular tradition, on the Holy Week night of Good Friday in 1810, Don Bernardo Abeyta, a member of the Penitentes, saw a light beaming out of one of the hills near the Santa Cruz River in Chimayo. He went to the spot and saw that the light was coming out of the ground. Digging with his bare hands, he found a Crucifix, which he immediately associated with Our Lord of Esquipulas. He left it there and a group of men went to notify the priest, Fray Sebastián Alvarez.<br /> <br /> The priest set out for Chimayo and carried the Crucifix back to his church in Santa Cruz, placing it in the niche of the main altar. The next morning, the Crucifix was gone and found in its original location in Chimayo. This same process was repeated two more times, and the Crucifix always ended up back in its original location thus making it apparent that Our Lord of Esquipulas wanted to reside in Chimayo. Another legend claims that Don Bernardo Abeyta had a vision while plowing his fields that directed him to dig beneath his plow where he would find earth with great healing powers.<br /> <br /> In 1813, on behalf of the residents of El Potrero, Abeyta petitioned the priest for permission to build a chapel dedicated to Our Lord of Esquipulas on what the people believed to be the site of the miraculous Crucifix or earth with healing powers. The miraculous healings grew so numerous it required replacing the chapel with the larger, current shrine in 1816. The healings started as a result of the miraculous earth or sand found under the shrine. It is said that the earth at Chimayo can be mixed with water to make mud and eaten or applied to the skin in order to heal a person of an ailment. Some people take vials of the sand with them as a remembrance of their pilgrimage to Chimayo.<br /> <br /> <em>(Adapted from the Latino American Heritiage Travel Itinerary)</em></p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location </b>(On NM 76 (the High Road) in the town of Chimayo, NM) <br /> <br /> El Santuario de Chimayo sits in the center of the small village of El Potrero, one of several settlements in the Santa Cruz Valley collectively called Chimayo. El Santuario de Chimayo is a well preserved small adobe church with twin front towers with belfries, wooden doors, a wall-enclosed garden, and an arched gate with a cross on top. The interior is a colorful mixture of Spanish and Indian decorations and styles. The nave of the church is decorated with original astonishing examples of 19th century Hispanic religious folk art, including several santos and religious frescoes. Behind the altar stands the miraculous statue of Our Lord Esquipulas. On the left side of the nave are two separate rooms.<br /> <br /> <br /> El Santuario remained in the ownership of the descendants of Bernardo Abeyta until 1929, when the Spanish Colonial Arts Society in Santa Fe that writer Mary Austin, artist Frank Applegate and architect/preservationist John Gaw Meem headed, purchased it from the family and donated it to the Archdiocese of Santa Fe.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olsp/planyourvisit/safety.htm\"><i>Safety Considerations</i></a></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.holychimayo.us/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olsp/index.htm\">Old Spanish National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Because of the particularly dry and difficult landscape of the Book Cliffs area, water was a crucial resource for travelers. Green River Gap became an alternate route to take as it could potentially provide water.<br /> <br /> Though use of the Old Spanish Trail largely ended at the time of the Mexican American War, a few groups would continue to use the Green River Gap route. For example, the Loring Expedition, comprised of Col. William Wing Loring and over 200 troops, traveled through Green River Gap in 1858 to fight for the United States during the Utah War.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(East Trailhead: 38.959, -109.910,-109.910) (West Trailhead: 38.972, -109.974.)<br /> <br /> Green River Gap is located in Grand County, Utah off of Highway 6 between Green River and Cisco. The surrounding landscape is dry and filled with sagebrush and cottonwood trees. As you travel here, you’ll pass through parts of the San Rafael Swell, a large geologic area that has been uplifted and eroded over time.<br /> <br /> The Green River Gap trail is a 5-mile one-way trail that could also serve as a quick out and back hike to view the scenery from the top of the hill. Open to both hikers and equestrian users, this trail would offer visitors a vicarious experience of traveling through the remote foothills of the Book Cliffs, a landscape which remains very similar to the one original trail travelers would have experienced on their journey. <strong>Because the West trailhead is not accessible to trailers, horseback riders and others with large vehicles will need to access the Gap from the East trailhead.</strong><br /> <br /> The difficulty of the trail is rated as moderate. It is fairly level, though there is no water or shade.

During this time, journeys in this area were more difficult because explorers had to rely on printed maps and the guidance of other travelers. To put it in perspective, imagine having to traverse a land you’ve never visited before without modern amenities like GPS or a smartphone. To prevent getting lost and stay on the right track, travelers would use unique landmarks, like Head Rock, to know they were on the right path, which in this case was the Old Spanish Trail.

Two eyes and a stern flat mouth consisting of natural horizontal lines from weatherization give the face a solemn expression.<br /> <br /> The landscape surrounding Head Rock is very dry and filled with sagebrush and cottonwood trees.

Unable to pay back a loan from English-born William Workman, she sold him the property in the early 1850s. Workman passed the property to his ranch foreman, Juan Matias Sanchez, and his son-in-law, Francisco P. Temple. Despite many changes in ownership, Sanchez lived in the adobe until his death in 1882; his family remained there until 1911, after which a series of ownership changes ensued. In 1972, the Scott family (who purchased the property in 1915) granted the adobe to the city of Montebello.<br /> <br /> The adobe's clearest connection to the Old Spanish Trail is through William Workman. He was co-leader of the Rowland-Workman party, a group of Anglo Americans and New Mexicans who migrated to California on the Old Spanish Trail in 1841. Once he arrived, Workman helped challenge the rule of unpopular Governor Manuel Micheltorena; the new governor, Pio Pico, rewarded him by enlarging the rancho he shared with expedition co-leader John Rowland. Workman would later support the American takeover of California. <br /> <br /> Like many of his fellow travelers in 1841, Workman prospered in California, acquiring land and influence in equal measure. However, an economic panic in the 1870s cost him his house and his fortune. He died in 1876.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location </b>(946 N Adobe Ave, Montebello, CA 90640)<br /> <br /> The adobe sits on a quiet street at the eastern edge of Montebello.

Its original location near the Whittier Narrows experienced frequent flooding, and in 1775 it moved to its present site closer to the mountains. Like other Spanish missions, San Gabriel was designed to convert Indigenous people to Catholicism and introduce them to other parts of European life. The missionaries stationed there relied upon the labor of neighboring Indigenous communities--most notably nearby Gabrieleno villages--to build the mission, harvest its crops, and tend to its livestock. San Gabriel became one of California's most productive missions, but at a tremendous cost; Indigenous neophytes faced violence, overwork, disease, malnutrition, and religious persecution on a regular basis. These factors spurred Indigenous leaders, including a Gabrieleno woman named Toypurina, to attempt a rebellion at Mission San Gabriel in 1785. A new exhibit, which opened in 2023, highlights Native perspectives on mission life.<br /> <br /> In an era when Santa Fe's population dwarfed that of Los Angeles, Mission San Gabriel was one of the most important population centers along the Old Spanish Trail. Antonio Armijo visited the mission in 1829, during his first trip between Abiquiu and Los Angeles. A few years later, Mexico secularized its missions. Although clergymen remained in control at San Gabriel, much of the mission's land was distributed to nearby ranchers in the 1830s.  Mission San Gabriel continued to provide nearby settlers with religious services, especially those in San Bernardino and Agua Mansa (which had small churches known as estancias, or outposts, to the mission). During this period, many Gabrielenos moved to the new pueblo of Los Angeles to seek work. Some Gabrielenos remained on the former mission lands, but they faced competition from Anglo settlers. Many of the church's buildings fell into disrepair after secularization, but efforts to restore them began in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br /> <br /> The city of Los Angeles and the mission maintain close ties, and every year descendants of Los Pobladores--the families that trekked from Mission San Gabriel to found Los Angeles in 1781--reenact this nine-mile walk at the western end of the Old Spanish Trail.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location </b>(428 South Mission Dr., San Gabriel, CA, 91776)<br /> <br /> Borrowing elements from a cathedral and former mosque in Córdoba, Spain, Mission San Gabriel appears almost like a fortress. Its espadaña is especially beautiful, featuring bells cast as early as 1795. The church's interior features stations of the cross thought to have been painted by Native neophytes in the 1820s.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olsp/planyourvisit/safety.htm\"><i>Safety Considerations</i></a></p> <h3><a href=\"https://parish.sangabrielmissionchurch.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olsp/index.htm\">Old Spanish National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p> <p>The Mojave Desert has a vibrant history. Before contact with the Europeans changed their world, the Chemehuevi lived on prickly pear, mesquite and roasted agave blooms and hunted deer and bighorn sheep. They resided in the Kingston, New York, and Providence Mountains west to Soda Dry Lake and south to the Whipple Mountains. Mojave tribal peoples were concentrated along the Colorado River and the Mojave trail became their main trading route.</p> <p>When explorer Father Francis Garces traveled across the Mojave Desert, in 1776, he was met by members of the Mojave Tribe. Other intrepid explorers would follow Garces, including Jedediah Smith in 1826 and John Fremont in 1844. Concern abounded about tribal attacks on the mail carriers who traveled the Mojave Road. During the 1860s government outposts were established providing protection for the mail wagons.</p> <p>During this same era, gold fever struck California. The General Mining Law of 1872 permitted individuals to stake a claim on an area of land where a mineral deposit was discovered. Copper, iron, gold and silver mines rapidly became established in the Mojave. In 1883, on the eastern side of the Providence Mountains, silver was discovered in the Bonanza King Mine. </p> <p>Mojave's history is as varied and colorful as the individuals who staked their claim in the desert. <strong>Read more...</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-mojave-road-the-old-spanish-trail.htm\">Additional History & Information</a></h2> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Mojave National Preserve is located in Eastern California.

There was likewise a strong economic incentive to move contraband goods and Indian slaves, over this same route. A viable overland route had to be found, though, to cross the remote deserts and mountains of Mexico’s far northern frontier.</p> <p>In 1776, during the Spanish period, priests Francisco Atanasio Dominguez and Silvestre Velez de Escalante left Santa Fe and explored far and wide through northern New Mexico, western Colorado, and southern Utah. Much of this county would later be part of the Old Spanish Trail. During this same time period, Franciscan priests, the Spanish military, and civilian explorers were beginning to settle various coastal valleys in Alta California. No one, however, made the trek connecting California and New Mexico.</p> <p>It took the vision and courage of Mexican trader Antonio Armijo to lead the first commercial caravan from Abiquiú, New Mexico to Los Angeles in late 1829. Following suit over the next twenty years, Mexican and American traders continued to use routes similar to the one he pioneered, frequently trading with Indian tribes along the way. It was from a combination of the indigenous footpaths, early trade and exploration routes, and horse and mule routes that the trail network known collectively as the “Old Spanish Trail” evolved. (The name was a term rooted in John C. Frémont’s report of his 1844 journey over the trail for the U.S. Topographical Corps., guided by Kit Carson. While the name acknowledges the fact that parts of the trail had been known to the Spanish since the 16th century, the 700-mile trail was not established until the Mexican period.) Many prominent members of both New Mexican and Californio families traversed this route as part of annual caravans. In one celebrated, well-documented instance, two toddlers made the trip while packed into the mules’ saddlebags.</p> <p>Thanks in part to the Old Spanish Trail, Santa Fe emerged as the hub of the overland continental trade network linking Mexico and United States markets—a network that included not only this trail, but also the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe Trail</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro</a>. After the United States took control of the Southwest in 1848, other routes to California emerged, a wagon route was opened to southern California, and use of the Old Spanish Trail sharply declined.</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olsp/index.htm\">Old Spanish National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2> <h2>This trail is jointly managed with the <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/national-scenic-and-historic-trails/old-spanish\">Bureau of Land Management</a></h2>",

The Native Americans were the first to trailblaze this area hundreds of years ago before the arrival of the Spanish in the late 1400s. The trails most popular use occurred with the establishment of the Old Spanish Trail in 1829. Though the first official expedition occurred on the Armijo Route further south, trading caravans would more commonly use the Northern Route that passes through this wash due to the easier paths and more abundant resources.<br /> <br /> Trading died down after Mexico ceded most of the West to the US in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. However, the trail still was still used sporadically by various groups. Captain John W. Gunnison led an expedition through this wash as well as other parts of the Old Spanish Trail as they searched for a railroad route through Utah. The Elk Mountain Mission, comprised of Latter-Day Saints, passed through as they headed further south from Salt Lake to settle parts of southeastern Utah. Shortly after, locals within Emery County would use this route as a wagon road between Castle Dale and Green River. Visual remnants such as stone culverts, unfinished railroad grades, and dugways can be found on the nearby ATV trails verifying the kind of travel this area used to receive. Eventually, as automotive technology and infrastructure improved, Upper Cottonwood Wash saw less and less traffic, and now is used mainly for recreation.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Latitude: 39.062745 Longitude: -110.415556)</p> <p>The trailhead for Upper Cottonwood Wash is in Emery County, Utah. It can be reached by taking the Smith Camp Road off Highway 89 and heading west along a series of <strong>dirt roads</strong>.<br /> <br /> This trailhead is in a remote location where<strong> 4WD and high clearance</strong> are needed to reach it safely. During or shortly after rainfall the roads will be impassible and flash floods may occur on the trail, so only attempt this hike under good weather conditions.<br /> <br /> A sign and interpretation kiosk mark the start of the trail. Cottonwood trees and various shrubs such as sagebrush are prominent throughout, especially in the spring and early summer. The trail is sandy and rocky from deposition as water flows down into the wash when it rains.<br /> <br /> The most notable element of the trail, however, is the historic inscriptions written on the walls by past travelers. Some have been written in the grease they used to lube their wagon axels with, and others were sketched into the rock. There are at least eight inscriptions that have been recorded, some can be read while others have faded or eroded over time, leaving them indecipherable. See if you can find more!<br /> <br /> This <strong>five mile trail</strong> is lightly trafficked and fairly level. There is little shade, and the environment gets very hot in the afternoon. Make sure to travel in the morning or evening and bring plenty of water to prevent heat exhaustion. As you walk through this trail, the setting you will witness is almost the exact same as what travelers on the Old Spanish Trail saw when they came through here over a hundred years ago!<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olsp/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/office/price-field-office\">More Site Information </a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=AF1865BE-E97B-4E15-BF85-22FCE0E0D7C4\">Exhibit Audio Description available</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olsp/index.htm\">Old Spanish National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

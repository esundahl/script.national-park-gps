        "notes": "Bremner\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/bremner.htm\n\n<p>Bremner is a glacier, river and mining camp within Wrangell-St Elias National Park. It is named after John Bremner, who in 1884-1885 was the first non-native person to live in the area and who prospected for gold along the Bremner River. Located just to the north of the Bremner River, it was the scene of an important placer gold discovery in 1902 and played a key role in the history of the Copper River Basin. Only a few miners struck it rich, but the resulting demand for materials and supplies helped establish regional transportation networks, encouraged supporting industries, and hastened the exploration and settlement of the entire region. While small-scale placer mining continued for over forty years, lode development was largely confined to the period between 1934 and 1941, the district's most significant era. The Bremner Historic Mining District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.Bremner is extremely remote and can only be reached by airplane or long range hiking. The closest road is about 70 miles away in McCarthy, Alaska. Currently, there are no residents, though there was a volunteer summer ranger in the past. There is a visitor's book to sign in the bunkhouse. Other buildings include an old power generating station, a garage with an old Model T in it and a few other buildings. There is also a damaged stamp mill and high up the mountain are additional remains at the actual mine sites. The Golconda Mining Company site, which contains a campsite, an elaborate ditch, and extensive piles of hand-stacked cobble, provides an example of an early placer mining system. The Goldconda complex includes two airstrips dating to the 1930s.The Yellow Band mining camp is one of the region's most complete, not only containing the typical housing and office facilities, but a sophisticated hydroelectric system. This camp is also significant for its association with Asa C. Baldwin, a distinguished regional explorer, surveyor, and mining engineer. While working for the U.S. Geodetic Survey, Baldwin completed the first American marine survey of Kodiak and the Aleutian Islands in 1909. From 1910-13, he served as a field officer with the U.S.-Canadian International Boundary Survey. Over the years, Baldwin worked locally as a consulting engineer, where, among other activities, he advised the Kennecott Copper Company and the Copper River and Northwestern Railway. Baldwin began prospecting in the Bremner District in the early 1930s, and from 1936 to 1940, was president of the Yellow Band Mining Company. He acquired the Bremner Gold Mining Company holdings in 1939.Lucky Girl, Grand Prize, Sheriff, and Yellow Band Mines are examples of remote underground mining operations. With each containing a variety of buildings and structures. While Lucky Girl mill is now ruinous due to repeated avalanche strikes, its operating machinery remains intact.The Bremner Historic Mining District embodies its period of twentieth-century mining, illustrating both its mining process and its evolutionary sequence. Unusually complete, it retains virtually all of its historic components, including an important placer site, a camp, four discrete lode mines, a mill, and an associated transportation network. This mining camp is extremely remote and in a very rugged Alaskan wilderness area. Access can be done through one of the air flight services in the area.<br /> <br /> Latitude: 61.02916717529297 Longitude: -143.4388885498047</p>",

Unlike many better known and more accessible regions, this area retains extensive evidence of its early mining use, including the deteriorating remains of two towns; numerous tent camps, various water diversion and delivery systems; a full range of hand, hydraulic, and mechanical mining operations; and a well-developed transportation network.<br /> <br /> The scene of Alaska’s last important gold rush in 1913, the Chisana district played a key role in the history of interior Alaska. While few struck it rich, the resulting demand for materials and supplies helped establish regional transportation networks, encouraged supporting industries, and hastened the exploration and settlement of both the Copper and Tanana Basins. The Chisana district was particularly significant from 1913 to 1915, the period encompassing its discovery, stampede, and boom. Chisana became known as \"the largest log cabin town in the world.\" It remained important through 1942, when war-time exigencies virtually ended local mining. </p> <p>Today, Chisana enjoys a seasonal population of about twenty-five. A few persistent placer miners continue to work the district's creeks. The spiritual heirs of the stampeders, they continue their predecessor's quest, ever searching for that one rich strike. There are bed and breakfasts and guide/outfitters in this area that is accessible only by small aircraft. Some adventurous hikers retrace the steps of the early stampeders and make the trek from Chisana to McCarthy. This is a difficult route and should only be attempted by experienced backcountry travelers or with an outfitter guide..</p> <p>As you hike around Chisana you will see ruins of structures and historic artifacts throughout the area. For its protection and to keep its historical integrity, it is unlawful and prohibited to remove or relocate anything. Debris and artifacts provide important clues to the story of the people who followed the lure of gold to Chisana. Many of the historic structures are located on private property. Public easements are marked, so please respect private property while at the site.

The town was a stopover and service point for the trains that traveled from the copper mines at Kennecott to ships waiting for ore at the port of Cordova. A steamship passenger arriving in Cordova could travel comfortably by train to Chitina, then by stage, sleigh or horse to Fairbanks other interior destinations. Native trails were improved to provide access to resources such as gold and copper. This Copper River area supported a population of approximately 200 Athabaskan Indian people when U.S. Army explorer, Lt. Henry T. Allen, traveled up the Copper River in 1885. They found the area very sparsely populated by people who followed fish and ani-mal migrations and lived in seasonal camps. One winter village was located southeast of the current site of Chitina, where Taral Creek enters the Copper River. When mines and the railroad came to the area, some Alaska Natives found employment in those enterprises. By 1928, the Bureau of Indian Affairs had built a school near Chitina to serve the region. Population ebbed, the school closed, and Chitina faded from its earlier ambition to be the metropolitan center of the Interior. However, the town did not completely “die out” as the area residents struggled to support themselves in the decades following the Kennecott Mine closure. Though some people still came to take salmon from the Copper River, Chitina had become a “ghost town,” as evidenced by town father O.A. Nelson’s ghostly art work which adorned many Chitina buildings in the 1940’s.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chitina Chronology</strong><br /> 1885 Army explorer Henry T.

At 290 miles long, the Copper River begins at the Copper Glacier on the northeast side of Mount Wrangell, in the Wrangell Mountains. It first flows north, then west and then south where it forms the park’s western boundary. As it flows further southeast through the Chugach National Forest, it eventually empties into the ocean in the Gulf of Alaska near Cordova.<br /> <br /> As an enormous Alaskan watershed, it is known for its extensive delta ecosystem. The Copper is the tenth largest river in the United States, as ranked by average discharge volume at its ocean mouth, USGS publication.<br /> <br /> The river's famous salmon runs arise from the use of the river watershed by over 2 million salmon each year for spawning. The river's commercial salmon season is very brief, beginning in May for chinook salmon and sockeye salmon for periods lasting days or hours at a time. Sport fishing by contrast is open all year long, but peak season on the Copper River lasts from August to September when the coho salmon runs. Subsistence fishing (cultural and traditional uses of the land and water) is predominately done with dipnet or fishwheel, with special use permits for local rural residents.<br /> <br /> Glacial rivers carry an extremely high level of silt, typically making it impossible to see the river bottom. Spring run-off, heavy rain, and hot summer temperatures can cause quick, dramatic change in water levels. Year round, The Copper River is extremely cold and hypothermia is a danger even after a brief submersion, regardless of air temperature. Always wear a drysuit and a personal floatation device (pfd) while floating or boating. <br /> https://www.nps.gov/wrst/planyourvisit/river-floating-and-boating.htm<br /> <br /> It's cultural and traditional name is Ahtna River, in Ahtna Athabascan - ‘Atna’tuu, \"river of the Ahtnas\", and in coastal Tlingit - Eeḵhéeni, \"river of copper\". The name of the river comes from the abundant copper deposits along the upper river that were used by Alaska Native communities and then later by settlers from the Russian Empire and explorers from the United States.<br /> <br /> Since the river is 290 miles in length, the Lat/Long. is represented at Copper Center, Alaska:</p> <p><strong>Latitude: </strong>61.955894470214844 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-145.298095703125</p>",

The bay was formed by the rapid retreat of the Guyot, Yahtse, and Tyndall Glaciers. The protected, blue waters surrounded by spectacular glacial scenery and an abundance of wildlife are ideal for sea kayaking.</p> <p>Most kayakers access Icy Bay by chartering a small bush plane to drop them off at Kageet Point on the eastern edge of Icy Bay or Pt. Riou, located on Chugach Alaska Native Corporation land southeast of Icy Bay. Before flying into Pt. Riou, visitors should request permission by writing Chugach Alaska Corporation, 3800 Centerpoint Drive, Suite 1200, Anchorage, Alaska 99503.</p> <p>Access to Icy Bay is restricted to small bush planes only, so many parties use collapsible kayaks.

Park staff worked with local tribes in identifying the campground name, and the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, on behalf of Daisy’s family, partnered with the park in organizing the dedication. Many of the more than 100 guests at the event were members of Daisy’s family. Also among the guests were Nabesna Road residents and park visitors camping at the site. Daisy’s closest surviving relatives – a sister and three daughters – shared memories of Daisy, as did several grandchildren. Speaking on behalf of the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, Tribal Administrator Wilson Justin, who is also one of Daisy’s grandchildren, said “The honor of keeping a promise made a generation ago is privilege not always understood but vital to those who stand in shadows of our Traditions. Thank You to the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park for the support in keeping that promise. Cheesh’na extends a welcome to all visitors to the Kendesnii Campground.” The campground is located at Mile 28.2 on the Nabesna Road. It has vault toilets, picnic tables, and ten sites that will accommodate tents and up to medium-sized recreational vehicles. Currently there is no charge for use of the site.

Even by Alaskan standards, the site is remote, accessed by small plane or the infamous McCarthy Road. The Kennecott Mill Town, the center of the Landmark, is linear in plan, an orientation dictated by the glaciated, mountainous terrain and the railway that served the site. Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986, the preservation efforts underway by the NPS since 1998 have uncovered an illustrious history and logistical challenges.<br /> <br /> Following the initial “discovery” of the ore in 1900, the development of the site took considerable effort not to mention financial commitment. Accessing the remote site required the construction of a 196-mile railroad from Cordova at a cost of $25 million. It included 44 miles of bridges and trestles, many of which were wiped out each spring and had to be rebuilt. The mill town and mine camps included over seventy-six buildings ranging in size from outhouses to the 14-story timber frame mill building. The fist sized chunks of ore were mined from seventy-seven miles of underground tunnels and transported to the mill building along three aerial tramways, totaling 6 miles in length.<br /> <br /> By April 1911, the first trainload of copper ore was headed to Cordova on its way to Tacoma for smelting. At its peak, Kennecott employed 500 to 600 men on three 8-hour shifts. By the time the operation closed in 1938, the Kennecott mines extracted 591,535 short tons of copper from 4,525,909 tons of ore valued at $200,000,000 in 1938 dollars.<br /> <br /> Exploitation of natural resources has formed the basis for Alaska's economy since Russian fur traders arrived more than 200 years ago. The mining of mineral resources has left an enduring mark on Alaska's landscape.<br /> <br /> <strong>Latitude: </strong>61.481048 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-142.885231<br /> <br /> <!-- br--><em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded work to rehabilitate the Recreation Hall at Kennecott Mines in 1999.</em></p> <h4><br /> Additional Information</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/historyculture/upload/Kennecottbulletin.pdf\">The Kennecott Story</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ak0003/\">Library of Congress, Historic American Buildings Survey - Photos and Drawings</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/78003420\">National Register of Historic Places - Official Nomination Form</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p>",

All visitors must park their vehicles at the end of the road and walk, bike, or take a shuttle into McCarthy and Kennecott. A seasonal private (non-NPS) shuttle to McCarthy (1/2 mile) and to Kennecott (5 miles) is available on the east side of the bridge. Summer hours of shuttle operation are posted in the weather shelter. Years ago, the only way across the river was in a self-pulled bucket and cable system. The bridge is State maintained and highway laws apply.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4>McCarthy/Kennecott area</h4> <p><br /> Be aware that land ownership along the McCarthy Road and within the Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a mix of public and private lands. The NPS welcomes visitors to the Kennecott area and reminds them that all the historic mill town and much of the surrounding area are within the Kennicott Subdivision, a residential community where NPS public lands are interspersed with privately owned lands. State ownership of the McCarthy Road ends at the southern boundary of the subdivision. Beyond that point, Kennicott Subdivision easements are private and reserved for the use of the present owners and their guests only. NHL visitors, as NPS guests in the subdivision, should be respectful of privately owned lands and residents of the subdivision.</p> <p>For the purposes of this section, “off-road vehicle” (ORV) refers to all-purpose vehicles such as all-terrain vehicles that have been registered and approved by the State of Alaska for general highway use. Visitor use of ORVs to access the Kennecott mill town or points beyond, such as the Bonanza mine, is permitted as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Use of ORVs and other types of all-purpose vehicles is permitted on the State-owned McCarthy Road pursuant to Title 13, Chapter 2 of the Alaska Administrative Code (13 AAC 02).</li> <li>The Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities Kennicott River bridge was designed and intended predominantly for pedestrian use. To ensure safety for all users of the bridge, NPS urges ORV users to reduce speed and yield to pedestrians when crossing the bridge.</li> <li>As a landowner in the subdivision, the NPS encourages its guests to access the historic Kennecott mill town by using a local shuttle service from McCarthy. Use of a local shuttle service or reaching Kennecott by bicycle or by foot will minimize impacts of motor vehicle use on the historic character of Kennecott, on visitors’ experience of the NHL, and on subdivision residents. Landowners in Kennicott Subdivision have requested of NPS and its guests that property rights be respected where road easements cross their private land.</li> <li>On NPS lands in the NHL, parking is allowed only at the shuttle turnaround located next to the Kennecott Visitor Center. The turnaround has limited capacity for parking, with space only for 6-7 full-size vehicles, and often is filled early each day. Once the turnaround is filled, there is nowhere to park safely without blocking the intended use of the area as a shuttle turnaround.</li> <li>Parking on NPS lands elsewhere in the NHL is prohibited except for Federally qualified rural Alaska residents engaged in permitted subsistence activities.</li> <li>Subdivision easements (which are unavoidable to motorized visitors to Kennecott) are private and reserved for the use of present owners of lots in the subdivision and their guests.</li> </ul> <p>Thank you for recreating responsibly and safely in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve and the Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark.</p>",

The view of the steep-sided, rocky, black spruce canyon and the silty, rushing Kuskulana River far below is breathtaking, if not a little scary. Be mindful of traffic, however, as there is no separate sidewalk. Note also that the road deck drops off immediately underneath the guardrail. Imagine making the crossing riding high in a heavily loaded ore train across two icy rails with no guardrails. An engineering achievement, this cantilevered bridge was constructed in two, brutally cold months in 1910. Perched 238 feet above the Kuskulana River, this one lane bridge provides spectacular views, but please park on either side of the bridge in the gravel parking areas to explore further.

Once the gateway to tremendous fortunes, it is now your gateway to spectacular scenery, vast wilderness, and adventure. For those willing to leave the pavement behind, this road provides access to many natural and historic wonders of our largest park. Today's road originated in 1909 as a railway constructed to support the Kennecott Copper Mines. When large scale mining ended in 1938, most of the rails were salvaged for scrap iron. In 1971 a new bridge was constructed over the Copper River and the rail bed was covered with gravel, creating today's surface of the McCarthy Road.</p> <p>Narrow and winding, the road still reflects its railway origins. In places, remnants of railroad ties may surface along with the occasional spike, creating unexpected hazards. Although traffic and weather often result in ruts and washboarded surfaces, under normal summer conditions most passenger vehicles can make the trip.

Chitina was once bustling as the major stopover and service point for the trains that carried ore from Kennecott to ships in Cordova. The railroad is gone, but today Chitina is busy during the summer fishing season and serves as a gateway to the park. Restrooms and informational panels can be found at the downtown wayside. There are restaurants, shopping, and lodging options in Chitina. There are no gas stations here.</p> <p><strong>Chitina Ranger Station</strong><br /> During the summer months, stop by the historic Chitina Ranger Station. This log cabin, which was constructed in 1910 by the Ed S. Orr Stage Company to house its local superintendent, serves as an enduring reminder of Alaska's colorful transportation history. One of Chitina's oldest surviving buildings, it was rehabilitated by the National Park Service and now serves as a visitor contact station. Current information about road conditions, the park, hikes, fishing opportunities, and other essential topics can be obtained there.</p> <p><strong>State Wayside - The Beginning of the McCarthy Road</strong><br /> This is the start of the McCarthy Road. It is a paved pull-out with vault toilets and exhibit panels.</p> <p>Just beyond the wayside, the road goes through a deep narrow gap known locally as the \"railroad cut.\" Actually it was originally a tunnel and was later altered into an open roadcut. The rocks exposed here are schist and phyllite typical of the Chugach Range.</p> <p><strong>Mile 0.4-0.7</strong><br /> There are several small pullouts here with some great views of the confluence of the mighty Copper and Chitina Rivers. The Copper is the only waterway that cuts through the Chugach Mountains, which extend for about 200 miles in a great arc across south-central Alaska. At the confluence, the Copper River is actually smaller than the Chitina River which is considered its tributary. At this point the Copper is about 1/2 mile wide, while the width of the Chitina is over one mile! The Chitina carries more water year-round than the Copper. Even though the Chitina River drains a smaller area than the Copper, it has more runoff due to greater precipitation in its watershed.</p> <p>The Copper and its tributaries, including the Chitina, drain an area that covers approximately 24,000 square miles. Much of this drainage basin lies within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve and about 3,500 square miles, or 17% of the drainage basin, is covered by glaciers. Because of this glacier influence, high water in the Copper River typically occurs not during the snow melt of spring, but during summer hot spells that cause rapid melting of ice. Low water usually occurs in late winter when everything is frozen.</p> <p>In 1950 the U.S. Geological Survey established a stream gauging station at the head of Woods Canyon, about 3.5 miles downstream, well below this confluence. Records from that gauge show that the average discharge of the Copper River has been 37,510 cubic feet per second (CFS) or slightly over 27 million acre feet per year. The largest recorded flood since 1950 was on August 8, 1981, when the river discharged over 380,000 CFS at the gauge. The lowest flow was recorded in March of 1956 when the river carried only 2,000 CFS at the gauge.</p> <p>Rocks exposed on the west <em>(left)</em> side of the road between here and the bridge are gneiss, schist, and phyllite with some quartz veins.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Copper River, Fishwheels, and Mount Drum\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/Fishwheels_in_Chitina2.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>The Copper River, Fishwheels, and Mount Drum.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Mile 1.4</strong><br /> As you drive across the Copper River Bridge, you can see the confluence of the Copper and Chitina Rivers. Several small pull-outs provide views of the rivers. Do not stop in the middle of the bridge for photos. After the bridge, the road becomes gravel.</p> <p>The large snow covered mountain visible to the north is volcanic Mount Drum (12,010'), part of the Wrangell Mountains. Suspended sediment loads of the Copper and Chitina Rivers are high, but the dissolved sediment loads are low; these rivers are dirty...but not polluted. Millions of tons of natural sediment, mostly silt and clay are carried downstream each year.</p> <p>The muddy waters that result from all this suspended sediment create an aquatic environment that is not very favorable as a permanent home for most fish. Therefore the Copper and Chitina Rivers have rather small resident fish populations. They do, however, have fantastic populations of migrating fish during the times that mature salmon \"run\" up to clear-water spawning beds and juveniles run down to the ocean each year. The muddy waters of the Copper allow successful salmon fishing by the use of dip nets and fishwheels; neither of these methods would work in clearwater streams.</p> <p><strong>Mile 1.6</strong><br /> On the south (right) side of the road is the Copper River Campground. This is a non-Park Service primitive campground. It is located just after crossing the bridge. This area has 12 sites, picnic tables, fire pits, and vault toilets.</p> <p>On the north (left) side of the road is the Copper River and the Kotsina River delta. The National Park Service has an easement here where you can access and view the Copper River. An easement is an area of land where visitors are granted the right to cross private property. Please follow the easement markers and respect the private property that you are crossing. Visitors can use a small site along the Copper River where they may park a vehicle, load and unload rafts, and temporarily camp for up to 24 hours. This is an excellent place to view the river and to witness Alaskans catching red, silver, and king salmon with dipnets and fishwheels.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Bluffs along the Kotsina river\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/kotsinabluffs.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Look for the brightly colored deposits of a large volcanic debris in the bluffs along the Kotsina River.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Mile 2.0-2.5</strong><br /> There are several small turnouts from which the lower Kotsina River can be seen. The Kotsina, a moderate size tributary of the Copper River, gets much of its water from Long and Kluvesna Glaciers which drain southward off Mt.Wrangell.</p> <p>Brightly colored deposits of a large volcanic debris flow are exposed on the south side of the road and can be also seen in the Kotsina River bluffs a mile to the north. Field studies show that these deposits came from great volumes of ash and clay that were originally high on Mt. Wrangell. They became liquefied when volcanic activity produced much steam and also caused melting of snow and ice. Movement probably began as a volcanic mudflow, but as the mudflow raced down steep slopes of the mountain and along the Chetaslina River it ripped out large pieces of bedrock and picked up loose blocks of rock and river cobbles to become a volcanic debris flow.</p> <p>Materials from this event are called the Chetaslina Volcanic Debris Flow and they were deposited along the Copper Valley and in the lower portions of its tributaries from the Tonsina to the Chitina. These debris flow deposits are overlain in various places by lava flows and also by stream, lake, wind, and glacial sediments. Furthermore, they have experienced considerable erosion by stream activity and by a major glacial advance that occurred after the debris flow. Radioactive potassium-argon dating of a lava flow which overlies debris flow deposits indicates that the Chetaslina Volcanic Debris Flow took place about 200,000 years ago.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 5.0-5.4</strong><br /> Rocks poorly exposed on the north (left) side of the road are basalt and greenstone of the Nicolai Greenstone rock unit. These rocks originated as flows of basaltic lava during the Triassic Period, about 220 million years ago. Later they were partially altered by heat and pressure to form the greenstone that is widely distributed in the Wrangell Mountains and is the source of copper mined near Kennecott. As you continue, you'll discover that limestone is also exposed on the north side of the road.</p> <p align=\"left\">There are several small pullouts that offer nice views of the Chitina River and Chugach Mountains to the south. The Copper River and its tributaries (including the Chitina River) drain an area of approximately 24,000 square miles. Much of this drainage basin lies within the park and almost 25% of it is covered by glaciers. Because of this glacial influence, high water in the park's large rivers typically occurs not during the snowmelt of spring, but summer hot spells that cause rapid ice melting. Low water usually occurs in late winter when everything is frozen.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"The Chitina is a classic example of a braided river\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/chitinaview_1.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Fed by glaciers, the Chitina is a classic example of a braided river</figcaption> </figure>   <p align=\"left\">Streams throughout the world exhibit three basic patterns in their channel form: straight channels, which are uncommon in large streams; meandering channels, which consist of many curves and loop-like bends; and braided channels. The Chitina is a classic example of a braided river as are many of the other rivers in this region. Braided rivers are characterized by many dividing and re-uniting channels and by numerous islands and gravel bars. The braided channel pattern tends to develop in rivers that; a) carry a lot of sand and gravel, b) have fairly steep slopes, or gradients, and c) undergo frequent fluctuations in water level.</p> <p align=\"left\">The Chitina River meets these conditions. In the area we can see here, it drops about 13 feet per mile, which is steep for such a large stream. Glaciers provide the stream with a great deal of sediment ranging from fine clay to boulders. Weather patterns cause flow variations because the river rises during warm and/or wet weather and drops during cold and/ or dry weather. Consequently, much of the sediment being transported to the sea is temporarily stored as islands or bars of gravel, sand, and mud along the Chitina River. If you happen to be viewing the river after several days of hot weather, most of the islands and bars will be flooded.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 10.1</strong><br /> Strelna Lake. A pull-out on the north side of the road provides access to a 1/3-mile trail to Strelna Lake. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game stocks this lake with rainbow trout, although you can find other fish here as well.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 10.6</strong><br /> Silver Lake. A short trail on the south side of the road provides access to Silver Lake for fishing. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game stocks this lake with rainbow trout, and you may find other fish as well.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 12.3</strong><br /> Sculpin Lake. A pull-out on the south side of the road provides access to a 1/4-mile trail to Sculpin Lake. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game stocks this lake with rainbow trout, although you can find other fish here as well.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 14.5</strong><br /> Kotsina Trail - Backcountry Trailheads. The Kotsina Trail departs from the north side of the McCarthy Rd and provides access to backcountry hiking routes. Take this trail 2.5 miles to the Nugget Creek trailhead or 3.8 miles to the Dixie Pass trailhead. The first part of this trail is a road, but it is not maintained and may not be passable for low clearance vehicles. It may be a better option to park your car at the McCarthy Road and hike to the trailheads. Ask a park ranger for more information and route descriptions.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 15.5</strong><br /> The road starts to run southeast here in a low valley between two long ridges of gravel. These gravel ridges are good examples of lateral moraines that were deposited along the margin of a large glacier as it receded.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 15.9</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Federal Land. The road is now entering land managed by Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 17</strong><br /> A few turnouts on the south side of the road offer good views of the Kuskulana River and bridge. Exposures on the other side of the road show the type of sediments that make up glacial moraines.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Kuskulana Bridge\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/kuskulana.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>The Kuskulana Bridge is perched 238 feet above the raging Kuskulana River.</figcaption> </figure>   <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 17.2</strong><br /> Kuskulana River Canyon and Bridge. A spectacular achievement, the Kuskulana Bridge was constructed during the winter of 1910. Imagine riding high in a heavily loaded ore train across the two icy rails. Perched 238 feet above the raging Kuskulana River, this single-lane railroad bridge is for many the most hair-raising part of the entire drive. It was the only railroad bridge in this area constructed of steel girders that span the canyon rather than timber pilings driven into the streambed. The bridge is supported primarily by the metamorphic bedrock of the inner gorge rather than the thick layer of glacial gravels near the surface. The Kuskulana’s muddy waters reflect its origin from the melting of several glaciers that drain off the southern and western slopes of Mt. Blackburn.</p> <p align=\"left\">This is a one-lane bridge. Watch for oncoming traffic. Please do not stop in the middle of the bridge for pictures. We encourage you to park at either end of the bridge and get out of your vehicle to enjoy the views.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 17.3</strong><br /> Kuskulana Bridge Wayside. This rest area has vault toilets and is a gravel pull-out.</p> <p><strong>Mile 20-21</strong><br /> Vegetation and poor drainage in this area are influenced by the presence of permafrost at relatively shallow depths. This is a good place to contemplate the problems of road construction and maintenance in areas of permafrost, muskeg and swamps.</p> <p><strong>Mile 24</strong><br /> Gilahina Butte to the south <em>(right)</em> of the road is composed of gabbro and gneiss; its sides have been smoothed by large glaciers that formally flowed down the Chitina Valley.</p> <p><strong>Mile 26.8</strong><br /> Clear waters of the Chokosna River support salmon spawning beds.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Gilahina Trestle\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/trestle.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>A classic reminder of a bygone era, this impressive trestle was constructed in eight days during the winter of 1911.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Mile 29.0</strong><br /> Gilahina River & Gilahina Trestle Wayside. This wooden structure was originally 890 feet long and 90 feet high, required one-half million board feet of timber, and was completed in eight days in the winter of 1911. Due to the rugged landscape, over 15% of the entire railway was built on trestles such as this. This rest area offers vault toilets and a gravel pull-out. There is a short 1/2 mile hiking trail that departs from this rest area. Please do not climb on the trestle.</p> <p><strong>Mile 34.8</strong><br /> The Crystalline Hills north of the road are composed mostly of gneiss and gabbro, but some of the lower slopes are made up of a light colored marble. These hills are an excellent place to see Dall Sheep. Take a moment to pull over and look up into the hills. Watch for bright white spots on the hillsides - these may look like patches of snow, but they could actually be sheep!</p> <p><strong>Mile 44.0</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Non-Federal Land. The road is entering privately-managed land.</p> <p><strong>Mile 44.5</strong><br /> The Lakina River gets some of its water from melting glaciers. The bridge was originally built across a river on the Glenn Highway but later removed during a highway upgrade project. Still later it was re-assembled on the Lakina. The bridge itself has functioned well in this location, but it is obvious that a much longer structure would be preferable. There have been repeated erosion problems and washouts of the long eastern approach to the bridge.</p> <p><strong>Mile 45.5</strong><br /> Long Lake. Each year, an average of 18,000 sockeye salmon struggle up the silty Copper and Chitina Rivers to spawn in this lake. This is a unique run. Salmon begin entering the lake as late as September and spawning continues until April. Glacial till and gravels deposited by ancient glaciers and glacial streams mantle the slopes around the lake.</p> <p><strong>Mile 48.3</strong><br /> Looking across the Long Lake inlet streams, the remnants of a C.R. & N.W. Railway trestle can be seen. Marble and limestone is exposed at the trestle footings and in road cuts nearest the stream. The road cuts through sandstone and conglomerate as it ascends the east side of the stream valley.</p> <p><strong>Mile 55.2</strong><br /> State Wayside. This wayside is a gravel pull-out and has vault toilets and exhibit panels.</p> <p><strong>Mile 56.7</strong><br /> Swift Creek, a small clearwater stream drains off Fireweed Mountain. Steeply dipping mudstones of the Chititu Formation are exposed in the cutbank on the west side of the stream. Fireweed Mountain is made up of these dark-colored mudstones and light-colored, silica-rich igneous rocks.</p> <p><strong>Mile 58.0</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Federal Land. The road is now entering land managed by Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve.</p> <p><strong>Mile 58.1-58.4</strong><br /> The Kennicott Glacier and River can be viewed from several small turnouts on the southeast <em>(right)</em> side of the road. Ice of the glacier is mantled by rock material, ranging from large boulders to very fine glacial flour that is still in transit. A short walk around the glacier terminus will make it obvious why glacial streams are so muddy. The Kennicott River runs from the glacier down to the Nizina River, so it is only five miles long. Bluffs along the Kennicott River apparently reflect down-cutting by stream erosion after the glacier melted back from its earlier, more extensive size. It can be seen from these viewpoints that the river valley gets progressively deeper going downstream. The Kennicott River drops over 250 feet in its five mile run between the glacier and the Nizina River. Where it empties into the Nizina, the Kennicott River is in an erosional canyon over 350 feet deep; ten miles further downstream the Nizina is entrenched over 600 feet where it joins the Chitina River.</p> <p><strong>Mile 58.6</strong><br /> McCarthy Road Information Station. This National Park Service information station contains posted information that is updated during the summer. Day-use parking is available as well as vault toilets, updated bulletin boards, and a short hiking trail. No overnight camping or parking is available. This station is generally not staffed.</p> <p><strong>Mile 59.4 - The End of the Road!</strong><br /> Kennicott River & Parking. You've made it to the end of the road, but in many ways, your adventure is just beginning. All visitors must leave their vehicles at the end of the road and walk, bike, or take a shuttle into McCarthy and Kennecott.</p> <p><strong>McCarthy - 1/2 Mile from the Footbridge</strong><br /> Homesteaded in 1906, McCarthy quickly grew into a lively community with a story all its own. McCarthy served as the supply and recreation stop for the entire Kennecott mining district. Town history is well portrayed by the local museum and guide services. Today, McCarthy retains much of its original flavor. Accommodations, dining, guide services, flightseeing, and air taxis are some of the services available here.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Kennecott\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/historyculture/images/kennecott.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Kennecott\" /> <figcaption>Kennecott Mill</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark - 5 miles from the Footbridge</strong><br /> Like a time capsule, the impressive structures and artifacts left behind when the mines were depleted represent an ambitious time of exploration, discovery, and technological innovation.

        "notes": "Mount St. Elias - Was'eitushaa\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/mount-st-elias-was-eitushaa.htm\n\n<p>By Tlingit scholars Judith Daxootsu Ramos and Elaine Chewshaa Abraham with additions by Barbara Cellarius           <br /> <br /> Located along the Alaska coast near Icy and Yakutat Bays, Mount St. Elias is the tallest and one of the most important mountains in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Rising to an elevation of 18,008 feet (5,489 m) above Icy Bay, it is the second tallest peak in both the United States and Canada and fourth tallest in North America. The mountain’s official English name was likely borrowed from the name that explorer Vitus Bering gave to a point of land he sighted on, July 20, the saint’s day of St. Elias, in 1741 (Orth 1971:825), but our Tlingit name for it is <i>Was'eitushaa</i>, meaning “mountain at the head of Icy Bay” or “mountain inland of <i>Was'ei</i>.” <i>Was'ei</i>, in turn, is the Tlingit name for Icy Bay (Deur et al. 2015: 34). In 1939-40, linguist and ethnologist John Peabody Harrington recorded \"Yaasśeeyyík\" for Icy Bay, meaning \"swampy or muddy ground\" (de Laguna 1972:11, 95).<br /> <br /> Our people consider this mountain a sacred site. It is part of the historical oral narratives of the <i>K’inei<u>x</u> <u>K</u>waan</i> and is <i>at.óow</i> (meaning clan property, something that is “owned and paid for” and often involves non-monetary forms of payment). (The clan is also known as <i>Kwáashk'i<u>k</u>wáan</i>, a name the clan took after they purchased fishing rights at the Humpback Salmon Creek, a creek which bears a traditional Eyak place name.) In his honor, songs and chants were composed, and today, many clan members use the mountain on their regalia. One of the clan’s “houses,” a sub-lineage of the clan, is Mountain House, named for Mount St. Elias. It continues to be one of the most important symbols of our community – our dance group is named after the mountain.<br /> <br /> Mount St. Elias has enormous cultural and spiritual significance to us and is part of our sacred homelands. We consider <i>Was’eitushaa</i> as another living being, human-like, with the spirit of a male. These beings, like the mountain and glaciers, had intelligence, demanded respect, and had strict moral values. According to Tlingit Elder Elaine Abraham, \"Mt. St. Elias is a very strong spirit and takes care of us, by telling us what the weather will be like. Also Hubbard glacier is a strong male spirit and can hear and understand what people are talking about.… He demands respect and that is why you have to be quiet in front of the glacier and offer tobacco, and request permission to enter the bay<em>.</em>\"<br /> <br /> The mountain is used to predict the weather. During her fieldwork in Yakutat, anthropologist Frederica de Laguna (1972:803) mentioned a flat cloud streaming from the top of Mount St. Elias one evening and was told: “In the old days they used to tell the weather from it. Sometimes it puts on a sou'wester [rainhat] and then it means a bad storm. Sometimes the cloud is sidewise, as it is tonight, and then it means a westerly wind, good weather.” During the 1931 Alaska Native Brotherhood Convention in Yakutat, a love song was composed to show how happy they were when Mount St. Elias showed his face, that is, when the clouds lifted, and the mountain was visible:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Southeast Alaska sisterhood:<br /> you make us happy yes,<br /> my grandparents’ mountain [1] <br /> there for you too will also be happy<br /> just as if you were the one that opened the world.<br /> Mount Saint Elias, you too will also be happy.<br /> (de Laguna 1972: 1303, approximate translation by Judith Ramos and Elaine Abraham)  </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"> </p> <p>In addition to being an important navigational landmark for mariners, the mountain served as a guidepost for members of the <i>K’inei</i><u>x̱</u><i> <u>K</u>waan</i> clan on their migration to the coast. Harry Bremner told de Laguna (1972:231-232, see also 222-223) a version of this migration story in 1949. The history of the people who become the K’inei<u>x̱</u> <u>K</u>waan clan<a> </a>began at Chitina on the Copper River. Long ago, a Raven chief (<i>Ltakdax</i>?) died and left behind a big dish made from a giant moose antler. Following a dispute over inheritance, a son who did not get the dish set out from Chitina with other members of the community on a voyage to an unknown and hostile land. They left behind their home and crossed glaciers and mountains all the way down to the coast. Their journey tested their strength and determination, and many people died along the way.            </p> <p><br /> They got lost in the fog on the glacier. When they called to each other, “wúhú!,” the sound echoed back and forth. In the fog they became separated. Half of the group ended up at the mouth of the Copper River. The remainder of the group crossed the Bagley Ice Field and came down along the side of Mount St. Elias, eventually ending up at Icy Bay. Crossing the ice field, there was no food to eat, and they were starving. They came to “a little mountain, an island with trees on it,” [2] where they killed a wolverine to eat. Then they continued walking towards what looked like a rabbit, as Bremner described: \"Pretty soon they saw a rabbit sitting on the snow, far away. They walked towards the rabbit. After two days walking they saw it was the top of a mountain, but they kept on walking anyway. Finally they came to Mount Saint Elias. It was a compass for the people so they wouldn't get lost.\" (cited in de Laguna 1972:232).<br /> <br /> When they came out at Icy Bay on the coast, everything was new to them. They knew very little about their new environment. They built their first lineage house at the bay and named it Mountain House, after Mount St. Elias.<br /> <br /> <u>Notes:</u></p> <p>[1] The composer is referring here to clan ownership of the mountain.</p> <p>[2] Possibly a nunatak, which is an exposed peak or rock formation surrounded by a glacier or ice sheet.<br /> <br /> <i>This article was prepared in part through a cooperative agreement between Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve and the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe.</i></p> <p><br /> <b>Sources: </b><br /> de Laguna, F.

The drive is an adventure with views of the Wrangell, Mentasta, and Nutzotin Mountains. Along the way you'll find campsites, scenic vistas, hiking routes, and opportunities for wildlife viewing. But you won't find many people here. So if you like taking a road less traveled, the Nabesna Road may be right for you.<br /> Nabesna Road Basics: <ul> <li>Begins at mile 60 of the Glenn Highway (Tok Cutoff), in Slana, AK.</li> <li>42 miles, allow 1.5 hours EACH WAY.</li> <li>Unpaved and maintained by the Alaska state DOT. Washouts are common.</li> <li>This is a remote area with limited services. NO FUEL is available in Slana. Fill up either in Chistochina (28 miles south) or Mentasta (18 miles north).</li> <li>Drive slowly, carefully, and courteously.</li> <li>We recommend that you carry a full-sized spare and an adequate jack.</li> <li>Private land adjoins many parts of the road. Please respect private property.</li> <li>Cell phone coverage is very limited.</li> </ul> CAUTION! This road was built to access the Nabesna Gold Mine, which operated from 1925 - 1945. Limited, small scale mineral extraction has occurred since then. The Nabesna Mine and its structures are privately owned and situated on private property (located at the end of the road). Please respect this private property. Park visitors should avoid the Nabesna Mine area altogether. The mine tailings extend onto adjacent park lands and these tailings contain high levels of metals and are acidic. Surface waters in the area contain contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, and lead. Environmental exposure may be hazardous.</div> </div> <div id=\"cs_spacer_917631\"> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917631\"> <div><strong>Look for the mile-marker posts along the Nabesna Road and follow along with this guide:<br /> <br /> Slana  Latitude: </strong>62.71294403076172 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-143.98992919921875<br /> <br /> <strong>Mile 0.2 Ranger Station road</strong><br /> The Slana Ranger Station is on the south side of the road (on your right heading east). Be sure to stop by for current road conditions, maps, ORV and subsistence permits, and park information.<br /> <strong>Mile 1.0</strong><br /> The original Slana Roadhouse (private property) is visible on the south side of the road. This roadhouse was built in the 1930s, but there has been a structure here since 1912. It served travelers on the trail to Chisana, the site of Alaska's final gold rush. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The roadhouse is privately owned and is not open to the public.<br /> <strong>Mile 1.7</strong><br /> Slana River Bridge. The Slana River drains southward off of the Mentasta Mountains. It empties into the Copper River just two miles downstream from this bridge. Looking straight down the road, the glaciated summit of Noyes Mountain can be seen 25 miles away. At an elevation of 8,235', Noyes is the highest peak in the Mentasta Mountains; its summit is on the park's northern boundary. The Mentastas run in a northwest/southeast direction from Mentasta Pass to the Nabesna River. From there the slightly higher Nutzotin Mountains continue into Canada. These two mountain ranges are the eastern edge of the Alaska Range which arches across the state. Mt. McKinley and Denali National Park are also in the Alaska Range, but a few hundred miles to the west.<br /> The first several miles of the Nabesna Road traverse relatively flat landscape underlain by accumulations of relatively young sediment. Much of this material is stream sediment, but a good deal of it, especially the beds of silt and fine sand, was deposited in huge glacial lakes which formed when glacial ice blocked off the stream valleys. Additionally, you will see many deposits of coarse gravel that were laid down by the glacial ice itself.<br /> <strong>Mile 2.7</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Federal Land. On the south side of the road, the boundary of the \"National Preserve\" begins.<br /> <strong>Mile 4.0</strong><br /> Junction with \"4-Mile\" Road. This road leads into the Slana Settlement, created in 1983 when the BLM opened over 10,000 acres to homesteading. It was one of the last opportunities for homesteading on federal land. Eight hundred claims were filed, but most were soon abandoned. Alaskan winters took their toll. Many tried to live in hastily-built cabins and tents, with temperatures down to -60˚F. Jobs were scarce and the climate was not suited to farming. Today, about 50 people live in the settlement on private property.<br /> <strong>Mile 5.6</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Preserve to Park. The north side of the road is \"National Preserve\" whereas the south side is \"National Park.\" Sport hunting is allowed in the preserve but not in the park. Subsistence hunting by local, rural residents is allowed in both the park and preserve.<br /> You may notice that many of the culverts beneath the road have small diameter pipes extending from both ends. These are installed to solve a problem that occurs in permafrost areas such as this. Each fall and winter, the culverts freeze full of ice. This is not a problem during winter, when there is no running water through the culvert. As temperatures warm each spring, however, melting snow sends water down the drainages where it is impounded behind the solidly frozen culverts. Such waters flood the road and may cause damage by erosion or ice. To avoid this, highway maintenance crews connect truck-mounted steam boilers to the small pipes to melt the ice and open the culverts.<br /> <strong>Mile 6.1</strong><br /> Rufus Creek Wayside. This is a primitive camping spot and rest area. There are no vault toilets here.<br /> <strong>Mile 11.2</strong><br /> Suslota Lake Trail. This trail is primarily an ORV trail and is generally not suitable for hiking.<br /> <strong>Mile 12.2</strong><br /> Copper Lake Trail. Only the first 2.5 miles of this 12-mile trail are generally suitable for hiking, then the trail crosses Tanada Creek and trail conditions deteriorate.<br /> <strong>Mile 15-18</strong><br /> Along this stretch of road there are several points from which prominent peaks of the Wrangell Mountains can be seen. All of these peaks are built up of the Wrangell Lavas, the general term for lava flows and volcanic rocks of this area. Ages of these rocks range from 10 million years to very recent. The conspicuous high glaciated conical summit to the southwest is Mount Sanford, the fifth highest mountain in the United States with an elevation of 16,237'. It shows the typical form of a strato-volcano (sometimes called a composite cone).<br /> Mount Wrangell is the more distant, rounded and glacial covered dome southeast of Mount Sanford, with its summit of 14,163'. It is the park's only active volcano and occasionally steam plumes can be seen rising from its summit. Mount Wrangell's broad, gentle form is an excellent example of a shield volcano, in fact, it is the largest andesite shield volcano in North America. Stratovolcanoes form from thick, sticky, viscous lava that does not flow readily. Because of its thick nature, development of the volcano is through infrequent, but violent explosive eruptions. The resulting ash, cinders, and lava form steep slopes as they pile up. Shield volcanoes develop from more fluid lava. Because the lava flows more easily, shield volcanoes have more frequent, but less violent eruptions. These eruptions produce only limited amounts of ash and cinders, but large volumes of lava that flows into gentle slopes.</div> </div> <div id=\"cs_spacer_917644\"> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917644\"> <div> <figure><img alt=\"Mount Sanford\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/sanfrd.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Mount Sanford (16,237') as seen from the Nabesna Road<br /> <br /> North of Mount Sanford and nearer to the road is the jagged prominence of Capital Mountain, with a summit elevation of 7,731'. The jagged dark colored ridge north and east of Mt. Wrangell is topped by 9,240' Tanada Peak. Capital Mountain and Tanada Peak are both remnants of once large shield volcanoes like Mount Wrangell, but their volcanic activity ceased and their summits have been heavily eroded and sculpted by the force of glaciers. Geologic studies and potassium-argon dating have indicated that the entire Tanada Peak shield volcano was formed between one and two million years ago and eroded to its present shape only during the last million years. On a clear day, Mount Jarvis can be seen over the right shoulder of Tanada Peak. It too is composed of lavas between one and two million years old, and its summit rises to 13,421 feet.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917642\"> <div>Flowing northward from the great ice fields of Mount Wrangell is the Copper Glacier. Its meltwaters give rise to the Copper River which flows northward off the mountains, and then westward along the end of the Wrangell Range. From there is turns southward and finally reaches Gulf of Alaska near Cordova. It is the only stream that cuts through the coastal barrier of the Chugach Mountains. Along much of its length, the Copper River marks the western boundary of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.<br /> <strong>Mile 16.6</strong><br /> Kettle Lake Wayside. This is a primitive camping spot and rest area. There are no vault toilets here.<br /> <strong>Mile 17.8</strong><br /> Dead Dog Hill Rest Area. This is a great site to take a break for wildlife viewing or bird watching. There are views of wetlands, a small lake, and boreal forest. Moose are seen here and caribou migrate through this area in the spring and fall. There is a vault toilet at this primitive camping site and rest area.<br /> <strong>Mile 18.9</strong><br /> Parking for the Caribou Creek Trail.<br /> <strong>Mile 19.2</strong><br /> Caribou Creek Trail & Access to Caribou Creek Cabin. Park at the gravel pit at mile 18.9. The trail is approximately 3 miles long and offers views of the Wrangell Mountains and the lakes and rivers below. The trail ends at a cabin, but you could hike further into the hills. Reservations are required for use of the Caribou Creek cabin. Contact the Wrangell-St. Elias Visitor Center to sign up for this public use cabin.<br /> <strong>Mile 21.8</strong><br /> Rock Lake Wayside & Access to Viking Lodge Cabin. This is a primitive camping spot and rest area. There is a vault toilet here. The trail is approximately 1/4 mile long to the cabin and departs from the north side ofthe road. Reservations are required for use of Viking Lodge cabin. Contact the Wrangell-St. Elias Visitor Center to sign up for this public use cabin.<br /> <strong>Mile 24.5</strong><br /> Tanada Lake Trail. This trail is primarily an ORV trail and is generally not suitable for hiking.<br /> <strong>Mile 24.7</strong><br /> Watershed Divide. This is the highest point along the Nabesna Road with an elevation of 3,320'. Waters flowing west and south from here are carried into the Copper River and ultimately the Gulf of Alaska. Waters flowing easterly from here are carried by Jack Creek into the Nabesna River and on through the Tanana River to the Yukon River which empties into the Bering Sea.<br /> <strong>Mile 27.8</strong><br /> Kendesnii Campground. Ten campsites, picnic tables, fire rings, and two vault toilets provide a nice spot for camping. Campground is first-come, first-served and is free. There are picnic sites near the shoreline of the lakes and short hiking trails. Enjoy canoeing, viewing waterfowl, and fishing for grayling.<br /> Toward the northeast in the Mentasta Range is a conspicuously multi-colored mountain. The lower slopes are made up of dark reddish-brown and greenish-gray rock unit known as the Nikolai Greenstone. On top of these dark rocks rests a light colored (gray and tan) limestone. Both rock units date to the Triassic. Stream and gravity transport of limestone rubble down valleys and gullies has produced the prominent light stripes extending down the mountain slopes.<br /> The ridges north and south of Twin Lakes are composed of gravels deposited along the margins of glaciers. Such glacial rock dumps are called glacial moraines. These moraines were formed during the Wisconsin Glaciation. This was the last great ice age; it reached its maximum advance 18,000 years ago when ice covered much of Alaska, almost all of Canada, and extended well into the northern states.<br /> <strong>Mile 28.1</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - National Preserve. Both sides of the road are now \"National Preserve.\"<br /> BEFORE YOU CONTINUE: Road conditions can deteriorate beyond this point. Trail Creek (Mile 29.8), Lost Creek (Mile 31.2), and Boyden Creek (Mile 34.3) may be flowing across the road. Generally, these creek beds are dry, but during spring run off or following prolonged rain, high-clearance and/or four-wheel drive may be necessary. Carefully evaluate all crossings before driving across.</div> </div> <div id=\"cs_spacer_917946\"> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917946\"> <div> <figure><img alt=\"Lost Creek\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/Lost_Creek.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Use caution when water is crossing the road.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"cs_spacer_917658\"> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917658\"> <div><strong>Mile 29.8</strong><br /> Trail Creek Trail. Trailhead is located where Trail Creek crosses the road. Parking is along the road - do not park within the creek drainage. The trail is approximately 6 miles long and allows quick access to the backcountry. The trail ends within the creek drainage, but you can continue hiking another 4 miles to reach the pass.<br /> <strong>Mile 31.2</strong><br /> Lost Creek Trail. Trailhead is located just after Lost Creek crosses the road. Parking is located at the trailhead. The trail is approximately 7 miles long, but you can continue hiking another 3 miles to the pass. Trail gives you scenery, alpine tundra, flowers, and the chance to see Dall Sheep.<br /> <strong>Mile 32.5</strong><br /> The two flat topped hills south of the road are composed of the Wrangell Lavas partially mantled by rock debris and soils that contain permafrost. During summer thaws of this frozen terrain, surface materials are slowly transported downslope by creep and semi-fluid flow. The hummocky area at the base of the western hill was produced by an ancient landslide.<br /> <strong>Mile 35.3</strong><br /> Jack Creek Rest Area. Several nice campsites with picnic tables and fishing along Jack Creek. There is a vault toilet at this rest area. Look for Dall sheep in this area. These bright white, wild sheep inhabit high altitude ridges, meadows, and extremely rugged terrain. Sheep use these areas for feeding, resting, and to escape predators. Although they usually stay at higher elevations, in this area they are known to descend to springs and mineral licks. Careful observers can usually spot small flocks on the mountainsides over the next few miles.<br /> <strong>Mile 36.2</strong><br /> Skookum Volcano Trail. This trail is 2.5 miles one-way to a beautiful high pass.The trail leads through an extinct, deeply eroded volcanic system with fascinating geology. The elevation at the trailhead is 3,000' and rises to an elevation of 4,800' at the pass. Hikers can explore other routes or expand this hike into a multiple-day trip<br /> As you continue down the road, the jagged peaks south of the road are dominated by volcanic rocks ejected from the Skookum Creek Volcano. Volcanic Ash and hot gasses formed a fiery cloud which flowed down the flanks of an ancient volcano to produce the tan and light gray, conspicuously bedded rocks. Lava which issued from several nearby volcanic vents flowed downslope and solidified to produce the more massive pinkish-tan rocks. Radioactive dating of these rocks by USGS investigators shows that Skookum Creek Volcano was active between two and four million years ago. Deep canyons and steep slopes show that erosion has been very effective in wearing down the land during the last two million years.<br /> <strong>Mile 40.2</strong><br /> Reeve's Field Trail. This 4.2 mile trail leads to views of the Nabesna River. The Reeve's Field airstrip is no longer here, but this area holds important historical significance. During 1941, trucks hauled equipment from Valdez to a rustic strip along the river. Pilot Bob Reeve cut everything into pieces, loaded it into his Boeing Trimotor, flew them to Northway, about 40 miles north, and then had them re-welded. This effort was organized to build the Northway Airport, a critical stopover in ferrying lend-lease aircraft to the Soviet Union during WWII. By November, he had transported all the materials for a full-scale airport. It was good timing. One month later, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor gave Northway new relevance, and it became a critical element in the defense of Alaska.<br /> <strong>Mile 42.0</strong> - End of the Maintained Road<br /> The maintained portion of the Nabesna Road ends at the Devil's Mountain Lodge, which is private property. Please respect this property and their privacy. Stay alert, and be careful not to park on the airstrip.<br /> Parking: Approximately a 1/4 mile beyond the lodge, there is a gravel parking area that is located on public land. If you'd like to explore further by foot travel or bike, this is the best place to park your vehicle, as the road is not maintained beyond this point.<br /> <strong>Mile 42.5</strong><br /> Rambler Mine Trail. Approximately 1/4-mile past the parking area, a trail leads south towards the remains of the abandoned Rambler Mine, an area that was active after WWII. The one-mile trail is steep, but the effort rewards you with superlative views of the Nabesna River and Nutzotin Mountains.<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"View from the Rambler Mine Trail\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/Rambler.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> Nice views from above the Rambler Mine</div> </div> </div> </div>",

Route: From the Kennecott Visitor Center, walk through the Kennecott Mill Town, north towards the Root Glacier. About a half-mile beyond the visitor center, the road will split. Stay straight. (The right hand trail leads to Jumbo and Bonanza Mines.) The trail will soon cross over Bonanza Creek and Jumbo Creek and then wind its way through the lateral moraines of the Kennicott and Root Glaciers. Approximately 1.5 miles after leaving Kennecott, the trail reaches the Root Glacier access trail. (Primitive campsites, along with an outhouse and food lockers, are available in this area.) To access the glacier, turn left at the sign and follow the trail as it winds down the moraine to the toe of the glacier. This trail crosses Amazon Creek, which is a seasonal stream. Depending on recent rainfall or spring melt, you may need to cross this stream.<br /> <br /> Hazards: The Root Glacier can be very slippery and dangerous. Crampons are strongly recommended. Avoid walking along the edge of Root Glacier as rotting ice and swift, cold water are potentially dangerous. Bears are present along the entire route. For maximum safety, travel in groups, be noisy when you are walking, and never give any food to a bear.<br /> <br /> Notes: If you are camping at the Jumbo Creek Camping Area or Donaho Basin, it is required that your food is stored in the bear-resistant food boxes or your own Bear Resistant Food Container (BRFC).",

A small section of the Valdez Trail is on the Boreal Forest Trail around the Copper Center Visitor Center. <br /> <br /> <strong>Latitude: </strong>62.020196 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-145.366612</p> <h4>History of the Valdez Trail</h4> <p>by Geoffrey Bleakley, former Park Historian<br /> The Valdez Trail provided the first overland access to much of interior Alaska. Built by the U.S. Army and the Alaska Road Commission between 1898 and 1907, it followed a series of indigenous paths linked by such prominent explorers as Lt. Henry T. Allen, Capt. William R. Abercrombie, Capt. Edwin F. Glenn, and Lt. Joseph C. Castner. Although originally directed to Eagle City, the trail was diverted to Fairbanks following a nearby gold discovery in 1902. A closing thrust in a period of pioneer American trail building which began with Daniel Boone's construction of his Wilderness Road through the Allegheny Mountains in 1769, the Valdez Trail channelled people, freight, and mail into the district, promoting mining activity, aiding the development of supporting industries, and hastening the settlement of the Copper, Yukon, and Tanana river valleys.</p> <center> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Native groups traditionally controlled all of the land bordering the Valdez Trail. South of the Chugach mountains, the land belonged to the Chugach (or Prince William Sound) Eskimo. Various Athapaskan groups held the more northern territory. Each created their own transportation networks. In general, local paths were used for subsistence activities, while longer trails were used for trade and occasionally for raiding. These routes usually followed natural corridors such as river valleys and traversed the more obvious mountain passes. Trade occurred among the different Alaska Native groups long before contact with the Russians. The Ahtna, for example, often served as middlemen, bartering with the Chugach, Tlingit, and Eyak peoples, as well as their Athapaskan relatives, the Dena'ina and the Tanana. Although copper was their most important export, they also exchanged moose, caribou, lynx, and beaver pelts for marine products like seal skin boots. Both oral and documentary evidence suggests that the Ahtna regularly held intertribal trade fairs within the Valdez Trail corridor, including ones near both Thompson and Isabel passes.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>American Exploration of the Valdez Trail Corridor, 1885-1898.</strong><br /> When the United States acquired Alaska from Russia in 1867, neither party knew much about the territory's eastern interior. Russians had focused their attention on coastal areas and had only made a few abbreviated attempts to explore the region. Americans, in contrast, had never visited the area at all. Neglected for the next fifteen years, the district began attracting interest in the mid-1880s. Gold strikes in northern British Columbia's Cassiar region and near the present site of Juneau lured prospectors to the north. Many eventually entered the interior, most by way of the Yukon River, but some via Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. The American government worried about the potential for conflict between the undisciplined miners and Alaska's Native population. Consequently, the U.S. Army soon dispatched several expeditions to reconnoiter the region. One such party, led by Lt. Frederick Schwatka, charted the entire Yukon River in 1883. Another, headed by Lt. William R. Abercrombie, attempted to examine the Copper River basin the following year. Although stopped by rapids on the lower river, Abercrombie later located an alternative overland route to the interior: across the Valdez Glacier heading the Valdez Arm.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 1885, the army sent Lt. Henry T. Allen to finish Abercrombie's work. More successful than his predecessor, the lieutenant ascended the Copper River and pioneered the route across the Alaska Range and into the Tanana River valley.<br /> Five years later, a private expedition led by E. Hazard Wells added another segment. Journeying down the Yukon from its headwaters, the party traveled up the Fortymile River and traversed the Kechumstuk Hills to Mansfield Lake. From there, they crossed the Tanana River and ascended the Tok River to near Mentasta Pass. Much of this route was later incorporated into the trail's Eagle City Branch.<br /> <br /> Northern gold discoveries continued, climaxing with an especially rich find on northwestern Canada's Klondike River in 1896. This precipitated the region's greatest rush. In their haste to reach the gold fields, many stampeders prepared inadequately for the hardships they would have to endure. As a result, the U.S. Army soon received reports of widespread deprivation. Responding to the rumors, the military dispatched Capt. Patrick H. Ray and Lt. Wilds P. Richardson to proceed to Alaska and to provide necessary relief. Most stampeders reached the Klondike via a largely Canadian path over the Chilkoot Pass, located near the northern end of Alaska's Lynn Canal. Many, however, objected to the foreign control of that transportation corridor and called for an \"all-American route.\" Recognizing the logic of their demands, Ray recommended the immediate construction of a government trail into the Yukon River basin. Unscrupulous local promoters, circulating stories of an easy passage linking Prince William Sound with the interior, lured thousands of gullible stampeders to Port Valdez. Unfortunately, the arriving prospectors found only one way across the Chugach Range: Abercrombie's exceptionally difficult and dangerous path over the Valdez and Klutina glaciers. Faced with few options, most attempted that route, and many eventually died from disease, accidents, and exposure.<br /> In the spring of 1898, the army sent Capt. William R. Abercrombie back to Port Valdez, hoping to locate a safer way. The captain first inspected the Lowe River valley, where he spotted the remains of a Chugach trail leading to the north toward Keystone Canyon. Proceeding to the interior via the Valdez Glacier, Abercrombie found an Ahtna path leading up the right (or western) bank of the Copper River. Both were eventually utilized by the Valdez Trail.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Construction of the Valdez Trail, 1898-1906</strong><br /> Abercrombie returned to the region in 1899. Utilizing only hand tools, his soldiers built a 93-mile packhorse trail from the coastal community of Valdez to the Tonsina River. Weary stampeders immediately adopted this shorter path. Addison M. Powell, a civilian employee of Abercrombie's and an early explorer of the Chistochina River, reported that by the end of the summer, the route was already filled with prospectors headed for the Nizina River basin. Encouraged by such traffic, construction continued, and by 1901 the army had completed its trail all the way to Eagle City. Alaska residents soon demanded additional federal aid. In 1903, visiting members of a Senate Subcommittee on Territories heard testimony on a broad range of subjects, including the need for better transportation. Army Signal Corps Lt. William L. Mitchell, for example, related the current condition of the Valdez-Eagle City Trail. Pioneer Judge James Wickersham went even further. He requested that the government improve the route, calling such action an essential prerequisite to developing the interior's mining potential. U.S. Geological Survey geologist Alfred H. Brooks agreed. Incidental to a discussion on the future of placer mining, he recommended that a million dollars be spent in building wagon roads to the inland placer camps. Such arguments seem to have convinced the senators. Upon returning to Washington, they recommended that the government construct a system of transportation routes, beginning with a well-built wagon road connecting Valdez and Eagle City. That winter Congress appropriated $25,000 to conduct the initial survey. The following spring the War Department appointed an army engineer to supervise the work. Completing the job in August 1904, J. M. Clapp estimated that it would cost $3,500 per mile or a total of approximately $1.5 million to build the road.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By then, however, Eagle City had already lost its priority as the trail's terminus. Mineral production on the upper Yukon River had begun to decline, and Felix Pedro had discovered gold in the Tanana River valley. Stampeders heading for this new strike left the Eagle City Trail near the Gakona River and followed that stream to its headwaters. Joining Castner's path near Paxson Lake, they crossed the Alaska Range and proceeded down the Delta River. Upon reaching the Delta's mouth, they followed the Tanana River northwest to Fairbanks. By late 1903, this Fairbanks branch had become the dominant interior route.<br /> The new trail quickly attracted its first common carrier. In December 1904, James Fish announced that his Valdez Transportation Company would soon provide passenger service to Fairbanks. \"Over such part of the trail as is practical,\" he assured travelers, \"comfortable bob sleds will be fitted up and drawn by two horses. Over the summit, and wherever it is not practicable [sic] to run two horses abreast, the single double-ended sleds will be used and the horses driven tandem.\" A month later the first of its tri-weekly stages left Valdez, promising a nine day trip for the exorbitant price of $150.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">While not a stage passenger, Wickersham traveled the trail during the same period. Conditions remained somewhat primitive. The judge recorded crashing his dog-sled on the approach to Copper Center, suffering scratches, bruises, and a twisted ankle. Reaching the Chippewa \"roadhouse\" on a cold, February night, Wickersham found only a canvas lean-to attached to a small, open-fronted cabin. Admittedly austere, even this housing was jammed with \"men and dog-teams transporting mining supplies . . . to Fairbanks.\"<br /> <br /> Although too late to be enjoyed by Wickersham, trail improvements were already under discussion. That January, President Theodore Roosevelt had established the Board of Road Commissioners for Alaska (popularly known as the Alaska Road Commission or ARC) and designated Maj. Wilds P. Richardson as its first president. Richardson was particularly concerned about the development of interior Alaska and emphasized the speedy construction of a more permanent Valdez-Fairbanks route.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ARC's initial construction efforts met only basic demands. The trail's width was determined by its anticipated traffic. Light traffic required a 10-foot roadway, while heavy traffic demanded 16-feet. Over most level, well-drained ground, road crews merely cleared a corridor. Where it was possible to improve drainage, they sometimes removed the moss, \"grading up and crowning, with a single ditch on interior slope and frequent cross culverts to carry off seepage and rainfall and prevent cutting.\" In permafrost areas, where good drainage was impossible, crews utilized corduroy construction. Designed to prevent the frozen ground from melting and creating an impassable quagmire, this technique involved placing a layer of poles parallel to the roadbed and covering them with another layer at right angles to the first. Culvert construction varied. Where the needed water capacity was small, the Road Commission usually fabricated pipe culverts from four 12-inch planks. For larger applications, the crews built culverts entirely of log, except in treeless sections where they sometimes utilized a dry masonry technique.<br /> Under normal conditions, the Road Commission would probably have limited itself to reconnaissance and survey work that first season and not undertaken any real construction. Receiving urgent appeals from the residents of Fairbanks, however, Richardson moved to provide immediate relief. Road crews rapidly replaced 3,032 feet of worn-out corduroy and bridged about 25 small streams.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ARC distributed and cached the materials necessary for its next construction season along the entire route during the winter of 1905-06. Besides arranging for the delivery of rations, animal forage, and tools, it also began the job of bridging the Tazlina River. Built by Lars Holland, this $19,000 structure replaced a hazardous ferry on which several passengers had been drowned.<br /> For interior Alaska, the bridge was a technological wonder. Four hundred and fifty feet long, it employed two Howe truss spans of 108 feet, two King post spans of 50 feet, and approaches. The main trusses rested on pile bents, protected by 10 x 30 foot, rock-filled crib piers. The trusses were constructed of hewn lumber, with the lower chords built from four to six pieces, bolted and keyed together. A lack of large timber near the site forced Holland to secure trees from as much as six miles away.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Improving the trail was a difficult and expensive process. Engineers had to overcome many obstacles, including a short construction season, raging glacial rivers, permafrost, and an abundance of mountainous terrain. Crews relocated many of the original segments, including the one linking Gakona with Castner's pass. Nevertheless, by the end of the 1906 season, the Alaska Road Commission had finished the route. These trail refinements substantially speeded postal service. While previous contractors had required about ten and one-half days to traverse the distance between Valdez and Fairbanks, mail carrier Ed Orr completed the journey during the winter of 1906-07 in a record time of only six days, ten hours, and ten minutes. The refurbished trail also attracted more common carriers. In 1907, at least two stage lines vied for its passenger and freight business: Orr's company and another operated by Dan T. Kennedy. Orr's enterprise was particularly successful. Equipped with nine-passenger, horse-drawn bobsleds boasting fur robes and carbon-heated foot warmers, it moved travelers from the coast to Fairbanks in just eight days.<br /> <br /> Such changes had a dramatic effect on the community. Expanding quickly, the town soon acquired most of the amenities of civilization, including electric lights, running water, and a telephone system. Something of a supply depot for the rest of the interior, Fairbanks possessed hotels, schools, churches, hospitals, and even a daily newspaper. Although the town received substantial river traffic during its short summer, the remainder of the year the Valdez Trail provided its only access.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maintenance and Use of the Valdez Trail, 1907-1919</strong><br /> As the Road Commission grew more sophisticated, it eventually adopted fixed standards for its roads. A \"wagon road,\" for example, embraced \"only that class of road intended to meet the conditions of an all-year-round traffic of considerable tonnage, located with suitable grades, crowned, ditched, and drained, and corduroyed or planked where necessary.\" A \"winter road,\" like that between Valdez and Fairbanks, was \"designed to meet the requirements for winter travel only.\" While not crowned, ditched, or drained, such a road possessed suitable width for double teams and a proper grade for loads.<br /> <br /> In 1907, the Alaska Syndicate began developing its rich copper claims above the Kennicott Glacier. While it soon started work on an affiliated railroad, that project required over two years to complete. In the interim, the corporation moved its requisite personnel, supplies, and equipment via the southernmost section of the Valdez Trail. Acting swiftly, it erected a 400-ton mill and a 16,000 foot tramway before the railway ever reached the site. Granted substantial annual funding, the Alaska Road Commission gradually upgraded the Valdez Trail. Originally created for pack and saddle horses, it quickly evolved into a winter road and by the end of 1908, about a third was suitable for wagons. Traffic increased as well. J. H. Ingram, the superintendent of the Valdez District, estimated that contractors had moved over 83,000 pounds of mail, 2,500 tons of freight, and nearly 100 head of cattle over his section during the preceding year.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By now, enterprising citizens had located \"roadhouses\" along the entire route. Usually owned by homesteaders, these inns provided travelers with a convenient and comfortable place to stop. As most operators cultivated gardens, many supplied fresh vegetables in season. Not surprisingly, these lodges became the local nodes: what Richardson called \"small centers of settlement and supply\" from which to explore the adjoining country.<br /> <br /> The trail itself, however, still needed a little work. In 1908, one pilgrim died when the sled in which he was riding overturned after hitting a chuckhole near the Tiekel River. Travelers experienced other setbacks, as well. Extensive flooding in 1909 severely damaged the Tazlina River Bridge. Repairs cost more than $13,000, about 70 percent of the price of the original structure, and required nearly a year to complete. During the summer of 1909, maintenance of the Valdez Trail required 19 crews. Each consisted of a foreman, cook, two teamsters, and about 20 laborers, plus a wagon and six to eight horses for moving camp and hauling timbers. \"Plows and scrapers were used wherever practicable, although the greater part of the work, being in a broken and rocky country or through brush and timber swamp, had to be done by hand with pick, mattock, and shovel.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 1910, the trail received its first serious competition. Roughly parallelling its southernmost one-quarter, the Copper River and Northwestern Railroad immediately captured most of the freight traffic headed for the Chitina River valley. Because the train was faster, many Fairbanks-bound travelers also rode it. Disembarking in Chitina, they rejoined the Valdez-Fairbanks route via the newly constructed Chitina-Willow Creek (later Edgerton) Cutoff. Use of the Valdez to Willow Creek section subsequently declined. Ignoring the competition, the Board maintained its expenditures. In 1910, for example, it spent $248,782 on improving the trail. Eventually, its persistent efforts began to achieve results. That August, for example, Richardson made the first continuous trip over the route in a wagon, covering the entire distance in only 13 days!<br /> <br /> The following year the ARC built a new, 420-foot bridge over the Tonsina River, replacing one constructed by the military in 1900 and now considered unsafe. Except for the Gulkana, Delta, Tanana, Salcha, and Piledriver Slough, all important rivers traversed by the trail were now bridged. Of the remaining five, only the Delta lacked a ferry. Bridge work continued in 1912. The Road Commission placed a 40-foot truss over Ptarmigan Creek, two 60-foot spans across Stewart Creek, and a 270-foot pile trestle over Gunn Creek. Most impressive, however, was its 748-foot bridge, possessing a single center king-post, over an unnamed glacier stream near the Miller Roadhouse. The new bridges contributed to another innovation. In 1913, the first motorized vehicle traveled the entire length of the trail. The automobile averaged about nine miles per hour, despite having to be \"helped through soft spots on rather heavy grades.\" Others quickly followed. The Road Commission, however, largely ignored the phenomenon, declaring that it made \"no pretense of having built roads adapted for automobile travel.\" Five years later its basic position remained unchanged. While acknowledging the increasing number of such vehicles, the Board still discouraged their use. Despite the ARC's objections, mechanization had clearly arrived. In 1918, the Board purchased two tractors, one eight-foot road grader, three six-foot road graders, four three-way road drags, and four heavy trucks. Automobile stage coaches now traveled regular routes between Valdez and Fairbanks and motorized vehicles carried most of the mail. No longer a trail, in 1919 the Road Commission conceded to the inevitable and redesignated it as the Richardson Road in honor of its newly retired first president, Colonel Wilds P. Richardson.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maintenance and Use of the Richardson Road, 1920-1945.</strong><br /> Journeying to Alaska in 1923 to dedicate the Alaska Railroad, President Warren G. Harding inspected both ends of the Richardson Road. While he only viewed about 50 miles of the corridor, he was apparently impressed. In a speech delivered upon his return to Seattle, he noted that \"our long national experience in pushing our highways ahead of the controlling wave of settlement ought to convince us that the broadest liberality towards roads in Alaska will be sure to bring manifold returns.\" In keeping with that belief, the President pledged \"to serve Alaska generously, and more, in this matter of road building.\" Nothing, however, came of his promise; Harding died only a few days later.<br /> <br /> By 1925, tour companies throughout the United States advertised the Richardson Highway as the center portion of the \"Golden Belt Line.\" Appealing to the more adventurous traveler, this circular route stretched from Cordova to Seward and incorporated the Copper River and Northwest Railroad at one end and the Alaska Railroad at the other. One major automobile carrier, aptly designated the Richardson Highway Transportation Company, carried hundreds of passengers each season, operating what it described as a fleet of passenger vehicles over the road \"without delay or inconvenience.\" Controversy erupted in 1932 when the Interior Department tried to increase the profitability of the Alaska Railroad by taxing Richardson Highway users. When most motorists ignored its license fee requirements, the Road Commission tried another tack: collecting a toll at the commission-operated ferry across the Tanana River. Commercial carriers quickly objected and, beginning in 1940, staged a general revolt. Rebellious truckers crossed the river on a home-built scow, defiantly flying a skull-and-crossbones flag. When challenged, one group even seized and disarmed the local U.S. Deputy Marshall. Despite such flagrant violations, the government was powerless to enforce its law. A Fairbanks grand jury judged the tax to be discriminatory and refused to return indictments against the accused. In 1942, Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes finally bowed to the inevitable and repealed the toll.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The threat of war brought many changes to the Richardson Highway. In 1940, Lt. Gen. John L. Dewitt, the commander of the U.S. Fourth Army, recognized that Anchorage was isolated and vulnerable to attack. To alleviate the danger, he proposed connecting the city to the road. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, the head of the Alaska Defense Command, agreed, further suggesting that the highway be widened and straightened, and that its bridges be strengthened sufficiently to withstand the anticipated increase in military traffic. Both were prudent requests. Following the outbreak of World War II, the men and supplies used to construct the Alaska section of the Alcan (now called the Alaska) Highway were all moved along the Richardson, with materials flowing southeast from Fairbanks as well as north from Valdez. Finished in November 1942, the Alcan joined the Richardson Highway to the remainder of the North American highway system at the interior Alaskan village of Delta Junction. The Anchorage connection came more slowly. It was late 1943 before the Glenn Highway, named for pioneer Alaskan explorer, Capt. Edwin F. Glenn, linked the city to the Richardson Highway at Glennallen.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Trail Today</strong><br /> Much of the Valdez Trail now lies buried beneath its major successors, the Richardson and Glenn Highways. Nevertheless, some important pieces remain. The segment between the Tanana and Fortymile Rivers, for example was largely abandoned following the Fairbanks gold discovery, and therefore exemplifies the earliest period of construction. Other sections, like the one found near the Wrangell St. Elias National Park headquarters/visitor center, were bypassed later, and represent subsequent building epochs. Today, park visitors enjoy the trail and walk through the Boreal forest around the visitor center.</p> </center>",

Extending from Valdez to Eagle City, then later rerouted to Fairbanks, the trail opened the interior to modern civilization. At first it was a foot trail, then a wagon trail, and finally, in 1919, a motorized roadway. The Valdez Trail was the main stem for Alaska pioneer travel. In 1901 the trail reached Eagle City. By 1904 it was diverted to Fairbanks. Gold miners, followed by entrepreneurs, postal carriers, freight and passenger transporters, and adventurers, all used the trail. Roadhouses —rustic inns —sprang up along the route. Roadhouses begot communities. Communities begot amenities. And the trail helped bring electric lights, running water, and a telephone system to frontier Fairbanks. Roadhouses, like the Wortman’s shown here, competed for the weary traveler’s dollar, offering such comforts as sheltered beds, hot baths, and hearty meals.</p> <h4><br /> History of the Valdez Trail</h4> <p>by Geoffrey Bleakley, former Park Historian</p> <center> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Valdez Trail provided the first overland access to much of interior Alaska. Built by the U.S. Army and the Alaska Road Commission between 1898 and 1907, it followed a series of indigenous paths linked by such prominent explorers as Lt. Henry T. Allen, Capt. William R. Abercrombie, Capt. Edwin F. Glenn, and Lt. Joseph C. Castner. Although originally directed to Eagle City, the trail was diverted to Fairbanks following a nearby gold discovery in 1902. A closing thrust in a period of pioneer American trail building which began with Daniel Boone's construction of his Wilderness Road through the Allegheny Mountains in 1769, the Valdez Trail channelled people, freight, and mail into the district, promoting mining activity, aiding the development of supporting industries, and hastening the settlement of the Copper, Yukon, and Tanana river valleys.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Native groups traditionally controlled all of the land bordering the Valdez Trail. South of the Chugach mountains, the land belonged to the Chugach (or Prince William Sound) Eskimo. Various Athapaskan groups held the more northern territory. Each created their own transportation networks. In general, local paths were used for subsistence activities, while longer trails were used for trade and occasionally for raiding. These routes usually followed natural corridors such as river valleys and traversed the more obvious mountain passes. Trade occurred among the different Alaska Native groups long before contact with the Russians. The Ahtna, for example, often served as middlemen, bartering with the Chugach, Tlingit, and Eyak peoples, as well as their Athapaskan relatives, the Dena'ina and the Tanana. Although copper was their most important export, they also exchanged moose, caribou, lynx, and beaver pelts for marine products like seal skin boots. Both oral and documentary evidence suggests that the Ahtna regularly held intertribal trade fairs within the Valdez Trail corridor, including ones near both Thompson and Isabel passes.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>American Exploration of the Valdez Trail Corridor, 1885-1898.</strong><br /> When the United States acquired Alaska from Russia in 1867, neither party knew much about the territory's eastern interior. Russians had focused their attention on coastal areas and had only made a few abbreviated attempts to explore the region. Americans, in contrast, had never visited the area at all. Neglected for the next fifteen years, the district began attracting interest in the mid-1880s. Gold strikes in northern British Columbia's Cassiar region and near the present site of Juneau lured prospectors to the north. Many eventually entered the interior, most by way of the Yukon River, but some via Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. The American government worried about the potential for conflict between the undisciplined miners and Alaska's Native population. Consequently, the U.S. Army soon dispatched several expeditions to reconnoiter the region. One such party, led by Lt. Frederick Schwatka, charted the entire Yukon River in 1883. Another, headed by Lt. William R. Abercrombie, attempted to examine the Copper River basin the following year. Although stopped by rapids on the lower river, Abercrombie later located an alternative overland route to the interior: across the Valdez Glacier heading the Valdez Arm.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 1885, the army sent Lt. Henry T. Allen to finish Abercrombie's work. More successful than his predecessor, the lieutenant ascended the Copper River and pioneered the route across the Alaska Range and into the Tanana River valley.<br /> Five years later, a private expedition led by E. Hazard Wells added another segment. Journeying down the Yukon from its headwaters, the party traveled up the Fortymile River and traversed the Kechumstuk Hills to Mansfield Lake. From there, they crossed the Tanana River and ascended the Tok River to near Mentasta Pass. Much of this route was later incorporated into the trail's Eagle City Branch.<br /> <br /> Northern gold discoveries continued, climaxing with an especially rich find on northwestern Canada's Klondike River in 1896. This precipitated the region's greatest rush. In their haste to reach the gold fields, many stampeders prepared inadequately for the hardships they would have to endure. As a result, the U.S. Army soon received reports of widespread deprivation. Responding to the rumors, the military dispatched Capt. Patrick H. Ray and Lt. Wilds P. Richardson to proceed to Alaska and to provide necessary relief. Most stampeders reached the Klondike via a largely Canadian path over the Chilkoot Pass, located near the northern end of Alaska's Lynn Canal. Many, however, objected to the foreign control of that transportation corridor and called for an \"all-American route.\" Recognizing the logic of their demands, Ray recommended the immediate construction of a government trail into the Yukon River basin. Unscrupulous local promoters, circulating stories of an easy passage linking Prince William Sound with the interior, lured thousands of gullible stampeders to Port Valdez. Unfortunately, the arriving prospectors found only one way across the Chugach Range: Abercrombie's exceptionally difficult and dangerous path over the Valdez and Klutina glaciers. Faced with few options, most attempted that route, and many eventually died from disease, accidents, and exposure.<br /> In the spring of 1898, the army sent Capt. William R. Abercrombie back to Port Valdez, hoping to locate a safer way. The captain first inspected the Lowe River valley, where he spotted the remains of a Chugach trail leading to the north toward Keystone Canyon. Proceeding to the interior via the Valdez Glacier, Abercrombie found an Ahtna path leading up the right (or western) bank of the Copper River. Both were eventually utilized by the Valdez Trail.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Construction of the Valdez Trail, 1898-1906</strong><br /> Abercrombie returned to the region in 1899. Utilizing only hand tools, his soldiers built a 93-mile packhorse trail from the coastal community of Valdez to the Tonsina River. Weary stampeders immediately adopted this shorter path. Addison M. Powell, a civilian employee of Abercrombie's and an early explorer of the Chistochina River, reported that by the end of the summer, the route was already filled with prospectors headed for the Nizina River basin. Encouraged by such traffic, construction continued, and by 1901 the army had completed its trail all the way to Eagle City. Alaska residents soon demanded additional federal aid. In 1903, visiting members of a Senate Subcommittee on Territories heard testimony on a broad range of subjects, including the need for better transportation. Army Signal Corps Lt. William L. Mitchell, for example, related the current condition of the Valdez-Eagle City Trail. Pioneer Judge James Wickersham went even further. He requested that the government improve the route, calling such action an essential prerequisite to developing the interior's mining potential. U.S. Geological Survey geologist Alfred H. Brooks agreed. Incidental to a discussion on the future of placer mining, he recommended that a million dollars be spent in building wagon roads to the inland placer camps. Such arguments seem to have convinced the senators. Upon returning to Washington, they recommended that the government construct a system of transportation routes, beginning with a well-built wagon road connecting Valdez and Eagle City. That winter Congress appropriated $25,000 to conduct the initial survey. The following spring the War Department appointed an army engineer to supervise the work. Completing the job in August 1904, J. M. Clapp estimated that it would cost $3,500 per mile or a total of approximately $1.5 million to build the road.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By then, however, Eagle City had already lost its priority as the trail's terminus. Mineral production on the upper Yukon River had begun to decline, and Felix Pedro had discovered gold in the Tanana River valley. Stampeders heading for this new strike left the Eagle City Trail near the Gakona River and followed that stream to its headwaters. Joining Castner's path near Paxson Lake, they crossed the Alaska Range and proceeded down the Delta River. Upon reaching the Delta's mouth, they followed the Tanana River northwest to Fairbanks. By late 1903, this Fairbanks branch had become the dominant interior route.<br /> The new trail quickly attracted its first common carrier. In December 1904, James Fish announced that his Valdez Transportation Company would soon provide passenger service to Fairbanks. \"Over such part of the trail as is practical,\" he assured travelers, \"comfortable bob sleds will be fitted up and drawn by two horses. Over the summit, and wherever it is not practicable [sic] to run two horses abreast, the single double-ended sleds will be used and the horses driven tandem.\" A month later the first of its tri-weekly stages left Valdez, promising a nine day trip for the exorbitant price of $150.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">While not a stage passenger, Wickersham traveled the trail during the same period. Conditions remained somewhat primitive. The judge recorded crashing his dog-sled on the approach to Copper Center, suffering scratches, bruises, and a twisted ankle. Reaching the Chippewa \"roadhouse\" on a cold, February night, Wickersham found only a canvas lean-to attached to a small, open-fronted cabin. Admittedly austere, even this housing was jammed with \"men and dog-teams transporting mining supplies . . . to Fairbanks.\"<br /> <br /> Although too late to be enjoyed by Wickersham, trail improvements were already under discussion. That January, President Theodore Roosevelt had established the Board of Road Commissioners for Alaska (popularly known as the Alaska Road Commission or ARC) and designated Maj. Wilds P. Richardson as its first president. Richardson was particularly concerned about the development of interior Alaska and emphasized the speedy construction of a more permanent Valdez-Fairbanks route.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ARC's initial construction efforts met only basic demands. The trail's width was determined by its anticipated traffic. Light traffic required a 10-foot roadway, while heavy traffic demanded 16-feet. Over most level, well-drained ground, road crews merely cleared a corridor. Where it was possible to improve drainage, they sometimes removed the moss, \"grading up and crowning, with a single ditch on interior slope and frequent cross culverts to carry off seepage and rainfall and prevent cutting.\" In permafrost areas, where good drainage was impossible, crews utilized corduroy construction. Designed to prevent the frozen ground from melting and creating an impassable quagmire, this technique involved placing a layer of poles parallel to the roadbed and covering them with another layer at right angles to the first. Culvert construction varied. Where the needed water capacity was small, the Road Commission usually fabricated pipe culverts from four 12-inch planks. For larger applications, the crews built culverts entirely of log, except in treeless sections where they sometimes utilized a dry masonry technique.<br /> Under normal conditions, the Road Commission would probably have limited itself to reconnaissance and survey work that first season and not undertaken any real construction. Receiving urgent appeals from the residents of Fairbanks, however, Richardson moved to provide immediate relief. Road crews rapidly replaced 3,032 feet of worn-out corduroy and bridged about 25 small streams.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ARC distributed and cached the materials necessary for its next construction season along the entire route during the winter of 1905-06. Besides arranging for the delivery of rations, animal forage, and tools, it also began the job of bridging the Tazlina River. Built by Lars Holland, this $19,000 structure replaced a hazardous ferry on which several passengers had been drowned.<br /> For interior Alaska, the bridge was a technological wonder. Four hundred and fifty feet long, it employed two Howe truss spans of 108 feet, two King post spans of 50 feet, and approaches. The main trusses rested on pile bents, protected by 10 x 30 foot, rock-filled crib piers. The trusses were constructed of hewn lumber, with the lower chords built from four to six pieces, bolted and keyed together. A lack of large timber near the site forced Holland to secure trees from as much as six miles away.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Improving the trail was a difficult and expensive process. Engineers had to overcome many obstacles, including a short construction season, raging glacial rivers, permafrost, and an abundance of mountainous terrain. Crews relocated many of the original segments, including the one linking Gakona with Castner's pass. Nevertheless, by the end of the 1906 season, the Alaska Road Commission had finished the route. These trail refinements substantially speeded postal service. While previous contractors had required about ten and one-half days to traverse the distance between Valdez and Fairbanks, mail carrier Ed Orr completed the journey during the winter of 1906-07 in a record time of only six days, ten hours, and ten minutes. The refurbished trail also attracted more common carriers. In 1907, at least two stage lines vied for its passenger and freight business: Orr's company and another operated by Dan T. Kennedy. Orr's enterprise was particularly successful. Equipped with nine-passenger, horse-drawn bobsleds boasting fur robes and carbon-heated foot warmers, it moved travelers from the coast to Fairbanks in just eight days.<br /> <br /> Such changes had a dramatic effect on the community. Expanding quickly, the town soon acquired most of the amenities of civilization, including electric lights, running water, and a telephone system. Something of a supply depot for the rest of the interior, Fairbanks possessed hotels, schools, churches, hospitals, and even a daily newspaper. Although the town received substantial river traffic during its short summer, the remainder of the year the Valdez Trail provided its only access.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maintenance and Use of the Valdez Trail, 1907-1919</strong><br /> As the Road Commission grew more sophisticated, it eventually adopted fixed standards for its roads. A \"wagon road,\" for example, embraced \"only that class of road intended to meet the conditions of an all-year-round traffic of considerable tonnage, located with suitable grades, crowned, ditched, and drained, and corduroyed or planked where necessary.\" A \"winter road,\" like that between Valdez and Fairbanks, was \"designed to meet the requirements for winter travel only.\" While not crowned, ditched, or drained, such a road possessed suitable width for double teams and a proper grade for loads.<br /> <br /> In 1907, the Alaska Syndicate began developing its rich copper claims above the Kennicott Glacier. While it soon started work on an affiliated railroad, that project required over two years to complete. In the interim, the corporation moved its requisite personnel, supplies, and equipment via the southernmost section of the Valdez Trail. Acting swiftly, it erected a 400-ton mill and a 16,000 foot tramway before the railway ever reached the site. Granted substantial annual funding, the Alaska Road Commission gradually upgraded the Valdez Trail. Originally created for pack and saddle horses, it quickly evolved into a winter road and by the end of 1908, about a third was suitable for wagons. Traffic increased as well. J. H. Ingram, the superintendent of the Valdez District, estimated that contractors had moved over 83,000 pounds of mail, 2,500 tons of freight, and nearly 100 head of cattle over his section during the preceding year.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By now, enterprising citizens had located \"roadhouses\" along the entire route. Usually owned by homesteaders, these inns provided travelers with a convenient and comfortable place to stop. As most operators cultivated gardens, many supplied fresh vegetables in season. Not surprisingly, these lodges became the local nodes: what Richardson called \"small centers of settlement and supply\" from which to explore the adjoining country.<br /> <br /> The trail itself, however, still needed a little work. In 1908, one pilgrim died when the sled in which he was riding overturned after hitting a chuckhole near the Tiekel River. Travelers experienced other setbacks, as well. Extensive flooding in 1909 severely damaged the Tazlina River Bridge. Repairs cost more than $13,000, about 70 percent of the price of the original structure, and required nearly a year to complete. During the summer of 1909, maintenance of the Valdez Trail required 19 crews. Each consisted of a foreman, cook, two teamsters, and about 20 laborers, plus a wagon and six to eight horses for moving camp and hauling timbers. \"Plows and scrapers were used wherever practicable, although the greater part of the work, being in a broken and rocky country or through brush and timber swamp, had to be done by hand with pick, mattock, and shovel.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 1910, the trail received its first serious competition. Roughly parallelling its southernmost one-quarter, the Copper River and Northwestern Railroad immediately captured most of the freight traffic headed for the Chitina River valley. Because the train was faster, many Fairbanks-bound travelers also rode it. Disembarking in Chitina, they rejoined the Valdez-Fairbanks route via the newly constructed Chitina-Willow Creek (later Edgerton) Cutoff. Use of the Valdez to Willow Creek section subsequently declined. Ignoring the competition, the Board maintained its expenditures. In 1910, for example, it spent $248,782 on improving the trail. Eventually, its persistent efforts began to achieve results. That August, for example, Richardson made the first continuous trip over the route in a wagon, covering the entire distance in only 13 days!<br /> <br /> The following year the ARC built a new, 420-foot bridge over the Tonsina River, replacing one constructed by the military in 1900 and now considered unsafe. Except for the Gulkana, Delta, Tanana, Salcha, and Piledriver Slough, all important rivers traversed by the trail were now bridged. Of the remaining five, only the Delta lacked a ferry. Bridge work continued in 1912. The Road Commission placed a 40-foot truss over Ptarmigan Creek, two 60-foot spans across Stewart Creek, and a 270-foot pile trestle over Gunn Creek. Most impressive, however, was its 748-foot bridge, possessing a single center king-post, over an unnamed glacier stream near the Miller Roadhouse. The new bridges contributed to another innovation. In 1913, the first motorized vehicle traveled the entire length of the trail. The automobile averaged about nine miles per hour, despite having to be \"helped through soft spots on rather heavy grades.\" Others quickly followed. The Road Commission, however, largely ignored the phenomenon, declaring that it made \"no pretense of having built roads adapted for automobile travel.\" Five years later its basic position remained unchanged. While acknowledging the increasing number of such vehicles, the Board still discouraged their use. Despite the ARC's objections, mechanization had clearly arrived. In 1918, the Board purchased two tractors, one eight-foot road grader, three six-foot road graders, four three-way road drags, and four heavy trucks. Automobile stage coaches now traveled regular routes between Valdez and Fairbanks and motorized vehicles carried most of the mail. No longer a trail, in 1919 the Road Commission conceded to the inevitable and redesignated it as the Richardson Road in honor of its newly retired first president, Colonel Wilds P. Richardson.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maintenance and Use of the Richardson Road, 1920-1945.</strong><br /> Journeying to Alaska in 1923 to dedicate the Alaska Railroad, President Warren G. Harding inspected both ends of the Richardson Road. While he only viewed about 50 miles of the corridor, he was apparently impressed. In a speech delivered upon his return to Seattle, he noted that \"our long national experience in pushing our highways ahead of the controlling wave of settlement ought to convince us that the broadest liberality towards roads in Alaska will be sure to bring manifold returns.\" In keeping with that belief, the President pledged \"to serve Alaska generously, and more, in this matter of road building.\" Nothing, however, came of his promise; Harding died only a few days later.<br /> <br /> By 1925, tour companies throughout the United States advertised the Richardson Highway as the center portion of the \"Golden Belt Line.\" Appealing to the more adventurous traveler, this circular route stretched from Cordova to Seward and incorporated the Copper River and Northwest Railroad at one end and the Alaska Railroad at the other. One major automobile carrier, aptly designated the Richardson Highway Transportation Company, carried hundreds of passengers each season, operating what it described as a fleet of passenger vehicles over the road \"without delay or inconvenience.\" Controversy erupted in 1932 when the Interior Department tried to increase the profitability of the Alaska Railroad by taxing Richardson Highway users. When most motorists ignored its license fee requirements, the Road Commission tried another tack: collecting a toll at the commission-operated ferry across the Tanana River. Commercial carriers quickly objected and, beginning in 1940, staged a general revolt. Rebellious truckers crossed the river on a home-built scow, defiantly flying a skull-and-crossbones flag. When challenged, one group even seized and disarmed the local U.S. Deputy Marshall. Despite such flagrant violations, the government was powerless to enforce its law. A Fairbanks grand jury judged the tax to be discriminatory and refused to return indictments against the accused. In 1942, Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes finally bowed to the inevitable and repealed the toll.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The threat of war brought many changes to the Richardson Highway. In 1940, Lt. Gen. John L. Dewitt, the commander of the U.S. Fourth Army, recognized that Anchorage was isolated and vulnerable to attack. To alleviate the danger, he proposed connecting the city to the road. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, the head of the Alaska Defense Command, agreed, further suggesting that the highway be widened and straightened, and that its bridges be strengthened sufficiently to withstand the anticipated increase in military traffic. Both were prudent requests. Following the outbreak of World War II, the men and supplies used to construct the Alaska section of the Alcan (now called the Alaska) Highway were all moved along the Richardson, with materials flowing southeast from Fairbanks as well as north from Valdez. Finished in November 1942, the Alcan joined the Richardson Highway to the remainder of the North American highway system at the interior Alaskan village of Delta Junction. The Anchorage connection came more slowly. It was late 1943 before the Glenn Highway, named for pioneer Alaskan explorer, Capt. Edwin F. Glenn, linked the city to the Richardson Highway at Glennallen.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Trail Today</strong><br /> Much of the Valdez Trail now lies buried beneath its major successors, the Richardson and Glenn Highways. Nevertheless, some important pieces remain. The segment between the Tanana and Fortymile Rivers, for example was largely abandoned following the Fairbanks gold discovery, and therefore exemplifies the earliest period of construction. Other sections, like the one found near the Wrangell St. Elias National Park headquarters/visitor center, were bypassed later, and represent subsequent building epochs. Today, park visitors enjoy the trail and walk through the Boreal forest around the visitor center.</p> </center> </div>",

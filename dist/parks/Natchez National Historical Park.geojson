This is the first stop on a self-guided tour that will take you around the grounds of the estate, past the mansion and outbuildings, and through the gardens. As you walk to the front of the house, you may wonder \"Why is Melrose part of a National Park?\" Simply, because it is one of the best-preserved estates in the Deep South from the mid-1800s. For that reason, it was named a National Historic Landmark in 1974. Melrose helps tell the American stories of an economy based on growing cotton and the world of chattel slavery. </p> <p>This land was once part of a series of Indian villages. The early French settlers called this area “Natchez” after the name of the native people who lived here. As the number of settlers and their enslaved African workers grew, so did disputes with the Natchez. After a series of wars, the Natchez Indians and some Africans rose up against the French in 1729. The French drove the Natchez out of this area and sold many of them into slavery. Over the next 70 years, European countries enticed settlers into the area with offers of large land grants. One early settler, Alexander Moore, bought land on this site in 1790, not long before the region entered the United States as part of the Mississippi Territory. </p> <p>The story of the Melrose estate begins many years later when John McMurran bought part of Moore’s plantation in 1841. By then the land was described as an “old waste cotton field.” McMurran crafted the estate that you see today. By 1860, Melrose was home to John McMurran, his wife Mary Louisa, and their two children. It was also home to twenty-two enslaved people of African descent who worked on the estate. </p> <p>After the Civil War, the McMurrans sold Melrose to Elizabeth and George Malin Davis. They then left it to their daughter Julia and her family. Julia’s son, George Kelly, and his wife, Ethel, moved to Natchez in 1909. They made Melrose a focal point of the Natchez Spring Pilgrimage tours that started in 1932. After Ethel Kelly’s death in 1975, John and Betty Callon purchased and restored the estate. The unique importance of the Natchez story led Congress to create a new national park in 1988. Natchez National Historical Park tells the story of all the peoples of Natchez. The Melrose estate with its land, its historic buildings, and its museum collection, serves as the centerpiece of the park.  </p>",

Behind the mansion was the world of the enslaved.</p> <p>Like the front of the mansion, the wall of the gallery across the back of the house and the brick columns were painted to look like stone. A steep exterior stairway on the north end was hidden behind painted wooden blinds. This gave the household servants almost invisible access to the second floor of the house. Several slave bells are located across the back gallery. They were used to call slaves to carry out tasks for the McMurran family and their guests inside the house. Those bells could ring at any time of the day or night, for a slave’s time was not their own. Two slave bells in the basement of the big house were used to call slaves from the two parlors, dining room, or front door, the most important areas of the mansion. These bells are located near basement rooms that have fireplaces, where an enslaved person was probably always stationed to answer the call any time of the day or night.</p>",

It sat near the smokehouse, two cisterns, and the dirt path that led straight out to the large vegetable garden. Its nearness to the servant hall entrance into the back of the mansion aided the swift service of hot food to the mansion dining room.</p> <p>The Melrose kitchen featured three rooms upstairs and three rooms downstairs. The first floor contained the cooking kitchen. The first floor also held a pantry and a possible dining room for the Melrose slaves. The cooks and some of the other household servants lived in the three upstairs rooms. An enslaved woman, Rachel, was the primary cook in 1850 and probably lived above the kitchen until 1864. Family letters mention another cook, “Dicey,” who was a slave on the nearby Quitman family estate, Monmouth.  “Mammy” Helen sometimes cooked, and she too likely lived in an upstairs room in the kitchen or dairy building. Mammy Helen was initially a nurse to the McMurran children. As they grew older, she probably played a role in nursing the children of other slaves.

The enslaved people who lived there were not tied to the call of the slave bells on the back of the mansion. Their tasks probably included working with some of the livestock or working on the estate grounds. The cabin to the right originally consisted of three rooms or “cells” with no interior doors. This cabin would have housed three separate families. The other, two-room cabin, would have held two families.</p> <p>The cabins offered a separate world with its own community. In 1856 two sets of young people had weddings at Melrose. The McMurrans’ daughter Mary married Farar Conner in the drawing room of the mansion. Patrick and Mime, described by Mary Louisa McMurran as “two we have reared and trained in the family – the children of old and favourite servants,” were married here as well. Mrs. McMurran wrote that after their wedding, Patrick and Mime “retired and passed the evening with some invited friends, and had a fine supper.” Viola, an enslaved cook at nearby Monmouth, served as bridesmaid; she was married to Marcellas, described as the “second waiter” at Melrose.</p> <p>Like Alice Sims, Jane Johnson came to Melrose with the Davis family in 1866. She was still working as a cook for the family but was no longer enslaved. Tradition holds that she and her family lived in the larger three-room cabin. She had it altered by the addition of interior doors. Slave cabins in town or on estates such as Melrose had wooden floors, glass paned windows with exterior shutters, and some store-bought furnishings. These cabins were often nicer in comparison to those on remote plantations. A wooden privy building, or outhouse, sits behind these two slave cabins.</p>",

Milk cows were a necessity, providing dairy products for the estate. Poultry was plentiful. Chickens, ducks, geese, turkey, and guinea fowl were given free roam of the grounds or kept in separate poultry houses and pens.

They allow for several carriages and wagons to be housed inside. Charles, an enslaved man, is identified in family letters and papers as the McMurrans’ carriage driver. He held a post of great responsibility. He had to navigate unpaved and hazardous roads. Carriages frequently broke down. The large, powerful horses could become frightened and uncontrollable. An 1843 letter from Eliza Quitman to her husband John described such an accident: “Mr. McMurran’s horse ran off with his Barouche yesterday morning and injured the carriage very much. Charles was on his way out to Melrose to take his mistress to church, when the horses took fright and ran away.”</p> <p>In 1857 a coachman met the McMurrans’ son John and his new bride Alie at the river landing when their steamboat came in late one night, and he safely delivered them to Melrose. A man named William followed in a wagon with their baggage.</p> <p>Typically, upon returning from an outing, Charles would stop at the front door of the mansion to let out his passengers onto the carriage block.

Near the kitchen “Georgie” could be easily watched by servants like Jane Johnson and Alice Sims. Sadly, Julia and her father both died in 1883. Stephen took his 6-year-old son to be reared in New York City. After 1883, no one lived in the Melrose mansion for two decades.

The vegetable garden was connected to the Kitchen building by a dirt path lined with cherry laurels. These native plants were used as hedges all around the estate. That path has now been expanded and paved to make it wheelchair accessible. The clever white wooden gate that swings both ways is probably a Kelly-era addition.</p> <p>This large garden provided a space for seasonal vegetables to feed people on the estate. The slaves may have also had their own garden plots down behind the cabins. The gardens would have held tomatoes, peppers, corn, squash, melons, beans, and peas in the summer. They were followed by root vegetables and greens in the cooler months. The gardens grew enough fruits and vegetables to feed two dozen people daily.</p> <p>The raised beds that are located by the parking lot today give visitors a chance to see examples of some crops that were grown out on plantations, such as cotton and sugar cane. More than 350 people were held in bondage on the McMurrans’ five cotton plantations. Their forced labor generated the great wealth that paid for the splendor of the Melrose estate.</p> <p>This concludes your tour of the Melrose grounds.

It was popular in America in the years before the Civil War. The tall ceilings, deep porches, and large windows and doors of this style worked well in the hot, humid Southern climate. The 16,000-square-foot house features some of the finest brickwork in the nation. The four Doric columns out front are made of brick but covered with stucco and painted to resemble stone. The porch wall behind them received the same treatment. Similarly, the large front cypress doors are painted to look like oak. Skilled laborers and trained carpenters – many of whom were probably enslaved - used locally milled cypress to construct the mansion. Giant cypress trees were logged out of the Louisiana swamps. They provided wood that was easy to cut but resistant to termites and rot.<br />  <br /> John McMurran moved to Natchez in the 1820s, not long after Mississippi became a state. In 1831, he married Mary Louisa Turner, who was the daughter of a local judge. In 1833, her parents gave them a 645-acre plantation and 24 enslaved people. McMurran grew up in Pennsylvania where slavery had been outlawed in 1780. He moved to the slave world of the Deep South. There, the practice of slavery allowed him to build great wealth.</p>",

One visitor described Melrose as being “English all over.” From inside the big house, the family and visitors looked out onto an orchard full of blooming fruit trees and a formal garden with flowering shrubs and winding walking paths. Mary Louisa McMurran served as mistress of the Melrose household. This role made her responsible for the house and grounds. She made certain that her enslaved servants tended them well. She wrote many letters to family members that give us details about the estate. They tell of the plants growing in her greenhouse, and they describe the different seasons at Melrose.

It came from Cherokee, a house they owned in downtown Natchez.  </p> <p>The wooded area on the far side of the orchard holds a cemetery. The McMurrans buried their enslaved servants there. They planted evergreen trees like cedar around the area. In 1844 a young woman named Laura became the first burial. She had “quite a large funeral.” Marice died of dysentery in 1861. Wesley died in 1853. The carriage driver Charles died in 1855. Today, there is no above-ground evidence of the cemetery remaining. However, a letter written in 1887 mentioned a brick wall surrounding the Melrose graveyard.</p>",

The first-floor functions included a laundry and a dairy.</p> <p>Laundry days at Melrose were difficult for the slaves and filled with hard tasks. These were backbreaking jobs that involved dangerous materials. People had to heat water in iron pots in the large fireplace. Then they poured the hot water into large washtubs where they scrubbed clothes, bedsheets, and table linens for the estate. They used caustic lye soap for cleaning and acidic lemon juice for deep stains. They had to rinse each item and wring it out. Afterward, they hung it on a clothesline to dry. Then they repeated the entire process for the next batch. They heated small irons in the fireplace for ironing all the cotton and linen items.</p> <p>Melrose had a small herd of dairy cows to provide fresh milk and butter for the estate. It was stored and processed in this building. The dairy room contains a series of built-in cement fixtures along one side. The lower part was closed behind wooden doors. It served as an early refrigerator holding blocks of ice to keep food cold. Water filled open troughs of the upper part where enslaved servants placed dairy products to cool that would be processed into butter and cheese. The water also served to keep ants out of the food.</p> <p>The upstairs rooms housed enslaved household servants. They had to respond to the ringing of the series of bells across the back porch of the big house. William and Eliza Jones served as a valet and a maid to the McMurrans. They likely lived in one of these upstairs spaces. William traveled with the McMurrans to northern resorts such as Niagara Falls in the summers. He also went with them to Europe when they made their Grand Tour with their children in 1854. Estate slaves were not like plantation slaves whose lives were ordered by the cycle of planting and picking cotton. Slaves who worked in the McMurran household lived their lives according to the routines and whims of the masters.  </p> <p>Alice Sims came with the Davises to Melrose in 1866, along with her family. She had previously been enslaved by the Davis family at their Vaucluse Plantation in Louisiana. The Sims lived upstairs in the dairy building.</p>",

People built cisterns to collect rainwater for drinking, cooking, and washing. These waterproof tanks could be above or below ground. The Melrose cisterns are all underground. They are made of brick and lined with natural cement. Rainwater runs through downspouts from the gutters around the roof of each building. At the bottom of each downspout is a metal “boot” that swivels. These funnel the water either into a cistern or into a pipe that drains out onto the ground. A copper sieve filled with charcoal helped to filter the water. A series of underground pipes connects the cisterns behind the Melrose mansion so that as one filled with water it would flow to the next one.</p> <p>These cisterns are capped with hand pumps to allow access to the water within. The two main cisterns behind the mansion have elaborate lattice work “covers.”</p>",

Two rooms of this privy sit over an underground vault that caught the waste and had to be periodically cleaned out. Each room has a wooden bench with holes. Some parts are lower with smaller seats to accommodate children.</p> <p>When Melrose was built, indoor toilets were very rare. This mansion had a tank in the attic that held rainwater. It was a large cypress box lined with zinc to make it waterproof. When the house was built, in the 1840s, the attic cistern fed a system of running water whose fixtures included a tub, shower, and flush toilet. The McMurrans and their guests also used chamber pots when they were in the big house. The household slaves had to empty and clean them.</p>",

William Johnson, a free black barber in Natchez, used bricks from buildings destroyed in the infamous tornado of 1840 to construct the State Street estate and commercial business area. The family lived in the upper stories of the house, while the first floor was rented out to merchants. The William Johnson House allows visitors to learn more about the life of free African Americans in the pre-Civil-War South. Visitors to the home will also learn about the extensive diary kept by William Johnson from 1835-1851 which detailed everyday life in Natchez.",

Several Pensacola citizens, however, petitioned the government to imprison Geronimo, a medicine man and warrior, and 15 other Apache men at Fort Pickens instead, separating them from their families. Prisoners worked seven-hour days clearing overgrown weeds, planting grass, and stacking cannonballs. The families were reunited at Fort Pickens in 1887. One year later all of the imprisoned Apaches were moved to Mobile because of a yellow fever scare and later to Fort Sill in Oklahoma Territory.<br /> <br /> The US Army transported Geronimo and other Apaches by train to Florida from what is now New Mexico and Arizona.<br /> <br /> \"I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free and there was nothing to break the light of the sun.

This building was used at different times as a guardhouse with quarters for three sergeants, a mess and kitchen, and lastly as an administration building for the 13th Coast Artillery in 1945.<br /><br />The U.S. military used this end of Santa Rosa Island for over 100 years. Fort Pickens, the first of four forts built to protect Pensacola Bay, has an unusual history. Union forces still held the fort during the Civil War in the 1860s even though Florida was a Confederate state.

This shrub has green serrated leaves, grey bark, and red berries. American Indians used the caffeinated leaves and twigs to prepare tea for ceremonies. But be careful; eating the berries can make you sick. Other vegetation that can be seen from this spot are pines, live oaks, and magnolia trees.  ",

The CCC 1437th Company came to Ocean Springs with the goal of creating a state park on Stark and Davis bayous. This work would include building roads, bridges, parking areas, picnic areas, outdoor fireplaces, a boat harbor, a pier, as well as installing electric, water, and sewage systems.<br /> <br /> What you see on either side of you is what is left of the road that lead to the men’s quarters while staying in Ocean Springs.

Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island and Fort McRee on Perdido Key, guarded the channel.<br /> <br /> Americans built harbor forts during the Revolutionary War (first system) and another series of forts between 1789 and 1812 (second system). Advanced Redoubt and Forts Barrancas, Pickens, and McRee were part of the Third System of coastal fortifications built between 1816 and 1870.<br /> <br /> Fort Barrancas and its water battery, situated on a bluff, could support their crossfire and fire shots at ships that entered the bay.<br /> <br /> Advanced Redoubt was built to protect the Navy Yard and Fort Barrancas from a land-based attack. During the Civil War the Confederates briefly held Fort Barrancas and exchanged gunfire with Federal forces at Fort Pickens.<br /> <br /> <b>Spanish Water Battery</b><br /> The white, stuccoed, semicircular structure down in front of you is BaterÃ­a de San Antonio, a battery built by Spain in 1797. After recapturing the Pensacola area from the British, the Spanish decided to build this fortification as part of a plan to strengthen harbor defenses. The maximum range of smoothbore cannon at that time was about one mile. The United States modified and armed the battery while building Fort Barrancas in the 1840s.<br /> <br /> The term water battery comes from the fortification's location, which was close to water level. From this battery gunners could fire smoothbore cannon shots at ship masts or skip shots across the surface of the bay hoping to hit wooden hulls at the waterline.<br /> <br /> <b>Fort McRee</b><br /> In front of you across Pensacola Bay once stood Fort McRee. The US Army built the fort at the end of Perdido Key in the early 1840s to help protect Pensacola Bay and ended up almost destroying it during the Civil War. In January 1861-three months before the war started at Fort Sumter in South Carolina-the US Army abandoned Barrancas and Fort McRee and consolidated its troops at Fort Pickens. The governors of Alabama and Florida quickly dispatched state militias to occupy the vacant military posts. In a massive artillery exchange with the Confederates in November, cannon fire from two Union ships and Fort Pickens nearly demolished Fort McRee. Considered obsolete by the end of the Civil War, Fort McRee was never repaired.<br /> <br /> Simultaneous volleys raked [Fort McRee's] outer walls and parapets ... the whole structure seemed to bulge and sink to earth in one general conflagration.<br /> <br /> Years after the Civil War battle the ruins of Fort McRee crumbled into the sand and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>",

In a battle, the glacis shielded the fort’s brick walls from cannon fire. When attacked by land, soldiers had to charge uphill while in full view of the defenders inside Fort Barrancas.<br /> <br /> Enslaved laborers used sand to build the glacis. They likely used sand from the dry ditch they dug into the bluff. Using carts pulled by mules, enslaved laborers transported sand around the construction site.

Spanish engineers built this battery between 1797–1798 after declaring war on Great Britain. From its location at the shoreline, seven cannon could ricochet cannonballs across the surface of the bay to hit ships at the water line. To protect the battery’s rear, a small stockade named Castillo de San Carlos was built on the bluff rising above.<br /> <br /> After Spanish West Florida became a US territory in the 1820s, Army engineers demolished the Castillo and built Fort Barrancas in its place. They then modernized the Spanish Water Battery and named it Barrancas Water Battery. With 15 cannon, the battery continued its original purpose in protecting the entrance to Pensacola Bay.</p> <p> </p>",

This design feature allowed soldiers to continue using Fort Barrancas even if the scarp collapsed in a battle.<br /> <br /> The counterscarp, or outer wall, supports the glacis. Long galleries, or passageways, run along the inside of the counterscarp.<br /> <br /> The scarp and counterscarp are pierced with ventilators, loopholes, and embrasures <i>(em BRAY shures</i>). Ventilators allow air to circulate inside the fort. Soldiers fired muskets through narrow loopholes and cannon through wide embrasures. <p> </p>",

Soldiers charging into the dry ditch would suffer heavy losses from muskets and cannon firing from the loopholes and embrasures.<br /> <br /> Construction of Fort Barrancas began in June of 1840. No more than 60 enslaved people labored on the fort at any given time. They worked 10-hour days from spring to fall under the sweltering Florida sun. From fall to spring, they worked sunrise to sunset. They were allowed one hour for breakfast and dinner.<br /> <br /> They began construction by digging this ditch into the bluff. They moved more than 16,000 tons of sand, or the equivalent of about 1,300 school buses.</p>",

Look closely and you will see a smaller door in the bigger door. This wicket door allowed entry without opening the main doors.<br /> <br /> The bricks around you supported different industries in West Florida. Local sawmill and brickyard owners relied on enslaved people to operate. To fire kilns for baking bricks, enslaved lumbermen harvested firewood from the region’s rich forests. To produce bricks, brickyard owners trained enslaved men in various brickmaking skills and shipped bricks to construction sites on Pensacola Bay and along the Gulf Coast.</p>",

They preferred to rely on citizen-soldiers if war erupted, like their ancestors had in the American Revolution.<br /> <br /> Of the forts, one Army engineer wrote: “When once constructed they require but little expenditure for their support. In time of peace they withdraw no valuable citizens from the useful occupations of life. Of themselves they can never exert an influence dangerous to public liberty; but as the means of preserving peace, and as obstacles to an invader, their influence and power are immense.”<br /> <br /> To support this attitude and tradition, Army engineers did not design Fort Barrancas with living quarters for soldiers. Instead, professional soldiers serving in the small US Army lived nearby at Barrancas Barracks.<br /> <br /> Even in peacetime, Fort Barrancas stored dozens of cannon and large quantities of ammunition that needed guarding. Soldiers stationed at the Army post took turns standing guard over the fort. They rotated with two men on duty (two hours on, four hours off, for 24 hours) while four men rested in this guard room.</p>",

The gallery runs along the inside of Fort Barrancas and provided soldiers access to narrow loopholes. In a battle, soldiers would fire their muskets through these loopholes. Ventilators above the loopholes allowed gun powder smoke to escape.<br /> <br /> Look closely down the length of the gallery and you will see a wall made up of arches supporting sand fill. Army engineers used this innovative technique because a curved surface can support more weight than a flat surface.<br /> <br /> Like all buildings, Fort Barrancas required maintenance after its completion. In 1851, a slaveholder rented an enslaved man named Peter Dyson to Army engineers. Engineers forced Dyson to make masonry repairs to the fort. In 1861, the first year of the American Civil War, Peter and his wife Henrietta sailed to Fort Pickens and freedom on the Underground Railroad.</p>",

Here 34 pieces of seacoast artillery, the heaviest cannon used in the 1800s, pointed over the fort’s brick walls. Today a 24-pounder cannon points toward Pensacola Bay. This cannon was cast in 1837 by McClurg, Wade and Company at the Fort Pitt Foundry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br /> <br /> The entire area is about 150 feet across, with the 25 feet nearest the walls sloping upward to a flat space along the walls where cannon could be stationed. This outer wall is about four feet high. One cannon is in place near the north east corner mounted on a base with wheels that allow it to be pointed in different directions. Feel free to touch, but do not climb. <br /> <br /> A reconstructed brick floor can be seen in one corner of the parade. Enslaved bricklayers built a hot shot furnace on this spot in 1847. Soldiers used this furnace to turn solid cannonballs cherry red. These missiles were used to set targets like wooden ships on fire.</p>",

Davis recalled that the British used the Mississippi Sound near Ship Island in 1814 to attack New Orleans. Though the fort never received an official Army title, Major General Winfield S. Hancock, called the structure Fort Massachusetts in 1884.<br /> <br /> This report is the first time it has been known by that name in an official document. Later, the fort on Ship Island became known as Fort Massachusetts, after the Union ship which retook in the island in the fall of 1861.</p>",

In 1873, this cannon was raised over the fort's wall and mounted here.<br /> <br /> The Rodman gun is any of a series of American Civil War–era columbiads designed by Union artilleryman Thomas Jackson Rodman. The guns were designed to fire both shot and shell. These heavy guns were intended to be mounted in seacoast fortifications.

This made the Parrotts much more accurate and destructive than earlier smoothbore cannons that fired round shots. The Parrots were cast iron muzzle-loaders like the smoothbores and could penetrate masonry forts. In the 1890s and early 1900s steel, breech-loading rifles replaced the Parrotts, and concrete-and-earthwork batteries replaced masonry fortifications like Fort Massachusetts.</p> <p> </p>",

In 1821, the Third System of coastal forts was extended to include protecting Pensacola Bay and the communities that lined the mainland shore. Pensacola Bay had long been considered important by European powers that sought to colonize North America.<br /> <br /> By 1825, legislation was passed to establish a navy yard and depot on the bay. Fortifications were needed to protect the new territory, its resources, and assets.<br /> <br /> From Santa Rosa Island, the fort worked with Fort McRee on Perdido Key to guard the entrance to Pensacola Bay. Fort Barrancas and the Spanish Water Battery, staring down from a bluff facing the harbor’s entrance, added more protection. Fort Barrancas and Advanced Redoubt guarded the Pensacola Navy Yard from land attacks.<br /> <br /> What many people don't know is that Fort Pickens was built on a bed of violence and cruelty. The Army forced enslaved Black men to build and later repair the fort. This didn't stop Fort Pickens from becoming a destination on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War and after. Freedom-seeking African Americans traveled to the fort to emancipate themselves.<br /> <br /> Following the Civil War and after the Apache Wars ended in the 1880’s, the Army concentrated Chiricahua Apache at Fort Pickens. Prisoners of war like Geronimo, a leader and medicine man, labored at the fort for one and a half years. The Chiricahua Apache remained prisoners of war for another 27 years.<br /> <br /> However, new technologies made Fort Pickens outdated. The Army continued using the fort until the end of World War II. In the 1890s, the fort supported an underwater minefield. Soldiers kept supplies for Battery Pensacola inside the fort's brick rooms. In the early 1900's, the Army set up a power plant in the fort to create electricity for the base.<br /> <br /> Fort Pickens joined the National Park Service's Gulf Islands National Seashore in 1971. Today the fort stands as a monument to military technology and as a memorial to past injustices.</p>",

A sally port served as the main path into and out of a fort like Fort Pickens.To enter Fort Pickens in the early 1800s, soldiers marched across a wooden bridge.<br /> <br /> The bridge stretched 180 feet over a dry ditch. When they reached the sally port, soldiers found several sets of heavy wooden doors. Now missing, these wooden doors allowed soldiers to control access to the fort.<br /> <br /> The Army changed the sally port in the late 1800s. In 1896, work crews began laying railroad tracks on Santa Rosa Island. Workers used the railroad to move building materials. Soldiers used the railroad to move weapons, ammunition, and supplies around the post.<br /> <br /> To help build Battery Pensacola, the Army ran railroad tracks from a dock on Pensacola Bay. The tracks passed through the sally port and ran to the middle of Fort Pickens. Deep, narrow grooves cut into the granite are one trace of the old railroad.<br /> <br /> Turn left to begin your self guided tour. <p> </p>",

They then installed a heavy framework of wooden beams called grillage. Using lumber from local Pensacola mills, the laborers installed grillage to create a foundation.<br /> <br /> Engineers used arches to support the weight of the fort on this grillage foundation.

Completed in 1899, Battery Pensacola once played a major role in this system. Four amazing technologies made Battery Pensacola revolutionary.<br /> <br /> A newer construction material, reinforced concrete made the structure stronger than Fort Pickens. The concrete was painted black to reduce glare from the intense Florida sun. Newly invented electrical distribution provided the electricity to make loading and firing the battery’s guns easier.<br /> <br /> The newly invented telephone allowed soldiers to communicate information more quickly and over greater distances. Steel guns capable of withstanding the extreme forces allowed soldiers to hit targets with deadly precision.<br /> <br /> Like Fort Pickens, Battery Pensacola became obsolete. The Army stopped using the battery in 1933 and removed its guns in 1934.<i>Visit Battery Cooper and its 6-inch disappearing gun to see an example of an armed battery on Pensacola Bay.</i> <p> </p>",

The explosion destroyed Bastion D and created this large gap.<br /> <br /> In the early morning hours of June 20, 1899, soldiers discovered a fire near the sally port. Here, casemates housed large wooden blocks for moving guns and artillery supplies. The officer in charge, Second Lieutenant Robert H. C. Kelton, 1st US Artillery, led his 60 men in fighting the fire. As the fire spread toward Bastion D, it moved closer to a powder magazine holding 8,000 pounds of explosives. Unable to control the fire, Kelton withdrew his men before the magazine exploded.<br /> <br /> The explosion wounded Private Henry Hopgood and killed another, Private Earle F. Welles. Today Private Welles rests across the bay at Barrancas National Cemetery.<br /> <br /> The fire's cause remains unknown to this day. Eleven soldiers, including Kelton, were recognized for their “. . . heroic and energetic efforts . . .” <p> </p>",

An officer used a room like this for sleeping, an office, and sometimes as headquarters. Fort Pickens once had six officers’ quarters in the north wall and seven in the south wall. Most officers’ quarters no longer exist. In 1861, the first year of the Civil War, some of these rooms served as a hospital for Union troops.<br /> <br /> At this hospital surgeons and their assistants cared for the sick, wounded, and dying. Those who died in defense of the United States were laid to rest in a temporary cemetery outside the fort.<br /> <br /> Later, around 1888, soldiers used rooms like these to house Chiricahua Apache prisoners of war, including Geronimo and his family. <p> </p>",

Casemates protected soldiers and cannon. They also supported the upper level, or barbette, of Fort Pickens. Each casemate in the fort had one or two windows, or embrasures. Soldiers fired cannon through these embrasures.<br /> <br /> This cannon is a 32-pounder. It sits on top of an oak carriage. The carriage is connected to the brick wall. Look under the embrasure and you will discover an opening. A metal plate, called a tongue, connects the carriage to a metal pin in the wall.<br /> <br /> This system locked the cannon to the wall and helped soldiers point their weapon. Look down at the floor and you will find granite blocks, or traverse stones. With iron rails bolted on top, travers stones made rolling cannon from side to side easier. Today you can still see the remains of traverse stones and rails around the fort. Cannon like this 32-pounder made a lot of smoke.<br /> <br /> Vents above embrasures allowed the smoke to escape. When a cannon fired, fresh air entered a casemate through a chimney or a diamond-shaped opening in the ceiling.<br /> <br /> <i>Help protect Fort Pickens.

Completed in 1894, this room became one of several onshore buildings used by soldiers to operate an underwater minefield. Long ago, the Army considered underwater mines one of the main weapons needed to defend a harbor.<br /> <br /> When engineers began updating Pensacola Bay’s defenses in the late 1800s, they made sure to include mines in their plans. A mine casemate was the heart of a controlled mine system.<br /> <br /> This area held batteries that powered the mines. It also housed the controls for setting off the mines. From the mine casemate, electrical cables ran underground, entered the bay, and extended to the minefield.<br /> <br /> When an officer gave the command, a soldier at the operating panel flipped a switch and detonated a mine. Because of high humidity, engineers built a new mine casemate outside the fort in 1907. This brick building still stands today. The Army eliminated Pensacola Bay’s mine defense system in 1926. <p> </p>",

Both have three narrow chambers that extend into the wall.<br /> <br /> During a battle, soldiers in the fort could move kegs of gun powder from a powder magazine to a chamber. Each chamber could hold 1,027 pounds of gun powder.<br /> <br /> When an attacker charged the fort, the defenders would ignite the gun powder and explode a chamber.

The magazines were lined with wood to help keep gun powder dry. Anyone who entered a magazine had to remove their shoes or put socks over them to prevent sparks.<br /> <br /> This is because the soles of shoes were sometimes attached with nails. Fort Pickens’ three magazines could hold more than 272,000 pounds of powder. This large quantity allowed soldiers to defend the fort during a long siege.  <br />   <p> </p>",

They decided to install a central power station at Fort Pickens. You are standing in the power station. It provided outdoor and indoor lighting for the military post. The three casemates in front of you were originally meant for cannon.<br /> <br /> In 1903, engineers turned these rooms into a central power station. Here they installed one 50-kilowatt Skinner-Willey generator. It also had one 8- and one 10-kilowatt General Electric generators. The station housed three engines, a switchboard, and three storage batteries. To power the generators, engineers built a boiler house outside the power station.<br /> <br /> This building housed a 103-horsepower Babcock and Wilcox boiler, a feed pump, and heater. Coal was stored in a casemate near the sally port. By the 1920s, the Army no longer needed the central power station. The equipment was sold, and the boiler house demolished.<br /> <br /> <i>Help protect Fort Pickens. Please stay off the walls and do not pick up loose bricks.</i> <p> </p>",

Wrapping around Fort Pickens, a dry ditch separated these towering walls.<br /> <br /> Attackers who reached the dry ditch would be caught in a deadly crossfire. By the summer of 1915, Army engineers filled the dry ditch to better protect the area from hurricanes.

It was orginally constructed in 1885 to serve as the Santa Rosa Island Life-Saving Station. It was one of the two first life-saving stations in all of the state of Florida, and was home to the U.S. Life-Saving Service.<br /> <br /> The original structure was a two-story building topped with an enclosed lookout tower that had windows on each side. The keeper, his family, and the crew lived on the second story. In 1907, the current building replaced the destroyed structure.<br /> <br /> ith the establishment of the U.S. Coast Guard in 1915, the Santa Rosa Life-Saving Station became Coast Guard Station 212.<br /> <br /> In 1986, the U.S. Coast Guard relocated to Naval Air Station Pensacola. The old life-saving station became a part of Gulf Islands National Seashore. Today the building serves as a ranger station and campground registration in the Fort Pickens Area.</p>",

He created thousands of paintings and sketches inspired by the Mississippi island wilderness.<br />  <br /> Today is it protect as designated Wilderness area. In 1978 Congress designated Horn Island - among the few undeveloped barrier islands on the Gulf Coast - as a Wilderness area. Uncommon species of birds, animals, and marine life are protected here. These areas also preserve the land's natural conditions and provide opportunities for solitude and primitive recreation, benefiting generations to come.<br /> <br /> Before visiting Horn Island, ask a ranger about wilderness area regulations and the difficulties of visiting places without water, shelter, facilities, or communication.</p>",

Though 8 to 10 miles away, Horn Island and five other islands-Petit Bois, West Petit Bois, Ship, and Cat- help shield the sound and the mainland from the full brunt of hurricane winds and waves stoked by the gulf's warm waters. These islands slowly migrate westward as they are reshaped by currents running along the shorelines. They are part of an irregular 2,000-mile chain of barrier islands along the U.S. coast from New York to Texas.<br /><br />Vegetation plays a critical role in shaping the landforms and providing some stability. On the islands, grasses trap sands that form dunes, where shrubs and trees take root. Seagrass beds and salt marshes help curb erosion.<br /><br /> <b>Murky Birthplace</b> <br />Don't let the stillness of the salt marsh fool you. The dark murky waters are swimming and crawling with life. Protected from predators of the open sea, the marsh serves as a productive breeding ground, maternity ward, and nursery for shrimp, crabs, shellfish, and finfish. Juvenile clams, oysters, and mussels filter nutrients from the tides. Young fiddler crabs and blue crabs feed on decaying plants and tiny organisms in the mud.

West Petit Bois Island is a barrier island located off the coast of Mississippi, Southeast of Davis Bayou. The island is designated a wilderness area which provides protection for plants and animals to thrive undisturbed.<br /> <br /> Petit Bois Island is shrinking. In order to preserve it, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers dredged sand from the island's shipping channel to create a new island, called West Petit Bois Island. As West Petit Bois Island continues to grow, plant and animal life are finding its way to the island. The impermanence and ever-changing environments of barrier islands are what make them so unique.   <br /> <br />  </p>",

Squirrels, otters, armadillos, and mice usually search for food during daylight. Raccoons, skunks, foxes, and opossums commonly rest during the day and forage at night.

Visitors may park at the visitor center and begin the trail to the west. The dirt path is fairly smooth with a sandy base, but can be slippery when wet. Use caution and respect wildlife on the trail. <br /> <br /> Succession in natural communities is the process by which new species of plants and animals become established as conditions change. As trees grow tall in coastal woodlands, they shade out sun-loving plants on the forest floor. Sometimes change occurs rapidly. Winds generated by tropical storms knock down mature trees and strip the leaves from others. This permits sunlight to reach the forest floor again and allows the return of wildflowers, grasses, and mosses.<br /> <br /> <strong>Duration:</strong> 15-30 minutes<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Note: This trail is inside Naval Air Station Pensacola, which is currently closed to the public.

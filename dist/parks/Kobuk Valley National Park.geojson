It is also extremely important to note that the root is toxic if ingested at any point. Only the stalks and leaves should be eaten. <br /> <br /> Medicinally, Angelica has been used for hundreds of years, and around the world, not just in the Northwest Arctic. The root can be used outside the body to help for aches, pains, sores, cuts, and more. The best way to use the root is by cutting, mashing, and boiling it to create a poltice and then placing it directly on treatment area, even for deep pains.<br /> <br /> Chewing on the leaves is said to cure a head cold and the many symptoms associated with it. <br /> <br /> Native Siberians inhaled fumes of the roasted Angelica root for a seasickness remedy.<br /> <br /> This plant should not be confused with the Poison Water Hemlock (Cicuta mackenzieana) which also grows in the region. There are many ways to tell these two plants apart. Wild celery smells strongly like celery. Its flowers are in a stiff, flat cluster with wide, flat leaves. Poision water hemlock on the other hand has loose flowers and thin leaves. It also has an obvious waxy look when compared to wild celery.<br /> <br /> Sources: <ul> <li>Jones, Anore. <i>Plants That We Eat: Nauriat Nigiñaqtuat</i>.

A favorite plant of many animals, including moose, the feltleaf willow can be found in boreal forests or along side water in the tundra. <br /> <br /> The willow family has many successful members in the greater tundra area. The most easily recognizable of them, however, is the feltleaf. Feltleaf willow come in all shapes and sizes and can be anywhere from one to 20 feet tall. Although smooth to start, the stems and the leaves gain a nice fuzzy appearance as they mature.<br /> <br /> The young, tender shoots can be eaten once the bark is removed. Many compare the taste to cucumbers at this stage. As the shoots age, their flavor becomes woodier, making them less sought after. <br /> <br /> Like most willows, the Feltleaf has long been used for medicinal purposes. The bark of the willows contain salicin, an active ingredient that is compared to aspirin. It has been known to help with mouth sores, headaches, colds, fevers, and bee stings. Some will draw medicinal benefits from this plant by simply stripping the bark off and placing it directly in their mouth to be chewed. Others brew the bark into a tea. It is believed that animals will seek out willows to help ease their pains as well.<br /> <br /> Sources: <ul> <li>Jones, Anore. <i>Plants That We Eat: Nauriat Nigiñaqtuat</i>.

It's no surprise as its beautiful, tall stalk filled with small pink-purple flowers demands attention.<br /> <br /> Many collect the flowers of this plant and turn it into a delicious jelly! The shoots can be eaten boiled or steamed to be eaten in a salad. Or you can enjoy them in seal oil along with meat or fish. <br /> <br /> Others use the flowers as indicators of how soon the seasons will change. The plant's typically take turns blooming, starting at the bottom and working its way up the stalk. It is said that when the Fireweed's topmost flowers bloom, Fall will be upon the area in two weeks.<br /> <br /> But did you know it also has medicinal qualities as well? A tea made from the leaves can be used for an upset stomach and to stimulate the bowels. A combination of boiled stems, leaves, and flowers has antispasmodic properties, which can help with asthma and coughs. Root poultices, made from cutting, boiling, and mashing the root, can also be used to help draw infection from wounds.<br /> <br /> Sources:</p> <ul> <li>Jones, Anore. <i>Plants That We Eat: Nauriat Nigiñaqtuat</i>.

A large tan patch in the middle of a sea of green trees and blue water ways. But how did they get there?<br /> <br /> While no glaciers currently exist within the park, two earlier glaciations, the Kobuk and Ambler glaciations, covered large areas of the Kobuk and Selawik valleys, as well as the drainages of the Baird Mountains.<br /> <br /> During the interglacial period between the Kobuk and Ambler glaciations, sediments (glacio-fluvial deposits) left behind on river bars and outwash plains were worn down by strong easterly winds. The down-valley movement of large volumes of silt and sand created dune fields, which cover an area of approximately 200,000 acres. Most of this dune area is currently vegetated by tundra and forest, except for the three active dune fields - the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes, the Little Kobuk Sand Dunes and the Hunt River Dunes. These active dunes cover approximately 20,500 acres.<br /> <br /> The Great Kobuk Sand Dunes’ field displays a complete sequence of dune development. They range from the eastern U-shaped, concave dunes with vegetation, to the western crescent-shaped, unvegetated barchan dunes, which stand over 100 feet in height. It is the largest active dune field in arctic North America.<br /> <br /> The Great Kobuk Sand Dunes are a popular destination for hiking and camping. Aircraft on wheels can land right on the sand. Tents can be set up on any level surface and day hiking in any direction is feasible. An alternative is to land on the Kobuk River in a float plane and backpack two miles across the tundra up to the dunes. Getting there is an orienteering exercise that takes about 4 hours round trip, not including time to enjoy the dunes themselves, even for the most experienced hikers.<br /> <br /> Depending on the time of year, visitors could have some amazing experiences with the natural world. From hiking on the dunes in the summer and experiencing 100 degree Fahrenheit weather above the Arctic Circle to observing the caribou migration in the fall, these sand dunes are truly a special place.",

They stand between Onion Portage within the park and the village of Ambler, located outside park boundaries. <br /> <br /> Many visitors marvel at these mountains, which can be seen from other popular areas within the park, including the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes and Onion Portage. The Jade Mountains are a small offshoot of the larger Baird Mountain range. The Jade Mountains stand surrounded by forests of coniferous trees and a smattering of colorful tundra plants. Rivers and creeks flow through its valleys, supplying fresh water to the plants surrounding it.<br /> <br /> The Jade Mountains have historically been an important source of minerals to the Iñupiaq people. Pre-contact, jade was one of the strongest materials available and was used in the making of a number of necessary items. This list includes anything from tools, such as weaponry and knives, to more adorning objects, such as beads. Jade is actually considered stronger than most metals, rating as high as a 7 on the Mohs Hardness Scale. <br /> <br />  ",

This list includes the Lowbush Cranberry, Kikmiññaq or Kikmiñat (Iñupiaq), or Vaccinium vitis-idaea (scientific).<br /> <br /> This plant is easily recognizable as it grows throughout the area. It grows low to the ground and boasts bright pink flowers in the spring and bright red berries in the late summer and fall. The berries are known for being tart when compared to other tundra berries. Although they can be eaten at almost any time, locals wait until after the first frost to pick lingonberry to allow for the flavor to fully develop.<br /> <br /> Lingonberries have been proven to contain more antioxidants than commercially grown cranberries, increasing their health benefit. Lingonberries have been used traditionally for medicine as well. Chewing the berries can help a sore throat, headache, or relieve an upset stomach<br /> <br /> While looking at the patch of Lingonberry, you may notice a few other plants growing along side of it. One of these such plants is tundra tea.<br /> <br /> Tundra tea (Ledum palustre) grows abundantly in our area. You may also hear this plant referred to as Eskimo tea, Labrador tea, or Tilaaqqiuq (Iñupiaq). The plant boasts a cluster of small white or pinkish flowers and narrow green leaves on a long brown stem. <br /> <br /> Medicinally, making a tea from the leaves is good for colds, inflammation, arthritis, and works as a laxative. Local wisdom either picking the leaves very young, or gatherings the leaves in the fall and winter after they have dried out as it changes the levels of certain chemicals in the leaves. <br /> <br /> However, this plant contains ledol, a toxin known to cause unwanted symptoms such as diarrhea and drowsiness if used in excess. This plant should only be used in moderation. It is not suggested for those with diabetes or heart conditions. </p> <p><br /> Sources:</p> <ul> <li>Jones, Anore. <i>Plants That We Eat: Nauriat Nigiñaqtuat</i>.

At the time, the Onion Portage site was the oldest found in the region. It teaches us how people have used and continue to use Onion Portage and the Kobuk Valley landscape as the climate, environment, and ways of life change over thousands of years. The Onion Portage Archeological District National Historic Landmark was designated on June 2, 1978.<br /> <br /> Today, the greater Onion Portage area is still heavily relied upon for subsistence hunting. When the Northwest Arctic caribou herd crosses the Kobuk River during its biannual migrations, locals continue the thousands of years of hunting tradtitions at Onion Portage.<br /> <br /> Caribou are much faster than humans on land, but when they are swimming, hunters stand a better chance. As this portion of the Kobuk River is deeper than other rivers in the area, it allows hunters to safely separate and take specific animals from a group numbering well into the hundreds of thousands. Traditionally, hunters would use paddled canoes and spears for this hunting; however, today, most hunters rely on motor boats and guns. This opportunity is necessary to ensure locals get enough meat to last the months to come.<br /> <br /> As this site is in a National Park, Onion Portage hunting is restricted to only federally qualified subsistence hunters. The Onion Portage Archeological District National Historic Landmark ensures the protection of 8,000 years of human use. The use of the area today by descendents of previous users ensures the continuation of the traditional area for future generations.</p> <p><br /> Additional Information</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kova/blogs/peeling-back-the-layers-at-onion-portage.htm\">Peeling back the layers at Onion Portage, Kobuk Valley National Park</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kova/learn/historyculture/paatitaaq-onion-portage.htm\">Onion Portage - Learn about history & culture at Kobuk Valley National Park</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p>",

This striking plant can be found on the tundra, especially in the marshy areas.<br /> <br /> Sourdock's most recognizable feature is its tall, thin stalk that is often bright red in color. The stalk is a short-lived feature. A more standard part of the plant to see during tundra exploring is its large, flat leaves that can be tipped in bright red.<br /> <br /> The leaves are the most commonly eaten portion of the plant. Typically people will freeze or cook them before consuming. This reduces the amount of oxalic acid in the leaves, which can be harmful if eaten in large amounts. Small amounts of raw leaves are not considered harmful, but always exercise caution when consuming.  <br /> <br /> Sourdock has the ability to be used as a laxative. Only small amounts of the plant are needed to help cure stomach and bladder troubles.

In Iñupiaq, it is known as Sargiq or Sargiġruaq. Although the common name makes it sound like this plant is disliked, Stinkweed is known as the miracle plant of the area and can be used for any number of fixes. <br /> <br /> True to its name, this plant carries a very distinct smell. It is difficult to describe, but even more difficult to forget. Once you are in front of the plant, reach out and gently rub one of the leaves. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the other plants on our garden tour, Sargiq is not encouraged as a food source. Small amounts can be ingested in tea form or as spices. However, certain species of Artemisia can contain absinthol and, when overindulged upon, can cause serious side effects such as tremors. <br /> <br /> Stinkweed can be utilized in a variety of forms, including tea, poltice, salve, oil, simply dried or even as a soak. <br /> <br /> Tea can be drank to help with cold symptoms and indegestion. <br /> <br /> A poltice of leaves, salve, or the oil can be placed directly on sores or cuts to help draw out infections, reduce scar tissue, and speed the healing process. Salves can also be used as a moisturizer for cracked hands through the winter. <br /> <br /> Dried leaves can be placed inside pillows and set under aching joints. This is said to help with arthritis. Or they can be placed in shoes to help dry the items while reducing microbes that may be causing unpleasant smells found there. This is also a treatment for athlete's foot. Some even use sargiq in their babies diapers to this day.  <br /> <br /> It is also called wormwood as it has been used historically to clear intestinal worms from livestock. Humans with issues of round worms or pinworms may benefit from drinking the tea regularly. There has been some research to suggest wormwood can be helpful to those suffering from malaria. <br /> <br /> What a miracle plant! It is no wonder that sargiq is the most frequently turned to of the local medicinal plants!<br /> <br /> Sources:  <ul> <li>Jones, Anore. <i>Plants That We Eat: Nauriat Nigiñaqtuat</i>.

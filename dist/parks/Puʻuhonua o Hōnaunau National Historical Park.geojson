Please make sure to visit respectfully.</em><br /> <br /> <em>Ano ai ke aloha</em>. Welcome. Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park was established in 1961 as a monument to the first Polynesian voyagers to cross Oceanic distances and make their home in this remote island world. Today our mission is to preserve unimpaired the cultural and historical heritage unique to this Hōnaunau region here on the island of Hawai’i. Throughout the region, many archeological sites paint a picture of life throughout 15<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th </sup>and 17<sup>th</sup> century Hawaiʻi.<br /> <br /> Realize that with your first steps onto the sands of the Royal Grounds, you are setting foot on what is revered by native Hawaiian’s as <em>wahi kapu</em>, a sacred place. These Royal Grounds encompass an area known as <em>Kauwalomālie</em>, a place traditionally reserved for the <em>aliʻi</em> or ruling chiefs and their guardians, stewards, and advisors. For the <em>Makaʻāinana</em>, who were the common folk, cultivators, and laborers, setting foot upon Royal Grounds was strictly forbidden. Indeed, casting so much as a shadow upon a wahi kapu such as Kauwalomālie was prohibited due to the law of the <em>ʻaikapu</em> – or kapu system. This system organized society and maintained a complex fabric of laws and responsibilities. Kapu were absolute, and so the penalty for breaking a kapu was severe and most often resulted in death for the offender.<br /> <br /> Today we are fortunate that these Royal Grounds can be made open for all to experience, while remembering the history and traditions that make this place a wahi kapu.</p>",

In one legendary tradition, the stone is said to have been brought to the island of Hawaiʻi from Kaua‘i and carried to this spot on the back of a giant chief. While other sources speculate that the stone may be a relic of the <em>Pōhaku Kālai o ‘Umi</em>, cut-stones said to have been made on the orders of ruling chief ʻUmi ā Liloa in the early 1500’s in an effort to build a <em>hale poki</em> out of shaped stone.<br /> <br /> Imagine the stories a stone could tell if we could speak its language. Legends have an ability to stir the imagination and are an important part of cultural identity.

To this day, women of this quality are referred to demonstratively amongst native Hawaiian communities as <em>Mana Wahine</em>. Ka‘ahumanu was in fact a crucial player in the unification of the Hawaiian islands, in many ways the power behind the man who would come to be known as King Kamehameha the Great.<br /> <br /> For the aliʻi of old, unions between men and women of status were not simply matters of love, with each paring often being arranged for political advantage.  Around the year 1794, when Kamehameha was still securing authority over the islands, a dispute between the two occurred when Kaʻiana – a prominent general in Kamehameha’s court – began displaying affection toward the young Ka‘ahumanu. It was not so much the idea of an affair that drove the passionate dispute, but rather the political consequences should Ka‘iana provide Ka‘ahumanu with a royal son, as a child of such a high rank could challenge the authority of Kamehameha himself.<br /> <br /> In one telling of the story, Ka‘ahumanu, after abandoning her position at Kamehameha’s court, came to seek refuge here and reportedly hid behind this large stone for a time. Ka’iana, who once held a welcome position as a general and warrior-chief, would eventually defect, joining the O’ahu chiefs in defense against Kamehameha’s forces, only to fall in the fateful battle at Nu’uanu in 1795. And as history will tell, Ka‘ahumanu and Kamehameha did indeed reconcile, and their pairing would alas serve to unify the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in the year 1810.</p>",

Archeological work revealed that this site may have been built in the characteristic style called <em>luakini</em>, which feature enclosed walls and an inner plaza, unlike the flat rectangular shape of the <em>māpele</em> style. Due to its close proximity to the shoreline, the ocean’s recurring barrage has greatly reduced this heiau into a ruined state.<br /> <br /> Remembered by the name ʻĀleʻaleʻa-nui, a tradition related in the 1920’s by a woman of Hōnaunau recalls that an area within this “old heiau” may have at one time been used to detain <em>kauwā</em>, a term referring to kapu breakers and prisoners of war.<br /> <br /> Temple sites such as these are numerous across the islands, yet are often left unmarked and with minimal interpretation available. Please be mindful of the memories contained within these places, even those seemingly reduced to ruins.

Lokoi’a function as enclosed, nutrient rich habitats for the farming of live fish such as <em>ʻamaʻama</em> and <em>ʻawa</em>. But remember, as is the case for all things kept within the Royal Grounds, the fish from these ponds were strictly reserved for the <em>aliʻi</em>.<br /> <br /> Unfortunatly, many of the fish populating Heleʻipalala today are invasive Tilapia—you may have noticed their circular nest structures. These fish were purposefully introduced decades ago for mosquito population control but are now considered an invasive species. Tilapia have a voracious appetite and easily out compete other species for food. These fish also create thick layers of sediment waste which is damagaing to partially enclosed ecosystems such as lokoiʻa. Their restoration is a priority for park scientists.<br /> <br /> Our partners at Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park outside of Kailua Kona maintain even larger, more impressive lokoiʻa along their shoreline.

Practitioners kept the secrets of their craft closely guarded with strict protocols, not unlike the guilds or trade unions formed in many Western countries. Knowledge in crafts such as canoe making, dry-set masonry, weaving, and hula to name but a few, have been handed down from instructor to apprentice over countless generations.<br /> <br /> While advancements brought in by the industrial revolution of the last century have brought changes both fruitful and detrimental to this island world, we are thankful for the <em>kupuna</em> or respected elders who have dedicated their life’s work to the preservation of traditional knowledge and skill. With that in mind, these hālau continue to be places of learning and instruction, where today you may meet craftsmen preparing materials or working on their craft under the protective shelter of a <em>pili</em> grass roof.<br /> <br /> Cultural demonstrators are an excellent source of knowledge and perspective, often learning and perfecting their craft over the entire course of their lives.

The intense heat and fire from the lava consumed the trees, leaving only hollow, circular impressions. If you look closely, you may notice the fine details of the surface of the tree within the mold.<br /> <br /> Tree molds provide a unique snapshot in time, showing us what the landscape may have looked like in the past.

Today this <em>wahi kapu</em> remains an active place of worship.<br /> <br /> Unique to the island of Hawaiʻi, Hale o Keawe is one of two known examples of a <em>hale poki</em> or royal mausoleum. Hale o Keawe’s namesake chief reigned throughout the late 1600’s and early 1700’s and came to be celebrated for his prosperous and peaceful rule over the island of Hawai‘i. He is also a celebrated ancestor to many famous aliʻi including our first king, Kamehameha the Great. Today descendants of Keawe are known across the island chain, many of whom engage in leadership roles within their own communities. The legacy of Keawe’s dynasty was represented at Hale o Keawe by 23 prominent aliʻi who were laid to rest inside the mausoleum alongside its namesake. Today, the <em>aliʻi i hala</em> (or the royal dead) from within Hale o Keawe retire in their eternal slumber at Mauna ʻAla in the Nuʻuanu valley on the island of Oahu.<br /> <br /> At one time suffering from deterioration, Hale o Keawe was restored and reconstructed in the 1960’s and continues to be maintained by the National Park Service and its native caretakers.<br /> <br /> As your eyes fall upon the carved temple-images called <em>kiʻi,</em> remember that you are being offered an exclusive glimpse into a world once strictly reserved for those of the highest rank and that Hale o Keawe is still a wahi kapu where communities come to practice <em>Ka Hoʻomana Kahiko</em> or the cultivation of spirit. The kiʻi placed around the temple and throughout the grounds at Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau have been carved by the skilled hands of native craftsmen, and today a new generation of sculptors have taken up the <em>ko‘i pāhoa</em>, the carving-adze in an effort to retain this storied tradition.<br /> <br /> You may notice <em>hoʻokupu </em>(offerings) left at the site, please refrain from entering past the gate or disturbing any offerings placed here.</p>",

Therefore, we say a Puʻuhonua is a place of refuge, offering healing, peace, and enlightenment.<br /> <br /> Do you recall the system of law used in ancient Hawaiian civilization? The <em>ʻAikapu</em> – or kapu system – informed many aspects of society; most directly religion, government, and social conduct. Kapu, which shares linguistic roots with the word ‘taboo’, were considered absolute due to the manner in which these laws regard resources, or even systems of resources, necessary for collective health and abundance. For this reason, many kapu in old Hawaiʻi centered around the use and preservation of water, the maintenance of fisheries, and the authority of the aliʻi; who in turn carried the responsibility of maintaining and distributing these resources, as well as upholding all religious rites, rituals, and observations.<br /> <br /> Because these kapu were considered sacred and upheld with the highest severity, the breaking of a kapu often resulted in death for the offender. If an individual condemned for violating a kapu could get within the bounds of a puʻuhonua, they would be spared this death sentence. After engaging in the holistic process of re-establishing themselves by the guidance of a <em>kahuna pule</em> (a priest) skilled in the healing arts, they could return to a community once more. During times of war, a pu’uhonua served as a safe haven for defeated warriors and those not able or eager to live by the spear.<br /> <br /> Research has identified numerous sites across the islands that may have been used as puʻuhonua at one time or another, however this site at Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park is the most well-preserved. In our modern era, advances in science and academia have merged with cultural tradition, and the idea of pu‘uhonua has now become conceptualized around the contemporary needs of our communities. This has resulted in new pu‘uhonua becoming established in the islands once more.<br /> <br /> Engaging in cultural traditions and forms of knowledge is an important way to build healthy communities. What are some customs that make your home special? What traditions do you hope to see your children remember?</p>",

It may seem like just a simple trail, but if you look closely it will tell the story of the progression from footpaths to roadways.<br /> <br /> Imagine what this island would look like with no roads…. How about with no trails! It would certainly be difficult to get around in this rugged lava landscape. When the Polynesian Voyagers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands, that was their reality. An untouched, rugged, lava wilderness. So, in ancient times, a network of trails was constructed to connect people, places, and resources.<br /> <br /> This section of trail is called the 1871 Trail, due to improvements made in… You guessed it, 1871. However, this small segment of trail is just one section of the larger Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail which is the 175-mile-long trail corridor that traverses from the northernmost tip of the island, along the western edge, around the southern tip and into Puna.<br /> <br /> This historic trail generally follows the ancient coastal <i>alaloa</i>, or long trail that formed primary route of travel around the island. The alaloa that the Ala Kahakai NHT follows is sometimes referred to as the <em>\"</em><i>alanui aupuni</i>,\" the Hawaiian Kingdom government road, that you can still see as the \"King's Trail\" in North Kona/South Kohala or the \"Māmalahoa Trail\" in North Kona which intersects our sister park, Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park. This ancient network of trail also included shorter more locally important trails like the <i>alahele</i> that ran laterally with the shoreline, and the <i>mauka-makai</i> trails, that ran from upland areas to coastal areas.<br /> <br /> Over the years, many of these anicent trails were straightened and widened to reflect changes in transportation while others were simply abandoned. Some of the trails that survived the tests of time were preserved, like the Ala Kahakai NHT, or even converted into roadways we know today. As you continue down the trail you see evidence of this evolution as you will pass historic and ancient structures, see impressive geologic features, and immerse yourself in the <i>kahakai</i> (coastal) environment.</p>",

That's a <em>hōlua </em>sledding track. <em>Heʻe hōlua</em>, \"sled surfing,\" or \"land sledding,\" was a popular sport in Hawaiʻi. A hōlua slide was made of dry-laid local stones taking advantage of the natural inclines or hills to create a long-sloped ramp that was then covered in fresh soil and reeds making a slick surface which was then lubricated with <em>kukui </em>(candlenut) oil.<br /> <br /> Individual riders rode down the slide on a <em>papa hōlua</em> (sled), often reaching speeds of up to 60 miles per hour (96.6 kph) The papa hōlua was carved from wood and was long and narrow in shape with two runners held apart by crosspieces. Two smaller rails sat on top of the crosspieces and acted as a platform. The whole sled was lashed together with coconut fiber. The sled could be as long as 14 feet (4.3 m) and weigh as much as 50 pounds (22.7 kg). See a replica of a papa hōlua in the bookstore at the visitor center.<br /> <br /> The papa hōlua's design allowed riders a choice of different riding techniques on their journey to the bottom of the slide, with two techniques being the most popular. Riders using the first technique would stand sideways on the papa hōlua, kick with one foot to launch themselves, and then put both feet on the sled and extend their arms for balance – much like a modern snowboard rider. Sliders using the second technique would jump onto the papa hōlua chest-down, face forward, and grip the narrow sled tightly for control. Both techniques allowed skilled sliders to steer the papa hōlua by shifting their body weight. Control of the papa hōlua was essential as a mistake or loss of control meant injury or possible death.<br /> <br /> He'e hōlua was a prestigious sport in the Hawaiian Islands. It was played mostly during <em>Makahiki</em>, the four-month winter New Year's celebration in honor of the <i>akua </i>(god) Lono, and only the Hawaiian <i>ali'i</i> (chiefs) were allowed to compete in the races.<br /> <br /> Would you be brave enough to test your skill on the papa hōlua?</p>",

Instead of using mortar or cement between stones, walls are held together by friction, requiring precise placement of stones. Walls such as these are used to divided property and are built as boundary markers. Enclosed stone walls seen here and along the trail were garden plots or animal pens. Networks of stone walls, called <i>kuaiwi, </i>could also serve as raised trails or causeways themselves.<br /> <br /> You may also notice that stones line the edges of the trail. These curbstones were part of improvements made to the 1871 trail when it was widened to easily accommodate two horses at one time. The curbstones delineated the trail making it easier for pack animals to follow it without constant guidance from their riders. Around the island, these types of “two horse trails” were constructed during an 80-year period lasting from 1841-1918. In 1918, the section north of Hōnaunau underwent a further evolution when it was modified to accommodate wheeled traffic. You might have even driven on it on your way to the park! However, this section south to Hoʻokena was never modified for motorized vehicles and remains a historic trail, frozen in time.</p>",

        "notes": "H - Alahaka Ramp\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/alahaka-ramp.htm\n\n<p>Another historic improvement to the 1871 trail was the construction of the Alahaka Ramp, the massive stone ramp that connects the trail to Kiʻilae Village. Historical accounts collected over the years indicate that access to Kiʻilae, prior to the construction of the ramp, was via a ladder or rope. So, it was pretty dangerous!<br /> <br /> There is no clear indication as to when the original ramp was built, but it most likely occurred sometime in the mid-1800s when a series of large-scale government programs were initiated to improve to public resources, such as roadways. However, the first version of the ramp would definitely not have held up to our modern-day safety standards. Local <em>paniolo</em> (Hawaiian cowboys) described the original ramp as the “one-foot-out trail,” as they would ride up and down the ramp with one foot out of the stirrup just in case they had to make a hasty escape due to the poor condition of the ramp.<br /> <br /> Due to this dangerous part of the commute to Kiʻilae village, improvements were made in 1868 to widen and stabilize the ramp. In a letter to the Hawaiian Kingdom Minister of the Interior dated Feb. 4, 1868 George Hardy, the road supervisor at the time, said: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"<i>In South Kona, I have repaired [a very] bad place known by the name of Alahaka in the village of Ki'ilae, a place of great danger where several horses had been kill'd: and where people were [sic] in danger of going up and down. I have made it wide and a substantial road</i>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately later that year, in 1868 there was a particularly destructive eruption event from Mauna Loa that caused multiple massive earthquakes (7-7.9) which in turn caused tsunamis and landslides across the island. During this event, the ramp may have been damaged and by the late 1890’s the Alahaka Ramp had fallen into a state of disrepair. In a letter dated December 31, 1897 road supervisor T. H. Wright wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"<i>Napo’opo’o to Ho’okena beach road in a fearful condition, it needs repair of the worst kind. The Walahaka [Alahaka] pali (cliff) is very dangerous. This road is used every day for the convenience of the public, going and back to these places</i>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Over the years, repairs were made, but in 1951, a large earthquake caused an upper section of the ramp to slough off and that continued to deteriorate. So, when the National Park Service came in, about twelve years later, the ramp was once again in a state of disrepair. This prompted a major stabilization project to restore and strengthen the Alahaka Ramp. Stabilization efforts consisted of removing the earthquake-damaged sections, clearing away boulders, and rebuilding the entire <em>makai</em> (ocean-facing) side.<br /> <br /> Given its proximity to the ocean and the cliffside, even today the Alahaka Ramp requires periodic maintenance and stabilization as a result of high surf, storm, and earthquakes. During the most recent effort, which occurred in 2010, NPS crews repaired a damaged portion of the outer face and stabilized the ramp buttress and trail trea This, of course, was no easy feat, as the work was located right along the steep ocean cliffside.<br /> <br /> As the years go on, and climate change causes increased storm intensity and sea level rise, these coastal trails will require a sustained joint effort to continue to preserve these pieces of history and the stories they contain. <i>What is something or someplace that means a lot to you that is threatened by climate change?</i> <i>What efforts do you hope are taken to preserve it?</i></p>",

It was a long voyage, and many died, the double canoes were tossed like leaves on the shaky sea. Paddlers died of thirst on a hot still day. The voyagers had pigs, dogs, chickens, and useful plants on board, but they used them sparingly, fearfully. What if they ate all their supplies and then sighted land? Aue! Better to die at sea then to find a barren land and have no life to bring to it. With the help of the gods and goddesses my ancestors reached these shores alive. They and the life they brought with them are my inheritance.<br /> <br /> <strong>Story #2: Pu Kani<br /> Button Location: Center of the wall</strong><br /> When the ruling chief traveled, men went before him sounding the kapu, the taboo. Everyone else got out of the road, ran and hid, or just fell with their faces to the ground when they heard the sound of the conch. The chiefs were descended from the gods; their power came form their mana, spiritual power the gods had given them. Lesser men couldn’t even look at the chief. The very ground he walked on was sacred; it had his mana, it was protected by the gods. A man of my family long ago stepped on a place where the chief had walked. The warriors killed him right away. By stepping on the mana, he had insulted the gods. Angry gods took their revenge with lava flows and tidal waves. The kapu breaker was sure to die. If the warriors killed him, others wouldn’t die because of him.<br /> <br /> <strong>Story #3: Refuge<br /> Button Location: Closest to the Royal Grounds</strong><br /> Our wise gods caused the ancient rulers to set aside pieces of ground as sanctuaries. They were few and far between, but if you broke the law and reached the place of refuge, no harm could come to you. The priest of the refuge purified you, and you returned home again all in a matter of hours, if you made it. In times of war, if you couldn’t fight, you went into the place of refuge; if you fought and lost, getting to the refuge would save you. Battles were short, so you would only be there a few days. The refuge was not pleasant, but it kept you alive. Ant then Captain Cook came, and others after him, and ours was no longer an island world. Changes came faster and faster. Kamehameha the first united the islands for the first time in our long history. Kamehameha the second saw his world changing and he destroyed the religion. With the religion went the kapu, the temples, and the refuges. The ancient problems are still with us: how to get along with each other and how to use the world wisely.</p>",

When the eruption ceased, all of the lava drained from this tube—some into the ocean—leaving a hollow tube.<br /> <br /> Lava tubes are found throughout the island and hold great cultural significance for the Native Hawaiian people. In ancient times, lava tubes were important for shelter from the elements and for refuge during times of war. In some lava tubes, water drips from the ceiling, filtered through porous lava rock and would serve as an important source of fresh water and collected in <em>ipu</em> (gourds). Lava tubes were also used as burial caves and many of these sacred burial caves are <em>kapu</em> (forbidden) and protected today.</p>",

        "notes": "Inner Court Kiʻi at Hale o Keawe\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/inner-court-kii.htm\n\n<p>The kiʻi images found within the inner court of Hale o Keawe are the focal point of the <em>heiau</em> (temple). These images are all forms of Lono that represent the various functions of the Puʻuhonua. In the semicircle of kiʻi the images represent the following forms of Lono (from left to right):</p> <h2>Lono-kīnaʽu</h2> <p>Lono-kīnaʽu is the farthest left image when facing the semicircle of the images in the inner court of Hale o Keawe. Lono-kīnaʽu is an <em>akua</em> (god) evoked for the identification of defects and associated closely with the practice of medicine, childbirth, and reproductive health.</p> <h2>Lono-makahialele</h2> <p>Lono-makahialele is often described as the “restless” or “flashing” eyes of Lono in ancient tradition. The “darting eyes of Lono” taught to cast a discerning eye upon potential challenges, and to navigate cautiously; as the famed navigator Pakaʽa did when taking to land at Kaluakoʽi Molokai – navigating the twisting reef-passages if Hikauhi and Kaumanamana. See Lono-makialele in the inner court of Hale o Keawe the second image from the far left when facing the semicircle of images.</p> <h2>Lono-i-ka-ʻoualiʻi</h2> <p>A major akua represented at heiau, Lono-i-ka-ʽoualiʽi is a form of Lono responsible for the sighting and understanding of omens. One important symbol of the aliʽi is the rainbow, represented as the shape of a crescent or arch, frequently appearing in traditional material culture. Lono-i-ka-ʽoualiʽi became a major akua in Hawaiʽi upon the arrival of Laʽamaikahiki, an aliʽi from Tahiti who introduced the worship of this particular aspect of Lono along with the stylized <em>pahu</em> (temple drum) and <em>kāʽekeʽeke</em> (bamboo drum). See Lono-i-ka-ʽoualiʽi in the inner court of Hale o Keawe. When facing the semicircle of images, Lono-i-ka-ʽoualiʽi is the third image from the left.</p> <h2>Lono-mōʻī or Haku ʻŌhiʻa</h2> <p>The central and most important image within the heiau is the mōʽī or “lord of images”, as described my 19th century Hawaiian scholar David Malo. Also termed Haku ʽŌhiʽa, this kiʻi is set in the center of the group of images facing the altar and is the most intricately carved. At Hale o Keawe, Lono mōʽī encompasses the many aspects of Lono in one visualization known as Lono-nui-ākea or “the great expanse” of Lono. The Lono-mōʽī along with the other images of the inner court served as a ceremonial focal point, crucial to the rituals conducted within the heiau.</p> <h2>Lono-iki-aweawealoha</h2> <p>A form of Lono that rises through the body and spirit, invoking the feelings of love and compassion crucial to the holistic practice of healing and restoration, <em>hoʽoponopono, </em>that took place at Puʽuhonua o Hōnaunau. See Lono-iki-aweawealoha in the inner court of Hale o Keawe; the third image from the right when looking directly at the semicircle of kiʽi.</p> <h2>Lono-ʻōpuakau</h2> <p>When facing the semicircle of kiʽi, Lono-ʽōpuakau appears as the second image from right-hand side. The billowing cloud forms of Lono, Lono-ʽōpuakau, is important to the occupations of agriculture and to the reading of omens. <em>O Kona kai ʽōpua I ka laʽi - ʽōpua hīnano I ka malie</em>, a famous saying goes, “Kona with its cloud-billows and calm sea – like a white <em>hīano</em> (Pandanus) blossoms resting in the quiet. This saying speaks to the calm nature of the people of Kona, Hawaiʽi, who look to the clouds for signs of rain and abundance.</p> <h2>Lono-i-ke-ʻeke</h2> <p>Lono-i-ke-ʽeke is a form of Lono important to the keeping of provisions and bountiful harvest. When facing the semicircle of images, Lono-i-ke-ʽeke is the image on the right-hand side.</p>",

And for the John Ahu house site that you see before you on the <em>makai</em> (ocean) side of the trail, the location was in a very prime spot indeed! Not only for expansive ocean views that would cause the price of this house site to soar in modern times, but also easy access to the main route of travel and the ocean. Below the house site is one of the few suitable canoe landing spots along this stretch of coast. As you continue down the trail a little bit, look back up at the house site and notice the gradual slope down to the water. That’s the spot! In addition to being able to land a canoe, this cove was also the only place with deep enough sheltered waters for larger boats to unload goods to exchange with villagers.<br /> <br /> When finding a place for one’s house, it’s important to make sure that you are close to all amenities, especially water. While there is certainly ample saltwater available at this location, fresh water is often hard to come by. In this part of the island, there are no streams or rivers to provide freshwater and instead, freshwater sources are either collected rainwater or the brackish water of anchialine pools.<br /> <br /> In Kiʻilae village most of the houses had thatched roofs and only the most well-to-do houses, like the John Ahu house, had tin roofing. With tin roofing came the ability of water catchment, and thus the cistern that you can see in what remains of the house site. However, even with water catchment, rain on the South Kona coast is not guaranteed, and in many cases, the Ahu cistern had to be filled via mule train from the wetter areas up <em>mauka </em>(mountain).<br /> <br /> Even today, many residents of South Kona live on rainwater catchment systems, however when the catchment is low, water trucks and roads allow for much easier access to freshwater than the mule trains of the past.</p>",

With the arrival of Europeans in the Hawaiian Islands, many things changed. New plants and animals were introduced and settlements began moving away from the coastal villages to the more fertile uplands and larger harbor cities. What remains in Kiʻilae today are abandoned house sites, agricultural features, animal pens, and salt pans that can be seen from more recent times.<br /> <br /> It is not known exactly when Kiʻilae village was established, but it may have been inhabited as early as the 1600’s due to availability of water, fishing grounds and upland fields. Indigenous knowledge points to the early settlement at Kiʻilae as a place where <em>kahuna</em> (priests) trained. By the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Kiʻilae had a population of approximately 100 people consisting of about 10 extended families.<br /> <br /> Unlike the difficulty assigning a beginning date for Ki‘ilae Village, the end of its occupation is well documented. By 1913 only one family remained in coastal Ki‘ilae, and sometime the 1930’s the last full time resident moved away. Its depopulation was largely the result of a changing economy that focused increasingly around the mauka areas near the current Māmalahoa Highway. Green (1993:534) explains the changing economy and shifting population with the following:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>The improved belt road around the island, which provided access to trade centers, effectively isolated the shoreline settlements, causing much of their population to move inland nearer to the road and the kula garden areas.</i></p> </blockquote> <p>So, it seems that the change in community pattern along this coast was triggered not only from the evolution of transportation in the area, but also a change in the economy from a barter economy to a “work-for-money” economy.<br /> <br /> As you continue along the trail into the heart of Kiʻilae village, remember to stay on trail and practice Leave No Trace principles to help protect these sites.</p>",

They were fisherman.<br /> <br /> Like many Kiʻilae residents, fishing was essential for survival, but it was hard work. Most fishing gear was handmade, including the wooden canoes used to access the coastal waters. Fisherman, like the Kahikinas, would fish for <i>ʻōpelu</i> (mackerel scad) as well as <em>ahi</em> (tuna) if two people were available to haul the large fish aboard. Fisherman would often feed the fish, banging on the outside of their canoe beforehand to alert the fish. The fish would then gather, and a large catch could easily be achieved. These fish were a major source of income for members of the community. Fresh fish were sold by girls door-to-door before school and any fish leftover could be dried and sold to stores.<br /> <br /> John Kahikina, one of the last to leave Kiʻilae, was an expert octopus fisherman. To see below the surface of the water when he was fishing, he would chew kukui nuts and then spit them in the water. The oil from the kukui nuts would create a make-shift window to the depths, allowing him to drop his lure on top of the octopus and quickly pull it up.<br /> <br /> However, as times begain to change, the traditional way of living could no longer sustain the remaining Kahikinas and as Frances Jackson states in his report on Kiʻilae Village,</p> <blockquote> <p>“John Kahikina explained, there was “<em>Nothing to do, no work.</em>” The coastal waters still could be fished, the kula gardens were there, but the economy had changed; a money-making job was almost a necessity.”</p> </blockquote>",

Here, kiʻi act as focal points in ritual, creating a link between the material world and the world of spirit.</p> <h3>What is a Kiʻi?</h3> <p>As defined by Pukuʻi’s Hawaiian Dictionary, a kiʻi is an image, statue, or likeness that serves as a symbolic embodiment of the akua and aumakua, or multitude of Hawaiian gods, deities, and venerated ancestors. While kiʻi most commonly take the form of wooden carvings, they are also formed out of stone, carved into <em>pūnohunou</em> (sea urchin spines), or assembled as ornate feathered images, <em>akua hulu manu</em>.</p> <h3>Hawaiian Akua</h3> <p>While there are numerous akua in the Hawaiian Pantheon, five primary akua are represented at <em>heiau</em> (temples). Each akua has a number of physical manifestations called <em>kinolau</em>.</p> <h4>Kāne</h4> <p>Kāne is associated with creation, the heavens, and the cosmos.<br /> <strong>Kinolau</strong> include sunlight, freshwater, lightning, bamboo, <em>ʻawa </em>(kava), and <em>pueo</em> (native owl)</p> <h4>Kanaloa</h4> <p>Kanaloa is associated with creation, the depths of the ocean, and the cosmic mysteries.<br /> <strong>Kinolau</strong> include salt, seaweeds, <em>maiʻa</em> (plantains), octopus, as well as whales and porpoises</p> <h4>Haumea</h4> <p>Haumea is associated with fertility and birth, and is represented at the Hale o Papa or Women’s Heiau. Haumea is worshiped across the islands as an ancestress to both chiefs and common folk.<br /> Her <strong>kinolau</strong>, the hau tree, is regarded highly as a material from which to make adze handles and canoe booms.</p> <h4>Kū</h4> <p>Kū is associated with aquisition and industry and is responsible for fishing, farming, building, and carving, as well as governance and warfare.<br /> <strong>Kinolau </strong>include mountain peaks and cliffs, coconut palms, ʻōhiʻa trees, dogs, red fish, and caterpillars.</p> <h4>Lono</h4> <p>Lono is associated with oxygen, the atmosphere and natural weather phenomenon, and is responsible for ensuring growth and abundance.<br /> <strong>Kinolau</strong> include rainbows, cloud formations, winds, <em>hue</em> (gourds), <em>ʻuala</em> (sweet potato), and pigs.</p> <h3>Kālai Kiʻi</h3> <p>The practice of <em>kālai kiʻi</em> or the carving of images is just one of many native Hawaiian traditions being revived among our island communities today. In this very hālau, cultural practioners engage in <i>kālai kiʻi </i>and continue to teach the practice to younger generations. The kiʻi that you see today at Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau are produced by descedents of the area who have preserved the tradition of carving over many generations. The last restoration effort here took place in 2004.</p>",

The plan was a collaborative effort amongst planner-designers Dave Ichelson and Ray Price and architect Pack Hunter. The three-man team worked jointly to insure compatibility between exhibit concepts and architectural concepts. The 'City of Refuge' NHP superintendent, Russell Apple,also worked closely with the team. This effort resulted in the mindful blending of the architectural design and interpretive graphics with the interpretive message given by a recorded voice. The stylized graphics were considered significant to the visitor center’s overall design and described as “idea images” as opposed to carefully rendered images. The designers’ believed that the bold and distinctive renderings were realistic and appropriate to convey the Cultural Landscapes Inventory Page 22 of 53. The interpretive wall was designed to supplement the live talks given by an NPS interpretive ranger. It was also designed to be informative and stimulate interest when a ranger led talk was not available. The open-air exhibit was a departure in concept and technique from previous NPS productions.There was a separate contract for the design, production and installation supervision of the tiles. The $15,160 contract was awarded to International Pipe and Ceramics Corporation of LosAngeles.  The scope of the contract included the production of the five tile murals(Polynesian Immigration; Hawaiian King and Polynesian Plants; Kapu Breaking; Place of Refuge; the Island). The Island mural included only the background for a sculpted relief map of the Island of Hawaii that was to be supplied by the NPS.</p> <p> </p>",

One translation of Pu'uhonua is \"rising/elevated lands\" and alludes to the function a Heiau (temple) of this type served. Pu'uhonua were in a sense like ancient hospitals, where one could enter sick, be treated by skilled Kahuna La'au Lapa'au (master plant healers), and leave elevated with their health. A Pu'uhonua is where many Kahuna (skilled craftsmen/priests) resided. If you did not have a role to play in your community, entering into the Pu'uhonua you could apprentice under a master and perhaps one day leave elevated with purpose.  <br /> <br /> For those who had broken the divine laws of Kapu, a Pu'uhonua offered them sanctuary where they were able to undergo a process of reformation physically, mentally, and of course spiritually.  <br /> <br /> Though the Pu'uhonua of Hōnaunau was believed to be the most powerful, there were once many temples like it found around our islands' shores. After the passing of Kamehameha the Great , his eldest son and wives chose to discontinue many of the traditions of his ancestors and what led to the destruction of many of our sacred sites found around the archipelago. Pu'uhonua o Hōnaunau is considered the last ancient Pu'uhonua that still remains greatly intact today, and continues to be utilized by kanaka maoli (native hawaiians) for religious and spiritual ceremony.",

These trails are referred to as mauka-makai trails and highlight the importance of connecting the resources available from mountain to ocean.<br /> <br /> In ancient Hawaiʻi, the land was divided into long sections called ahupuaʻa that ran from the mountain to the ocean providing the people living in them almost everything they needed to survive. Larger trees for carving from the forest, fertile lands with ample rainfall in the <i>kula</i> (uplands), and abundant ocean resources from the <i>kahakai</i> (coastal area). Resources from each area were meticulously managed and shared throughout the ahupuaʻa along mauka-makai trails.<br /> <br /> While the primary village area for Kiʻilae was concentrated in this coastal area around the 1871 trail, as historian Frances Jackson (1966) states,</p> <blockquote> <p>“to attempt to show Ki‘ilae Village as existing only at the shore would show barely a third of the life of the villagers.” </p> </blockquote> <p>Families also maintained <i>kula</i> gardens with <em>ʻuala</em> (sweet potato), yams, pumpkins, squash, <em>kō</em> (sugar cane), papaya, <em>maiʻa</em> (bananas),<em> pia</em> (arrowroot), <em>ipu </em>(gourds), and <em>ulu</em> (breadfruit). These <i>kula</i> gardens were located far enough upslope to receive regular rain. In addition to kula gardens, many also cared for dryland <em>kalo</em> (taro) fields located even further upslope. A network of trails connected fields to field houses and to a mauka-makai trail that served as the main artery for travel between the <i>mauka</i> gardens and the coastal residences.<br /> <br /> This is no longer a maintained trail. Please make sure to stay on the 1871 Trail and practice Leave No Trace Principles to help protect archeological sites.</p>",

These walls enclosed house sites, or pā hale, and kept out animals such as pigs, cows, and goats that roamed the are Walls would rarely have gates and instead would have places built up to step over the wall into the house site. Later, stone walls were modified to accommodate ranching operations in the area.<br /> <br /> Within the walls would be a house platform upon which a house would be built. In Kiʻilae village, the majority of the houses were the old-style thatched grass houses. However, the more “well-to-do” houses were constructed with modern lumber and had tin roofs, like the John Ahu house. Showing the transitional nature of these times, some houses met halfway with thatched walls and a tin roof. Houses typically were just one large room for the entire family.<br /> <br /> One of the things that all of these house site had in common was the lack of a bathroom or even a pit outhouse. Bathing was done in the ocean and other activities were just done outside or in the tidal areas. The village also did not have electricity. In the evenings, light was provided by kerosene lanterns or kukui nut lights in which sundried kukui nuts were strung onto coconut midribs and lit. According to residents, one string of kukui nuts would last half the night.<br /> <br /> In the “yard” of the pā hale, families would grow any useful or decorative plant that could survive in the dry coastal environment, but most of the food was grown in the kula gardens upslope. “Yards” would also have a designated area for garbage, sometimes walled off from the rest of the area.<br /> <br /> <em>How are these traditional pā hale different or similar to the home you live in today?</em></p>",

Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey are working to better understand the impacts of water and sediment dynamics in the San Francisco Bay and Delta. Since the 1980’s, instruments have been installed at many sites to monitor water levels and temperature, and to measure sediment, salt and oxygen content. This information is critical for making decisions that affect the future of the Bay and Delta.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{94e3cde2-2fcd-473e-846c-b86feafe33b6}{188}\" paraid=\"782557944\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Monitoring Stations. Monitoring stations, like the one at the end of this pier, report water quality parameters every 15 minutes.

Reichel raised seedlings in the greenhouse for staff and inmate gardeners, experimenting with succulents and native plants suited to the island’s wind and drought.  </p>",

However, the occupation of the island was a historical turning point for American Indians across the country. Public sympathy generated by the occupation played a key role in ending the U.S. government’s policy of terminating tribal governments, and the relocation of Indians from their reservation lands and communities. This led to an official government policy recognizing tribal self-rule, which protects Indian lands, languages, culture, and identity.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{77}\" paraid=\"1015830757\">SECOND COLUMN:  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{81}\" paraid=\"166423103\">QUOTE: “In the name of all Indians...we reclaim this island for our Indian nations...” The Alcatraz Proclamation, Indians of All Nations, 1969. </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{89}\" paraid=\"659195835\">DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph of a tipi on Alcatraz Island with the bay and the city visible in the background.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{95}\" paraid=\"788115761\">CAPTION: The occupiers erected this tipi, symbolic of traditional American Indian life, as a sign of their reclamation of the island.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{101}\" paraid=\"860565764\">DESCRIPTION #2: Black and white photograph of Native American women standing behind a table filled with cooking supplies and various containers.

Some inmates wanted none of it – seeing the free world so close, and yet so out of reach, was too painful.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGES: A painting done by an inmate shows the city skyline as seen from Alcatraz and is broken down into 7 separate images. The paintings feature the docks, different landmarks like Coit Tower, the Palace of Fine Arts and ends with the Golden Gate Bridge on the right.<br /> <br /> CAPTIONS: San Francisco, circa 1950s. Inmate John Paul Chase made notes of the view when he was in the exercise yard at work detail and created these paintings from his cell, working from memory. Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill, the Palace of Fine Arts, and many other landmarks were part of Chase’s view in the 1950’s. Much has changed in San Francisco since Chase was here. Can you spot the differences between his paintings and the current view? Or the areas where his memory was faulty, causing him to misplace landmarks?<br /> <br /> QUOTE: “It was all there for you to see…everything I want in my life, and it’s there. It’s a mile and half away and yet I can’t get to it.” – Jim Quillen, inmate from 1942 to 1952.",

The overgrown piles of rubble below, near the island’s edge, are all that remain of apartments and cottages that once housed Alcatraz Prison guards and their families. Demolished after standing empty for nearly a decade following the penitentiary’s closure in 1963, the ruined structures are home to other residents now. Deer mice, California slender salamanders, and banana slugs reside here. Black-crowned night-herons nest in the tumbled housing. Pigeon guillemots’ nest in old pipes.All over the island many species of birds breed and raise their young in and on what’s left of the prison structures. Some species seek cover in the nooks and crannies of the vegetation that has spread from old garden beds. Others prefer concrete surfaces, building their nests in plain sight.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A gray fuzzy western gull chick, with black webbed feet, stands on a concrete surface.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Western gull chick. The effects of human presence on Alcatraz’s wildlife has decreas4ed since the prison closed in 1963.

Islands are naturally great habitat for sea birds because they are entirely surrounded by water, with food sources nearby. With increased options for cover, including vegetation that has spread from old garden beds, and planted trees, Alcatraz has become even more attractive habitat since the prison closed.<br /> <br /> SECOND ROW:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A close-up photo of a small brown and white speckled bird stands on a post, mouth slightly open, as if singing.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: This song sparrow, along with hummingbirds, house finches, and other common birds live at home on Alcatraz.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A close-up photo of a small, brown mouse with large ears stands on gravel.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Deer Mouse (<i>Peromyscus maniculatus)</i>.

The second column has two rows of images with two images in each row. <br /> <br /> FIRST COLUMN:<br /> <br /> TEXT: Seabirds: At home on the rock. Alcatraz, nicknamed “The Rock,” devoid of fresh water and surrounded by the salty bay, might not be an ideal home for some wildlife, but it’s great for seabirds. Several species are seasonal or permanent residents, including cormorants, oystercatchers, and pigeon guillemots. Because seabirds drink saltwater and take much of their food from oceans and bays, this is rich habitat for them. Alcatraz also has few predators and, because of park management policies, relatively little human disturbance. To coexist peacefully on Alcatraz, resident seabird species have developed contrasting feeding and nesting patterns. For example, cormorants feed from deep water and build their nests on the island’s cliffs, while oystercatchers feed from the tide pools and nest near the water. <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An illustration of the cliffs on Alcatraz showing the variety of birds that visit the island. The image features birds with text next to them. Text lists the following birds, from top to bottom: Snowy egrets, Black crowned Night Herons, Western Gulls, Brandt’s Cormorants, Pelagic Cormorants, Pigeon Guillemot, and Black Oystercatchers.<br />  <br /> CAPTION: The National Park Service carefully manages activity on Alcatraz to protect the island’s birds. Please stay on established walkways. <br /> <br /> SECOND COLUMN:<br /> <br /> FIRST ROW:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A medium sized bird stands on a rock like surface. The bird is completely black and has a small greyish white patch on its wings, a short black pointed beak, and bright orange webbed feet.  <br /> <br /> CAPTION: Pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba). The San Francisco Bay estuary is home to just one colony of pigeon guillemots, and they breed here on Alcatraz. Pigeon guillemots build their homes in holes in the sides of the island’s cliffs, in discarded pipe, and other hollows. Sixty-one adult pigeon-guillemots and 21 nests were counted on Alcatraz in 2007. <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A medium sized bird sits on a rock surface. The black oystercatcher is completely black bird with a bright orange ring around its eyes, and a long, thin bright orange beak.  <br /> <br /> CAPTION: Black oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani). Alcatraz’s nesting population includes large and small colonies, and both year-round and seasonal residents. The island’s one pair of black oystercatchers, first sighted in 1995, live here full-time. But they’re elusive, so consider yourself lucky if you see them! <br /> <br /> SECOND ROW:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A close up image of about 20 black birds scattered along a rocky surface. The birds are black, have black webbed feet and a long black beak with a bright blue pouch attached to their bottom beak, like a chin. Some of the birds are sitting on nests made of dried grasses. <br /> <br /> CAPTION: Cormorant nests. Note the blue throat pouches on the male cormorants, which are used to attract females. <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A wider photo of the cormorant nesting area showing hundreds of birds scattered along the rocky cliffs of the island. <br /> <br /> CAPTION: Brandt’s cormorant breeding colony can be seen during the spring and summer. ",

Throughout the military and penitentiary years, Alcatraz was much like a small town. Keeping the town going – and the convicts under control – depended on the uninterrupted service of the power plant to your left and the warehouse straight ahead. Because of the vital nature of these facilities, they were strictly off-limits to prisoners, unlike some operations on the island that relied on inmate labor.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81433fce-0523-4922-aae8-b9e445c8ba0c}{200}\" paraid=\"1371888732\">Completed in 1912, the power plant generated the island’s electricity and powered the pumps that provided fresh and salt water for all needs, including cooking, drinking, bathing, producing steam heat, irrigating the gardens, and fighting fires. The warehouse, built in 1921, stored essential supplies and equipment brought from the mainland, and provided workshop space. Today, both buildings serve many of the same functions.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81433fce-0523-4922-aae8-b9e445c8ba0c}{204}\" paraid=\"1347292261\">SECOND COLUMN:  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81433fce-0523-4922-aae8-b9e445c8ba0c}{208}\" paraid=\"1261573467\">DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white image of the power plant engine room.

With a potential life span of 25-30 years, including 20 or more breeding years, and a clutch of three eggs every nesting season, suggest that each pair of western gulls could raise more than 60 chicks. However, just one or two chicks fledge from each clutch, and of the very few that survive to adulthood, most live no more than ten years. Through careful management, the island provides vital nesting habitat for colonies of gulls and other sea birds.  </p>",

The trail is open when the birds are not nesting, typically from about mid October to mid January.</p> <h3>Naming Alcatraz</h3> <p>The origin of the name \"Alcatraz\" is debated, but is often attributed as a derivative of a name given by 18th century explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala, \"Alcatraces,\" meaning \"pelicans\" or \"seabird.\" The name is fitting, given the number of birds that call the island home. It's interesting to note that the original name the US Army gave to the island was \"the post on Alcatraces.\"</p> <h3>Bird friends</h3> <p>Alcatraz Island is a prime destination for seabirds including Brandt's cormorants and pigeon guillemots. The bluffs on the island provide habitat where these species can safely nest. These bird friends mostly feed in the open ocean and San Francisco Bay and have a taste for small fish.<br /> <br /> But the good life these birds enjoy could be in danger. Changes in ocean temperatures, and wind and upwelling patterns are affecting productivity and the distribution of the fish these birds eat. In some recent years, the distribution of anchovies, a favorite snack of cormorants, shifted south, leading to a near complete failure of cormorant nesting at Alcatraz and other nearby nesting areas. Continued climate change is likely to lead to further productivity and food chain disturbances for seabirds.</p>",

Beginning when the island was designated as a disciplinary barrack in 1868, most prisoners were US military personnel, but some notable exceptions included southern sympathizers during the Civil War, WWI conscientious objectors and Native Americans.</p> <h4>Bureau of Prisons</h4> <p>In the 1930s, the federal government developed a new type of prison for the nation's most incorrigible bad boys. The facilities at Alcatraz were modernized to become a maximum-security, minimum-privilege penitentiary specially designed for inmates that other prisons couldn't contain or control. During its 29 years of operation from 1934-1963, more than 1,500 convicts were incarcerated here.</p> <h4>We Hold the Rock</h4> <p>From November 1969 through June 1971, Alcatraz was taken over by Native American activists who called themselves Indians of All Tribes. The protest drew attention to the plight of native peoples across the US. Many lived in severe poverty on reservation land and faced serious discrimination from the greater US. The activists, many of whom were students who'd relocated to the Bay Area, selected Alcatraz for the occupation because it was surplus government land. It also had the distinct practical advantage of being difficult for federal authorities to access.<br /> <br /> The dramatic nature of the occupation was effective in capturing national attention, especially since it was an on-going action that dominated TV news for several months. The takeover resulted in a series of federal reforms with regard to the treatment of American Indians.<br /> <br /> According to the architects, the most significant impact of the occupation was to galvanize the reconnection of Native Americans to their cultural roots. The activists who first arrived on Alcatraz called for a pan-Native occupation, inviting any and all native people to join them on the island, which is exactly what happened. All the activists lived communally, some for the entirety of the occupation. In this way, a community formed that gave rise to personal bonds and cultural exploration that lasted long after the occupation was over.<br /> <br /> The success or failure of the occupation should not be judged by whether the demands of the occupiers were realized. The underlying goals of the American Indians on Alcatraz were to awaken the American public to the reality of the plight of the first Americans and to assert the need for American Indian self-determination. As a result of the occupation, the official government policy of termination of tribes was ended and a policy of American Indian self-determination became the official US government policy. Alcatraz may have been lost, but the occupation gave birth to a political movement which continues today.</p> <h4>From prison to tourist attraction</h4> <p>In 1972, Alcatraz was added to the newly created Golden Gate National Recreation Area and was opened to the public in 1973 as a historical landmark.</p>",

The Golden Gate National Recreation Area has taken these challenges head-on and developed several ways to improve efficiency and limit energy expenditure. Be it water usage, garbage management or carbon emissions from electricity production or transportation, we are addressing the problems.</p> <h3>Hybrid Ferries</h3> <p>The Alcatraz Cruises runs future-forward ferries powered by a combination of solar, wind and diesel power to get visitors to and from Alcatraz and Angel Island and back to San Francisco.</p> <h3>Waste Management</h3> <p>Garbage and sewage are shuttled back to the mainland to keep Alcatraz from getting too stimulating to the olfactories. The park, along with Alcatraz Cruises, is committed to keeping waste from Alcatraz out of landfills. After returning to the mainland, workers separate recyclable and compostable materials.</p> <h3>Alternative Power Source</h3> <p>Alcatraz has no electrical or water lines from the mainland. Drinking water and diesel fuel for electric generators must be ferried to the island. These inefficiencies raise the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions Alcatraz puts out, which is why the NPS has found some creative ways to reduce Alcatraz's carbon footprint.<br /> <br /> The buildings on Alcatraz are fitted with solar panels and a battery system that lowers its carbon dioxide emissions. In 2013, solar power reduced the island's fuel usage by an estimated 32,000 gallons and kept 325 Metric Tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere. Go planet!</p> <h3>The Ins and Outs of Solar Power</h3> <p>When it's sunny out, 959 solar panels on the cellhouse roof power the entire island. Any extra electrical juice that comes through charges a bank of batteries located in the old power house. The batteries store energy to boost the electrical system when the sun isn't enough. The power house is also equipped with diesel generators that can power the island if all the other juice runs low and then put any extra energy back into the battery bank.</p> <h3>Smart Water</h3> <p>Alcatraz needs water for drinking, irrigation and maintaining the island's sewage system. To cut down on bringing water to the island, the gardens are irrigated with captured rainwater, and the toilets are flushed with saltwater. Currently, desalinization and on-site sewage treatment are under study, and may further reduce the need to transport water and sewage.</p>",

        "notes": "Alcatraz Sally Port\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/alcatraz-sally-port.htm\n\n<p>During the 1860s, Alcatraz was the most fortified military site on the West Coast with over 100 cannons facing the bay in case of would-be intruders. The guardhouse was built in 1857, and contained the island's first prison, a US military stockade in the building's basement. That facility was used to house unruly soldiers and during the Civil War, Confederate spies. The guardhouse featured a sally port, an armored, controlled entryway to the fortress on Alcatraz beyond.</p> <h3>Hopi Prisoners</h3> <p>In 1894, 19 Hopi men were arrested by federal troops in Arizona as part of a US policy of using incarceration to intimidate Native Americans who resisted assimilation. The Hopi men were part of a group who refused to send their children to government boarding schools and other disputes with US authorities. They were taken from their homes and kept in the army prison on Alcatraz for a year before their release in September 1895.<br /> <br /> <br /> Besides being forcibly removed from their homes and families for the 'crime' of defending their culture, the Hopi prisoners lived in dangerous, unsanitary conditions on Alcatraz. During the day, they were made to cut large logs into smaller sections. Their hardship was downplayed by newspapers and their captors, who referred to their forced removal as \"rude.\" Two of the men's wives gave birth to children who died while the men were imprisoned.</p> <h3>Restoring the guardhouse and sally port</h3> <p>The National Park Service completed major repairs to the guardhouse, with special attention paid to improving the structure's ability to withstand earthquakes. The boathouse, added in the 1920s, was removed so that visitors could see and pass through the original sally port entrance constructed in 1857.<br /> <br /> Any construction projects on Alcatraz are complicated because supplies and water must be ferried to the island. The guardhouse repairs were especially challenging because the work had to be performed alongside the island's daily visitors, who traveled through the actual construction site. Delivery of the building materials was carefully coordinated around visitor arrival and departure times and the breeding seasons of the island's bird population.<br /> <br /> Certified hazardous material contractors removed the building's unsafe lead paint and repainted the building with environmentally friendly paint that would stand up to the harsh marine environment. The NPS rehabilitated special historic guardhouse features, including the defensive dry moat, the cannon port \"embrasure\" and the lower prison room.<br /> <br /> The 1920s boathouse addition was removed so that visitors could better understand and experience the guardhouse and sally port entranceway as it was originally constructed.</p>",

Most were soldiers who committed crimes while fighting Filipino nationalists after U.S. annexation of the Philippines following the Spanish American War (1898). In 1907, as the prison population grew, the army renamed the island from Fort Alcatraz to U.S. Military Prison Alcatraz Island. Incarcerated soldiers were forced to tear down the Civil War brick buildings and cannon batteries and construct what you see here today, including this Powerhouse built in 1910 to power a new prison.<br /> <br /> In 1912, when that new 600-cell prison opened atop the island, it was the largest steel-reinforced concrete building in the world. Along with incarcerated soldiers, the new prison held First World War conscientious objectors like Philip Grosser, an anarchist who refused to work and was shackled in an unlit cell below the prison for weeks at a time.<br /> <br /> <em>How would you stand up for what you believe in? </em></p>",

One of the men held here was C.L. Weller, brother of a former governor of California and Chairman of the State Democratic Committee. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ef0f82d4-d742-4331-8027-0f81c35810ac}{128}\" paraid=\"104197299\"><em><strong>Should people be imprisoned for their beliefs? </strong></em></p>",

Soldiers like George Bender, convicted of arson, joined the 500 prisoners put to hard labor at Fort Alcatraz. One day Bender set the building on fire. No one died and the fire was extinguished, but fear of fire in the wooden building, especially after the 1906 earthquake and fire in San Francisco, led the Army to consider building a new prison. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ae1f5a47-2800-48e6-8a6f-45a369503e55}{1}\" paraid=\"15705939\"><em><strong>Should mental health care be provided to people incarcerated in prisons?  </strong></em></p>",

Those who failed to abide by the rules in the federal prison system ended up on Alcatraz, not necessarily for the crime they committed, but for their behavior in other federal prisons. Gangsters like Al Capone and George “Machine Gun” Kelly did time on the Rock, but so did men with mental health issues like Joseph Bowers or those who defied racial segregation like Robert Lipscomb. The Federal Bureau of Prisons rebuilt the cellhouse and converted the military prison into a modern maximum-security institution. The penitentiary closed for good in 1963 because of the expenses of operating a prison on a rock in the middle of the Bay. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ae1f5a47-2800-48e6-8a6f-45a369503e55}{105}\" paraid=\"328964742\"><br /> <em><strong>What other options to prisons exist? </strong></em></p> <p paraeid=\"{ae1f5a47-2800-48e6-8a6f-45a369503e55}{116}\" paraid=\"997758258\">The US prison system holds more than two million people at a cost of $80 billion annually. Many of the incarcerated have mental health issues and drug addictions.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Are the costs worth it? Or do we need to rethink incarceration as a universal system of punishment? </strong></em></p>",

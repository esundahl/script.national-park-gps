The night before the flood, a pail left outside near the dam collected eight inches of rainwater! Swelling streams poured into the lake, increasing its normal volume 33%. <br /> <br /> When the dam failed, an estimated 20,000,000 tons of water pushed through the gap in front of you. During the 45 minutes or so it took for the lake to drain, the volume of escaping water roughly equaled the flow over Niagara Falls.<br /> <br /> A 30 to 60-foot-high flood wave swept down the valley to your right toward Johnstown, at speeds averaging 40 miles per hour. The churning water swept up earth, stones, trees, livestock, houses, and debris as it advanced, adding to its destructive power and horrifying appearance. Witnesses describe a dark mist which hung over the wave, and an ominous sound like thunder.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> View of the breach in the dam from downstream not long after the flood. The photographer's dashed line indicates the elevation of the dam before it gave way. The floodwaters removed 90,000 cubic yards of earth and stone from the dam in less than an hour.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> The flood wave hit the Day Express, a passenger train from Pittsburgh, about two miles upstream of Johnstown at East Conemaugh. Many passengers saw and heard the wave approaching, and escaped to high ground. Twenty-two were killed.<br /> <br /> <strong>Walking or climbing on the slopes of the dam is hazardous, and may damage the historic earthworks by promoting erosion.

Notice that it is only a matter of feet to the top of the dam. After a night of torrential rain the lake was rising a foot an hour by the morning of May 31, while the storm continued to rage. Everyone there knew that if the water began to flow over the top, the dam would quickly erode and then break.<br /> <br /> As you look across the South Fork Creek, you can see a heavy timber bridge, which the National Park Service reconstructed over the original spillway. The various tributaries that flowed into the lake had become raging torrents as a result of the storm ripping out trees and picking up debris along their banks. The current in the lake flowed toward the spillway, carrying the debris with it. The only means of letting out the excess water in the lake was the spillway, and it was becoming jammed.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A photo from the 1880s showing the water level of Lake Conemaugh with boats and oars.

There is one column of text and one image.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Title</strong>: On old state maps it was the Western Reservoir.<br /> <br /> <strong>Text: </strong>The original dam was built by the state of Pennsylvania to create a reservoir for the western portion of the Pennsylvania Mainline Canal and completed in the 1850's. It had a control mechanism consisting of a sluice gate with five very large cast iron pipes that enter a stone culvert extending 270 feet through the base of the dam. The foundation stones that are still visible here are all that remain of the culvert. A valve tower out in the lake regulated the flow of water out through the pipes. After a breach in 18532, the lake was completely drained, the valve tower burned down, and the cast iron pipes were removed. <br /> <br /> After a series of owners, the property was purchased by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1879. When the dam was patched under their ownership, this vital control system was never replaced. The only means left to get rid of excess water from the lake was the spillway--and on the morning of May 31, 1889, it was jammed with debris from the storm.<br /> <br /> The level of the lake continued to rise at an alarming rate. It was just a matter of time before the water would flow over the top of the dam, causing it to break. John Parke rode his horse to the town of South Fork to send a telegraph warning to Johnstown. The roads were in terrible shape because of the storm, but he made the two mile ride in just ten minutes. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> The first South Fork Dam as it was built by the State of Pennsylvania in 1853 to provide water for the state canal system with text showing your location. NPS/Harpers Ferry Center",

The screen had been installed years before to keep fish from escaping from the lake. In the summer of 1881, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club stocked the lake with 1,000 black bass, which had been transported by special railroad tank car from Lake Erie at a cost of about a dollar a fish.<br /> <br /> After the flood people were particularly bitter about the fish screens. A man by the name of Isaac Reed wrote a popular poem at the time which began:<br /> <br /> <em>Many thousand human lives--<br /> Butchered husbands, slaughtered wives..<br /> Mangled daughters, bleeding sons,<br /> Hosts of martyred little ones,<br /> (Worse than Herod's awful crime)<br /> Sent to heaven before heir time;<br /> Lovers burnt and sweethearts drowned,<br /> Darlings lost but never found!<br /> All the horrors that hell could wish,<br /> Such was the price that was paid for--fish!</em><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Image: </strong>Black bass",

This <i>new addition</i>, as Club members referred to it, expanded the amount of guest rooms from 17 to 47. While there were 14 private cottages, Club rules dictated that all meals were to be eaten in the Club House. This building served as the main gathering place of the Club, which boasted 61 members-Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Philander C. Knox, and Andrew Mellon included.<br /> <br /> The shoreline of the lake would have been near where the grass line meets the road, directly across from the front porch. There would have been a boardwalk to connect the cottages and other Club buildings to the Club House. Behind the Club House, instead of a residential area, there were trees and woods. Legend has it that the Club even had a two-story outhouse somewhere in those woods. One of the most cherished activities of the Club was sitting on the front porch conversing with other Club members and taking in the evening breezes off of the lake. Of course, club members fished and hunted.<br /> <br /> In addition, members put on plays, swam in the lake, took walks around the lake, had picnics by the spillway, played and listened to music, and they also had a large fleet of sailboats and other watercraft. The summer season typically began in earnest around the middle of June, however there were about five or six Club members and their families at the Club on May 30-31, 1889.",

Within this now beautiful national park, we commemorate one of the darkest days in American history. On Friday, May 31, 1889, the South Fork Dam, the remains of which are visible below and to the right, failed, sending over 20,000,000 tons of water hurtling into the Conemaugh Valley. At 4:07 pm that afternoon, the flood wave struck the industrial city of Johnstown. $17,000,000 in property damage occurred and an official total of 2,209 men, women, and children were killed.<br /> <br /> You are standing on what was once the property of the South Fork Fishing & Hunting Club. The house directly in front of you was the home of the Club’s second and last president, Colonel Elias J. Unger. The building to your right, the park visitor center, was designed to resemble the Unger barn. Hayfields and orchards would have been visible as well. Unger was originally from the Harrisburg area. He had an illustrious career working for the Pennsylvania Railroad, making a name for himself in hotels. He eventually settled in the Pittsburgh area. Through his work with the railroad, he befriended many of the rich and powerful club members. He did not have the same kind of wealth that most club members possessed but they wanted their Club House to be the best and they knew Unger was the man who could make this happen. Unger’s duties included caring for the South Fork Dam. After the breaking of the South Fork Dam and the Johnstown Flood, he stayed on the spot, living out the rest of his years until he died in 1896.",

The elevation to Johnstown decreases by 450 feet. You are standing atop the north side of what is left of the South Fork Dam. The body of water penned in by the dam went by numerous names over the years: the Western Reservoir, the Old Reservoir, Three Mile Dam, and finally Lake Conemaugh. When construction began in 1838, the dam and reservoir were to serve as a canal feeder for the Pennsylvania Mainline Canal from Johnstown to Blairsville. The dam was ready for operation in 1853, but the canal went out of business shortly after that. The body of water and the dam was actually in the hands of four owners until its demise on the afternoon of Friday, May 31, 1889. These owners included: The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, The Pennsylvania Railroad, United States Congressman John C. Reilly, and finally, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club.<br /> <br /> The dam was 72 feet high and 931 feet across. At the center of the base, it had five sluice pipes for the purpose of draining the reservoir to supply water for the Mainline Canal. The footbridge you crossed is where the spillway was. Originally, this was an unobstructed spillway, but in 1881, when the fishing and hunting club stocked the lake with black bass from Lake Erie, a weir was put over the face of the spillway to keep the fish from escaping.",

The Club filled the dam so that it held 62-65 feet of water. The rain began on the night of May 30, 1889. By the morning of May 31, 8-10 inches of rain had fallen. Colonel Elias J. Unger the Club president, making observations from his porch that morning, said, ‘It seemed as if the whole valley was under water.’<br /> <br /> The young engineer John Parke had been hired on to oversee the installation of a sewage system for the Club. That morning he was sailing around the lake, taking measurements and making observations. Through his calculations, it was observed that the water in the dam was rising about an inch every 10 minutes. A team of about two dozen Italian immigrants had been hired to do the work of the installation of the sewage system. They had a camp near what is now the South Abutment. On the morning of May 31, they had a new work order: Save the South Fork Dam. A dozen were employed in trying to raise the level of the dam while the rest were trying, unsuccessfully, to dislodge all of the debris from the spillway. At around 11:00 that morning, Parke thought it would be a good idea to race to South Fork to sound an alarm, an alarm that many people either did not heed or take seriously.",

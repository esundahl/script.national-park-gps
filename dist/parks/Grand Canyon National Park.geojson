Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>, a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest.

Ancient examples of geologic processes that have shaped our planet over eons are visible here and help us understand similar, modern processes still occurring today.<br /> <br /> The fossils contained within these rocks add another layer to the story and often provide the clues needed to understand the environments that shaped the landscape so long ago, but finding these tiny, ellusive fossils can be difficult in the face of the immensity of Grand Canyon.<br /> <br /> Thankfully the Bright Angel Fault Fossil beds provide an easy solution. Located on the rim of the canyon, a short walk west of the first shuttle stop on the Hermit Road, access to the site is open to the public. <br /> <br /> This site tells the tale of a world far different than the one we see here today. With careful eyes, exposed fossilized remains of creatures from an ancient marine environment 270 million years ago, can unlock secrets and mysteries preserved within Grand Canyon's layers. What will your eyes discover at this one-of-a-kind place along the south rim?<br /> <br /> Remember that the fossils we see and enjoy here today are the ones left to us by the visitors of yesterday and it's up to us to leave what we find for tomorrow's visitors and all those that come after. Feel free to explore and handle the rocks and fossils on your own or with a park ranger, but leave them for the next visitor.<br /> <br /> Please do not mark, mar, or otherwise damage the site during your visit. Take only pictures and leave only footprints.<br /> <br /> <b>All fossils within Grand Canyon National Park are protected by federal law and should remain at the site no matter how small or numerous they may seem.<br /> <br /> Watch your step and your head</b> when exploring the site. The area is uneven with sudden drops and the branches from the scattered trees in the area are better seen than felt.  <br /> <br /> *<em>For a bonus challenge try to find where the Bright Angel Fault meets the rim when you are walking to or back from the fossil site along the rim trail.</em> (<em>Hint: It's betwen the fossil site and Village Route Shuttle Stop)</em></p> <h3>Ranger Programs</h3> <p>A Ranger Program called \"Fossil Discovery Walk\", which visits this site, may be offered in the spring, summer, and fall.<br /> <br /> Check at visitor centers within the park or on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/sr-programs.htm\">website</a> for availability.</p>",

A transition from the cool green forest of the Kaibab Plateau to a stunted forest of pinyon and juniper occurs within a very short distance. On flat land, one would have to travel several hundred miles to experience this much environmental variation, but thanks to the canyon's topography, the transition is compressed into a few hundred yards.<br /> <br /> The trail to Bright Angel Point begins on the Bridle Path behind the Visitor Center, or from the Grand Canyon Lodge veranda. Below the lodge, from the junction of the Transept Trail and Bridle Path, it is a 0.5 mile (0.8 km) round-trip walk which usually takes at least 30 minutes to complete. This narrow, paved path provides spectacular views, although it drops off dramatically on both sides in some places, and certain sections are surprisingly steep. The length of the trail is exposed to the elements; watch out for thunderstorms during the summer months and seek shelter in the Grand Canyon Lodge if you see lightning or hear thunder. </p> <h3>Trail Information</h3> <p><strong>Roundtrip Distance:</strong> 0.5 miles (0.8 km)<br /> <strong>Elevation change:</strong> Minimal<br /> <strong>Average Hiking Time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>",

Destinations below Havasupai Gardens are not recommended day hikes due to the long distance, extreme temperature changes, and an approximately 5,000' (1,500 m) elevation change each way.</strong></p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>Water is available seasonally (May through October) along the trail at Mile-and-a-Half Resthouse and Three-Mile Resthouse, as well as year-round at Havasupai Gardens.<br /> <br /> However, water availability is subject to weather conditions and may be interrupted by pipeline breaks. Check at the Visitor Center or Backcountry Information Center for water status on the trail.<br /> <br /> Even though the Bright Angel Trail has water stations along the trail, carrying your own water is still necessary. Water from natural sources such as creeks and springs should be purified. When hiking in a group, each person should be carrying water.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>Bright Angel Trail is considered the most popular hiking trail in the park. Well-maintained and graded for stock, it is fairly easy to walk down. This can be a blessing or a curse. Wide views of the inner canyon and distant formations often distract hikers from just how far down the trail they've walked. The return hike back up and out of the canyon is far more difficult and requires much more effort. Plan for at least twice as much time back up as it took to go down.<br /> <br /> While South Kaibab Trail follows a ridge line, Bright Angel Trail is tucked deep within a side canyon along a massive fault, which keeps the trail in this side canyon for the first few miles. The majority of the trail's elevation change takes place in the upper four miles via a series of switchbacks that seem endless. Views are framed by massive cliffs, with more plant and animal life thanks to a higher degree of shade and natural water sources. If you're interested in geology or wildlife, this is a trail with complementary features. You can expect to see mules on the trail as well. See below for more information.<br /> <br /> The trail levels out as it approaches Havasupai Gardens, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) and over 2,000 vertical feet (925 meters) below the rim. This destination is an oasis within the canyon, home to the Havasupai People until they were forced to leave when the National Park was established. From here, you might consider the relatively flat (but very exposed) 3-mile (4.8-km) round trip hike to Plateau Point for sunrise or sunset.<br /> <br /> Hikers interested in planning a trip beyond these destinations should consult a park ranger.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> During late fall, winter, and early spring, temperatures regularly drop below freezing, and upper portions of this steep trail can become dangerously icy. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended during these times of year. Consult a park ranger for current trail conditions.<br /> <br /> Before heading down into the canyon, <strong>consult the signs at the trailhead</strong> for trip planning and <strong>current weather, trail information and trail closures</strong>. (or visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/key-messages.htm\">Key Hiking Messages</a> webpage).<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> Before your hike, it is critical to determine your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing: proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting, sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>—a seizure-producing, electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Mules and Hikers</h3> <p><strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br /> <strong>Always give mules the right of way.</strong><br /> Encounters between hikers and mules have resulted in injuries to packers and even death to mules. To ensure safety for yourself, other trail users, mules, and mule riders, follow these steps when encountering mules on the trails:</p> <ol> <li>Step off the trail on the uphill side-away from the edge.</li> <li>Listen for and follow the directions of the wranglers.</li> <li>Remain completely quiet and stand perfectly still.</li> <li>Only return to the trail when the last mule is 50 feet (15 m) beyond your position.</li> </ol> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for all camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn more and apply <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">online</a>, or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.</p> <ul> <li>Only camp in designated campsites - Havasupai Gardens Campground offers 15 small group sites and 1 large group site.

Built on this site in 1895 by William Owen \"Buckey\" O'Neill, the 2-room office and bunkhouse—complete with v-notched logs, rough mortar chinking, and a native stone chimney—was the rustic home of Buckey and his wife while they operated a small hotel on the South Rim. The consummate entrepreneur, Buckey improved the Bright Angel Trail and camp at Indian Garden and promoted the Grand Canyon Railroad to benefit both his tourism and mining interests.<br /> <br /> Buckey O'Neill died in Cuba in 1898 during the Battle of San Juan Hill, fighting with Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders. After his death, the cabin was bought by entrepreneur James Thurber, who owned and operated the nearby Bright Angel Hotel. Thurber incorporated the cabin as part of his hotel, connecting the two structures first with a large circus tent and later with an actual wooden frame building. The hotel, including Buckey's cabin, was sold to Martin Buggeln in 1901, and was later acquired by the Santa Fe Railroad after the completion of the El Tovar Hotel in 1905. The railroad and Fred Harvey Company tore down the Bright Angel Hotel in 1934-1935 to replace it with the Bright Angel Lodge, which still stands today. The architect of the Bright Angel Lodge and its associated cabins, Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter, decided to renovate Buckey O'Neill's cabin as a guest lodge. It remains operating as one of Bright Angel Lodge's active guest cabins to this day.</p>",

There is no direct view of the canyon from this site, but a few small glimpses can be seen through the gaps in the trees. The small, teardrop-shaped parking area is fine for cars and small RVs, but larger vehicles and those towing trailers will find turning around a bit tight.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Prior to using the land for a cattle ranching venture, Martin Buggeln first became involved with Grand Canyon when he moved here in 1901 from Williams, Arizona. After purchasing the Bright Angel Hotel on the South Rim, Buggeln partnered with the newly arrived Santa Fe Railroad to provide tourist accommodations.<br /> <br /> In 1902, he became the first postmaster of the Village when he opened a post office in his hotel. As a community gathering place, the post office provided one of the few social outlets for the permanent residents of the developing Village. However, after only a few years in the hotel business, Buggeln sold his interest in Bright Angel Hotel to the Santa Fe Railroad. He had tired of the political infighting between hotel owners, the railroad, and public landholders regarding ownership rights of the Bright Angel Trail.<br /> <br /> In 1906, Buggeln bought the 160-acre (65 ha) Hance Ranch property and built a 17-room hotel on the land, although he never operated the hotel for tourists. Instead, he began a cattle operation that continued into the 1930s. Martin Buggeln died in 1939, and in 1948, the National Park Service bought the land from his second wife. At that time, it was the last privately owned property in the park east of Grand Canyon Village. All buildings on the property were removed in 1957.</p>",

From here you wander underneath rocky outcrops until you reach a chest-high boulder resting under one of these large overhangs. The spring is on the cliff side of the boulder.

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia </strong>-a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",

There are guardrails around the cliff edge for your safety.<br /> <br /> Directly below is the Colorado River's \"Big Bend\", where it dramatically shifts its previously southward course by executing a sharp 90-degree turn to the west, cutting directly into a major uplift on the Colorado Plateau known as the Kaibab Upwarp. Looking to the west, one can glimpse in the distance where the river plunges into the black, narrow, confined depths of the Granite Gorge.The airline distance to the opposite rim of the canyon is 18 miles; to the Colorado River, 4 miles. The river is about 300 feet wide as seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> To the east, several thousand feet below where you are now standing, is the broad expanse of a plateau known as the Marble Platform, which is part of the Navajo Nation. The brilliant colors of the Painted Desert can be glimpsed in the distance. <br /> <br /> Also to the east, and situated back from the Canyon rim, is a prominent flat-topped mesa called Cedar Mountain. Just beyond this mountain the Little Colorado River gorge extends north and south as a crack in the surface of the earth. Tracing the gorge to the left, one may see where it connects with Grand Canyon. The point of connection is where Grand Canyon begins. From that point the Canyon extends 217 miles westward as measured by the Colorado River. Fifty miles of the canyon may be seen from Desert View.<br /> <br /> Dark cliffs bordering the Colorado River below Desert View are composed of lavas resulting from volcanic activity long before the cutting of Grand Canyon began. For the most part the walls of Grand Canyon consist of material which hardened into rock after being deposited by wind or water: Consequently, this lava rock is very different in origin and character from the rest of the rocks of the Canyon walls.</p> <h3>1956 Aviation Accident Memorial</h3> <p>At Desert View point, a National Historic Landmark plaque and stone memorial commemorate the 1956 Grand Canyon TWA-United Airlines Aviation Accident Site,<strong> </strong>a horrific airline collision over Grand Canyon that took place on June 30, 1956. <br /> <br /> On that day, a Trans World Airlines (TWA) Super Constellation L-1049 and a United Airlines DC-7 collided in uncongested airspace 21,000 feet over the Grand Canyon, and killing all 128 people onboard the two flights. The tragedy spurred an unprecedented effort to modernize and increase safety in America’s postwar airways, culminating in the establishment of the modern Federal Aviation Administration. </p> <h3>National Historic Landmarks Program</h3> <p>The National Historic Landmarks Program, established in 1935, is administered by the National Park Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. The agency works with preservation officials, private property owners, and other partners interested in nominating properties for National Historic Landmark designation. Completed nominations are reviewed by the National Park System Advisory Board, which makes recommendations for designation to the Secretary of the Interior. This site was dedicated as one of the nation's newest National Historic Landmarks on Tuesday, July 8, 2014.</p>",

From there, the Watchtower is in plain view.<br /> <br /> Recognized as a National Historic Landmark, the Watchtower was constructed in 1932. Architect Mary Colter’s design takes its influences from the architecture of the Ancestral Puebloan people of the Colorado Plateau. This particular tower was patterned after those found at Hovenweep and the Round Tower of Mesa Verde. Colter indicated that it was not a copy of any that she had seen, but rather modeled from several.<br /> <br /> The view from the Watchtower provides a unique perspective of the eastern portion of Grand Canyon. From here, looking to the northeast offers a distant glimpse of the Colorado River's transition from the relatively narrow Marble Canyon to the north into the much wider, broader expanse of Grand Canyon.<br /> <br /> For more about what can be seen from here, view <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/desert-view-point-1956-aviation-accident-memorial.htm\">Desert View Point.</a></p> <h3>The View Room</h3> <p>This lower floor of the tower, the View Room, is modeled after a traditional Native American kiva, and hosts cultural handicraft demonstrations throughout during most of the year. A Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store is also located here.<br /> <br /> Inside the Watchtower View Room, views of the canyon, through the different windows, are enhanced by looking through reflectoscopes —viewing instruments that use polished black glass mirrors to cut through the haze and glare of bright sunlight and more clearly highlight the canyon's multi-colored layers.<br /> <br /> The View Room, which for years was used as retail space, in 2015 was returned to the open area that Mary Colter had intended, because the room was originally designed to be a rest area. It was here that visitors to the canyon in the 1930’s could sit in comfort and have outstanding views of the canyon. The fireplace is unique in that it does not block the view for visitors. Gaze into one of the reflectoscopes and see a different perspective of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More About the Watchtower</h3> <p>With painstaking detail, Colter directed the placement of each rock and architectural accent in the Desert View Watchtower. Using mostly locally sourced rocks and reused timber, the tower appears to grow organically from the rim of the canyon itself, paying homage to the techniques and styles of local tribes while utilizing modern-day equipment and materials to strengthen the internal structure. <br /> <br /> As you approach the building you might see how well it blends into the environment. It is difficult to tell where the rock of the canyon walls end, and the tower begins. Colter said:<br /> <br /> <em>“First and most important, was to design a building that would become part of its surroundings; one that would create no discordant note against the time eroded walls of this promontory.”</em><br /> <br /> To obtain this result she insisted that the rocks not be cut or worked, so they would not lose the <em>“weathered surfaces so essential to blend it with the canyon walls”.</em><br /> <br /> Note, too, some of the intricate designs she had built into the tower. For example, look for the white decorative stones near the top, which fade out as the eye goes around the tower. She had seen this pattern at Chaco Canyon and thought it would break the monotony of this Watchtower. The built in cracks which are patterned from some of the ancient towers she had seen are deliberately designed. There are petroglyphs on some of the stones. Can you spot them?<br /> <br /> The internal steel framework of the Watchtower was designed and supervised by the bridge builders of the Santa Fe Railway company. Upon this framework, each exterior stone was selected and carefully placed to ensure exactly the look that Mary Colter was hoping to obtain.</p> <h3>Traveling to the Watchtower </h3> <p><strong>Park Shuttles are NOT provided to Desert View. You must drive you vehicle, or take a </strong><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/plan/interpretive-bus-tours/\">commercial bus tour</a>, that starts from Grand Canyon Village.<br /> <br /> The 23 mile (37 km) drive east of Grand Canyon Village on Arizona Highway 64 is worth the effort. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-drive.htm\">Desert View Drive</a> offers spectacular perspectives of the canyon, including: </p> <ul> <li>Six developed canyon viewpoints</li> <li>Four picnic areas </li> <li>Five unmarked pullouts </li> <li>Accessibility for private vehicles </li> <li>Tusayan Pueblo Site and Museum.<strong>(CLOSED FOR WINTER)</strong></li> </ul> <p><br /> There is NO lodging at Desert View, although there is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-campground.htm\">seasonal campground</a> operated by the National Park Service from mid-April to mid-October.</p> <h3>Desert View Visitor Services</h3> <p>Desert View provides restrooms, the Watchtower, Trading Post/ice cream/coffee, Grocery Store/Deli, Gas Station, and Campground. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view.htm\">Details ></a><br /> <br /> <strong>Cultural handicraft demonstrations take place in the Watchtower in the Spring, Summer and Fall. </strong>The program provides an opportunity for visitors to interact with Tribal artisans from Grand Canyon's Traditionally Associated Tribes, and for them to share their history, knowledge and skills. <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/desert-view-cultural-demonstration-program.htm\">View the Schedule ></a></em></p>",

Scattered throughout Grand Canyon you will find sinking ships, alligators, covered wagons, figures of myth and legend, and more all hidden in the rocks and formations we see.

The buidling now serves as the offices for Grand Canyon Conservancy. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon Conservancy (GCC) is the official nonprofit partner of Grand Canyon National Park, funding projects not covered by federal money. The realization of preserving trails and historic buildings, delivering educational programs for the public, conducting scientific research, and protecting wildlife and their natural habitat has been cultivated, in part, through GCC's memberships, publications, educational outreach, park stores, philanthropic efforts, and a field institute featuring guided natural and cultural history programs.<br /> <br /> Your purchases at each GCC Park Store will support these and many other initiatives in Grand Canyon. A GCC membership provides you with a 15% discount on all purchases at any of GCC bookstores in the park. In addition, your membership may allow for separate discounts at other park cooperating associations and stores on separate federal public lands.</p> <h3>Grand Canyon Conservancy (GCC) Stores</h3> <p><strong>GCC operates multiple Park Stores in the park:</strong><br /> <br /> Grand Canyon Conservancy Park Store<br /> Yavapai Geology Museum<br /> Verkamp's Visitor Center<br /> Kolb Studio<br /> Tusayan Museum and Ruin<br /> Desert View Watchtower<br /> North Rim Visitor Center</p> <h3>Grand Canyon Field Institute</h3> <p>The Grand Canyon Conservancy Field Institute helps visitors experience Grand Canyon like never before. Through classes, guided hiking trips, and educational tours you will learn about the geology and cultural and natural history of this magnificent place from those who know it best-geologists, historians, ecologists, archaeologists, and other experts.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>In 1932, park ranger naturalist Edwin \"Eddie\" McKee founded the Grand Canyon Natural History Association. As a park ranger working on the South Rim, McKee saw the need for a partnership to support interpretive programs, publications, and efforts to preserve the canyon. From its beginning, the natural history association did just that, funding interpretive talks, research, and scientific papers. It continues to do so today as the Grand Canyon Conservancy.<br /> <br /> Today, GCC still serves its founding mission, and much more. Membership, general-audience publications, educational outreach, a field institute, and philanthropy programs were added over the years to serve the Conservancy's mission of cultivating support, education, and understanding of Grand Canyon.</p> <h3>More Information (Wi-Fi or cell service required)</h3> <p><a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/\">Grand Canyon Conservancy</a></p>",

Efforts to rebuild began in 1936, and the lodge was rebuilt to ensure it could withstand heavy snow.<br /> <br /> The lodge has been in operation since it reopened in 1936, earning the prestigious designation as a National Historic Landmark on May 28, 1987.<br /> <br /> Learn more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/grand-canyon-lodge-history.htm\">History of Grand Canyon Lodge ></a></p>",

But the ages of Grand Canyon's rocks are a different matter entirely, spanning over 1.5 billion years of Earth's history. The oldest known rock in Grand Canyon, known as the Elves Chasm Gneiss, is located deep in the canyon's depths as part of the Vishnu Basement Rocks and clocks in at an ancient 1.84 billion years old. The youngest of Grand Canyon's rock layers, the Kaibab Formation, forms the rims of the canyon and is a mere 270 million years old. But that's still even older than the dinosaurs!<br /> <br /> This interpretive exhibit along the Trail of Time discusses some of the methods geologists use to determine the ages of rocks, tools which are part of a field within the science of geology known as geochronology. This stop also offers an opportunity to actually see and touch a piece of the Elves Chasm Gneiss, the oldest known rock in Grand Canyon.</p>",

It also provides especially fantastic aerial views of the switchbacks on the upper and middle portions of Bright Angel Trail, as well as a view of 3-Mile Resthouse far below. Grandeur Point is a popular stop along the Rim Trail between Grand Canyon Visitor Center and the Village, as well as a popular spot for sunset that is often less crowded and more easily accessible spots like Mather, Lipan, or Hopi Points.<br /> <br /> Grandeur Point is located along the Rim Trail about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) west of Yavapai Point and Yavapai Geology Museum. It can also be reached via Parking Lot A and Park Headquarters by following the paved trail past McKee Amphitheater and out to the Rim Trail. After following this path for 0.4 miles (0.6 km), turn right and follow the Rim Trail east for nearly 0.5 miles (0.8 km). The view is worth the walk!</p> <h2>Geology</h2> <p>Grandeur Point offers an especially dramatic view of Bright Angel Canyon, which slices directly across Grand Canyon and cuts deep into both the South and North Rims. Grand Canyon Village sits near the southern head of this massive side canyon, which has formed along a geologic structure known as the Bright Angel Fault. Many faults, large and small, cut the rock layers of Grand Canyon, but the Bright Angel Fault is probably the most famous. Movement of rocks along this fault has created a major conduit for water flowing down to the Colorado River, including Garden Creek from the South Rim (fed by springs at Indian Garden, far below) and Bright Angel Creek from the North Rim (fed by Angel Spring and Roaring Springs, the source of all drinking water within the park). Since movement along faults causes breaks in the shear cliffs of Grand Canyon, they often serve as access points for trails descending from the canyon rims. Where the switchbacks of the Bright Angel Trail descend through the break in the shear cliff of tan Coconino Sandstone several hundred feet below the rim, one can clearly observe the offset along the Bright Angel Fault. The displacement along this portion of the fault is about 200 feet (60 m), with the western side of the fault uplifted relative to the eastern side. However, this normal displacement along the Bright Angel Fault represents only the most recent chapter of its long history; like other major faults in Grand Canyon, the Bright Angel Fault traces its origin back to the formation of the proto-North American continent about 1.7 billion years ago. Since its initial formation, the Bright Angel Fault has been reactivated several times, sometimes as a normal fault (such as it is now) and sometimes as a reverse and/or strike-slip fault.<br />  </p>",

Ponderosa pine typically grows at higher altitudes than pinyon-juniper, where the weather is cooler and slightly wetter. The area around Grandview point is slightly higher than the areas east or west of it and even this slight difference in elevation is enough to increase the amount of precipitation the area gets and decrease the overall temperature. These tiny shifts in the environment are enough to impact the plant community in the area, causing the shift to the taller trees and needle covered forest floor. There is even a small grove of aspen trees near Grandview Point, the only ones found anywhere on the South Rim. The area affected is too small to create a totally different environment for the animals of the South Rim, but the forest around Grandview Point is a favorite spot for deer, elk, and mountain lions. If you're really lucky, you might even see one of the canyon's occasional transient black bears.<br /> <br /> If you keep your eyes peeled as you travel throughout the park, you'll notice many places where the topography of the canyon can mimic changes in altitude through variations in shade, temperature, and moisture, allowing plants to grow in places where one would not normally expect to find them. These micro-habitats are part of the reason that Grand Canyon is one of the most ecologically diverse national parks in the country.</p> </div> </div> </div>   <div class=\"panel panel-default collapsible-item\" id=\"Collapsible1633123080397\"> <div class=\"panel-heading collapsible-item-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1633123080397\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"panel-title collapsible-item-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1633123080397\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1633123080397\">History</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1633123080397\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse collapsible-item-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1633123080397\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"panel-body collapsible-item-body\">From the mid-1880s to the early 1900s, the area around Grandview Point was the epicenter for visitation and tourism at the South Rim. Mining interests (mainly copper) on Horseshoe Mesa, far below Grandview Point, generated even more interest in this area by 1892, spurring the initial improvement of the Grandview Trail. The Grandview Toll Trail to Horseshoe Mesa was completed in 1893, and by 1897, the rustic Grandview Hotel offered lodging to visitors that made the long, bumpy, dusty wagon road journey from Flagstaff. Tourism at Grandview changed dramatically in 1901 when the Santa Fe Railroad completed a spur rail line to the canyon rim from the town of Williams, followed by construction in 1910 of a fine rail station near El Tovar Hotel in the rapidly developing Grand Canyon Village, 13 miles (20.9 km) west of this location. The increased ease of travel offered by the railroad and the more modern services offered by the Sante Fe Railroad and Fred Harvey Companies lured visitors away from the more rustic accommodations and facilities at Grandview Point, and bit by bit, the tourism trade at Grandview slowly dwindled away.<br /> <br /> The Grandview Hotel closed in 1913 after the entire area was sold to California newspaper magnate William Randolf Hearst. Although Hearst long considered developing his own tourism enterprise at Grandview Point, that development never came to pass; he largely used the area as a family retreat, finally dismantling the Grandview Hotel in 1928-1929. Wooden beams from the Grandview Hotel now form the ceiling of the kiva room on the first floor of the Desert View Watchtower. The property was acquired by the National Park Service in 1941.</div> </div> </div>   <div class=\"panel panel-default collapsible-item\" id=\"Collapsible1633123080394\"> <div class=\"panel-heading collapsible-item-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1633123080394\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"panel-title collapsible-item-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1633123080394\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1633123080394\">Geology</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1633123080394\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse collapsible-item-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1633123080394\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"panel-body collapsible-item-body\">Looking to the east from Grandview Point provides a splendid view of one of Grand Canyon's most recognizable rock formations: the Sinking Ship. The rock layers of the Sinking Ship are noticeably dipping down to the north, making the entire formation look like a ship perched on the rim of the canyon that is about to sink down into its very depths. These folded, dipping rock layers are evidence of a dramatic geologic feature which passes directly below Grandview Point: the Grandview-Phantom Monocline. Monoclines are unusual step-like folds in layers of sedimentary rock, usually (though not always) formed in association with movement along faults; think of a carpet or rug draped over a set of stairs. Monoclines are a relatively common feature in Grand Canyon geology, largely thanks to the uplift of the Kaibab Plateau and movement along the canyon's many faults. The Grandview-Phantom Monocline formed as a result of the Laramide Orogeny, a tectonic event from about 70-40 million years ago that uplifted the Colorado Plateau and formed the modern Rocky Mountains.</div> </div> </div>",

Hikers should carry a map and have a detailed plan before entering Grand Canyon's backcountry.<br /> <br /> <b>No drinking water</b> is available on the trail to Horseshoe Mesa; <b>springs below the mesa are not reliable</b> . Consult with rangers at the Backcountry Information Center for the most recent updates on water availability below the rim.<br /> <br /> Allow extra hiking time; <b>trail conditions are more difficult than on the Bright Angel, South Kaibab, and Hermit Trails</b> .</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>The original Grandview Trail was developed to connect the rim with copper mines on Horseshoe Mesa. The well-built trail eventually provided access to more tourists than miners, as Grandview Point provided one of the best access routes into the canyon at that time. Relatively undamaged segments of the original miner trail remain in the upper portion of Grandview Trail, testifying to the engineering prowess of the builders as they devised creative solutions to the problems that the landscape presented.<br /> <br /> The trail descends to the right of the established Grandview Point overlook. The Kaibab/Toroweap section traverses steep slopes, and the old trail is eroded in places, so careful attention is critical. Vertical steps were placed by constructing log \"cribs\" that were chained or pinned to the cliff face to provide a foundation for the trail where nature provided none. The exposure along these sections impresses some hikers to the point of being considered hazardous. Unfortunately, several of the historic cribs were swept away by landslides during the winter of 2005. Trail crews restored the trail, but not the historical context of the old logs. A series of sloping ledges at the top of the Coconino Sandstone cliff demands caution, especially when icy or wet. Be careful throughout the Kaibab and Toroweap sections - a fall here could have catastrophic consequences.<br /> <br /> The original cobblestone \"riprap\" trail construction remains throughout most of the Coconino section. Large slabs of sandstone placed edgewise provided a durable and labor intensive walking surface. The trail comes to the top of a dramatic east-facing gully at the contact between the Coconino Sandstone and Hermit Shale (known locally as Coconino Saddle), which offers tantalizing views into the upper valley of Hance Creek. Steep cobblestone switchbacks below Coconino Saddle descend through the Hermit Shale to the Supai Formation, where the steepness of the trail lessens as it begins a more gradual traverse out into the canyon and down to Horseshoe Mesa.<br /> <br /> Along the trail, you might notice what appears to be trash or remnants of past mining operations, including rusty cans, nails, tools and structures. These objects are actually protected as archaeological resources. <strong>Please leave these objects as you found them, where you found them</strong>.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p><strong>For experienced desert hikers only. </strong>There are no maintained water sources along Grandview Trail. Seasonal springs below Horseshoe Mesa may offer water (which must be treated or filtered), but are not reliable.<br /> <br /> <strong>Coconino Saddle</strong><br /> <em>Recommended summer day hike</em>; <em>no signs present</em><br /> 2.2 miles (3.5 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,000 feet (305 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Horseshoe Mesa</strong><br /> <em>Please be respectful of campers</em><br /> 6.0 miles (9.6 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,500 feet (760 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Viewpoint</strong><br /> <em>This point is on the very northern edge of the western arm of Horseshoe Mesa.</em><br /> 7.6 miles (12.2 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,500 feet (760 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Page Spring</strong><br /> <em><strong>Water contains high arsenic levels</strong></em><br /> 7.4 miles (11.9 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 3,040 feet (925 m) elevation change</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A backcountry permit is required for <strong>ANY</strong> camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn more and apply <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">online </a> or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> Backpackers camping on Horseshoe Mesa (BF5) must camp in designated sites. Three (3) small group sites are located east of the standing masonry structure. The large group site is further north and east of the little butte that caps Horseshoe Mesa. Vault toilet facilities are located at both areas. <strong>Camping is not allowed in or near historic mines and structures</strong>. Camping in the Cottonwood (BG9) and Hance Creek (BE9) use areas is \"at-large\". All hikers should bring animal-proof food containers; mice and ravens are skilled at opening and looting packs or bags in this area.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p>Every year, this trail bears witness to accidents resulting in serious injury or death. <strong>Grandview Trail is steep, rarely maintained, and does not provide access to the Colorado River.</strong> It is not a recommended first hike into the canyon.<br /> <br /> Old decomposing mines are inherently unsafe. For your safety and the protection of local bat populations, all historic mines are closed to visitation. You may see artifacts scattered about-these are protected by federal antiquities laws.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Cave of the Domes is closed to protect roosting bats and other sensitive cave resources.</strong> Bats are particularly sensitive to human disturbance and will abandon roost sites. Permits are required to enter caves in Grand Canyon National Park due to the extremely sensitive nature of the cultural and natural resources inside. Contact the Backcountry Information Center for information.<br /> <br /> <strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia, </strong>a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Suggested Maps</h3> <p>7.5 Minute Cape Royal and Grandview Point Quads (USGS)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)</p> <p> </p>",

This established migration corridor and avian conservation zone stretches from the upper reaches of Canada's boreal forests into Central and South America.<br /> <br /> At least 19 species of raptors fly through the Grand Canyon including Sharp-shinned, Cooper's, Red-tailed, Swainson's, Broad-winged, and Ferruginous Hawks; Bald and Golden Eagles; Peregrine and Prairie Falcons; American Kestrel, Osprey, Northern Harrier, Merlin, Northern Goshawk, and California Condor.<br /> <br /> Almost 30 years ago, birders along the South Rim of Grand Canyon noticed these raptors migrating, prompting HawkWatch International (HWI) to set up an official monitoring site at Yaki Point, an overlook on Desert View Drive east of Grand Canyon Village.<br /> <br /> During migration, official counters from HWI are stationed at the site daily from 9 am to 4 pm to update raptor-migration tally boards between August 27th and October 30, each year.<br /> <br /> They welcome visitors to watch, count, and learn about raptor identification and ecology. There is no vehicle parking at Yaki Point, so, park at the visitor center and take the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/kaibab-orange-route.htm\">Eastbound Kaibab (ORANGE) Route shuttle</a> to Yaki Point. At Yaki Point, follow the hanging signs to the west, along the dirt footpath to the observation site. Buses come every 15 minutes during the time that Hawkwatch volunteers are staffing the site.  <br /> <br /> The narrow, unpaved trail leads across the rocky, uneven ground through a sparsely forested area with low desert scrub. The trail's width varies from a foot to three- to four-feet (1- to 1.2 m) wide along a gentle downward sloping surface. Caution is advised as you move along the trail across flat limestone rocks and smaller six- to eight-inch (15- to 20 cm) loose rocks strewn in the path. Note there are no railings or ropes on the platform to prevent accidental slips and falls on the loose footing, so exercise extreme caution when approaching the rim. The trail leads 200 feet (60 m) to a wide open flat-topped mesa, 15-feet (5 m) wide by 40-feet (12 m) long. <br /> <br /> The information collected by HWI is used to monitor long-term trends in raptor populations and identify the effects of the environment and humans on these high-flying inhabitants of the sky. Although not officially monitored by HWI, Lipan Point, about 13 miles farther east on Desert View Drive, is also a good spot for watching these fall migrants wing their way to warmer climates. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://hawkwatch.org/migration-network/grand-canyon/\">Learn More > </a><br />  </p>",

        "notes": "Hermit Trail Grand Canyon\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/hermit-trail.htm\n\n<p>Louis D. Boucher, the \"hermit\" of Hermit Creek basin, lived in this area for 20 years. Boucher built the Boucher Trail (west of the Hermit Trail) and seasonal residences at Dripping Springs and near Boucher Creek. Though socially active in the South Rim community, residents labeled Boucher a hermit because he lived alone.<br /> <br /> The modern trailhead is located just west of Hermits Rest. Follow the dirt road from the restrooms to make your way to the trailhead. <strong>There is no parking for day hikers at this trailhead when the Hermit (Red) Route shuttle is active; day hikers must ride the free shuttle bus to reach the trailhead.</strong><br /> <br /> <b>For experienced desert hikers only.</b><br /> <br /> <b>Water from springs must be purified.</b><br /> <br /> Allow extra hiking time; <b>conditions are more difficult than on the Bright Angel and South Kaibab Trails</b>.</p> <h3>Trail Desciption</h3>   <p>The upper section of the Hermit Trail is quite steep, dropping almost 2,000 vertical feet (610 m) in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). Passage through the Kaibab Formation and Coconino Sandstone is via well-defined switchbacks. Most of the Hermit Trail was originally surfaced with large hand-fitted rock slabs that created a smooth walking surface. Ongoing erosion has claimed much of this remarkably labor-intensive paving, but a few isolated fragments survive, especially in the Coconino Sandstone. Fossilized animal tracks have been noted in many locations throughout the canyon, but they were first studied in detail along the Hermit Trail. Observant hikers can see a few of these fossilized lizard-like tracks in the lower half of the Coconino Sandstone.<br /> <br /> The trail enters Waldron Basin, a quiet, isolated pocket within the Hermit side canyon, at 1.2 miles (1.9 km). The Waldron Trail junction is encountered soon after at 1.5 miles (2.4 km), followed by the Dripping Springs Trail junction at 1.75 miles (2.8 km). To continue on the Hermit Trail, stay right at both junctions. Dripping Springs, however, does make an excellent day hike destination. After the Dripping Springs trail junction, the Hermit Trail drops down along the east side of Hermit Creek gorge. Santa Maria Spring is reached at 2.5 miles (4 km) along the trail, offering a trickle of water and a historic masonry rest house which provides welcome shade during the summer.<br /> <br /> Continuing on the Hermit Trail past this point is generally not recommended for a day hike during the summer. During cooler months, Lookout Point, an additional 1.5 miles (2.4 km) down the trail from Santa Maria Spring, is also a reasonable single-day option for those seeking a longer hike. Between Santa Maria Spring and the top of the Redwall Limestone at Cathedral Stairs, the Hermit Trail is characterized by long traverses through the Supai Formation. This section of the trail is tucked up against the west facing walls of the south rim and offers hikers a period of extended shade during the hotter months.<br /> <br /> At Cathedral Stairs, the descent becomes unrelenting. An endless series of rocky switchbacks eventually leads hikers through the Redwall cliff and down the west-facing talus below Cope Butte to the intersection with the Tonto Trail. The Tonto Trail is an important Inner Canyon route that allows access in both directions along the Tonto Platform, east to Monument Creek, west to Hermit Creek. Turn left (west) and follow the Tonto Trail about a mile to the Hermit Creek campsite. Be sure to walk downstream a short distance during your stay at Hermit Creek, or even descend all the way to the Colorado River at Hermit Rapid.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p><strong>For experienced desert hikers only.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Waldron Basin</strong><br /> 3 miles (4.8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,240 feet (378 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Dripping Spring Trail Junction</strong><br /> 3.6 miles (5.8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3-4 hours / 1370 feet (418 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Santa Maria Spring</strong><br /> 5 miles (8 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 1,680 feet (512 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Dripping Spring</strong> (via the Dripping Spring Trail)<br /> 7 miles (11.2 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 5-7 hours / 1040 feet (317 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Breezy Point</strong><br /> 11 miles (17.7 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 2,220 feet (677 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Tonto Trail Junction</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to Tonto Trail Junction and back in a day.</em></strong><br /> 14 miles (22.5 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3,430 feet (1,045 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Hermit Creek</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to Hermit Creek and back in a day. </em><em>Water requires purification.</em></strong><br /> 16.4 miles (26.4 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 3,740 feet (1,140 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Colorado River / Hermit Rapids</strong><br /> <strong><em>Not recommended to hike to the Colorado River and back in a day.</em></strong><br /> 19.4 miles (31.2 km) <strong>round trip</strong> / 4.340 feet (1,323 m) elevation change</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>A spring-fed water station is available near the vault toilets along the gravel road that leads to the Hermit Trail parking area. Santa Maria Spring, 2.5 miles (4.0 km) down the trail, offers year-round spring water. Dripping Springs, 7 miles (11.3 km) down the trail (via the Dripping Springs side trail), also offers year-round spring water. Hermit Creek is a perennial water source for those descending down the trail for a stay at the backcountry campsites there. Water from any natural sources in Grand Canyon, including springs, creeks, and the Colorado River, must be purified before drinking.</p> <h3>Access</h3> <p>From March 1st to November 30th, access to the Hermit Road is restricted to shuttle buses only. However, backpackers with a valid backcountry permit for the Hermit or Boucher Trails are allowed access by personal vehicle during this time. To gain access to the Hermit Road, please enter the numerical code provided by the Backcountry Information Center. Drive eight miles (12.9 km) west along Hermit Road to Hermits Rest then continue on the dirt road 0.25 miles (0.4 km) to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> From December 1st through the end of February, the Hermit Road is open to all traffic. The park shuttle buses do not operate along the Hermit Road during this time.</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A backcountry permit is required for <strong>any</strong> camping below the rim of Grand Canyon. Learn about how to apply for a permit on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">website </a> or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> The only legal places to camp in the Hermit Creek drainage are the designated campsites at Hermit Creek (BM7, toilet on site) and Hermit Rapids (BM8, no toilet). A sign with a prominent \"L\" marks the large group site near the toilet at BM7. Large groups of 7-11 people must use this site. At-large camping is not permitted along the Hermit Trail.</p> <h3>Suggested Maps</h3> <p>7.5 Minute Grand Canyon Quad (USGS)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C).

The Hermit Creek basin was the scene of one of the most aggressive of these improvement efforts. Initiated by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1911, this program involved development of the rim and also included the construction of what was, at the time, a state-of-the-art rim-to-river trail.<br /> <br /> The Hermit Trail was built to serve a luxury campsite near Hermit Creek. Hermit Camp predated Phantom Ranch by 10 years and in its heyday was complete with a tramway from the rim, a functional automobile for transportation within the facility, and a Fred Harvey Company chef. Operations ceased in 1930, but for two decades Hermit Camp was the last word in gracious tourism below the rim. As is always the case at Grand Canyon, time and erosion have taken a heavy toll. The old Hermit Trail is today a mere shadow of its former self, but for experienced and knowledgeable canyon backpackers, the walk offers a direct link to the excitement and romance of the early days at Grand Canyon.</p>",

Built as a rest area at the end of scenic Hermit Road (also constructed by Fred Harvey), Hermits Rest was also the last bastion of civilization for those visitors preparing to descend down into Grand Canyon on Hermit Trail.<br /> <br /> Horse-drawn carriages, and later automobiles, operated by Fred Harvey, carried visitors on scenic tours along the Hermit Road, dropping them off here for a respite before the return trip to Grand Canyon Village. The distinctive style of this structure is unique and skillfully crafted out of native materials that blend in with the natural environment.<br /> <br /> Today, this location is frequented by hikers, travelers, and history enthusiasts that arrive by foot, bicycle, the Hermit Road (Red) Route shuttle bus, and, during the months of December through February, personal vehicles.</p>",

Shaped and built like a Hopi pueblo, Hopi House was originally designed to house the main sales rooms for Fred Harvey Indian Arts. Mary Colter designed the building to resemble a Hopi dwelling similar to those at Oraibi, Arizona. In its early years, Hopi House was an actual dwelling-some of the Hopis who worked in the building lived on the upper floors.<br /> <br /> Hopi House is rectangular and its multiple roofs are stepped at various levels, giving the impression of Puebloan architecture. The sandstone walls are reddish in color, and tiny windows, like those of true Hopi structures, allow only the smallest amount of light into the building.<br /> <br /> Inside, the floor finish on the first story is concrete. Most of the rooms have a ceiling typical of the Hopi style: saplings, grasses, and twigs with a mud coating on top, resting on peeled log beams. Corner fireplaces, small niches in the walls, and a mud-plaster wall finish, typical of Hopi interiors, are also character-defining features.</p> <p> </p>",

By October 1902, he had persuaded his brother Emery to join him. A year later, the brothers established their photography business near Bright Angel Trailhead after receiving permission from Ralph Cameron, who at the time owned Bright Angel Trail. They camped out in a small tent on the canyon rim before building a small wooden house in 1906, which they called Kolb Studio.<br /> <br /> Over the next 12 years, the Kolb brothers established themselves as both photographers and adventurers. From capturing unorthodox photos of hard-to-reach areas of the canyon to documenting their 101 days running the Colorado River on film with a motion-picture camera, Ellsworth and Emery revealed images that few had dreamed of. Selling their images in leather-bound books for three dollars each and touring the country to present their film lecture series, the Kolb brothers made a name for themselves and opened the eyes of a nation to this wonder of the world.<br /> <br /> For decades, the Kolb brothers continued to make a living out of Kolb Studio on Grand Canyon's South Rim. Later in life, when their contractual agreements with the park ended, the National Park Service actually wanted to demolish this studio in the 1960s. The architecture wasn't quite in line with the style and theme of other buildings in the park. After several years of quibbling between Emery and the agency, the structure was saved when Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966, legislation that effectively protected park structures over 50 years old from being destroyed.</p>",

This makes it an ideal spot to enjoy sunrise, sunset, and the night sky.<br /> <br /> On a clear day, you can see the Vermillion Cliffs 45 miles (72 km) to the northeast and the curving river to the west as it enters the Inner Gorge of the canyon.<br /> <br /> This spacious panoramic view features many spires, buttes, and temple formations that resemble ancient pyramids. Westward views seem to stretch on forever, and the canyon walls present a tapestry of blacks, grays, reds, browns, and tans in a wide variety of rough and smooth textures.<br /> <br /> From here, you can look down to the very bottom of the canyon to view the mighty Colorado River and the tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup. These unique rocks are exposed in just a few places within the canyon, and are visible at only a few viewpoints. Hidden among the titled layers and cradled by the river is Unkar Delta, where ancient Puebloan people once cultivated beans, corn, and squash.<br /> <br /> Listen for the roar of Hance Rapid, almost four miles (6.4 km) away, and for the cries of hawks and other raptors along this important migration route. Forests on this side of the canyon and on the North Rim, just eight miles (13 km) away, make Lipan Point an ideal spot for birds crossing the canyon.<br />  </p> <h4>Geology in Depth: Grand Canyon Supergroup</h4> <p>The tilted strata visible deep within Grand Canyon at this viewpoint are part of a series of rock layers known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. From here, look across the canyon to see them in the walls of the North Rim. The lower half of the Supergroup, known as the Unkar Group (1255-1100 million years old), was deposited by north-flowing paleorivers carrying sand and mud from now-eroded mountains in what is now the region of West Texas. The upper half of the Supergroup (which is not visible from here) is known as the Chuar Group (780-729 million years old), which was deposited in a shallow sea while all of Earths' continents were joined together as the supercontinent Rodinia. Stromatolites in both groups record single celled life that existed in shallow seas. Chuaria fossils, also found within these layers, are small 750-million-year-old single-celled fossils that record a time of diversification of microbial life.<br /> <br /> In this part of the canyon, instead of being confined by the hard Vishnu basement rocks within the narrow Inner Gorge to the west, the Colorado River instead winds its way through layers of soft, purple sandstone belonging to the Dox Formation. This is why Lipan Point features such spectacular views of the river. Above these purple layers is the black Cardenas Basalt, formed by lava flows erupting due to continental collisions during the formation of the supercontinent Rodinia over one billion years ago. To the west, one can see another stretch of river cutting down through layers of purple, orange, and brown rocks; these are the Bass Formation, Hakatai Shale, and Shinumo Sandstone, respectively. One can also see where the river crosses from these layers into the unlayered black and pink Vishnu basement rocks underneath to begin forming the Inner Gorge.</p>",

Generally rectangular in plan, the small building is constructed of coursed rubble masonry.<br /> <br /> Commissioned to directly compete with the Kolb brothers and Kolb Studio, Mary Colter designed Lookout Studio in a similar manner as Hopi House: to imitate the stone dwellings of the Pueblo Indians of the southwest. Inspired by the natural forms of the landscape around the site, she used these influences to guide her design.<br /> <br /> The parapet rooflines and stone chimneys mimic the irregular shapes of surrounding bedrock. The interior of the building is divided into several levels, with structural log work exposed in posts, beams, and ceiling joists. The floor is scored concrete and the interior walls are exposed stone. Because of all of the viewing windows around the walls of the structure (which naturally feature Colter's trademark baby blue window frames), the interior is considerably lighter than most of Colter's other buildings.</p>",

The view from Maricopa encompasses over 180 degrees of Grand Canyon, with no significant obstructions between here and the canyon's depths. Several miles of the Tonto Trail are visible below and sharp eyes will spot the first tiny view of the Colorado River along the Hermit Road. <br /> <br /> Glancing back toward the canyon rim between Maricopa Point and the next viewpoint at Powell reveals a relic of Grand Canyon's past. A large gate and clearing on the rim are all that remain of the Orphan Mine and its brief hotel operations. Looking west and down into the immediate left of the viewpoint reveals derelict mining equipment, cable line and supports, and a large man-made hole in the side of the canyon.</p> <h4>History</h4> <p>Maricopa Point is named for the Maricopa Indians who lived in south-central Arizona. They lived with the Pima Indians and were noted for their friendly approach to white pioneers. As you walk out onto this stunning vista, exhibit panels reveal the controversial mining history in the canyon from a spectacular viewpoint.<br /> <br /> The nearby Orphan Lode Mine started as a copper mine in 1891 and then produced rich uranium ore until 1967. Be sure to stay on the trail, as \"hot spots\" from mined uranium ores still remain!<br /> <br /> The National Park Service is restoring this mine site.</p>",

Rather than having to travel by train or carriage, people could journey in their own automobiles.<br /> <br /> In the 1940s, 36 cabins were added and 22 cabins were moved from Bright Angel Lodge.

A short walk from the Grand Canyon Visitor Center and parking lots 1-4, Mather Point offers an expansive view of the canyon. On a clear day you can see 30+ miles (48 km) to the east and 60+ miles (96 km) to the west. Looking down into the canyon you can see a few small samples of the Colorado River, Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the canyon, and numerous trails crisscrossing the landscape.<br /> <strong>There is no parking directly at Mather Point, but the parking lots around Grand Canyon Visitor Center are a short walk away and the free Kaibab/Rim Route (orange) shuttle bus makes a stop here as well.</strong><br /> <br /> Thanks to it's wide view and the dramatic formations visible from the area, Mather Point is a popular place for both Sunrise and Sunset throughout the year. Be sure to get here early to enjoy the change in colors as the sun rises and sets.  </p> <h4>What's in a Name?</h4> <p>This viewpoint is named for Stephen Tyng Mather, the first director of the National Park Service. A wealthy businessman from Chicago, Mather was avid conservationist and supporter of public lands, who moved to Washington D.C. in 1915 to help found the National Park Service. Appointed its first director in 1917 he continued to promote park access, development, and use until he left office in 1929. He believed that magnificent scenery should be the first criterion in establishing a national park, and made efforts to have new parks established before the lands were developed for other purposes. Mather always wished to have the parks supported by avid users, who would then communicate their support to their elected representatives. During his tenure the Park Service grew to include sites such as Grand Canyon, Shenandoah, Great Smoky Mountains, Mammoth Cave National Parks, and many others.<br /> <br /> He laid the foundation of the National Park Service, defining and establishing the policies under which its areas shall be developed and conserved unimpaired for future generations. There will never come an end to the good that he has done.</p>",

His work helped to create many national parks. Explore this point for a good spot to watch the shadows and changing light throughout the day, just as the artist did.</p> <h3>Thomas Moran</h3> <p>In 1873, Hudson River School artist Thomas Moran joined John Wesley Powell on his exploratory expeditions of Grand Canyon and the Colorado Plateau. Shortly after his return, Moran set to work on a canvas equal in size and ambition to his earlier 1872 painting from Yellowstone National Park, \"The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone\". In 1874, Congress purchased the result, \"The Chasm of the Colorado\" (1873-1874, National Museum of American Art) for $10,000. It became the second of Moran's western landscapes to hang in the United States Capitol, and is now part of the Smithsonian Institution, residing primarily at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.</p> <h3>Geology in Depth: Grand Canyon Supergroup</h3> <p>Geology is a prominent feature at any Grand Canyon viewpoint, but especially so at Moran Point. From here, all three main rock groups of Grand Canyon are clearly visible.<br /> <br /> The horizontal sedimentary layers of rock that make up the majority of what we see in Grand Canyon's depths are known as the Layered Paleozoic Rocks. Beneath these relatively flat-lying layers are the tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup, which represent a significant portion of the canyon's geologic record even though they are only exposed in a few isolated sections of the canyon. These tilted layers are only visible from a few select viewpoints along the rim, including here at Moran Point. The black Vishnu Schist and pink Zoroaster Granite, as well as a few other associated metamorphic and igneous rocks are collectively known as the Vishnu basement rocks. These are the oldest rocks in the canyon, and thus are found far below near the Colorado River, beneath the over-lying sedimentary layers.<br /> <br /> The tilted strata visible deep within Grand Canyon at this viewpoint are part of a series of rock layers known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. From here, look across the canyon to see them in the walls of the North Rim. The lower half of the Supergroup, known as the Unkar Group (1255-1100 million years old), was deposited by north-flowing paleorivers carrying sand and mud from now-eroded mountains in what is now the region of West Texas. The upper half of the Supergroup (which is not visible from here) is known as the Chuar Group (780-729 million years old), which was deposited in a shallow sea while all of Earths' continents were joined together as the supercontinent Rodinia. Stromatolites in both groups record single celled life that existed in shallow seas. Chuaria fossils, also found within these layers, are small 750-million-year-old single-celled fossils that record a time of diversification of microbial life.<br /> <br /> From Moran Point, one can observe prominent tilted layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup directly to the north, sitting on the unlayered black and pink Vishnu basement rocks to the west. The short segment of the Colorado River visible here is cutting through a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, with tall cliffs of brown Shinumo Sandstone above. These vibrant orange layers of rock can also be seen on this side of the river, directly below the viewpoint to the northwest. Beyond these layers, on the far side of the canyon, one can observe four distinct layers of rock sitting on the Vishnu basement rocks. In order, these are a sill of black Cardenas Basalt, purple layers of Bass Formation, a slope of orange Hakatai Shale, and brown cliffs of Shinumo Sandstone.</p>",

Visitors traveling to the canyon via horse-drawn coach, could also stable their horses here. <br /> <br /> In the 1920's, as horse-drawn tours were discontinued, mules that carried visitors to the bottom of Grand Canyon.were moved from the adjacent barn across the road (the original mule barn), to this building, in order to accommodate a growing number of mules.<br /> <br /> The adjacent barn is presently used for Xanterra's carpenter shop and storage.</p>",

Beginning 1,000 feet (305 m) higher than South Rim trails, hikers can glimpse the vast expanse of Bright Angel Canyon through fir trees, aspen, ferns and wildflowers.<br /> <br /> Built throughout the 1920s to match the quality and grade of the South Kaibab Trail, the present-day North Kaibab Trail replaced an older route infamous for crossing Bright Angel Creek 94 times (the present-day trail crosses only 6 times). Though masterfully constructed and maintained, North Kaibab Trail is challenging for day hikers as well as rim-to-rim hikers.</span></p> <h3>Day Hike Turnaround Points</h3> <p><strong>North Kaibab Trailhead</strong> (8,241 feet / 2,510 m)<br /> Be sure to pick up a map before hiking.<br /> <br /> <strong>Coconino Overlook</strong> (7,450 feet / 2,270 m)<br /> 1.4 miles (2.3 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 1-2 hours / 790 vertical feet (241 m)<br /> <br /> <strong>Supai Tunnel </strong>(6,840 feet / 2,085 m)<br /> 4.0 miles (6.4 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1400 vertical feet (425 m)<br /> <br /> <strong>Redwall Bridge</strong> (6,040 feet / 1,840 m)<br /> 5.2 miles (8.4 km)<strong> roundtrip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 2200 vertical feet (670 m)<br /> <br /> Check with a park ranger before attempting to hike past Redwall Bridge and back in one day.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>Water stations are available at North Kaibab trailhead and North Rim Backcountry Information Center. Potable water may also be available at Supai Tunnel, Manzanita Rest House and Cottonwood Campground. Water is NOT available at Roaring Springs. Never fully rely on these water stations, as pipeline breaks and freezing weather impact them. Always carry a way to treat water from the creek in case water stations are not functioning.<br /> <br /> Prior to beginning your hike, check the Visitor Center or Backcountry Information Center for water status updates.</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p>After an initial steep descent down the head of a side canyon via a series of numerous switchbacks through lush greenery and impressive views below the trailhead, the trail approaches the distinctive Supai Tunnel. Here hikers will find potable water (mid-May to mid-October) and pit toilets. No emergency phone is available.<br /> <br /> Switchbacks continue to the massive cliffs of Redwall Limestone, where for long stretches the trail has been blasted out of the cliff. The Redwall section is awe-inspiring in every way; fantastic exposure and views contrast with the engineering marvel of providing access to this location.<br /> <br /> From Redwall Bridge, the bulk of the trail's descent meets the flatter bottom of Bright Angel Canyon and Roaring Springs. Here, water gushes forth directly out of the cliffs, cascading over moss and fern to form Bright Angel Creek (which will be a constant companion all the way to the Colorado River). This giant spring provides drinking water for every visitor and resident within Grand Canyon National Park. The water is delivered to the South Rim via a pipeline buried beneath the North Kaibab Trail (installed 1965 - 1970). You can see this amazing pipeline as it stretches across the Colorado River on the underside of the Silver Bridge from Bright Angel Trail.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Please consider seasonal variations in trail conditions. </strong><br /> <br /> During winter months, the upper section of North Kaibab trail can be ice-covered and snowbound. North Rim hikers must be prepared for extreme winter conditions with extra food, clothing layers, and tractions devices.<br /> <br /> During hotter months (May - September), it is critical that hikers begin their hike well before dawn or after 3 p.m. Success and enjoyment depends on the amount of time spent planning ahead and preparing for all conditions. Success in the summer can be as simple as staying off the trail and out of the sun between 10 am-4 pm. Hiking the entire North Kaibab Trail in a single day is not recommended, particularly in summer, as it would be extremely difficult to avoid hiking in the heat of the day.<br /> <br /> <strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your itinerary with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes **hyponatremia **-a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Mules & Hikers</h3> <p><strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br /> <strong>Always give mules the right of way.</strong><br /> Encounters between hikers and mules have resulted in injuries to packers and the death to mules. To ensure safety for yourself, other trail users, mules, and mule riders, follow these steps when encountering mules on the trails:</p> <ol> <li>Step off the trail on the uphill side-away from the edge.</li> <li>Listen for and follow the direction of the wrangler.</li> <li>Remain completely quiet and stand perfectly still.</li> <li>Only return to the trail when the last mule is 50 feet (15 m) beyond your position.</li> </ol> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for camping in this area. Learn more and apply <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">online </a> or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> At-large camping is not permitted on the North Kaibab Trail; camp only in designated campgrounds.</p> <h3>Maps</h3> <p>Hiking Into Grand Canyon (NPS, free)<br /> 7.5 Minute Quad, Phantom Ranch (USGS)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)</p>",

Right after passing through the first, or upper tunnel, pause and look above the sloping cliff on your left. Far above, you can see pictographs painted in red onto a band of rock beneath an overhanging ledge. <br /> <br /> These deer pictographs were left by ancestral canyon occupants to mark their path down into this side canyon. A variety of additional symbols and images can be seen through a pair of binoculars. The site, known as Mallery's Grotto, dates between 4000 years ago (2000 BCE) and 1950.<br /> <br /> It contains Archaic period elements and Cohonina culture elements. Historic charcoal inscriptions are attributed to the Havasupai. This route into the canyon was used by the Havasupai people who lived and farmed at Havasupai Gradens (formerly know as Indian Garden), down in the relatively flat riparian area, you can see 3000 feet (914 m) below the canyon rim. When Grand Canyon National Park was established, they were no longer permitted to live there.  <br /> <br /> The location was given the name, Mallery Grotto, after Garrick Mallery (1831-1894), an authority on the pictographs of the North American Indians. Mallery worked for the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology.<br /> <br /> <b>Please help us protect this site by staying on the trail and enjoying it from afar. </b></p>",

From there, connections are possible to the Nankoweap Trail and Kaibab National Forest.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, leave your plan with someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing: proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>—a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p>",

This is a great viewpoint with stunning vistas for sunset and sunrise. A two-way shuttle bus stop makes visiting here easy and a nice quick option for those limited on time.</p> <h3>What's in a name?</h3> <p>The story of Grand Canyon as we know it is tied directly to John Wesley Powell. As a geologist Powell grew interested in exploring the unknown canyons of the Green and Colorado rivers. He studied reports from earlier expeditions, but in the late 1800s there wasn't much to go on and most of what was available was inaccurate and jaded by the perceptions of early explorers. Gathering support and supplies from the Smithsonian Institution, railroads, educational institutions, and Congress for his expedition down the Green River. He designed his own boats and gathered a makeshift crew of ex-trappers, mountain men, and Civil War veterans like himself. The expedition launched four boats from Green River, Wyoming in May 24, 1869 to explore the course of the river, fill in the blank spots that littered maps of the southwest, and to gather scientific data.<br /> <br /> After three summer months spent exploring the upper canyons of the Colorado River, the expedition passed the Paria River on August 4 hungry, exhuasted both mentally and physically, and with only musty apples, spoiled bacon, wet flour, and coffee remaining to sustain them they entered the last and greatest of the canyons. The scientific expedition had turned into a fight for their very survival as they entered into Grand Canyon. Powell referred to Grand Canyon as “<em>our granite prison</em>” and described an almost unbroken series of rapids that the expedition ran, lined, or portaged, praying all the while for an end to the ordeal. On August 28, the canyon ended and the river became relatively quiet once again. They had survived, and in doing so became the first recorded people to successfully navigate from Green River, Wyoming to the Black Canyon of Arizona/Neveda.<br /> <br /> After a near disatrous first trip that cost Powell’s most of his notes and scientific data, a few boats, and multiple men, he secured full federal funding to a second trip. Powell gathered a new crew, this time including amateur scientists and educated men, and he began a second expedition on May 22, 1871. Between his two trips down the river Powell gathered invaulable information and data and literally helped to put Grand Canyon on a map. Further studies in the area over the next few years, by both Powell and his peers in the geologic community, helped to lay the foundation of how we understand Grand Canyon geology today. </p>",

        "notes": "Rim Trail - Mather Point\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/rim-trail-mather-point.htm\n\n<p>The Rim Trail is a mostly paved path that stretches roughly 13 miles (21 km) along the southern rim of Grand Canyon from South Kaibab Trailhead in the east to Hermits Rest in the west. Most people won't hike the whole trail in one go, but walking short sections of the rim can provide an excellent chance to stretch the legs after a long car ride, take a break from riding the shuttle, or to get away from a busy viewpoint for a moment. No matter how much of it you walk, you'll get lots of good views along the way!<br /> <br /> <strong>One-way Distances from Mather Point along the Rim Trail.</strong><br /> <br /> South Kaibab Trail - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Yavapai Geology Museum - 0.7 miles (1 km)<br /> Verkamp's Visitor Center - 2.2 miles (3.5 km)<br /> Bright Angel Trailhead - 2.5 miles (4 km)<br /> Hermits Rest - 11 miles (18 km)</p> <h2>Popular Sections</h2> <h4>Mather Point to Yavapai Geology Museum</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 0.7 mi (1 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong>: </span>15–30 minutes<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade. <br /> <br /> This short section of the trail is one of the most popular as it is easily accessible from both Mather and Yavapai Points and it offers constant views of Grand Canyon, as well as Phantom Ranch and a glimpse of the Colorado River far below. Even walking part of this section guarentees some great Grand Canyon vistas. <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Kaibab/Rim (Orange) Route shuttle bus is running to Mather Point and the Yavapai Geology Museum it links the two ends of this section for an easy one-way hike.  </p> <h4>Mather Point to Grand Canyon Historic Village</h4> <p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Length</strong></span>: 2.5 mi (4 km) one way<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Time</strong></span>: 45 minutes to 2 hours<br /> <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><strong>Accessibbility</strong></span>: Paved, short sections of grade. (It is largely downhill heading east to west from Mather to the Village)<br /> <br /> This 2.5 mile stretch of the Rim Trail includes the section above, and expands it west to include the trail to/from the historic village. While you can walk this section in under an hour it is recommended to plan for a longer trip as you'll want to take your time to appreciate all the good views, snag a few pictures, and experience the Trail of Time, which overlaps this section of the rim. The 2 mile (3.5 km) section between Yavapai Geology Museum and the Grand Canyon Historic Village can be hot and sunny in the summer time so be sure to take water, snacks, and sun protection. Water and restrooms are available at the Geology Museum, Grand Canyon Visitor and at multiple spots in the village. This section of the trail is quite popular as well, but offers more opportunities for solitude and quiet moments along the canyon's edge. <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Village (Blue) Route shuttle bus is running transportation will run between the Grand Canyon Visitor Center and the Village to help complete a one-way loop. </p> <h4>Grand Canyon Historic Village to Hermits Rest</h4> <p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Length</span>: </strong>7 mi (11 km) one way<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Time:</span> </strong>3+ hours<br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">Accessibility:</span> </strong>The section between Monuement Creek Vista and Pima Point is paved and accessible, but the rest of the Rim Trail along the Hermit Road is <strong>NOT</strong> accessible. The rest of the trail is a mix of dirt and paved paths with the paved sections including steep grades and steps. <br /> <br /> The views along this section of the Rim Trail offer some of the best views of the Colorado River along the Hermit Road and can help get you away from the crowds at the major viewpoints along the way. There is limited water and restrooms availability along the Hermit Road so be prepared for longer hikes. Most hikers will use the shuttle system to jump along the road to do shorter sections of the trail and to return to the beginning of the scenic road. <i>Most</i> of the stops are about 1 mile from each other, though a few are longer, check your <strong>Pocket Map</strong> for a break down of the Rim Trail from point to point.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Hermit Rest (Red) Route shuttle bus is running it will stop at each of the major viewpoints and access points along the Rim Trail through this section. </p> <h4><span style=\"color:#cc0000;\">Safety - Hike Smart</span></h4> <p>- Take water, snacks, and sun protection with you on your hike. At 7,000 ft (2000 m) in elevation even a hike on the rim can leave you dehydrated, tired, and sun burnt. <br /> - Stay on designated trails and walkways and always keep a safe distance of at least six feet (2 m) from the edge of the canyon rim.<br /> - In areas where there is a railing or fence, do not climb over the barrier.<br /> - Know where the edge is. Watch foot placement and look for trip hazards.<br /> - Never throw rocks, coins, trash, or anything else over the edge.<br /> - Early summer temperatures can be HOT. Highs will often reach the low to mid 90s <sup>o</sup>F (...<sup>o</sup>C) and even the canyon rim can reach temperatures above 100<sup>o</sup>F (38<sup>o</sup>C). Check the weather and be prepared.<br /> - The late summer season brings rain and thunderstorms to Grand Canyon. Remember, \"If it roars, Go indoors\". Lightning can and often does strike the edge of the canyon as thunderstorms pass over the area. </p>",

To the left of a rock bearing the Theodore Roosevelt plaque, a short trail leads through overgrowth to an overlook. Here, a USGS medallion marks the end of the trail.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>A staunch conservationist, avid outdoorsman and hunter, Theodore Roosevelt cared about natural resources with a burning passion. He is also said to have rode a mule down the Bright Angel Trail in 1903 to tell the Havasupai people they had to leave their home, now Indian Garden, to create a National Park.<br /> <br /> During his first visit to Grand Canyon in May 1903, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed, \"Leave it as it is. You cannot improve upon it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it.\"<br /> <br /> On June 8, 1906, Roosevelt signed into legislation the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm\">Antiquities Act</a> , which enabled the President \"...to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments..\"<br /> <br /> On January 11, 1908, Roosevelt officially recognized the significance of Grand Canyon by using this same order to proclaim it a national monument. In 1919, three years after the creation of the National Park Service in 1916, it was officially designated as a national park.<br /> <br /> In his time as President of the United States, â€˜Teddy' used his authority to protect wildlife and public lands in unprecedented fashion. He created the United States Forest Service (USFS) in 1905 and established 150 national forests. In addition, Roosevelt also authorized the creation of 51 federal bird reserves, 4 national game preserves, 5 national parks, and 18 national monuments under the Antiquities Act. In total, Theodore Roosevelt protected approximately 230 million acres of public land.<br /> <br /> Today, the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, both positive and negative, is found across the country. There are six national park sites dedicated, in part or whole, to our conservationist president. You can find more information about these places, including North Dakota's Theodore Roosevelt National Park, under these <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-related-web-sites.htm\">related websites</a> .</p>",

However, the 40th Annual <a href=\"https://grandcanyonmusicfest.org/concerts/\">Grand Canyon Music Festival</a> took place here during the month of September, 2023. <br /> <br /> During the cooler months, before the pandemic, evening programs by park interpretive rangers were held inside Shrine of the Ages; providing opportunities to learn about a variety of Grand Canyon's resources. Topics included geology, human history, wildlife, the night sky, water resources, rock art, canyon hiking, and more.<br /> <br /> Special events, such as concerts, symposia or demonstrations, sometimes took the place of a ranger programs. Activities included: guest speakers, visiting artists, musicians, or even students from Grand Canyon School who presented their own programs to the community and park visitors.</p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/religious-services.htm\">Religious Services</a></h3> <p>Religious services are offered in Shrine if the Ages Auditorium, and the surrounding community. Current schedules are posted at <strong>Mather Campground</strong> (near the check-in station), <strong>Shrine of the Ages</strong> , the information kiosk near the <strong>post office</strong> , <strong>Grand Canyon Visitor Center</strong> , and <strong>Verkamp's Visitor Center</strong> .</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Although the idea for an interfaith chapel at Grand Canyon was proposed as early as 1917, it was not until 1952 that the Shrine of the Ages Chapel Corporation was formed, plans drawn up, and fundraising started. Representatives from Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant services comprised the Corporation. The National Park Service approved it because it offered the opportunity for all religious faiths to have a place of worship. The idea was to build a permanent building near a site on the canyon rim already used for services, including a very popular Easter Sunrise service.<br /> <br /> Harold E. Wagoner, a member of the board of directors of the Church Architectural Guild of America, was selected as architect. Working within National Park Service guidelines to respect the natural environment and American Indian culture, he designed a structure that reflected the architectural style of a kiva, a place of worship used by native people in the Southwest. This design worked well since the National Park Service also required that no towers or specific religious symbols be used.<br /> <br /> Because the initial building site was on the rim of the canyon just west of today's Hermits Rest Route (red) shuttle stop, plans called for the main auditorium to have a sweeping canyon view from a multi-story, curved window placed behind the altar. A special hydraulic lift would raise and lower at least three different altar configurations for Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant services. An organ placed on a small balcony, with wind chests and pipes located at different sections of the main chapel, would provide stereophonic sound effects.<br /> <br /> Even as fundraising efforts reached around the world, questions about whether the rim was an appropriate location for the structure resulted in delays. Some even argued that the building only remotely resembled a kiva, instead looking more like a huge spacecraft perched on the canyon rim. Donations were never quite enough to realize Wagoner's plans, and federal funding became involved. The building was ultimately redesigned and relocated away from the edge of the canyon. An appropriate site was chosen next to the existing Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery, and Shrine of the Ages was completed by 1970.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service took over ownership of the building in 1975, along with all maintenance, operational, and administrative duties.</p> <h3>Evening Programs</h3> <p>Before the pandemic, evening programs were usually held at Shine of the Ages at 7:30 pm each night. When you are visiting the park, you can ask at the visitor center to see if programs are being offered during your stay. Program and event schedules are also posted on sandwichboard signs around the village. </p>",

During winter months, the <strong>first bus leaves the Visitor Center at 8 am, and the last bus is at 6 pm.</strong>  <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/kaibab-orange-route.htm\">Details and schedule > </a><br />  </p> <ul data-editing-info=\"{\"orderedStyleType\":1,\"unorderedStyleType\":1}\"> <li data-ogsc=\"black\"><em><strong>If trail users need access to or from the South Kaibab Trailhead when the shuttle buses are not running, please contact Xanterra Taxi Service at 928.638.2631.</strong></em></li> </ul> <h3><strong>About South Kaibab Trail </strong></h3> <p>The South Kaibab Trail is a well-defined, well-maintained dirt trail offering wonderful expansive views. This can be a great trail for short trips into the canyon of half a day or less, but the openness of this trail lends itself to extreme heat during the summer months and little to no protection from passing storms.<br /> <br /> There is little shade, and what is there comes mostly from the canyon walls at the very beginning of the trail in the early part of day.<br /> <br /> There is <b>no water</b> along the trail, though there is a spring-fed water filling station at the trailhead during the summer.<br /> <br /> <b>No private vehicles allowed at the trailhead. Access is by foot, bicycle, or shuttle bus only.</b><br /> <br /> *Note: all trails into the canyon are steep and difficult; consider contacting a park ranger before starting your hike.</p> <h3><strong>Destinations</strong></h3> <p><br /> <strong>Ooh Aah Point</strong><br /> 1.8 miles (2.9 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 1-2 hours / 790 feet (230 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Cedar Ridge</strong><br /> 3 miles (4.8 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2-4 hours / 1,120 feet (340 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Skeleton Point </strong>- Check with a park ranger before attempting as a day hike.<br /> 6 miles (9.6 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 4-6 hours / 2,040 feet (620 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking below Skeleton Point is not recommended as a day hike due to the long distance, extreme temperature changes, and an approximately 5,000-foot (1,500 m) elevation change each way. Consult a park ranger before heading further down for safety tips and overnight permits.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>The Tipoff</strong><br /> 9 miles (14.5 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 6-9 hours / 3,280 feet (1,100 m) elevation change<br /> <br /> <strong>Phantom Ranch</strong><br /> 15 miles (24 km) <strong>roundtrip</strong> / 2 days / 4,700 ft (1,430 m) elevation change</p> <h3><strong>Water</strong></h3> <p>There is no water on the South Kaibab Trail. From early May to mid-October there is water near the trailhead (from a spigot near the bus stop). Potable water is available year round at Bright Angel Campground, however, please note that due to occasional pipeline breaks water at Bright Angel Campground is not guaranteed: bringing an alternative form of water treatment, such as iodine tablets or a water filter, is essential. During hot weather, take at least 4 liters of water.</p> <h3><strong>Trail Description</strong></h3> <p>Hikers seeking panoramic views unparalleled on any other trail at Grand Canyon will want to consider a hike down the South Kaibab Trail. It is the only trail at Grand Canyon National Park that so dramatically holds true to a ridgeline descent. But this exhilarating sense of exposure to the vastness of the canyon comes at a cost: there is little shade and no water for the length of this trail. During winter months, the constant sun exposure is likely to keep most of the trail relatively free of ice and snow. For those who insist on hiking during summer months, which is not recommended in general, this trail is the quickest way to the bottom (it has been described as \"a trail in a hurry to get to the river\"), but due to lack of any water sources, ascending the trail can be a dangerous proposition.</p> <h3><strong>Access</strong></h3> <p>Hikers must use the park's free shuttle bus system to reach the trailhead. Every morning, three hiker express buses leave from the Bright Angel Lodge and then from the Backcountry Information Center (times vary depending on the month). Otherwise, hikers will need to park at Grand Canyon Visitor Center and take the South Kaibab (Orange) shuttle bus.</p> <h3><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia </strong>a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3><strong>Mules and Hikers</strong></h3> <p><br /> <strong>Mules use this trail regularly.</strong><br /> Expect to encounter aromatic evidence of them on your hike!<br /> <br /> <strong>Always give mules the right of way.</strong><br /> Encounters between hikers and mules have resulted in injuries to packers and the death to mules. To ensure safety for yourself, other trail users, mules, and mule riders, follow these steps when encountering mules on the trails:</p>   <ol> <li>Step off the trail on the uphill side-away from the edge.</li> <li>Listen for and follow the direction of the wrangler.</li> <li>Remain completely quiet and stand perfectly still. </li> <li>Only return to the trail when the last mule is 50 feet (15 m) beyond your position.</li> </ol> <h3><strong>Camping</strong></h3> <p><br /> A permit is required for backcountry camping in this area. Learn more and apply <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">online </a> or request a permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> Bright Angel Campground, located on the north side of the Colorado River at Phantom Ranch, offers 30 small group sites and 2 large group sites. Stock is permitted here!</p>",

It ranks as <b>one of the most difficult and demanding developed trails</b> in the park.<br /> <br /> The Tanner Trail is <b>steep</b>, <b>rarely maintained</b>, and <b>not a recommended first hike into the canyon</b>. The only source of water is at the Colorado River. In general, Grand Canyon is infamous for summer heat and the Tanner Trail is noted for being unusually hot.<br /> <br /> The summer sun rises early and sets late in this wide-open area. The absence of water produces sparse vegetation and little shade. River runners call this part of the Grand Canyon \"Furnace Flats\".<br /> <br /> Avoid this trail during warm/hot weather over 95°F (35°C).</p> <h3>Trail Description</h3> <p><strong>Strongly consider talking with a park ranger before attempting this hike.</strong><br /> <br /> The trail is <strong>steep</strong> and <strong>no water is available until the river</strong>. Expect to hike and climb over unstable footpaths and boulder fields. Your best option for a day hike would be to the 75 Mile Creek Saddle. To reach just this point, be prepared for 1.6 miles (2.6 km) over a descent of 1,700 feet (518 m). Hiking beyond the 75 Mile Creek Saddle is exposed and can be extremely hot.<br /> <br /> There are no water sources along the trail until the Colorado River, a 9 mile trek (14.5 km) and elevation change of 4,650 feet (1,417 m) each way. The elevation at Lipan Point is 7,350 feet (2,240 m) and at the Colorado River it is 2,700 feet (823 m). However, the Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult and time-consuming to purify.<br /> <br /> If you choose to hike down what remains of a pioneer-era trail, you will head immediately down the gully east of Lipan Point. The upper section of the Tanner Trail is narrow, badly eroded, and can be difficult to follow, especially after a storm. The trail stays on the slopes east of the bottom of the gully through the Toroweap Formation and switches to the west side at the top of the Coconino Sandstone. Rockslides in the Coconino Sandstone have covered the original trail in places, forcing hikers to improvise short sections. The trail descends steeply across the slope west of the bed of gully nearly all the way to the 75 Mile Creek Saddle. A prime canyon view at the saddle is the reward for a couple of miles of notably unstable hiking. The reward comes with a price - hiking out of the canyon from even here is one of the more rugged, steeper climbs in the park.<br /> <br /> Hiking beyond this point requires detailed planning and experience hiking in a desert environment.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>The Colorado River is the sole source of water. No reliable water exists above the shoreline. The Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult to purify under those conditions.</p> <h3>Access</h3> <p>Parking is available at Lipan Point. Walk back down the road a short ways and look for the trailhead, east of the pavement.<br /> <br /> It is 9 miles (14.5 km) from Lipan Point at 7,350 feet (2,240 m) to the Colorado River down at 2,700 feet (823 m).  All water should be treated or boiled. However, the Colorado is often silt laden and can be difficult to purify.</p> <h3>Hike Smart</h3> <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong><br /> Once you have researched your trip and are confident in what to expect on the trail, communicate your plan to someone who will notice if you are overdue and report it to 911.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check the Weather</strong><br /> Summer temperatures in the shade routinely pass 100°F (38°C). Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The hike out of the canyon will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>, a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <p>The lower reaches of Grand Canyon below Desert View are dominated by a series of tilted layers of stone known as the Grand Canyon Supergroup. The Supergroup is a complex collection of ancient sedimentary and igneous rocks ranging in age from 729 million to 1.255 billion years, the oldest sedimentary deposits in the canyon. The colorful rocks are soft and easily eroded so the canyon floor is unusually expansive, offering unimpeded views of some of the steepest walls to be found below the rim.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>American Indians used this natural rim-to-river route for several thousand years. The trail as we know it today has been in use since 1890, when Franklin French and Seth Tanner improved it. This work allowed early miners access to their claims; it was also used as the southern component of the disreputable Horsethief Route.</p> <h3>Camping</h3> <p>A permit is required for backcountry camping in this area. Learn about how to apply for a permit on the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm\">website</a> or request permit in person at the Backcountry Information Center.<br /> <br /> As part of conservation efforts to salvage plant and animal habitats that depend upon remnants of older pre-dam sediments near the Colorado River, <strong>the large sand dune at the mouth of Tanner Canyon is closed to visitation and camping</strong>. <strong>Tanner Canyon use area (BB9) is the only exception</strong> , allowing \"at-large\" camping. There are nice (although dry) established campsites along the trail at Seventyfive Mile Creek-Tanner Canyon saddle, trailside in the Supai Formation, above and below the Redwall Limestone, and in the Tapeats Sandstone. Campsites near the Colorado River can be found on the east side of Tanner Canyon. A composting toilet is nearby.</p> <h3>Suggested Maps</h3> <p>7.5 Minute Desert View Quad (USGS)<br /> Trails Illustrated Map, Grand Canyon National Park (National Geographic)<br /> Sky Terrain Trails Map, Grand Canyon (Sky Terrain)</p>",

At The Abyss, no fault line is present, meaning very little water runs into the canyon because it mostly drains to the south away from the rim.<br /> <br /> This is unlike many of the other side canyons, which are usually caused by faults cutting through the rock walls and funneling water toward the Colorado River below. Instead, most of the erosion near The Abyss occurs because of gravity's constant pull on the rock face.

On either side of you, tall and densely clustered pine or aspen trees abruptly end at the edges of this large meadow. The open area that you see extends for miles.<br /> <br /> Why would these vibrant forests suddenly stop invading an open, rolling grassy landscape? Several factors are linked to this phenomenon.<br /> <br /> <b>Wildfire</b> has certainly played a role.<br /> <br /> <b>Drainage</b> is also a limiting factor. Trees are skilled at soaking up water, though seedlings may have a hard time growing in locations exposed to greater amounts of sun, rain, and snow.<br /> <br /> <b>Soil chemistry</b> is also a consideration. Natural toxins and higher alkaline concentrations can prevent the growth of woody plants.<br /> <br /> <b>Competition</b> is significant. For example, Ponderosa pine trees struggle to grow in areas dominated by established grasses. <b>Variations in bedrock</b> (primarily Kaibab limestone) may also affect how deep or suitable an area is for seedling growth. And grazing <b>wildlife</b>, like mule deer and bison, keep vegetation low and trimmed.<br /> <br /> You can also observe this phenomenon along the beginning of Cape Royal Road, here on the North Rim.</p> <h3>Bison Safety</h3> <ul> <li>Bison are wild animals and are unpredictable.</li> <li>Maintain a distance of 100 feet (30 m) from bison.</li> <li>When the bison are within 100 feet (30 m) of the road, it is recommended to view wildlife from inside a vehicle.</li> <li>Please use established gravel or paved pull-outs to park vehicles completely off the roadway (all wheels right of the white line).

It is a 0.4 mile (0.65 km) to the portal at the junction with the Canyon Rim Trail, (Trail of Time). <br /> <br /> This portal sits at 1,000 million (1 billion) years ago along the Trail of Time, a period of Grand Canyon history which corresponds with the deposition of rocks belonging to the Grand Canyon Supergroup, some of Grand Canyon's oldest sedimentary rocks.<br /> <br /> This fact is reflected in the seating rocks and paving stones surrounding the portal. The paving stones represent sandstones of the Dox Formation, while the seating rocks include several large pieces of Hotauta Conglomerate (the basal member of the Bass Formation) and Bass Limestone; one piece of purplish limestone bears striking ripple marks formed by flowing water.<br /> <br /> On the east side of the actual trail junction sits a large piece of Shinumo Quartzite, with an equally large piece of Sixtymile Conglomerate sitting next to it.<br /> <br /> Directly opposite these rocks, on the west side of the junction, sit two large stromatolite fossils, the top sides of which have been cut and polished.<br /> <br /> <strong>Walking west from here</strong> will take you to exhibits of the <strong>oldest rocks in Grand Canyon and Grand Canyon Village. </strong>0.6 mile (0.9 km).<br /> <br /> <strong>Walking east from here</strong> will take you through <strong>Grand Canyon's younger years to the present day and eventually to Yavapai Geology Museum. </strong>0.7 mile (1.13 km).</p> <h3>Trail of Time Overview</h3> <p>The Trail of Time is the world's largest geoscience exhibition at one of the world's grandest geologic landscapes, Grand Canyon National Park.

The first train arrived in 1901, bringing passengers ready to marvel at Grand Canyon's one-of-a-kind views. Today this feeling continues as folks step off the train, eager to make the walk up towards El Tovar Hotel and the canyon rim.<br /> <br /> Constructed in 1909-1910, the Train Depot is part of the Grand Canyon National Park National Historic Landscape District and a designated National Historic Landmark. Designed by architect Francis W. Wilson of Santa Barbara, California, the log and wood-frame structure is two stories high.<br /> <br /> Originally, the downstairs was designated for station facilities and the station agent's family inhabited the upstairs. Today, the first floor is used for railway passenger services. The building is one of 14 log depots constructed in the United States and one of only three remaining. Of the three, the Train Depot is the only one in which logs were used as the primary structural material and which still serves an operating railroad. The depot's logs are squared on three sides creating bearing surfaces, flat interior surfaces, and a rustic exterior appearance.<br /> <br /> Just beyond the depot is the El Tovar Hotel, built in 1905 by the Santa Fe Railroad. The structure is the signature hotel along the rim. The railroad built the Train Depot five years after the hotel and placed it conveniently close for the rail passengers.</p>",

The history of these people and their culture is interpreted through physical objects such as the pueblo itself, and the stories of their descendants which have been passed down from generation to generation.<br /> <br /> To learn more about the history of this site, join a park ranger on a guided walk during the summer season, and/or by visiting tribal lands and learning from the people who carry the stories of their ancestors who occupied the area physically, and are still here spiritually. </p>",

After winding through the forest on Ken Patrick Trail for 0.9 miles (1.5 km), bear right and walk for another 0.4 miles (0.6 km). At this point, you have the option of heading left or right. Either direction is part of the same loop on this trail. Both lead to a point overlooking the canyon and North Kaibab Trail switchbacks. The entire loop portion for this section of the trail is 2.1 miles (3.4 km).<br /> <br /> This trail is also used by mules.

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32Â°F (0Â°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down.

At that time, the wildlife management plan sought to protect grazing animals by removing the predators.<br /> <br /> James T. \"Uncle Jim\" Owens was a warden for the US Forest Service (USFS) who lived in a cabin on the rim while carrying out his duties in the reserve. Uncle Jim is credited with killing 532 mountain lions from the North Rim.</p>",

Avoid hiking between 10 am and 4 pm, the hottest times of day.<br /> <br /> From July to September, monsoons can build large, violent lightning storms. Seek shelter immediately.<br /> <br /> In winter and early spring, temperatures can drop below 32°F (0°C) and upper portions of this steep trail become dangerously icy. Hard ice often conceals potentially hazardous passages. Over-the-shoe traction devices are highly recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pack Properly</strong><br /> It is critical to determine before your hike your needs for fluids and for snacks high in calories and salts. Consuming twice as many calories as during normal exercise is realistic for summer canyon hikes. The return hike will likely take twice as long as the hike down. Wearing sun hats and cool, wet clothing will help regulate your core body temperature during warmer hikes.<br /> <br /> <strong>Energy Balance</strong><br /> Your body needs energy-balancing proper nutrition and hydration are critical to your hiking success! Eat and drink while resting-sip fluids only when thirsty.<br /> Too little water leads to dehydration and heat stroke. Excessive hydration and insufficient salt intake causes <strong>hyponatremia</strong>,<strong> </strong>a seizure-producing electrolyte disorder. If you do not feel well: seek shade, get wet, cool off, eat, and rest. Turning around may be your best option.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>The trail is named after Gunnar Widforss, an early twentieth-century artist from Sweden. He lived and painted at the Grand Canyon in the 1930s, producing a large collection of watercolors prized for their geologic detail. Widforss tried to capture the Grand Canyon environment as he saw it then. That environment has changed over the years as natural and human forces continue to reshape a picture characterized by monumental change through the eons. The geologic features, plant life, and historic features along this trail all provide glimpses of these past and present environments-and future ones as well.<br /> <br /> Previously, Widforss Point had been called McKinnon Point. Colonel H. McKinnon, a British visitor, stopped here in 1892 after a successful hunting trip on the Kaibab Plateau with W.S. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody. He left a note in a tin can at the point to commemorate his triumph.</p>",

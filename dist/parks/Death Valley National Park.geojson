Here, visitors marvel at an array of colors (red, orange, yellow, blue, pink, and green), splashed across the hills. These colors are from volcanic deposits rich in compounds such as iron oxides and chlorite, which creates a rainbow effect.   <br /> <br /> Stunning not only at Artists Palette, the Artists Drive loop winds through hills carved by the erosive power of water, and gives vistas of both the rugged Black Mountains and swirling white salt flats. While no maintained trails exist along this loop, several pull outs provide safe parking areas from which to explore this unique landscape on foot.  <br /> <br /> Although Artists Drive and Artists Palette are beautiful any time of day, sunrise and sunset provide additional shadows and changing light, further enhancing the allure of this incredible place.<br /> <br /> When visiting Artists Palette, allow approximately 30 minutes to detour from Badwater Road along the one-way Artists Drive Scenic Loop. The drive begins 8.5 miles (13.7 km) south of the Hwy 190/Badwater Rd. junction and has a length restriction of 25 ft. (7.6 m) due to sharp bends and large dips. <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

The Ashford Mine, located approximately 5 miles (8 km) east and 3,500 feet (1,067 m) above the mill, did produce gold ore but was not rich enough to justify the large amount of money needed to extract, process and transport that ore. The mine was worked intermittently between 1910 and 1941 by the Ashford brothers or individuals/companies they leased it to.<br /> <br /> One of the lessees, B.W. McCausland and his son Ross, supplied the capital to build the forty-ton capacity mill located on the valley floor. The mill once had wooden walls and windows as well as machinery including a jaw-crusher; now only the foundation and some debris remains. Visitors to the Ashford Mill site today will also see the crumbling concrete ruins of an office building.   <br /> <br /> When exploring the Ashford Mill site, be sure to take a moment to notice the terrace formations on the side of Shoreline Butte (the large hill dotted with dark volcanic rocks west of the site). Shoreline Butte was so named because the terrace formations (shores) were formed by different water levels of the ancient Lake Manly which once covered much of Death Valley.  <br />   <br /> The Ashford Mill site is located off Badwater Road, 28 miles (45 km) west of the Shoshone entrance. </p> <p> </p>",

The salt flats here cover nearly 200 square miles (518 square km), and are composed mostly of sodium chloride (table salt), along with calcite, gypsum, and borax. <br /> <br /> Stories suggest that Badwater Basin earned its name when a mule belonging to an early surveyor refused to drink from the spring-fed pool near the present-day boardwalk. However, the water here is not truly “bad,” just very salty. Despite this high salinity, many organisms not only survive, but thrive here. The pool is home to an endemic snail naturally found only at this location, and its rim is dotted with salt tolerant plants, including pickleweed. <br /> <br /> Badwater Basin was once the site of the large ancient inland Lake Manly which evaporated tens of thousands of years before the arrival of the 1849er for whom it was named. The lake had no outlet, leading to the accumulation of sediment and salt over time. When the lake eventually evaporated, concentrated salt deposits were left behind. Today, fascinating geometric salt polygons form on the flats as groundwater rises up through these deposits and evaporates.  <br /> <br /> The pool and boardwalk are easily accessible from the parking lot off Badwater Road, but the best views of the salt polygons require an easy 1.5-2 mile (2.4-3.2 km) roundtrip walk out onto the salt flats. Be sure to look up on the cliffs of the Black Mountains to the east; here you will see a sign high above, indicating sea level. Also take a moment to pick out Telescope Peak in the Panamint Range to the west; at 11,049 ft (3, 368 m), this peak is over two miles (3.2 km) above you.

As true today as it was then, Dantes View affords visitors an unparalleled view of the swirling white salt flats of Death Valley below (or if you’re a Star Wars fan, Mos Eisley), and the Panamint Range to the west. <br /> <br /> Towering 5,575 ft (1,699 m) above Badwater Basin, on the ridge of the Black Mountains, Dantes View is a favorite spot for photographers. Sunrise and sunset are especially magnificent here, and although this area is popular, it is easy to find solitude and set up the perfect shot with a short hike along the ridge to the north. More adventurous hikers can continue along the ridge to Mt. Perry, an 8 mile round-trip journey with approximately 1,200 ft (366 m) of elevation gain.  <br /> <br /> Not only is Dantes View incredible during the day, it is absolutely breathtaking at night. Death Valley National Park is an <a href=\"https://www.darksky.org/our-work/conservation/idsp/parks/deathvalley/\">International Dark Sky Park</a>, so don’t forget to bring your telescope (or just use your naked eyes), because a visit during a new moon will provide a humbling glimpse of the Milky Way and stars above. A visit during a full moon is equally as grand, as the salt flats below glow a ghostly white.<br /> <br /> A 45 minute drive from Furnace Creek, Dantes View is well worth the detour off the main Highway 190 route.<br />  ",

Nestled in an unassuming canyon with no water flowing beyond the canyon mouth, few would guess that around several dry desert bends hides a world of water and life.<br /> <br /> Darwin Falls was named for an Army physician, Erasmus Darwin French, who came to the west in 1846 during the Mexican American war and prospected for silver in the area. At around 18 feet (5.5 m) tall, Darwin Falls is one of only a handful of year-round waterfalls in Death Valley National Park. The spring-fed water creates a truly special environment, allowing for the growth of trees, cattails, aquatic vegetation, and even ferns. Amphibians such as tree frogs and toads complete part of their lifecycle in these waters, and wildlife including bighorn sheep depend on the water’s flow for survival.<br /> <br /> Humans have also used this water for hundreds of years, and hikers may notice a metal pipe carrying water from the stream below the falls. Please do not enter the pool, as it is the drinking source for nearby Panamint Springs Resort.<br /> <br /> The trailhead for the falls is accessed via an unmarked gravel road 1.2 miles (2 km) west of Panamint Springs Resort and is not always passable by sedans; speak with a ranger about current road conditions before heading out.     </p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><b>HIKING NOT ADVISED AFTER 10AM IN THE SUMMER</b></span><br /> <br /> <strong>Round Trip Length: </strong>2 miles (3.2 km) <strong> </strong><br /> <strong>Round Trip Time: </strong>1.5 - 2 hours<br /> <strong>Difficulty: </strong>Moderate<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 450 ft (137 m)<br /> <strong>Trail Type: </strong>No official trail, unmarked out and back route<br /> <strong>Location: </strong>Darwin Falls Road off CA-190 (2.5 mi/4km from turn off).

Upon entering the canyon, visitors find themselves immersed in the badlands; geologic formations made up of fine, silt-like sediments that covered the bottom of an enormous lake which once stretched across much of Death Valley. <br /> <br /> While hiking through these badlands, notice how easily the canyon walls crumble and erode. Badlands are greatly impacted by sudden downpours of rain, which quickly turn this canyon into a river of mud. Hikers will step over piles of dried sediment at the base of the canyon walls, and crisscross a section of deep mud-cracks, all of which were left behind from powerful flash floods and mudflows. <br /> <br /> Most of the badlands in Desolation Canyon are a rich golden color, but as hikers progress up the canyon they will see some sections of green, red and purple rocks. Millions of years ago, when this area was under water, nearby volcanic eruptions deposited layers of ash and debris in the lake, which settled among the silts and clays at the bottom. After the lake evaporated away and exposed the badlands formations, the iron minerals in these ash deposits reacted with oxygen and developed colorful tints. Some of the best times to hike through Desolation Canyon are in the late afternoon and early evening, when the low light catches these colorful rocks. </p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">HIKING NOT ADVISED AFTER 10 AM IN THE SUMMER</span><br /> <br /> <strong>Round Trip Length: </strong>3.6 mile (5.8km)<br /> <strong>Round Trip Time:</strong> 2.5 hours<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate/Difficult<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 600 ft (183m)<br /> <strong>Trail Type:</strong> Out and back route- not an official trail<br /> <strong>Location: </strong>The short unpaved Desolation Canyon Road is located 3.7 miles (6km) south of CA-190 off Badwater Road. <br /> <strong>Parking:</strong> Gravel parking area <br /> <strong>Route:</strong> Up a canyon.

The calm, carbonate-rich and oxygen-poor water of Devils Hole is a constant 33.5–34°C (93°F) in the deeper reaches of the cave and is often even warmer in the shallows. This combination creates a challenging environment for the tiny blue Devils Hole pupfish! These fish subsist on algae, invertebrates, and other micro-organisms found on a shallow rock shelf within the pool. <br /> <br /> The water level in Devils Hole was protected by the United States Supreme Court in 1976 to help ensure the ongoing survival of this unique fish. With only about 100–180 individuals remaining in the wild, scientists continue their efforts to conserve the species for this and future generations to learn from and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Ash Meadows is located approximately 50 miles east of the Furnace Creek Visitor Center in Death Valley and 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.

The dunes cover an area only 3 miles long and 1 mile wide, yet they are the tallest sand dunes in California, possibly the tallest in all of North America. They rise suddenly more than 680 feet above the dry lakebed at their western base. As tall as these dunes are, they are dwarfed by the impressive limestone wall of the Last Chance Mountains which rises another 4000 feet above the valley floor.</p> <p><strong>Singing Sand</strong><br /> The climb to the summit of the dunes is not an easy walk. All the slopes are steep and the loose sand gives way beneath your feet. At the top, the sweeping view seems reward enough for your efforts, yet if the sand is completely dry you may experience one of the strangest phenomena to be found in the desert: singing sand. When the sand avalanches down the steepest face of the highest dune, a sound like a bass note of a pipe organ or the distant drone of an airplane can be heard eminating from the sand. If the dune is at all damp (even though it may not feel so to the touch) no sound will be made. Why this occurs is not fully understood, but may have something to do with the smooth texture of the sand grains and the friction of those grains sliding against each other.</p> <p><strong>Island in the Desert</strong><br /> At first glance the Eureka Dunes appear desolate. What could possibly survive the hardships of this area? Plants and animals must endure the shifting sands, as a windstorm could bury them alive or expose them to the drying sun. The dry surface is deceptive, for dunes can hold water like a sponge. The Eureka Dunes receive more rainfall than others in the Death Valley area because their location at the western base of a mountain range that captures precipitation from passing storms. For perhaps 10,000 years these dunes have existed, providing a unique habitat for specialized lifeforms to evolve. The isolation of Eureka Dunes from other dune fields has led to the development of endemic species of plants and animals that are found nowhere else in the world. Besides 5 species of endemic beetles, 3 special plants have their entire range limited to this island of sand.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eureka Dunegrass</strong> <em>Swallenia alexandrae</em><br /> is often the only plant found on the higher slopes of the dunes. Its dense root system catches and holds drifting sand, forming stable hummocks. Stiff, spiny leaftips protect the plant from being disturbed by herbivores and careless hikers. Federally listed as an endangered species.</li> <li><strong>Eureka Dunes Evening Primrose</strong> <em>Oenothera avita eurekensis</em><br /> has large, white, night-blooming flowers to take advantage of pollenators such as moths that avoid the heat of day. When the leafy flower shoot is covered by windblown sand, roots sprout from the sides and a new rosette of leaves forms at the tip. Federally listed as an endangered species.</li> <li><strong>Shining Milkvetch</strong> <em>Astragalus lentiginosus micans</em><br /> reflects excess light and heat with a covering of silvery hairs to conserve moisture. This is a hummock -forming plant like the dune grass. Nodules on the roots gather nitrogen from the air, an important nutrient not available in the sand. Candidate for the Endangered Species List.</li> </ul> <p><strong>A Special Place</strong><br /> Eureka Dunes are clearly a special place. Please have respect when you visit. Lifeforms here may not be able to survive our carelessness. Try to choose activities that have the least impact on the land. Recreational activities such as sandboarding are not allowed on these delicate dunes. Camp away from the base of the dunes where most of the endemic plants and animals live. Most importantly, OFF ROAD VEHICLE TRAVEL IS NOT PERMITTED ON THE DUNES, or any where else in Death Valley National Park for that matter. Please keep your vehicle on established roadways.</p>",

Crowley, a catholic priest responsible for ministering to the people of Inyo County Parish in the 1930s.The Desert Padre, as he was known, would often stop here to admire the views on his way to or from visiting parishioners in Death Valley, and his home in Lone Pine, CA.  <br /> <br /> Located near the western park boundary, this vista point offers a stunning view into Rainbow Canyon, a colorfully striped canyon created by ancient volcanic activity. A short ¼ mile (400 m) walk or drive on an unpaved road leads from the vista parking area to Padre Point, overlooking Panamint Valley. <br /> <br /> In recent years, Rainbow Canyon was nicknamed “Star Wars Canyon” by visitors who came to observe and photograph the military test flights which occured in the vicinity. Star Wars Canyon is part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deva/joint-airspace.htm\">R-2508 Complex</a>, which has been used by the military since the 1930s. Unfortunately a jet crash in the canyon in 2019 resulting in the death of the pilot and injury to several visitors in the area, putting an end to training flights through the canyon. <br /> <br /> Visitors to this scenic vista point today observe the serene beauty and silence of the canyon and of Panamint Valley below, much the same way as Father Crowley did almost 100 years ago. <br />  ",

While a peek into the canyon mouth from the parking area will give visitors a glimpse of the canyon's secrets, hiking into the canyon offers so much more: towering walls, colorful side canyons beckoning for exploration, ripples formed by ancient water, now preserved in stone, the history of a road reclaimed in a flash-flood event, and the skittering of wildlife.  <br /> <br /> This easy/moderate hike is 2 miles (3.2 km) round-trip, and involves one 3 foot (1 m) rock scramble. Although most hikers turn around at the junction to Red Cathedral, those looking for a more adventurous hike can continue an additional 0.5 miles (0.8 km) to the vertically fluted walls of a natural amphitheater- Red Cathedral (this involves scrambling and squeezing/crawling through rock spaces). An even longer trek- 7.8 miles (12.6 km), will take hikers to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/zabriskie-point-scenic-viewpoint.htm\">Zabriskie Point</a>, before looping back to the parking area via Gower Gulch. <br /> <br /> Want to learn more?

Coleman built the Harmony plant and began to process ore in late 1883 or early 1884. When in full operation, the Harmony Borax Works employed 40 men, who produced three tons of borax daily. What little evidence remains indicates that the bulk of this labor force was composed of Chinese workers. The Chinese laborers gathered the impure chunks of mineral from the valley floor and loaded them into one-horse carts for transport to the borax plant.<br /> <br /> During the summer months, when the weather was so hot that processing water would not cool enough to permit the suspended borax to crystallize, Coleman moved his work force to the Amargosa Borax Plant near present day Tecopa, California.<br /> <br /> Getting the finished product to market from the heart of Death Valley was a difficult task, and an efficient method had to be devised. The Harmony operation became famous through the use of large mule teams and double wagons which hauled borax the long overland route to Mojave.The romantic image of the “</span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/historyculture/twenty-mule-teams.htm\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">20-mule team</span></a><span style=\"color:#000000;\">” persists to this day and has become the symbol of the borax industry in this country.<br /> <br /> The Harmony plant went out of operation in 1888, after only five years of production, when Coleman’s financial empire collapsed. Aquired by Francis Marion Smith, the works never resumed the boiling of cottonball borate ore, and in time became part of the borax reserves of the Pacific Coast Borax Company and it successors. On December 31, 1974, the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\"><strong>HIKING NOT ADVISED AFTER 10AM IN THE SUMMER</strong></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Round Trip Length: </strong>0.4 mi (0.6km) <br /> <strong>Round Trip Time:</strong> 30 minutes <br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain: </strong>50 ft (0.8km)<br /> <strong>Trail Type:</strong> paved, </span><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\"><em><strong>current conditions include sandy areas, uneven and missing pavement due to flood damage.</strong></em></span><br /> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Location:</strong> 1 mile (1.6km) west of Furnace Creek on CA-190<br /> <strong>Parking:</strong> Paved area with large spaces for RVs and buses<br /> <strong>Closest Restroom:</strong> No restrooms.

Discovered by accident in 1903 by Jack Keane and Domingo Etcharren, Keane Wonder Mine and the surrounding area was mined intermittently until 1942, with heyday years of 1907-1912. Unlike many Death Valley claims which drew much excitement but yielded little actual revenue, Keane Wonder Mine produced $625,000-$682,000 worth of gold during its boom years. <br /> <br /> Part of what made Keane Wonder Mine so successful was the ingenious aerial tramway which was built to transport gold ore from the mine to the mill. The tramway included two terminals and thirteen towers, with cables spanning deep ravines and an overall vertical fall of 1,500 feet (457 m). Metal ore buckets were loaded at the top (approximately 70 tons of ore was transported each day!) and moved down the cables to the mill, a mile (1.6 km) away. <br /> <br /> Many of the original structures have been stabilized and repaired, and visitors to the site can spend several minutes to an entire day exploring the area. The impressive timbers of the lower terminal and mill are a short walk from the parking area, and a strenuous climb along an unmaintained trail (approximately 0.3 mi/0.5 km) will bring hikers to the base of a tramway tower with views of a ravine with historic ore buckets at the bottom. More serious adventurers can climb the entire steep 1.6 miles (2.6 km) to the upper terminal of the tramway and the mine itself. <br /> <br /> The parking area is reached via a 2.8 mi (4.5 km) dirt road accessible to most vehicles (check for current conditions at the Visitor Center as washouts can occur) off the Beatty Cut Off Road. When visiting, please respect the history of this incredible site by not climbing on any of the structures or entering any of the mine openings. While many of the mine openings have been closed for visitor safety and are now the homes of native bats, some openings and metal debris still exist, so use caution when exploring. <br />  ",

In order to create sand dunes, there must be a source of sand (in this case, the eroding mountains to the north), wind to move that sand, and a barrier to prevent the sand from being blown farther (the mountains to the south). The conditions at Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes are perfect for the creation of dunes, and while individual grains move, and ripples form, the dune field remains.<br /> <br /> These dunes are named for the mesquite tree which grows in abundance in the area. The trees must twist and grow to avoid being buried, and leafless brown trunks are often exposed by the shifting sands. The arrival of spring brings forth a burst of bright green leaves and yellow flowers from the trees’ upper branches. Mesquite bean pods are a traditional food of the Timbisha Shoshone, and the flour from these pods can be purchased in specialty food stores today.  <br /> <br /> Sand dunes provide habitat for many animals, including nocturnal kangaroo rats and sidewinder rattlesnakes. No official trails exist at the dunes, so please watch your step when exploring and do not disturb burrows.  <br /> <br /> The Mesquite Dunes are known for dramatic shadows at sunrise and sunset, as ripples and edges in the dunes stand out in greater contrast.

        "notes": "Natural Bridge\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/natural-bridge.htm\n\n<h3>Natural Bridge is a stunning geologic formation tucked back in a Death Valley canyon.</h3>   <p>This is an excellent short hike for families, geology lovers, and those who simply enjoy getting out and exploring. Although there is no official trail, a walk straight up the wash from the parking area will bring hikers directly under the bridge. Different from the smooth sandstone arches found in Utah, Natural Bridge is interesting because it is made of a jagged rocky alluvial deposit (rock, gravel, and sediment washed to the base of an ancient mountain and cemented together). Hikers who continue beyond the bridge up the canyon will encounter more examples of interesting Death Valley geology including dry falls, vertical chutes, and hanging canyons.<br /> <br /> The bridge rises approximately 35 ft (11 m) above the canyon floor and is about 35 ft (11 m) thick. Although rain is infrequent in Death Valley, over thousands of years, flash flood events have carved the canyon which Natural Bridge spans today. At some point, the water changed course slightly and ran just north of the present location of the bridge (look for this diversion as you hike). This diversion lowered the level of the canyon just above the location of the bridge.

Flooding changed the creek bed, destroyed the boardwalk and damaged the toilet.</em></span></h4> <h3>Rare water in the desert leads to an abundance of life.</h3> <p><br /> Those who visit Salt Creek during the summer witness a dry landscape with brittle plant life, but a return visit in the winter is an entirely different experience. When the air temperature drops, flowing water returns to the dry bed of Salt Creek. Pickleweed plants growing along the banks thirstily suck up this life-bringing water, birds can be seen in the shallows, and macroinvertebrates crawl and swim under the surface. Perhaps most exciting of all is the return of the Salt Creek Pupfish- small blue fish which dart in and out of the underwater vegetation.  <br />  <br /> Salt Creek pupfish are specifically adapted to the unique habitat of Salt Creek and can tolerate salt concentrations several times that of sea water. They take advantage of the cooler winter months to spawn, then as summer approaches, must retreat up the creek toward its spring-fed source to avoid perishing in the drying pools. Pupfish earned their name from the lively behavior they display during spawning, which some people liken to playful puppies.<br /> <br /> Located approximately 15 minutes west of Furnace Creek Visitor Center, off CA 190, Salt Creek is a unique haven in an arid environment. Here, visitors can view the pupfish and other species which rely on the water of the creek from a wooden ADA-accessible boardwalk which crisscrosses the creek. The boardwalk is a 0.5 mile (0.8 km) signed interpretive trail with information and benches along the way. Please be respectful of this VERY FRAGILE environment, and do not step off the boardwalk.  <br />  </p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"color: rgb(192, 57, 43);\">HIKING NOT ADVISED AFTER 10 AM IN THE SUMMER</span></p> <p><br /> <strong>Round Trip Length:</strong> 0.5 miles (0.8 km)<br /> <strong>Round Trip Time:</strong> 30 minutes  <br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy <br /> <strong>Elevation Gain: </strong>none-flat<br /> <strong>Trail Type:</strong> ADA accessible wooden boardwalk loop<br /> <strong>Location: </strong>Unpaved Salt Creek Road located 13 miles (20km) west of Furnace Creek off CA-190.<br /> <strong>Parking: </strong>Open gravel parking area large enough for RVs and buses  <br /> <strong>Closest Restroom:</strong> Vault toilet located in the parking lot <br /> <strong>Route: </strong>Boardwalk loop paralleling and crossing Salt Creek, with benches and interpretive signs. </p>",

When the debris settled, a new crater appeared.</h3>   <p>Ubehebe Crater in northern Death Valley National Park is an excellent place to explore the power of maar (explosion pit) volcanoes. It was here that molten lava came into contact with ground water, creating steam which eventually produced enough pressure to explode through the earth above and create a crater.<br /> <br /> Although Ubehebe Crater is only one of about a dozen craters in the Ubehebe volcanic field, it is the largest and youngest at an estimated 2,100 years old. The crater is approximately 0.5 miles (0.8 km) in diameter, and ranges from 500-777 feet (152-237 m) deep, depending which ridge it is measured from. <br /> <br /> Ubehebe is easily viewed from the parking area, but an easy/moderate trail (1.5 miles/2.4 km) along the rim, allows hikers to marvel at the crater from all sides. Those wishing to explore farther can visit some of the other maars in the area, including Little Hebe Crater. Many visitors enjoy hiking into the depths of the crater, but remember that the hike back up is a difficult slog in ankle-deep debris, and should not be attempted during hot summer months.<br /> <br /> Afternoon and sunset are particularly grand times to visit this spectacular site. In this lighting, the colorful layers of the sedimentary rock exposed by the explosion become quite obvious, along with the mantle of dark ejected material which caps these older deposits. Allow an hour drive time from Furnace Creek and come prepared for windy conditions. Please visit this area with respect, as it is an important cultural site for the Timbisha Shoshone people.   <br />  </p> <hr /> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">HIKING NOT ADVISED AFTER 10 AM IN THE SUMMER</span><br /> <br /> <strong><u>Ubehebe Rim Hike</u></strong><br /> <strong>Round Trip Length: </strong>1.5 miles (2.4 km) <br /> <strong>Round Trip Time:</strong> 1 hour<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 500 ft (152m)<br /> <strong>Trail Type:</strong> Official loop trail<br /> <strong>Location: </strong>8 miles (13km) west of Scotty's Castle<br /> <strong>Parking:</strong> Paved lot directly overlooking the crater- large enough for buses and large RVs<br /> <strong>Closest Restroom:</strong> No restrooms.

The number of kilns- ten in all – is itself an attractive feature, especially since they are all laid out in a perfect line up in the canyon.”</h3> <br /> This excerpt from a study published in 1969 by National Park Service Historian, Benjamin Levy, reveals that a trip off the beaten path, up Wildrose Canyon, is well worth the detour. Completed in 1877 to supply charcoal for the Modock Mines 25 miles to the west in the Argus Range, these kilns were likely only used until 1879.   <br /> <br /> The kilns were built from local stone, and the mortar is a lime, sand and gravel mix. During the kilns’ operation, wood was harvested from the surrounding hillsides, loaded into the kilns, and fired to produce charcoal. The charcoal product was then transported by pack animal, and possibly wagons to be used in smelters for lead-silver mines. Charcoal was the preferred fuel source for use in mining furnaces because it burns more slowly than wood, and produces a much greater heat, which is needed for refining ores.  <br /> <br /> Many of the trees used as fuel in the kilns were local Pinion Pines. Pinion pines are the source of pine nuts (think-pesto!), which were a traditional staple of the Timbisha Shoshone diet. The nuts ripen in the fall, and can be stored for several years, making them a valuable food source.<br /> <br /> The best way to reach the Wildrose Charcoal Kilns is by taking the Emigrant Canyon Road turnoff of Highway 190 (minimum 1.5 hr detour). This paved road offers spectacular scenery, while winding through hills, valleys, and washes. Be alert for wild burros, whose ancestors were left behind during the mining days; these animals often stand in roadways and have been known to bite and kick when approached. The final 2 miles (3 km) is gravel, and although it is generally passable by most vehicles, check current conditions before making the trip. <br />  ",

Named in honor of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/historyculture/christian-brevoort-zabriskie.htm\">Christian Zabriskie</a>, a prominent figure in the heyday of the Pacific Coast Borax Company, Zabriskie Point affords an elevated vista from which to marvel at the badlands below. These yellow and brown stripped hills have been shaped by the powerful force of water, and even during dry times, the path carved by this water is unmistakable. Gazing beyond the badlands, views of the salt flats covering the floor of Death Valley are visible in the distance, with the hulk of the Panamint Mountains towering above.  <br /> <br /> The most pronounced feature viewed from Zabriskie Point is Manly Beacon. This jutting high point rises to an elevation of 823 ft (251 m), and bears the name of one of the first <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/historyculture/the-lost-49ers.htm\">49ers</a> (gold rush pioneers) to visit the area.

From the parking lot, the point is a ¼ mile (400 m) walk up a hill on a paved trail. Those interested in hiking in the badlands can pick up the Badlands Loop Trail at the Zabriskie Point parking lot. Hiking distance varies depending on the route chosen: longer hikes can include Gower Gulch, Golden Canyon, and Red Cathedral.   <br />  ",

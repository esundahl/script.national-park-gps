Created to prevent flooding down stream but mainly for its aesthetic value, the reservoir is still a highlight for visitors, surrounded by Pinnacle's rock formations. This is a great spot to have lunch or watch the sunset. To get there, hike one mile up the Moses Spring trail from the Moses Spring Trailhead. Depending on the time of year, you can go through another park highlight, the Bear Gulch caves, on your way. Make this hike a loop by returning on the Rim Trail. The reservoir is important habitat for the red legged frog, a threatened species in California.  ",

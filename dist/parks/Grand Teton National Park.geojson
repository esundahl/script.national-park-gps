Homesteaded by John Sargent in 1890, little remains of his lodge and store that served travelers on the road to Yellowstone. All current buildings date to the W. Lewis Johnson era (1926-1936) and the Alfred Berol era (1936-1976). Both Johnson and Berol built large log vacation homes representing two distinct periods of rustic architecture as well as various other cabins and outbuildings.<br /> <br /> Berol, president of the Eagle Pencil Company, decorated his lodge with \"pencil themed\" fixtures including the wrought iron and log chandeliers. The Berols-Alfred, Madeleine, and son, Kenneth (AMK)-sold the property to the National Park Service in 1976 for more than $3 million and a life estate. Today, the ranch houses the University of Wyoming-National Park Service Research Station, hosting researchers studying the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

        "notes": "Albright View Turnout\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/albright-view-turnout.htm\n\n<p>Albright Peak is the only mountain peak named for Horace M. Albright, the second director of the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> Facing west, the southern Teton Range-dominated by Buck Mountain, Static Peak and Albright Peak-towers over the valley of Jackson Hole. Death Canyon slices deep into the range to the south of these peaks.<br /> <br /> To the east, Blacktail Butte seems a minor hill but it still over 1,000 feet above the highway. The lack of trees on the south facing slopes of Blacktail Butte suggest past logging by settlers. The lack of trees, however, reflects the well-drained soils and exposure to the sun.</p> <h3>Name Origin</h3> <p>Horace Albright introduced John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to the area that became Grand Teton National Park in 1926. Albright, as superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, met with local business people in 1923 in Maud Noble's cabin setting in motion the recruitment of Rockefeller to help preserve and protect this landscape.</p> <h3>Biography of Horace Albright</h3> <p>Horace Albright was born in 1890 in California. In 1913, Albright graduated from the University of California, Berkeley and moved to Washington DC to begin working as a clerk for the Secretary of the Interior. Although he worked on park issues right away, his focus became nearly exclusively their issues in 1915. That year he became the assistant of newly hired Stephen Mather. In fact, Mather would not join the department unless Albright agreed to be his assistant in order to “’keep me [Mather] out of jail.’” Together they worked to create a parks bureau that resulted in the creation of the National Park Service (NPS) on August 25, 1916.</p> <p>In 1917 Stephen Mather became seriously ill from what was likely bipolar depression. This made it so Mather was unable to do the duties as director of the newly formed NPS. During a span between 1917 and 1919, Albright served as acting director.</p> <p>After Mather could return, Albright took up the jobs of superintendent of Yellowstone and NPS field director. As superintendent, Albright wanted to make Yellowstone a flagship of the agency and demonstrate how a park would be managed under the new National Park Service. Many of the current agency and park-wide policies and functions have roots with Albright. Two of the functions he helped found were visitor services and park museums. He was also instrumental in achieving the enlarged Grand Teton National Park of today.</p> <p>After Mather suffered a stroke in 1929, Albright became the second director of the NPS. One of his most lasting contributions to the National Park Service was to get all the war department sites placed under NPS control. This solidified the agency’s place as the keeper of both the natural and cultural heritage of the United States of America.</p> <p>In 1933, Albright left the NPS to work for the United States Potash Company. He retired from the company in 1956. Although he went into the private sector, Albright was always interested and involved in the affairs of national parks. He was even awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1980 for his involvement with the creation of the NPS. Albright died in 1987.</p> <p> </p>",

Today, it's the oldest one still standing. It was founded in 1912 by Struthers Burt and Harold Carncross, Easterners who emigrated to Wyoming. Burt and his wife, Katharine Newlin Burt, were prolific writers, so their ranch attracted a more artistic and literary set. The clientele tended to be wealthy Easterners who wanted a rustic vacation experience, away from the constraints of high society. Many former guests bought ranches in the area, and some of their families are still in the valley today. During the heyday of dude ranching in the 1910s and 20s, many other ranches operated in Jackson Hole and throughout the West. At its height in the 1920s, the Bar BC was actually one of the valley's largest employers, hiring over fifty people to help run the ranch each summer. The industry declined as tourism dropped during the Great Depression and World War II, though there are still some dude ranches in Jackson Hole today.</p>",

The Death Canyon Trailhead will be accessible from the north via Moose. Access from the south via the Granite Canyon Entrance will only be available on weekends (7 pm Friday to 7 am Monday) from Memorial Day to Labor Day. <br /> <br /> <b>Location:</b> Access the Death Canyon trailhead from the Moose-Wilson Road. Travel three miles south from Moose and turn north on a spur road. The last mile leading to the trailhead is a narrow, rough dirt road recommended for high-clearance vehicles.<br /> <br /> <b>Notes:</b> Facilities include a small dirt parking lot, a vault toilet and a seasonally-occupied patrol cabin. Remember to bring water with you. Bears may be active any place and at any time-travel in groups, make noise and carry bear spray. Backcountry camping requires a permit-pick one up at a backcountry permits office.</p> <h3>Destinations</h3> <p>Hikers may opt for the relatively level Valley Trail or hike one mile up to a stunning view of Phelps Lake. From the overlook, descend to the lake and then climb along Death Canyon Creek until you reach a once-glaciated, hanging canyon. At the patrol cabin, the trail splits. The north fork climbs a to Static Peak Divide and over into Alaska Basin. The main trail continues along the canyon to Fox Creek Pass and the Death Canyon Shelf. Backcountry camping permits are required for overnight stays.<br /> <br /> <strong>Phelps Lake Overlook</strong><br /> 2.0 miles RT, 1.5 hours, 430 ft total climbing, Moderate.<br /> Trail climbs moraine to overlook of Phelps Lake.<br /> <br /> <strong>Phelps Lake</strong><br /> 4.2 miles RT, 3 hours, 1050 ft total climbing, Strenuous.<br /> Trail climbs to overlook, then descends to Phelps Lake. Return involves steep hike back to overlook.<br /> <br /> <strong>Death Canyon-Static Peak Trail Junction</strong><br /> 7.9 miles RT, 6 hours, 2100 ft total climbing, Strenuous.<br /> Trail climbs to overlook, drops toward Phelps Lake, and then climbs the canyon to a patrol cabin.<br /> <br /> <strong>Static Peak Divide</strong><br /> 16.3 miles RT, 12 hours, 5100 ft total climbing, Very Strenuous.<br /> From the patrol cabin, climb switchbacks through whitebark pine forest to high ridge. An ice axe may be necessary through July.</p> <h3>Name Origin</h3> <p>There are several theories for this name. The most likely is that a member of the 1899 Thomas Bannon survey party wandered into the canyon and was never seen again.</p>",

The original log-crib dam constructed in 1906-07, failed in 1910. In 1916, the Bureau of Reclamation completed a concrete dam raising the pool level by 39 feet. The increased water level flooded the surrounding forest, drowning many trees. Young men from the Civilian Conservation Corps helped to clear the shores of Jackson Lake and burn the slash piles during the Great Depression. Today, enjoy the views across Jackson Lake or fish in the Snake River below the dam.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>A log crib dam first impounded water in 1906 with a storage capacity of 300,000 acre feet. The dam failed in 1910. An earthen dam replaced the log crib in 1916 to raise the natural lake level by 39 feet increasing the capacity to 790,000 acre feet. In 1917, the channel was dredged downstream to further increase the reservoir capacity to 847,000 acre feet. During the 1980s, engineers drained the reservoir and reinforced the dam to withstand a M7.5 earthquake.</p>",

He moved the cabin to the shores of Jenny Lake in 1929. Today, the rustic Jenny Lake Visitor Center hosts over 250,000 visitors annually. A new outdoor plaza provides interpretive and directional information. A fully accessible trail system leads visitors to the lakeshore and boat dock.<br /> <br /> Access the majestic Grand Teton backcountry from several nearby trailheads - Lupine Meadows, Jenny Lake, String Lake or Leigh Lake. A short path leads from the visitor center to the east boat dock where you may cross the Jenny Lake or enjoy a one-hour scenic cruise.<br /> <br /> Visit this facility for trip planning information.

He moved to the Teton area in 1863 as a fur trapper. Jenny and Beaver Dick assisted the 1872 Hayden expedition - he as their guide, she with camp logistics. The Hayden Expedition named Jenny and Leigh lakes in their honor.</p> <h3>Building History</h3> <p>The Jenny Lake Visitor Center is also known as the Crandall Studio. Harrison Crandall homesteaded near the Cathedral Group Turnout in 1924. He raised 40 head of horses, but his interest was photography. He built his studio in 1927 and later secured the photography concession in the park. Like the Ranger Station, this building has been moved twice. Once from Cathedral Group turnout to the shores of Jenny Lake and then back from the lake to improve the lakeshore views.</p>",

Because the trip took so long and was so expensive, visitors tended to stay at dude ranches for weeks, if not the entire summer. Often, the same families would return year after year. However, with the growing popularity of the automobile in the 1930s and 40s and the advent of the \"tin can dude\" or automobile tourist, more people wanted to stay for just a few days and visit more locations-similar to the way people vacation today. A growing middle class also meant that more people had the means to travel, though generally not the freedom to take the entire summer off. These shifts changed the unique culture and camaraderie that once existed among the longtime guests and their hosts at dude ranches, and many ranches ceased operating altogether.</p>",

Later that year, Petzoldt guided Lucas, who at age 58 became the second woman to reach the summit of the Grand Teton.<br /> <br /> Today, eleven of the old homestead buildings still stand at the base of the Grand Teton inspiring all who visit with the spectacular views that Geraldine saw.<br /> <br /> In 1998, the Geraldine Lucas Homestead and Fabian Place were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an Historic District.</p>",

She moved to the valley permanently in 1916 and contracted a cabin on the east side of Cottonwood Creek. She purchased the Menor homestead in 1918 and had her cabin moved to the homestead. With her partner Frederick Sandell, she ferried increasing numbers of visitors across the Snake River and ran the Ferry Ranch Store.<br /> <br /> In 1923, a group of local residents and Horace Albright, Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, met at Noble's cabin to discuss their concerns over commercial development along the base of the Teton Range. The alarmed meeting participants discussed ways to save the valley from tawdry exploitation. They agreed that some sort of preserve would be necessary to protect the \"Old West\" character of the valley, though their concept of a preserve was different from a national park. The group decided to seek a wealthy individual who would be willing to buy private land to donate to the preserve -- that person was John D. Rockefeller, Jr.<br /> <br /> In 1927, a steel truss bridge was built just south of the ferry, making it obsolete. Maud Noble sold the property to the Snake River Land Company in 1929.</p>",

The cabin was constructed in three distinct phases. Menor built the west wing in 1894 (the Tetons are to the west). Around 1895, he added the central section. The larger east wing was built around 1905. The west wing served as a bedroom and sitting room while the central section housed the kitchen and pantry. Menor opened a store in the east wing where settlers and travelers could purchase tobacco, coffee, tea, sugar, flour, canned foods and some items of clothing. The store, ferry and blacksmith shop generated cash to supplement Menor's subsistence farming.<br /> <br /> Except for a few items such as glass and nails, pioneers used local materials to construct shelters. Abundant stands of nearby lodgepole pine provided a convenient source of lumber. The rough-sawn boards of the central section indicate the presence of a sawmill in the valley around 1894. Menor painted his cabin with lime-based white-wash that he got from his brother, Holiday Menor who homesteaded across the river. Holiday Menor quarried lime from Blacktail Butte and prepared it in a kiln near the east landing of the ferry.</p>",

Burt became a strong conservationist in his own right and a key advocate for the future Grand Teton National Park, using his position of prominence to generate support for it. In 1930, he sold his share in the Bar BC to demonstrate the importance of preserving the valley as a park, and he and his family relocated to a ranch farther north. Burt also encouraged his friend, John D.

In 1926, the Murie brothers began their master's degree programs at the University of Michigan in the young science of ecology. While Olaus' studies were a one-year break in his Biological Survey work, Adolph completed his Ph.D. with a firm commitment to the value of all wildlife.<br /> <br /> Through his career as a wildlife biologist, Adolph's research challenged long-standing values in wildlife management. His groundbreaking studies on carnivores opened the door to our modern understanding of predator-prey relationships. His 1937 study of coyotes in Yellowstone National Park was the first serious predator study in the park service's history. His findings ignited a controversy by stating the value of all species and condemning the ongoing practice of killing coyotes in the park.<br /> <br /> Adolph served as Grand Teton National Park's only biologist throughout the 1950s. Even as they held long assignments in Alaska and other places during Adolph's thirty-year Park Service career, the Homestead cabin at the Ranch remained Adolph and Louise's home base.</p>",

Facing east, the long ridge climbs south from the Gros Ventre River rising above tree line as if a person is lying down. Further south, the ridge rises more steeply as a series of limestone cliffs forming the person's crossed arms. A notch forms the neck and chin while the face slopes to the south. Steep limestone cliffs wrap around the face forming the Indian's headdress. Some visualize the Indian quite easily; some do not. </p><h3>Name Origin</h3><p>The official name of this summer is Sheep Mountain for the bighorn sheep that graze on its slope. The unofficial name is \"Sleeping Indian\" because it resembles an Indian chief wearing a feather headdress stretched out on his back. Limestone cliffs form the headdress. This summit is part of the Gros Ventre Range extending south and east from Jackson Hole.</p><h3>History</h3><p>In 1925, a large landslide occurred on the north end of Sheep Mountain, damming the Gros Ventre River and forming Lower Slide Lake. In 1927, the natural dam partially failed and a torrent of water flooded across the valley. Six people were killed in Kelly and water was 3 feet deep in Wilson at the base of Teton Pass.</p>",

Originally a hunting and fishing guide, Leek rose to fame photographing starving elk in Jackson Hole during the harsh winters of the early 1900s. His conservation efforts lead to the establishment of the National Elk Refuge in 1912. Today, thousands of elk congregate on the refuge north of Jackson during winter seeking forage on their native wintering grounds. During summer, look for elk grazing in meadows along the Teton Park Road early in the morning or late in the evening. The heat of the day drives the elk into the cool shade of the adjacent lodgepole pine forest.</p><h3>Name Origin</h3><p>Stephen Leek was a cattle rancher, conservationist and entrepreneur. He settled in the southern part of the Jackson Hole valley in the 1880s. Before 1900, he established Leek's \"clubhouse\" on the north end of Leigh Lake and then Leek's Camp on the east shore of Jackson Lake as hunting and fishing camps. Later, Leek took photographs of starving and dying elk during the winter of 1908-09. He used these images in lectures, articles and tours to help publicize the dilemma. In 1912, Congress established the National Elk Refuge to provide wintering grounds for elk.</p>",

By turning the pilot wheel, the rope tightens on one side of the pulleys and loosens on the other rotating the ferry. When the captain angles the ferry toward the opposite bank, the pressure of the current against the pontoons pushes the ferry across the river. This type of ferry existed in ancient times and was used elsewhere in the United States.<br /><br />Menor charged 50 cents for a wagon and team and 25 cents for a rider and horse. Pedestrians road free if a wagon was crossing. When the water was too low for the ferry, Menor suspended a platform from the pulley, and three to four passengers could ride a primitive cablecar across the river. In later years, Menor and his neighbors built a bridge for winter use, dismantling it each spring.</p>",

During the early 1900s, they ventured north to visit Yellowstone and Jackson Hole and loved the area. Turner purchased a homestead from Bill Jump in 1926 and moved his family from Utah.<br /><br />Turner and his sons began building their home, first finishing the basement that summer. They hosted hunters that fall - housing them in the basement. The ranch began hosting dudes - wealthy Easterners who wanted to experience the old west. Dudes would often stay for more than a month at a time living and working on the ranch.<br /><br />In the late 1920s, the family sold the dude ranch to the Snake River Land Company, but continued to operate the ranch. The land became part of the expansion of Grand Teton National Park in 1950. Today, the fourth generation of Turners continues to operate the ranch as a concession within the park.</p>",

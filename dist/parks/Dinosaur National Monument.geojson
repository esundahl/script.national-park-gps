The species \"<em>louisae</em>\" was named after Andrew Carnegie's wife, Louise. Carnegie financed most of the excavations of the quarry at Dinosaur and had many of the specimens sent to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where they still stand in the museum that bears his name.<br /> <br /> The \"Discovery Bones\" that led to the discovery of the Carnegie Quarry were tail vertebrae (back bones) of <em>Apatosaurus louisae</em>. This specimen, a nearly complete skeleton with a skull, became the type specimen of <em>Apatosaurus louisae</em>. This means that it was the first of its species ever found and scientifically described.Like many sauropods and dinosaurs in general, <em>Apatosaurus</em> skulls are extremely rare. The skull bones are thin and easily crushed. Skulls are mostly hollow to hold soft tissues that cannot be preserved. Fine sediments compress the skull to flatten it the way you might step on an empty tin can. These skulls may be preserved, but some of the three-dimensional structure is lost.<br /> <br /> The only <em>Apatosaurus</em> skull in the world was found in the Carnegie Quarry because the sand-sized sediment preserves bone in great detail without compressing it. Today a cast of the <em>Apatosaurus</em> skull is still on display with the rest of the specimen at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

While standing behind the Quarry Visitor Center, look at the Frontier Sandstone cliff beside you. High above the trailhead sign and on the cliff, notice the wavy ripple marks within the large dark brown patches. These ripples were created when water moved over sand. If you were hiking here approximately 100 million years ago, you would have been walking along the sandy shores of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. <a href=\"https://www.cretaceousatlas.org/geology/\">Cretaceous Atlas of Ancient Life | Geology</a> A vast difference from the high desert environment of today!<br /> <br /> On the ground, behind and to the left of the trailhead sign is another notable feature, a huge chocolate-colored rocky sphere known as a concretion. This concretion also has a delightful star-shaped crack that filled in with minerals which crystalized. Concretions are masses of mineral matter embedded in the sandstone. They often form when minerals settling out ground water gather around a nucleus, such as a pebble or shell. Concretions can be any size, but the hefty dimensions of this one (and others here) is due to the presence of large amounts of water from the former seaway. <br /> <br /> While staying on the trail, there are a number of other large concretions in this area How many others can you locate? Hint: There are five others, but some are badly weathered and have broke apart.<br /> <br /> As you proceed along the Frontier Formation, you may see animals such as squirrels, marmots, birds, rabbits, snakes, or lizards. <a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/Search/SpeciesList/DINO\">NPSpecies- Search for a Park Species List</a><br /> Keep wildlife wild and yourself safe by observing all creatures from a distance.<br /> <br /> Once you reach the end of the Frontier Formation, just around the corner, you'll see how ancient people used the geology here. Petroglyphs were pecked into this rock with tools to make symbols of people, animals or patterns. Pictographs are painted symbols. These were created approximately 1,000 years ago by ancient people archaeologists call the Fremont. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dino/learn/historyculture/fremont-culture.htm\">Fremont Culture - Dinosaur National Monument (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a>. Since the Fremont did not have a written language (as did the Egyptians for example, with their hieroglyphs) the exact meaning of the Fremont symbols is unknown.<br /> Help us protect these and all petroglyph sites for future generations by not touching them. <br /> <br /> Hike on to discover the next chapter in our ancient book - the Mowry Shale Formation.",

Its pencil-like teeth were only in the front of the jaws and were used to strip leaves off of low-growing plants. It could get up to 92 ft (28 m) in length and traveled in small herds.

        "notes": "Echo Park Overlook\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/echoparkoverlook.htm\n\nFrom here you can see directly down into Echo Park. Beyond Steamboat Rock, just out of sight, is the confluence of the Green and Yampa rivers. Both are part of the Upper Colorado River system, and each has its own unique story.<br /> <br /> From almost the beginning of American settlement in the West, demand for water has exceeded availability. In 1950, the United States Bureau of Reclamation presented the Colorado River Storage Project, a proposal to construct several dams throughout the Colorado River system. The initial project included a dam downstream of Echo Park that would have flooded both the Green and Yampa rivers, destroying many of the natural and cultural features that had been protected as part of Dinosaur National Monument since a boundary expansion in 1938.<br /> <br /> This proposed dam had the potential to set a precedent that put every national park and monument at risk of development, and environmental groups took a strong stand against it. The movement to defeat the Echo Park Dam garnered tremendous public support and ultimately was successful. However, a dam was still built upstream on the Green River at Flaming Gorge.<br /> <br /> In its natural state, the Green River flooded almost every spring, carrying loads of silt and scouring its banks. Life in the river was so well-adapted to this environment that many organisms depended on this seasonal influx of water and sediment to survive. In 1964, the Flaming Gorge Dam was completed, trapping silt behind its walls and regulating water flow at a constant rate. Native species, ill-adapted to this cold, clear water, began to suffer. <br /> <br /> Today, the dam regulates water releases in an attempt to mimic the natural rhythms of the Green River and aid in the recovery of native species.<br /> <br /> The Yampa River stands in contrast to the today’s Green River. The Yampa is the last major free-flowing tributary in the Colorado River System. It serves as a sanctuary to native fish and invertebrates, like mayflies, that are adapted to its natural fluctuations. Where the two rivers meet at Echo Park, the Yampa rejuvenates the Green with its warm, silty waters for miles downstream, effectively creating a hybrid river, both regulated and wild.",

These designs include both petroglyphs (patterns chipped or carved into the rock) and pictographs (patterns painted on the rock). Pictographs are relatively rare here, perhaps because they are more easily weathered. Some petroglyphs show traces of pigment, possibly indicating that many designs originally included both carved and painted areas. These designs are very fragile. Touching the petroglyphs and pictographs can damage the designs by leaving oils behind that abrade the rock. Tracing and rubbings can damage the soft sandstone designs. For these reasons, please do not touch the designs.<br /> <br /> The style and content of indigenous designs vary throughout the region. The “Classic Vernal Style” predominates in Dinosaur National Monument. This style is characterized by humanlike figures, animal-like figures, and abstract designs. Human figures typically have trapezoidal bodies, which may or may not include arms, legs, fingers, and toes. Elaborate decorations on the bodies suggest headdresses, earrings, necklaces, shields, or other objects. Why did these ancestral cultures create these designs and what did they mean? Perhaps the designs served some ceremonial or religious purpose, related to hunting activities, identified clans, or simply expressed the artist’s imagination – or perhaps all or none of these. Attempts to interpret the designs by comparing them with recent Native American groups may provide clues, but the true meaning remains a mystery.",

After emerging from the Flaming Gorge Dam, the river wanders placidly through an open valley beginning 30 miles upstream from here. Early trappers and traders to the area named this valley Browns Hole after Baptiste Brown, a French-Canadian trapper. He choose this area to settle because of its mild winters and plentiful beaver pelts.<br /> <br /> Travelers that passed through the area later included John Wesley Powell on his historic float through the Grand Canyon. Powell gave the area its current name of Browns Park. However, most local cattle ranchers still referred to the valley as Browns Hole until a spirited young Elizabeth Bassett convinced them to adopt what she termed the much more “eloquent” name of Browns Park. Because of its isolation, Browns Park served as home to not only ranchers but also outlaws including Butch Cassidy, Matt Warner, and the notorious bounty hunter Tom Horn. Today, Browns Park remains sparsely populated by people, but it provides critical habitat for a variety of wildlife.",

No one knows for sure why this is the case, but one theory suggests that a few million years ago the river flowed eastward, away from the mountains. When that route was blocked by uplift along the present continental divide, drainage in this area stagnated. Browns Park gradually filled to the brim with sediments. Meandering along on top of that fill, the Green River eventually spilled over the buried crest of the mountains and down their southern slope. This gave it the energy to begin down cutting once more and as it washed out most of the recent sediments, it also rasped its way into the older rocks to carve the Canyon of Lodore.",

As the west became more settled with the arrival of Europeans, the bighorn sheep began to die out from a combination of over hunting, disease, and competition from domestic livestock. The last native bighorn sheep seen in Dinosaur was reported in 1944. In 1952 a new herd of animals from elsewhere in Colorado were transplanted into the area. Their population has increased significantly to the point where bighorn sheep are now a common sight along the river corridors.

This evening, as I write, the sun is going down and the shadows are settling in the canyon… and now it is a dark portal to a region of gloom, the gateway through which we are to enter on our voyage of exploration tomorrow, what shall we find?”<br />  <br /> John Wesley Powell wrote these words as he camped near here on June 7, 1869, expressing the combination of excitement and fear he and his companions often felt as they made the first full length expedition down the Green River. Since most of this canyon country was still literally a blank spot on the map, Powell and his men had the opportunity to fill in the blanks with new names. Andy Hall, the youngster of the group, suggested the name of this canyon after recalling “The Cataract of Lodore” by the English poet Robert Southey: “All at once and all o’er, with a mighty uproar and this way the water comes down at Lodore.”<br /> <br /> These lines soon proved to be appropriate, for the first large rapid below here wrecked one of the party’s four wooden boats and earned itself the name Disaster Falls. The crew salvaged what they could, and approached the later rapids more cautiously. Powell ultimately floated all the way down the Green and Colorado Rivers through the Grand Canyon.",

River running is very popular in Dinosaur National Monument. The monument uses a permit system both for boater safety and to reduce the impact of too many people concentrated in narrow canyons. To some, imposition of such regulations is contradictory to the freedom of wilderness travel; to others, some control necessary to preserve the wilderness itself. How we protect our public lands, while also allowing for their use, is a continual debate.<br /> <br /> Rafters may not have been able to enjoy these wild rivers if proposed dams had been constructed within the monument boundaries. The Echo Park Dam would have flooded the entire Canyon of Lodore and also that of the Yampa River, the Green’s major tributary. Protestors of the dam pointed out that Dinosaur National Monument had been enlarged to protect these canyons in their natural state, not as artificial reservoirs. After years of contentious debate in the 1950s and 60s, the decision was made to not build a dam within the monument boundaries.<br /> <br /> Though the water that passes through the Gates of Lodore today is not quite the wild and unknown torrent that Powell saw, it is still a flowing river. The current still gnaws inch by inch into ancient rock; beaver still burrow and feed along the banks; bighorn still find footholds on the canyon walls; and modern explorers thrilled by the sights, the roar of a rapid and the song of a canyon wren can attest that this river is a rare and valuable resource.",

Beginning in the 1870s, early settlers altered the landscape to suit their needs. Great cattle herds once roamed the range. Unlike native animals, cattle grazed on native grasses faster than they could reproduce and new invasive plants took their place. Cheat grass is one of the most common of these species. Originally introduced in grain shipments from the Mediterranean, it spread rapidly across the American west. Not only does it provide poor forage for native animals, but its seeds have the ability to hitchhike to new destinations by catching in fur or your socks.",

In drier weather, the river may live up to its name, flowing cold and green all the way from Flaming Gorge Dam, which traps most of its sediments. The dam’s greatest affect is not the river’s color, but its flow. After its completion in 1969, the great spring floods of former years are now trapped behind the dam. This altered the habitat downstream and made it more difficult for native fish to survive. In response, dam operators release extra water in the spring to<br /> simulate natural flooding and create conditions for the fish to spawn successfully.

Partly due to the weight of these sediments, the land gradually sank and the sediments piled up, reaching a thickness of over 24,000 feet.

The Utah juniper, however, manages to cover much of this arid country. What it lacks in stature, the juniper makes up for in toughness, longevity, the fragrance of its wood, and the beauty of its often gnarled, twisted trunks. Also, from a more utilitarian viewpoint, junipers have fueled many a campfire since prehistoric times, supported miles of fences and perhaps right now are providing you with a bit of welcome shade.<br /> <br /> The junipers’ companion in much of the canyon country forests is the pinyon (piñon) pine. Though you might think of pines as growing best on snow-capped mountains, many species, especially the pinyon group are well adapted to lower, drier areas. All leaves have pores through which plants breathe but in pine needles these are sunk in deep pits. Along with a waxy coating the needles help to reduce the amount of moisture lost through evaporation. Also, in many pines a type of root fungus helps draw water from the soil, since the fine strands of the fungus can penetrate into more nooks and crannies than relatively coarse roots. Perhaps you’ve seen or tasted the “pine nuts” sold throughout the Southwest. These are the seeds of the pinyon pine, borne in small cones which ripen in the fall. Harvesting them is a fall tradition for many native cultures. Additionally, pinyon seeds are a staple food for wildlife including the Clarks Nutcracker, Golden Mantled Ground Squirrel and the Juniper Titmouse.",

You’ll also find the trailhead for a moderate 2 mile (3.2 km) roundtrip trail that features unsurpassed views of the Mitten Park Fault and Whirlpool Canyon, often complimented by the sound of the river echoing up the cliffs.",

Look for dark black ravens that are at home in the canyon country you see before you. Typically traveling in pairs, they are generalist species and are able to survive in almost all the environments found in the monument, from high forests to low dry deserts. Other birds you may encounter along the trail include the melodious Mountain Chickadee, the vibrant blue Scrub Jay, the mischievous Black-billed Magpie, and the boisterous Dark Eyed Junco.<br /> <br /> If you glance behind you into the trees, you might see a bird that is uniquely adapted to this environment. In high forests across the west, the black and gray Clark’s Nutcracker can be seen flashing from tree to tree. They have a specially designed beak that allows them to pry open pinecones and remove their seeds; underneath their tongue they have a unique pouch that allows them to store the seeds so they can cache them for later use. In preparation for winter, they will hide seeds all around the forest.

Look closely at the rocks beneath your feet, you may be able to spot the clam-like shells of brachiopods, and pieces of the stems of crinoids or “sea lilies,” animals actually related to starfish.

To us, accustomed as we are to thinking in terms of minutes, hours, and days, the scene may look like the result of some chaotic upheaval but it wasn’t. All around us the forces that shaped it are still in action. Rivers deepen their channels grain by grain; minor earth tremors occur daily in one place or another; and lands have risen or fallen, slowly but measurably, within historic times. We measure our history in years, but the Earth measures time in millions of years, enough time for each tiny change to be multiplied over and over into a major change. The upturned layers of the Mitten Park Fault below you dramatize such a change. This is the same fault noted at stop number seven, but here the Green River has sliced through it to reveal the broken rocks in cross section. Movement along the fault probably began with the uplifting of the region around 50 million years ago, and may have continued off and on almost to the present. Each shift, perhaps accompanied by what we would call a major earthquake, might have been only a few inches, but over the ages many little shifts added up to a total displacement of about 3,000 feet (920 meters) from one side of the fault to the other.",

While our changes are usually not on the same scale as natural forces, they often occur much more rapidly. In the 1950s, controversy arose over a proposal to build a dam for water storage and power generation in Dinosaur National Monument directly below this point at the head of Whirlpool Canyon. Many people protested that the Green and Yampa Canyons deserved to remain in their natural state. Ultimately, the protests were heeded and a dam was instead built at Flaming Gorge, 70 miles (113 Kilometers) upstream on the Green River from here.<br /> <br /> Even though the dam was located outside the monument, it still affects this area. Stream side plants, some considered invasive, are no longer scoured out by spring floods and are spreading. Native fish, adapted to muddy water have retreated to the Yampa River because most of the Green River’s sediment now settles behind the dam. Four of these fish are now Federally listed as Endangered Species.<br /> <br /> Changes such as these may or may not seem significant, but they illustrate an important, sometimes forgotten fact: despite our power to shape our world, we are still subject to interdependent, natural processes. Every change we make sets in motion more changes, often far reaching and acting faster than some natural systems can react.<br /> <br /> National Parks and Monuments were created to preserve places like Harpers Corner. If you could come back 100 years from now, what changes do you think you would see?

Today, it is maintained as an historic site.<br /> <br /> Before the Chew family came to the area, Pool Creek was the home of a colorful character named Pat Lynch. Pat wandered into the area in the early 1880s and for 30 years lived a hermit’s life in caves and cabins along the lower Yampa Canyon and Pool Creek. The latter area is often called Pat’s Hole after him.<br /> <br /> The canyon walls have sheltered people since ancient times.

The ruggedness of the land limited exploration by routes other than by water. William H. Ashley, a trapper looking for beaver pelts, conducted the first recorded expedition down the Green River in 1825. In the weeks that it took his party to pass through these canyons, the rapids nearly wiped out his small, hide covered bullboats. Having survived the ordeal, Ashley and his men went on to explore other areas of the American West.<br /> <br /> Nearly half a century passed before the Green River was seriously challenged again, this time by John Wesley Powell in 1869. Powell’s group lost a wooden boat in a rapid upstream from here, which they appropriately named Disaster Falls. Echo Park, where they listened to their voices bouncing off Steamboat Rock, was a welcome rest after days of battling white water. The party followed the Green to its junction with the Colorado River and continued on through the Grand Canyon. Echo Park, where Powell camped, remains a peaceful retreat.",

As the seas retreated, windswept sand dunes piled up to become the light colored Weber sandstone of the Yampa Canyon’s cliffs and domes. When geologic forces uplifted this area to its present elevation, faulting occurred. The rock layers were bent and broken as some blocks of land were pushed higher than others. You are standing on the edge of one of the high blocks from which the younger sandstone has been eroded away. In the low block to the east erosion has not progressed as far.

He found it here, in the area known as Pool Creek. In a time and place where self-reliance was as necessary as water, Pool Creek provided the raw materials the Chew family needed to build their future. In addition to critical water sources, the surrounding hills offered good winter grazing and timber for building homes, storage houses, fences, and fires in the cold winter. In their time here, the Chew family planted orchards and gardens, and dug irrigation ditches. With hard work and nature's support, they made a home that sustained them for more than half a century. Jack's son, Rial Chew, sold the 1,900 acres of the ranch within Dinosaur National Monument to the National Park Service in 1966.<br /> <br />  ",

How is that possible? Two large blocks of land have slipped downward along the Yampa Fault and the Red Rock Fault, forming giant steps, or benches. Although the underlying rock of each bench is the same Weber Sandstone, differences in elevation and moisture dramatically affect the vegetation. Sagebrush and grasses dominate the lower benches, while pinyon pines and juniper trees forest this area. The pinyon-juniper landscape at this stop is a hallmark of many arid areas in the West. At Dinosaur, these forests support diverse native vegetation and can be very old. Intense fires, capable of altering entire stands of trees, are fairly rare here; some pinyons are over 700 years old. Today, pinyons and junipers are almost always associated with each other and are expected to be seen together, but this has not always been the case. Junipers actually arrived in the area about 9000 years ago. Pinyons arrived much later, around the mid-1200s.",

There, between Whirlpool Canyon and Split Mountain Canyon, the Green River flows placidly in island dotted channels. This grassy area near the river features abundant forage, attracting many early settlers, including the Ruple family. In April 1883, Henry and May Ruple homesteaded in Island Park and established a cattle ranch. They built a multi-story cabin with a stone fireplace—a fine house for anyone in such a remote area. After they finished construction, they were 18 miles from the nearest neighbors. The family ran cattle from Island Park to Wild Mountain, 10 miles away. In 1915, the Ruple’s son Hod took over the property and switched from cattle to sheep ranching. Sheep were better suited to the harsh, high desert climate and were an important part of the region’s early economy. The Ruples sold the majority of the property in 1945, but the family still retains a portion of the original homestead outside of the monument boundary.",

This montane forest is only found over 7000 feet elevation and covers less than 5% of Dinosaur’s<br /> 211,000 acres.<br /> <br /> Douglas-fir trees live an incredibly long time; some are hundreds of years old. Over the years, they have survived many harsh winters and provided animals with food and shelter. Each cone contains 20 to 30 winged seeds, dispersed by wind. These seeds provide critical nourishment to a variety of birds and small mammals like mice, voles, shrews, and chipmunks.<br /> <br /> Aspen trees have also adapted to this higher elevation. The thin white layer of outer bark conceals a green layer underneath. This part of the bark is photosynthetic, allowing these trees to produce energy throughout the winter when leaves are absent. An entire stand of trees is often only one individual organism sharing an interconnected root system. As conifers grow and eventually replace aspen trees, the root system remains dormant underground for years. While a forest fire may destroy a conifer stand, it provides aspens with an opportunity to regrow, beginning the cycle anew.",

Sometimes these differences are subtle, sometimes striking. Most of the Morrison Formation is mudstone and clay, but watch for the trail spur that follows a sandstone cliff. This part of the Morrison Formation is made up of river-deposited sand and gravel. Based on radiometric dating from volcanic ash, in older and younger layers on either side of the sandstone wall, this layer is estimated to be about 151 million years old. Fossil fragments of dinosaurs are embedded in the cliff along with impressions of freshwater clams. The Morrison Formation trail spur follows the same sandstone layer that is exposed in the Quarry Exhibit Hall. However, this cliff has not been worked on by paleontologists to make the bones easier to see. The first fossils along the spur are fragments that are shiny and dark orange in color. Some have a spongey-looking interior which contained bone marrow. Their texture is generally smooth and their size ranges from 1/2 inch to 10 inches in diameter. <br /> <br /> As you hike along the cliff, the quality and size of the fossil bones increases. Just past the mid-point of the spur, the trail dips a few feet. From here, look up about 10 feet on the cliff face to see eight vertebrae. At the very end of the spur, a large femur rests in the rock. Sharp eyes can find more bones, depending on the angle of the sun. More than eleven species of dinosaurs have been discovered in the Morrison Formation within the monument. They range in size from about seven inches to nearly 100 feet, with some sauropods exceeding 50,000 pounds. New research on non-dinosaur fossils such as small animals, plant remains, pollen, and insect trackways tell us more about the environment in which these animals lived. Based on this research, scientists believe that around 150 million years ago, the area was semi-arid and warm, with year-round streams. Ferns dominated the plant life, along with conifers, ginkgo trees, tree ferns and horsetail rushes. <br /> <br /> When you return to the main trail, you return to the mudstone and clay layers of the Morrison Formation. Soon you will leave the Jurassic period and enter the Cretaceous, marked by a brown sandstone in the Cedar Mountain Formation. A species of sauropod named Abydosaurus mcintoshii was found during the 1990s in this formation in the monument, proving that paleontologists still have much left to discover. ",

The older Muddy Sandstone contains 100 million year old beach sand stained bright orange and yellow by iron-rich minerals. The younger Frontier Sandstone, formed from 90 million year old beach sediments. Along the coast of an ancient sea, volcanoes (near the present California/Nevada border) spewed ash which fell into salty waters. By studying minerals decaying in the shale, geologists determined that the ash was deposited between 99 and 97 million years ago. The ash likely killed most of the fish swimming here. Currents at the bottom of the sea then scattered their scales. Look for tiny, shiny gray-to-golden fish scales fossilized in these rocks. Taking the time to discover even the tiniest of fossils can bring ancient ecosystems to life in our imaginations. ",

Garbage cans are located near the visitor centers, at day-use areas and in campgrounds.</p> <h4><strong>Your Pet's Safety</strong></h4> <p><strong>Never Leave Pets in an Enclosed Vehicle!</strong> Do not leave pets inside a closed vehicle for even short periods of time, especially in the summer. On even a mildly warm day, the temperature in a parked car can rise to 120°f or more in a matter of minutes - even with the car windows partially open. Pets can quickly overheat and die.</p> <p>Dinosaur National Monument weather is semi-arid with hot summers. There is little to no shade. Do any hiking with your pet in the early morning or near sunset. Remember to carry plenty of water for you and your pet.</p> <p>Dinosaur National Monument is home to a variety of wildlife that can be dangerous to you and your pet such as mountain lions and bears. Even a female deer will become aggressive to protect her young. Always keep your pet on a leash.</p> <p>Many of the wildlife in Dinosaur National Monument carry diseases or parasites such as fleas that may transmit diseases such as rabies, tularemia and plague. Do not let your pet get close to or eat dead animals. Keep your pet on a leash at all times.</p> <br />   <h4>Need a Kennel?</h4> Nearby local communities may have kennels for your pets. Contact local organizations to locate a kennel. <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" summary=\"\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dino/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Utah Welcome Center</a><br /> Jensen, UT<br /> 435-789-4002</td> <td><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dino/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Colorado Welcome Center</a><br /> Dinosaur, CO<br /> 970-374-2205</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dino/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Dinosaurland Travel Board</a><br /> Vernal, UT<br /> 435-789-6932<br /> 800-477-5558</td> <td valign=\"top\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dino/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Rangely Chamber of Commerce</a><br /> Rangely, CO<br /> 970-675-5290</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dino/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Craig Chamber of Commerce</a><br /> Craig, CO<br /> 800-864-4405</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br />   <h2>Service Animals</h2> <h4>How \"Service Animal\" Is Defined</h4> <p>Service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA).</p> <p>This definition does not affect or limit the broader definition of \"assistance animal\" under the Fair Housing Act or the broader definition of \"service animal\" under the Air Carrier Access Act.</p> <p>Some State and local laws also define service animal more broadly than the ADA does. Information about such laws can be obtained from the State attorney general's office.</p> <h4>Where Service Animals Are Allowed</h4> <p>Under the ADA, State and local governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is normally allowed to go.</p> <h4>Service Animals Must Be Under Control</h4> <p>Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the individual's disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.</p> <h4>Inquiries, Exclusions, Charges, and Other Specific Rules Related to Service Animals</h4> <ul> <li>When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.</li> <li>Allergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals. When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.</li> <li>A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or (2) the dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal's presence.</li> <li>People with disabilities who use service animals cannot be isolated from other patrons, treated less favorably than other patrons, or charged fees that are not charged to other patrons without animals.</li> <li>Staff are not required to provide care or food for a service animal.</li> </ul>",

Along the Echo Park Road, a sign directs visitors down a short trail where a sheer cliff stands opposite a creek. Carved into the cliff about 35 feet (10.5 m) above ground level are several figures. The ancestral indigenous people of the region created these petroglyphs approximately a thousand years ago. But how did they place their designs so high up? Back when these petroglyphs were first carved, the ground's surface extended to the level where the petroglyphs are now.

The noticeable curve of Split Mountain is part of an anticline - an upward fold of rock. While Split Mountain arcs up, other features seem to sag. The sags are called synclines. This underlying rollercoaster of rock formed when formerly flat sedimentary layers were compressed and wrinkled. Forces related to the building of the Rocky and Uinta Mountains 70 - 40 million years ago caused the uplifting, tilting, faulting and folding of the rock layers. While some layers erode into mounds, others stick out as ridges. <br /> <br /> Erosion reveals not only a variety of shapes, but also an array of colors. Look back across the Moenkopi Formation labyrinth you just traversed. In the distance you will see a swath of red rock known as “The Racetrack.” The “lanes” are made up of Triassic-aged Moenkopi and Chinle formations, seemingly wrapping around the corner. These rust colored rocks are rich in iron and are sometimes called the Triassic Red Beds. Iron is also responsible for many of the yellow, orange and greenish tints to the rock layers here. Obviously inspired by the colors and shapes from near this ridge, Ernest Untermann brought his paints and easel to this area in the mid-1900s. A German immigrant, he became known as “The Artist of the Uintas,” and Dinosaur’s dramatic landscapes spoke to him. The sedimentary rocks around you were originally flat, horizontal layers when they were deposited. Each layer represents its own story of a different past environment, different fauna and flora, a succession of time and life on our planet. For millions of years, these stories were buried deep underground. Thanks to uplift and erosion, they are once again free to tell colorful tales of change over time.",

Take a minute here to inspect the crusty biological soil. It is mostly cyanobacteria (sometimes called blue-green algae), and also includes lichens, mosses, green algae, microfungi and bacteria. It takes many years for this soil to form and support life. While cyanobacteria are mobile and will regenerate if disturbed, lichens and mosses are not, and will die if trampled. Blown by wind or moved by other forces, it is estimated that lichens will recolonize an area in 45 years, while it takes mosses an estimated 250 years.

The drug ephedrine, an antidepressant and decongestant, can be extracted from this and other Ephedra species. This area is a great place to look for animal tracks, scat, and game trails. Can you distinguish between carnivore and herbivore scat? Look for fur and bones in the long, slender pieces of mountain lion, coyote, and bobcat scat. Deer, elk and rabbit scat will be more smooth and rounded. You may see game trails in this area, made primarily by elk and deer. See if you can distinguish these game trails from the people trail you are following!",

Solitude and refuge are two things that national parks and monuments offer. These are places to reflect, learn, and experience nature. Also protected are other qualities such as dark night skies and natural quiet — rare commodities in cities where many of us live. Growing around you on the slope are Utah junipers. The most common tree species in Utah, it covers one-fifth of the land area of the state. It seems like they can grow nearly anywhere, even out of solid rock. Their roots are the secret. A massive system that makes up 2/3 of the tree’s total mass, the tap root can be 25 feet deep and lateral roots may extend out 100 feet. The juniper berry is actually a tiny pinecone, and is eaten by rabbit, fox, coyote, and many species of birds. Junipers grow slowly. Older trees, which may be 650-850 years old, have sculptural qualities. Even dead, a juniper may stand silent and strong for several hundred years. Like all of the plants at this 5,000 foot elevation, the juniper must survive on a sparse 10 inches of precipitation a year.<br /> <br /> As you hike, check out the sky and you may see a Turkey Vulture or two, flying on silent wings high above you. Lightweight for such a wide wingspan, they teeter and totter on the breeze, rarely flapping their wings. An excellent sense of smell leads Turkey Vultures to carcasses where they feed cooperatively. Think of these silent birds not as purveyors of death, but rather as elegant birds who transform death into life on the wing. Look carefully at each soaring bird and you may be lucky to see a Golden Eagle, easily confused with a vulture at first glance. The Golden Eagle, at 10 pounds, is a much heavier bird, outweighing the vulture by 6 pounds. Eagles do not teeter and totter, and they hold their wings out flat, while vultures hold their wings in a slight V-shape. Both are dark birds, the vulture is here only during the summer, the eagle a year-round bird. Perhaps a lizard has caught your attention during your hike, lending even more life to the desert. Six species of lizards are found here:<br /> sagebrush, plateau, western whiptail, shorthorned, side-blotched and tree lizard. Listen for lizards rustling about in the leaf litter, looking for spiders or insects to eat.",

Surviving by means of deep roots and sheer perseverance, they often take on a dwarfed appearance. Unlike most species of ash trees, which have compound leaves, this western ash has a single leaf on each stem. The red rock ridge underneath you is the Chinle Formation, formed during a time when rivers, marshes, and small lakes covered the landscape. Plants would not have included a flowering tree like the Singleleaf Ash. Instead, conifers, cycads, ferns, and horsetail plants grew here. Dinosaurs made their first appearance in this time period, about 225 million years ago. Coelophysis, a three-toed, therapod dinosaur about the size of a large dog, roamed the land.

Erosion continues with each new rainstorm moving more sediment downstream. Differences in the sediment layers help natural cavities develop. Holes may be enlarged and used by squirrels and birds, as nesting sites. Listen carefully and you may hear the scratchy call of a Rock Wren or the melodic song of a Canyon Wren.

It is above your head, in the crevice between the two large rocks that form the overhang. Look for twigs, rocks and fecal pellets, all held together by shiny crystallized urine. Middens can tell us about past environments. They may exist and be added to for thousands of years. Radiocarbon dating has identified middens up to 50,000 years old. Middens may contain leaves, seeds, fruit, twigs, pollen, bone, shells and scales, leading to identification of past environments. We know from middens that Douglas Fir and Ponderosa Pine once grew in this area, during a cooler and wetter time. As the climate changed over the last 10,000 years, these species retreated to higher elevations where they are still found.<br /> <br /> You may notice some plant stumps with large root structures. Why would monument staff cut down these plants? Look around for the feathery leaves of tamarisk, also known as salt cedar. If it is blooming, it will have small, white to pink flowers. It is a non-native tree that grows in riparian areas. Brought to North America in the early 19th century for use as an ornamental wind break, and to fight erosion, it quickly spread and became an invasive weed, often outcompeting native plants. Its presence on the river banks of the Green and Yampa Rivers, and here in this intermittent stream, changes river flow and makes it difficult for deer, elk, and sheep to get to water. In 2006 and 2007, Dinosaur National Monument introduced<br /> 50,000 non-native northern tamarisk beetles to four locations in the monument. The most intensively studied biocontrol agent in North America, the beetle eats only tamarisk.

This feature reminded an early traveler of a derby hat and inspired the name Plug Hat Butte, with a “crown” of Entrada Sandstone and a “band” of red Carmel Formation. As you drive around the butte, look for sweeping cross-beds of fine sand grains in the “brim” of Nugget Sandstone, indicating that this rock layer began as windblown desert sand dunes.<br /> <br /> At the Plug Hat Butte picnic area, several viewpoints and short walks introduce you to the Colorado Plateau. Sedimentary rock layers across Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona were uplifted to form a table-like region, or plateau, drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries. The scene before you is typical of the plateau’s colorful strata, flat topped mesas, buttes, and sheer walled canyons. Lack of soil and plant cover contributes to the visibility of these landforms.",

Anon, at the word, there first came one daughter, and then came another, to second and third the request of their brother, and to hear how the water comes down at Lodore, with its rush and its roar, as many a time they had seen it before. So I told them in rhyme, for of rhymes I had store; and ‘twas in my vocation for their recreation that so I should sing; because I was laureate to them and the king. From its sources which well In the tarn on the fell; from its fountains In the mountains, its rills and its gills; through moss and through brake, it runs and it creeps for a while, till it sleeps In its own little lake. And thence at departing, awakening and starting, it runs through the reeds, and away it proceeds, through meadow and glade, in sun and in shade, and through the wood-shelter, among crags in its flurry, helter-skelter, hurry-skurry. Here it comes sparkling, and there it lies darkling; now smoking and frothing Its tumult and wrath in, till, in this rapid race on which it is bent, it reaches the place of its steep descent.”<br /> <br /> Excerpt from “ The Catarct of Lodore” by Robert Southey",

Each rock layer was formed in a certain environment at a specific time. Geologists call those discrete layers formations. The formation on either side of the road here formed in streams and rivers during the late Triassic Period, resulting in a coarse-grained, gritty yellow and tan sandstone. Utah is famous for red rocks which contain oxidized iron minerals that were exposed to air. Often nearby there are green rocks that are reduced iron minerals which altered in water. The yellow colors in the sandstone right here are also result from a mixture of materials, including iron oxides, sulfides, and silicates, called limonite.",

Paleontologists find this rock attractive for more than its colors; a few of its outcrops contain 150 million year old dinosaur fossils like those found at the Dinosaur Quarry. The formation originated as muds and sands laid down by a network of ancient rivers whose water nourished an abundance of plants, dinosaurs, and other animals. It is thought that during times of drought the river would dry up and there would be massive die-offs. Dinosaur carcasses collected in the river bed. When the rains returned, the river flowed again and transported bones and carcasses then buried them in sand and mud where they were preserved.",

Over the last century, grazing has been a primary use of the land in and around Dinosaur National Monument. Today, grazing is still allowed at certain locations within the monument’s boundary. Many of the families permitted to pasture their animals here originally homesteaded in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, prior to the establishment of the monument.<br /> <br /> In those days, cattle rustling was a common trade in this part of the country. Trail Draw, the small canyon before you, was part of what is now known as the Outlaw Trail. This famous backcountry route snaked through desolate, rugged terrain from Montana to New Mexico, linking well-known hideouts such as Hole in the Wall and Robber’s Roost. The most notorious outlaws that used this route were known as the Wild Bunch, led by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Legend holds that the infamous duo originally met in Browns Park, an area just north of the monument. Abundant grasslands and relatively warm winters attracted settlers to Browns Park as early as the 1870s. Outlaws frequented this isolated valley to rest and resupply.<br /> <br /> Two local residents, Ann and Josie, also known as the Bassett sisters, befriended the Wild Bunch. The Bassett family was on good terms with the outlaws, and even joined them for a Thanksgiving dinner, alongside other residents of the valley. Their friendship with the Wild Bunch may have deterred other local outlaws from rustling the Bassett’s cattle. Eventually, Josie moved to the base of Split Mountain where her homestead still stands today.",

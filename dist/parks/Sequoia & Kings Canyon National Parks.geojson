        "notes": "\"Tharp's Log\" Wayside\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/tharps-log-wayside.htm\n\nBefore you is a low-profile wayside that is 36 X 24 inches. It has two rectangular pillars supporting the panel. The panel is made from oxidized metal. The sign is located next to Tharp's Log: a historic cabin near Crescent Meadow. <br /> <br /> Layout: The main image is a sepia-toned photograph of the cabin and corrals. The main text of the wayside blends into the top of the photograph. In a column to the right, there is text above a second, smaller, photograph.  <br /> <br /> Title: Tharp's Log<br /> <br /> Main photo, description: a photo taken from far enough away to show the log, cabin, and corral. Two men stand next to the corral. <br /> <br /> Photo caption: The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) completed the restoration of corrals and cleanup of Tharp's Log in 1936. <br /> <br /> Main Text: Hale Tharp’s arrival in the southern Sierra Nevada range marked the earliest documented settlement of European Americans in the area. Looking for economic opportunity and accompanied by two Monache/Yokuts Indians, Tharp first visited the Giant Forest in 1858.  <br /> <br /> A stockman by trade, Tharp used nearby Log Meadow as a seasonal grazing pasture and lived in this tiny rustic cabin until the creation of Sequoia National Park in 1890. His goal was to raise cattle and sell beef to an expanding local population. <br /> <br /> Tharp adapted this 70-foot hollow sequoia log as the structure for his summer cabin. A fire had burned inside the tree, lining its interior with charcoal. He carved a window and made a shutter with horseshoe hinges. Tharp enclosed the open end of his log home with a shingled building and added a fireplace and chimney made from granite boulders.  <br /> <br /> Tharp had limited resources to create this cabin among the trees, but the details really made this place his home. What is your favorite detail that he added? <br /> <br /> Text, right-hand column, first section titled \"Travelers and Friends\": A local tribal chief, Chief Chappo, invited Hale Tharp to visit the village of Pah-din, now called Hospital Rock. Tharp recounted that he and Chief Chappo were “the very best of friends,” and that he felt welcome as Chief Chappo introduced him to more than 600 local California Indians at the village. In the summer, Tharp and two Monache/Yokuts Indians traveled together along the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River, past Moro Rock, and through nearby Log Meadow to a place they called the “big tree forest.” Chief Chappo’s descendants believe that guides accompanied Tharp for his safety along the treacherous, higher-elevation routes and that Tharp must have earned their trust for them to share this valued place. <br /> <br /> Text, right-hand column, second section titled \"New Arrivals\": Early settlers arriving here in the Giant Forest came with a wide array of motivations. What they all shared, however, was their pursuit of a question—what can the mountains provide? <br /> <br /> Right-hand column, photo description: A group of about twenty-five people in early-twentieth century dress stand in front of the cabin.<br /> <br /> Photo caption: An interpretive tour of Tharp's Log in 1929 conducted by Lead Naturalist Frank Been. ",

Fire puts smoke into the air, and leaves blackened terrain that some find unattractive. You can learn more by visiting a burned area a year or two after a fire, and see what kind of changes have taken place.<br /> <br /> This exhibit, titled \"A Natural Process,\" shows how fire plays a part of sequoia growth.</p>",

It is flat, paved, and has benches along the way. Informational displays offer insight into what you are experiencing. Watch for yellow-bellied marmots, bears, and other wildlife. After taking this trail, consider walking the Hazelwood Meadow Trail on the other side of the road; it leads through another part of the sequoia grove.</p> <h3>Services and Parking</h3> <p>In summer, you can park here if you have an accessible-parking placard; if not, walk here from Giant Forest Museum. A vault toilet and drinking fountain are available in summer. In winter, this small parking lot may be open to all cars, but the drinking fountain and restroom are closed. The closest public telephones are at Lodgepole.</p> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>Parking is available at the trailhead for people with disability placards. If you don't have a placard but need to park closer to the trailhead, temporary placards are available at visitor centers.<br /> <br /> In winter when roads are snowy, the trailhead parking area is open to all.</p> <h3>Community Science</h3> <p>Giant sequoia trees have called the Sierra Nevada mountains home for thousands of years. These silent watchmen have observed change across this landscape throughout their expansive lifetimes; a closer look at these trees provides curious visitors with clues about our climates' past, present and future.<br /> <br /> If you'd like to learn more about sequoias, join a park ranger for a guided hike through the Giant Forest and gain an understanding about forest health, fire ecology, and the life cycles of the largest trees on earth. Try your hand at measuring the diameter and height of these giants as part of an ongoing community science project. Middle and high school field trips, college classes, and volunteer groups of all ages are welcome to join for a fun-filled, informative day of exploration!

Washington-a leader in the African-American community during the late 18th and early 19th centuries-stands before you.<br /> <br /> Colonel Charles Young-a commissioned officer in the US Army who served as the first superintendent of Sequoia National Park, dedicated this tree in honor of a man he deeply admired. Deployed to protect the park in the summer of 1903, Charles Young and his men travelled by horseback from the Presidio in San Francisco to Sequoia National Park, reaching their destination 16 days later. Assigned to extend a wagon road leading into the park, Young and his men made steady progress, meeting the goal of extending the road into the Giant Forest.<br /> <br /> The African-American army company working on the road were known as â€˜Buffalo Soldiers'. The citizens of nearby Visalia were so impressed with their work, they insisted that one of the giant trees be named in Captain Young's honor. Young declined, asserting that 2,000-year-old living trees should not be diminished by attaching any human's name. He acquiesced when it was agreed upon that the person honored would be Booker T. Washington.<br /> <br /> The significance of this Giant Sequoia tree was forgotten over time. After nearly 100 years, this tree has been rediscovered, and in 2003-on the hundredth year anniversary of the tree's dedication-a rededication ceremony was performed to honor Charles Young and Booker T. Washington. A sequoia has been named for Charles Young and is nearby.</p>",

A local resident who attended, Phil Winser, wrote the following about Captain Charles Young, the leader of this contingent and the first African American superintendent of any national park: \"They wanted to name a tree for our captain but he refused, saying they could do so if they felt the same way, twenty years hence...\" He chose instead to name a sequoia for educator Booker T. Washington, a leader in the African American community up until 1915.<br /> <br /> Little did then-Captain Young realize that people would feel the same way almost 100 years later! The third African American to graduate from West Point (1884), Young had gone on to fight oversees; become a colonel; serve as the first military attaché to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and then Liberia; write a book on race and military power; and teach as a professor, among other accomplishments. At a rededication ceremony for the Booker T. Washington Tree in June 2003, the deputy director of the National Park Service, to crowd approval, called on the park to make good on its 100-year-old promise.<br /> <br /> The Colonel Young Tree was dedicated in a private ceremony in the summer of 2004.

Parking is limited in winter. Please stay in the picnic area and not the nearby campground.</p> <h4>Sled Safely</h4> <p>Every winter, people get hurt badly while sledding in the park. Sledding accidents send over 20,000 people to emergency rooms each year in this country. <strong>The most common reason people get hurt is they sled when conditions are bad (icy snow, rock or tree hazards exposed, poor visibility), so if the snow isn't great or you can't see, don't sled!</strong><br /> <br /> Don’t let an accident ruin your winter fun.</p> <ul> <li>When sledding, slide feet first.</li> <li>Consider wearing a helmet.</li> <li>Make sure your path is clear. Don’t slide near rocks, trees, branches, or other people.</li> <li>After sliding, look uphill. Move out of the way of people coming downhill after you.</li> <li>Don’t slide into roads or parking lots.</li> <li>Avoid hard-packed snow or ice, where speed and direction get out of control.</li> <li>Sliding devices that can be steered may be safer than others.</li> </ul> <p>In an emergency, contact a ranger or call 911. There is a public telephone at Wolverton Snowplay Area. The closest telephone to Columbine and Big Stump snowplay areas is at Kings Canyon Visitor Center in Grant Grove Village.</p> <h4>Services Nearby</h4> <p>Parking, restrooms, and picnic tables available year-round. This becomes a snow-play area in winter.</p> <h4>Acessibility</h4> <p>Although there is no designated accessible parking here, routes from the parking area to the restrooms and picnic area are firm and stable with gentle slopes. The restrooms are mostly, though not fully, accessible. The picnic area includes extended picnic tables and accessible grills.</p>",

There is a moderately steep (but paved) half-mile trail from the parking area to the cave entrance. The trail through the cave is also one half mile. Because of fragile formations, the only way to visit the cave is on a guided tour. Tours are suitable for all ages.

At the Crystal Cave Parking lot restrooms and food storage lockers are available. Everyone is required to remove all foods and scented items from cars and place them in the food storage boxes.</p> <h4>Accessibility</h4> <p>The trail to Crystal Cave, though paved, is very steep and narrow, and not recommended for visitors using mobility assistive devices. For an American Sign Language (ASL) translation of the Crystal Cave tour, please ask at the information booth at the Crystal Cave trailhead for a tablet with ASL interpretation.

Two of the fires burning in remote, rugged terrain and heavy fuels, presented challenges to firefighting and spread rapidly. By mid-September, they joined to form a single fire called the KNP Complex. From here you can see a steep, burned slope behind the Foothills administrative buildings where the fire burned in mixed hardwood and shrub vegetation.  You’ll notice a range of conditions, from blackened, standing-dead trees or bare ground, to areas sprouting grasses or containing live green trees.  At other locations in the app, learn more about how fire history, terrain, vegetation, and weather affect how a fire burns.  </p>",

        "notes": "General Sherman Tree\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/general-sherman-tree.htm\n\n<p>There are taller trees, and wider trees, but the General Sherman Tree contains more wood (volume) in its trunk than any other tree on Earth. Behind the Sherman Tree are the General Grant, President, Lincoln, and Stagg trees. Another measure of tree volume is the total biomass of the tree-trunk, branches, roots, and foliage. If we measure the biomass, the Sherman Tree still ranks at #1, but the General Grant Tree loses second place to the President Tree.<br /> <br /> Rapid growth over a long life accounts for the size of these trees, but they are not as old as once thought. The most recent age estimate of the Sherman Tree is about 2200 years old.<br /> <br /> Sequoia roots are shallow but spread wide. They entangle with the roots of other sequoias, forming a kind of mesh that helps all the trees maintain balance and stability.<br /> <br /> As you walk among sequoias, watch for Douglas squirrels, also called chickarees. They climb into sequoias and chew through the stems of cones. If you come across a tree that seems to drop a cone every few seconds, you know that a Douglas squirrel is cutting cones for dinner. They then eat the green, fleshy covering of the cones; look for chewed-up cones on the ground. They also store cones and dried mushrooms high in pines or sequoias.<br /> <br /> The Congress Trail starts near the Sherman Tree, and provides a tour of some of the most spectacular sequoias of Giant Forest. This easy three-mile loop also connects to other trails that can take you throughout Giant Forest (be sure to take a map).<br /> <br /> The Sherman Tree was once named the Karl Marx Tree by the Kaweah Colony, a utopian group that lived in Three Rivers before Congress created this park. The Kaweah Colony supported itself in part through logging. When the national park was established, their efforts were deemed illegal. One of their original structures, Squatter's Cabin, still stands near Crescent Meadow and is on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> In 1903, the Buffalo Soldiers protected these parks. Their leader, then-Captain Charles Young, was one of the first superintendents of these parks and the first African-American superintendent of any national park. He developed plans to protect the legacy of the giant sequoia groves, oversaw the building of the first roads into the parks, and protected both parks from illegal logging, grazing, and poaching.</p> <h3>Services and Parking</h3> <p>The main parking area and trailhead for the General Sherman Tree is located just off Wolverton Road. The parking area is one of the main shuttle stops in the parks. Shuttles stop here every 15 to 20 minutes.<br /> <br /> Parking for people with disabilities is located on the Generals Highway 2 miles from the Giant Forest Museum and 3 miles from the Lodgepole Visitor Center.<br /> The parking area provides restrooms, trash cans, water, and food-storage lockers.<br /> <br /> Make sure that you store all food is stored in these lockers-bears can be active in this parking lot.<br /> <br /> The General Sherman Tree is about a half mile from the parking lot. Be prepared for an uphill climb when return from your hike. In summer, you can avoid the uphill hike by walking from the Sherman Tree down to the accessible parking lot and shuttle stop along the Generals Highway. From there, take the Orange Route back to the main General Sherman Tree parking area.</p> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>Accessible parking is located on the Generals Highway 2 miles from the Giant Forest Museum and 3 miles from the Lodgepole Visitor Center. The parking area provides restrooms, trash cans, and water. An easy path leads to the General Sherman Tree from the trailhead. This wheelchair-accessible paved path is accessible by wheelchairs, strollers, and walkers. The trail is about 500 feet in length and is gently sloped.<br /> <br /> In summer, the free park shuttle leads to the General Sherman Tree accessible parking area.</p>",

This place was once a vibrant village inhabited by Native Americans. Learn more about their relationship with this area. Experience these exhibits, along with accompanying tactile and audio components, in person, or learn more below.</p> <h3>A Shared Space Exhibit</h3> <h4>The past, present, and future are alive here. Nature, people, and spirit share this space. Native Americans call this place <i>Pah-din</i>, which means <em>place to go through</em>. It is also known as Hospital Rock.</h4> <p>This spot along the Kaweah River supports a diverse mix of animals, plants, and trees. The richness of this landscape made it an ideal location for <b><i>Pah-din</i></b>, a village that was home to hundreds of California Native Americans. Today, it is still an important place for the descendants of the village, and a site where people of many backgrounds come to rest, play, and explore the natural world.The Hospital Rock area features hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Snow, ice, and water carved the surrounding hillsides and valley floor. In this place, several large granite boulders provided temporary shelter or space for tribal gatherings. The area namesake rock, <i>Pah-din</i> or Hospital Rock, is a massive 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. Like the landscape, the river is a life force. It is home to fish and insects, and sustains nearby plant life.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-The Civilian Conservation Corps</h4> <p>In the 1930s, the Hospital Rock landscape changed dramatically. Assigned to Hospital Rock, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) completed several landscaping and improvement projects. They also cut a new stone staircase leading to the pictograph, built the Big Pool Trail and tunnel, and built a historic vehicle water station. Many local Native Americans joined the Corps and contributed to its projects nationwide.</p> <h3>Connections between Land and People Exhibit</h3> <h4>Native American groups lived, interacted, and traded goods in this village for generations. They continue to gather here as land stewards to practice their culture, educate, restore native plants, and for spiritual and special events.</h4> <p>Native Americans have a deep connection with the land. When Hospital Rock was an active village, the people cared for the plants and woodland ecosystem in ways that promoted health and abundance. From this practice, they were able to harvest materials necessary to live and thrive. Even today, these tribal cultural practices remain a way of life.Life here included fishing and gathering foods, cultivating the land, trading, playing games, visiting, andconnecting to one’s spiritual beliefs. The land provided everything needed to survive. People of the village harvested plants to build shelters, weave baskets, and create snares.Fire has always been part of this landscape. People living here depended on it for warmth and cooking. They also used it to clear vegetation to improve visibility and productivity in forests and grasslands.In this area, Native Americans hunted game, such as deer, squirrels, birds, and fished for food. Theyalso gathered plants, acorns, seeds, berries, and roots.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-Homeland</h4> <p>“This is an ancient site, a sensitive site.... People took care of each other here. There’s a welcome feeling here...the medicine is strong.”A connection with the land is critical to North Fork Mono Tribal Chairman Ron Goode. “Everything out here is our relations.” Traditional Ecological Knowledge has been passed down for generations by his people, and children today have strong relationships with the land. This traditional knowledge guides their restoration of damaged meadows and waterways in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This work benefits not only tribal lands, but also national forests and parks.</p> <h3>A Village Exhibit</h3> <h4>In this area, the Mono (Monache), the Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal connected with their neighboring tribes to form a vibrant community. These connections continue today.</h4> <p>Many groups lived, visited, gathered, and practiced traditions here. Historical accounts document more than 500 people occupying this village. Travelers stopped at the village to visit, rest, or trade. Runners and messengers used the extensive trails to deliver news about events such as fires. Tribal leaders are responsible for the safety and welfare of their people, including welcoming outsiders, negotiating with neighboring groups, and maintaining peace.By the 1860s, Native Americans left the Hospital Rock area. New settlers forced many out of the area, while others died from newly introduced diseases.Today, Mono (Monache), Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal live all over the world. Some live on rancherias,  reservations, or other Indian lands. Their descendants maintain a strong connection to <i>Pah-din</i> (Hospital Rock) and often participate in park management decisions.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-A True Leader</h4> <p>The descendants of Chief Chappo remember him as a strong leader who was compassionate, honest, and decisive—a peacemaker and a healer. Responsible for the welfare of his people, Chappo lived peacefully at Hospital Rock for generations. In the 1860’s, when new settlers arrived, they brought disease and conflict to the area. Chappo made the difficult decision to leave his homeland to save his people. Today, his descendants share stories about his gifts, and work to follow in his footsteps.</p> <h3>Activity, Past and Present Exhibit</h3> <h4>Signs that <em>Pah-din</em> (Hospital Rock) was once a vibrant village are all around us. Pictographs, bedrock mortars, historic fire pits, and obsidian artifacts all tell a story of a way of life.</h4> <p>Imagine a time when a community of hundreds of people lived here. Picture a village with dwellings (called nobi by the Mono people), children playing, women preparing food, and men getting ready for a hunt. This location inspired a way of life and created traditions and practices that continue today.Village women processed acorns into a flour that was a staple food. They made depressions in flat bedrock to create grinding holes, or mortars, and used cylindrical stones as pestles.Redbud shrubs provide strong, flexible shoots that were split or kept whole to weave into baskets. Elderberry shrubs were used for food, cultural uses, medicine, or ceremonial use.Items such as beads and obsidian (volcanic glass) may be found here. If you find an artifact, help us by leaving it where it is. Take a photo, note the location, and report your finding to park staff.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-The Weavers</h4> <p dir=\"rtl\" style=\"margin-right: 80px; text-align: left;\"><i></i><i>“The materials that make up a Native basket serve to ground it to an area. The weaver’s culture governed the techniques used to make it and the designs that adorn it. And the voices of tribal elders whisper through it.”               </i>- BRYN BARABAS POTTER</p> <p>Weaving serves a practical purpose but is also an art. Nature not only provides materials but also inspires patterns. An active basket-making community continues to teach skills to the next generation of weavers.</p> <h3>Community Traditions Exhibit</h3> <h4>What memorable traditions occur here, past and present? The Hospital Rock area has a rich history of people, events, and activities that shape it and create a sense of  community.</h4> <p>The granite rocks near the pictographs of Hospital Rock served many purposes such as a shelter, a place of healing, and a location for ceremonies. Native Americans call this place <i>Pah-din</i>, which means <i>place to go through.</i>Every Native American society has healers, who practice traditional medicine to aid ailing community members. On occasions, healers cared for injured travelers here. The English name “Hospital Rock” was first used in 1873 after a pioneer recovered here from a trapping injury.Spirituality was prominent in the form of reverence for the natural world. The land and its animals were respected. Creation stories were passed down within families.­Like the beat of drums, sounds from clapper sticks are an important part of cultural, spiritual, and ceremonial traditions. Clapper sticks are made from elderberry stalks.Today, families picnic together, share memories, swim in the Kaweah River, and hike in this spot.</p> <h3>Shared Voices Exhibit</h3> <h4>What is your native language? From past to present, many languages have been spoken here, connecting people to this space and to one another.</h4> <p>In the past, California Native American groups lived, met, and gathered here. They spoke a number of languages and dialects to trade goods, share news, and cooperate with others. Today, these languages are still heard throughout the Sierra range and foothills. People can tell a lot about their neighbors based on the way they say “hello.” A person’s language communicates to others who they are, where they come from, and how they live.Historically, California Native Americans each had their own language. However, each group spoke many languages to connect with their neighbors and fellow travelers.Today, travelers from all over the world rest, picnic, and enjoy nature here, whether they call this place Hospital Rock or<i> Pah-din</i>. While you’re here, listen for people speaking a variety of languages.Nature also has a language. The rustling of oaks, chirping of birds, calls of squirrels, and the roaring river flowing over granite boulders form the essential sounds of this landscape.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-Our Language Lives</h4> <p>Language is Marie Wilcox’s life. According to Marie, “words matter and learning the language is important to our culture.” Marie is one of the last living speakers of the Wukchumni language. With the help of her family, Marie created a Wukchumni dictionary. Containing thousands of words and examples of their uses, the dictionary documents the living language of her people. As part of a movement to preserve our nation’s Native American languages, Marie’s work documents the art and heritage of the Wukchumni voice.</p>",

They are part of their traditional belief systems, and as important as any place of worship. <strong>Do not touch or mark on the pictographs or rocks here.</strong> If you see someone vandalizing this area, please let a park ranger know right away.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, people who came here drew these pictographs. Their meaning is unknown, but local tribal members explain that they serve as a history for the people who once lived here, and are a reminder of how important this place is to them today.<br /> <br /> This area once hosted a village of hundreds of people from the Mono (Monache), Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal tribes. The tribes who once lived here are no longer in the park, but they live in nearby communities and actively continue to honor past traditions. </p> <h4>Safety and Accessibility</h4> <p>The area around the pictographs, while flat, is bound by two roads—beware of traffic approaching with limited visibility. Access to the pictographs viewing platform is via a set of short, steep stairs. For those with limited mobility, the pictograph can be seen from the parking lot across the street with binoculars.

It's situated on top of one of the many moraines along the canyon floor. These piles of glacial rubble are higher than the canyon floor, and views from the cabin are spectacular.

The trail starts along the steep bank to the right. Additional parking available across the Generals Highway in the Potwisha Overflow Parking Lot.</p> <h3>Community Science</h3> <p>Water is essential for life to thrive in the hot, dry foothills, but can sometimes be challenging to find. In the springtime, streams and creeks swell to high levels as snowmelt makes its way down towards the Central Valley. Once the snow has melted, however, water levels drop significantly. By late summer, many water sources dry up completely. Inconsistent snowpack from year to year makes it difficult to predict what resources will be available for the parks' flora and fauna. By tracking water levels over time, park scientists can better understand this unique landscape.<br /> <br /> Are you interested in exploring watersheds in the Foothills? Join a park ranger at any point in the year to collect data as a community scientist. In order to be sensitive to the plants and animals that call these streams home, group sizes are limited to a maximum of 6 participants. Individuals with an interest in a longer-term volunteer commitment are encouraged to reach out.<br /> <br /> Call Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks' Education Office at 559-565-4211 or email seki_ritc@nps.gov for more information.</p>",

To reach the top of this granite dome, take the stairway that climbs up 300 feet (.09 km) to the 6,275 ft (2,050 km) summit.<br /> <br /> At the top is a spectacular 360° view from the Great Western Divide to the east around to the western half of Sequoia National Park. Consider summiting Moro Rock at dawn or before dusk. It offers a huge expanse of night sky, a rare view in forested parts of the parks. One of the best places in the parks to see sunset and moonrise.<br /> <br /> Moro Rock is one of several granite domes in these parks. These domes formed millions of years ago when magma beneath the surface cooled into granite. Since erosion removed the layers of softer rock that were above them, they have been rebounding and lifting a tiny bit each year.<br /> <br /> In summer, free park shuttles at the Giant Forest Museum will drop you off at this parking area. This parking area is two miles (3.2 km) from the Generals Highway.</p> <h4>Safety</h4> <p>Take your time; unless you are used to this elevation this walk can be challenging. Moro Rock is also prone to lightning strikes. If there is any evidence of an approaching storm, get off the rock quickly but safely.</p> <h4>Winter Access</h4> <p>To access the base of this trail in winter, you will need to hike, snowshoe, or ski into the area. In winter, the staircase is typically not safe to ascend. Don't climb the stairs if any ice or snow is present; it is very dangerous.</p>",

Look outward from Panoramic Point across hundreds of miles of Kings Canyon National Park and neighboring national forest lands. Below lies Hume Lake, a small historic lake in Sequoia National Forest that was created in 1908 using a rare multiple-arch dam. The lake water fed a flume that floated timber down to the valley. Beyond, lies the deep glacial gorge of the Kings Canyon itself and a wealth of the High Sierra's peaks.<br /> <br /> The area before you has a rich history. In the 1890s, artist Bolton Brown climbed many peaks to learn about and paint the area more accurately. Beginning In the late 1920s, poet Kenneth Rexroth often hiked here and wrote about this area. James Hutchings also spent time here, developing his Illustrated California magazine in the 1850s to bring attention and protection to the High Sierra. The likes of John Muir, Stephen Mather, George Moskey, and Horace Albright spent time here discussing how to develop a national park system.<br /> <br /> This is also home to countless species of plants and animals, from the alpine zone, where cold-tolerant species like pika and foxtail pines live, to the foothill zone, where heat-tolerant life thrives year round. You can also see the effects of fires that have passed through, leaving the forest healthier and stronger.<br /> <br /> You can also continue past the overlook on a more difficult 2.6-mile unpaved hike to the Park Ridge Fire Lookout. If the lookout volunteers are in, they may give you access and a tour of the view.</p> <h4>Accessibility</h4> <p>The half-mile trail to the viewing area is accessible, leading visitors to a stunning view overlooking the Sierra Nevada.

You can hike to the end of the trail, or walk as far as you'd like and then turn around. In summer, watch carefully for poison oak and avoid touching its \"leaves of three.\" Many hikers prefer to spend time here in fall, winter, and spring, when temperatures are cool. In spring, wildflowers are varied and lovely. In spring or after storms, take care with creek crossings and turn back if it doesn't seem safe.<br /> <br /> The trailhead is in Buckeye Flat Campground. In winter, the road to the campground is closed to vehicles and you can begin your hike at Hospital Rock Picnic Area. Walk along the road to the campground and look for the trailhead as you enter.</p> <h3>Education Programs</h3> <p>The Sierra Newt, a native Californian amphibian, calls the foothills home. Newts descend from the hillsides throughout the winter and early spring to reach their breeding pools, which form as snowmelt cascades down the mountains.<br /> <br /> Interested in learning more? Join a park ranger on a curriculum-based field trip to study the phenology, or timing, of newt migration. Tracking the timing of breeding cycles gives scientists critical insight into how the lives of plants and animals are impacted by the changing climate.<br /> <br /> Call 559-565-4211 or email seki_ritc@nps.gov to learn more about the community-science field trip opportunities offered at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.<br />  </p>",

Before you lies one of the largest groves of giant sequoia trees in the world. From this overlook, you can see the tops of sequoias, the canopy of the Redwood Mountain grove.<br /> <br /> It was here that park scientists began to understand the importance of fire in the ecology of forests. The trunks of large giant sequoias trees are almost always marked by fire scars at ground level, and their lower branches have been burned away. Their living limbs and needles grow hundreds of feet above the forest floor, where they are safe from most flames. Fire is necessary in order for sequoia cones to open and release their seeds. It is also necessary to clear away underbrush and give trees the space and sunlight they need to grow. Scientists and park managers have developed ways to use fire to maintain healthy ecosystems within the parks, including natural (lightning) fires and prescribed burns.<br /> <br /> Redwood Canyon also houses thousands of dogwood trees. In spring and early summer, white blossoms cover their branches. In autumn, their foliage turns red, brown, and yellow. Light filtering through the leaves or blossoms creates an ever-changing atmosphere, so the experience of the canyon shifts with the seasons.</p>",

Enter river trail here at your own risk. Stay on trail. Hazards include but not limited to falling trees or tree limbs, loose rocks, flash flooding, and debris flows. Portions of the trail may be blocked with debris. </strong><br /> <br /> This historic entrance sign was constructed in 1935 by Civilian Conservation Corps craftsmen based on a smaller design from a National Park Service architect. Over time, the original sign has been updated and painted. A sequoia log four feet in diameter supports the sign, complete with sequoia bark.</p> <p>History emanates from some objects. Sequoia National Park's entrance sign, with its powerful presence at the boundary, is one such antique. Its origins speak of varying aspects of our past. But is this sign, with its Indian head image, still appropriate for display today? <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/historyculture/sequoias-historic-park-entrance-sign.htm\">Learn more about the story of the sign and the cultural history questions it raises today </a></p> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>There is designated accessible parking at this scenic viewpoint. A paved sidewalk leads to the Historic Entrance Sign and views of the river.</p> <h3>Community Science</h3> <p>The foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range are home to the blue oak woodlands. Ongoing drought, inconsistent snowpack, wildfires, bark beetles, and other environmental factors place this sensitive ecosystem at risk. Park scientists closely monitor the blue oak trees to measure the growth, and death, of this important species.<br /> <br /> Are you a middle school or high school student? Your class can join us in collecting data to learn more about blue oaks. Students work alongside park rangers to collect data in two oak plots here, serving as community scientists. They gain basic forestry skills and help the parks better understand this changing landscape.<br /> <br /> Call 559-565-4211 or email seki_ritc@nps.gov to learn more about the community-science field trip opportunities offered at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.</p>",

Notice a mosaic of live trees and shrubs, patches of fire-killed vegetation, and other areas where only bare, blackened ground remains. As time passes new plants will sprout in most of these bare areas. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{dcf0a411-465b-42c8-b913-94f90bb6c519}{184}\" paraid=\"957073885\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">These different burn  patterns resulted from a variety of fire behavior (or how the fire burned). In places, light upcanyon winds may have pushed the fire cross-slope or it may have backed down the hillside at lower intensity. Further upcanyon, areas with no vegetation and exposed rock are places where flammable shrubs burned at higher intensity. Look on the slope below the pullout for a buckeye tree re-sprouting from its base and other plant re-growth.  </p> <h4>Poison Oak</h4> <p>Beware the three-leaved plant that grows here! Touching it can cause an intensely itchy rash. Even in winter when twigs are bare, oils from this plant can transfer from the plant to hands, clothing, and anything that touches it.</p> <p> </p>",

The Lakes Trail leads to Heather Lake, Emerald Lake, and Pear Lake. The challenging Alta Trail, which climbs more than 4,000 feet in elevation over 12.8 miles (20 kilometers) to the summit of Alta Peak, has some spectacular views. Or go as far as Panther Gap 4 miles, (6.4 kilometers) for a good look at the Great Western Divide. The Watchtower portion of the Lakes Trail leads you along the ridge overlooking Lodgepole, the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, and Tokopah Falls. This stretch of trail is extremely treacherous if any snow or ice is present; if icy or snowy conditions are present, always choose the Hump Trail instead.<br /> <br /> For a much easier hike, try the Wolverton Meadow Loop which circles a wetland. On this trail, you must usually make two easy stream crossings; however, early in the season the water can be high. Wolverton Meadow is an excellent place to view black bears in the late spring and early summer. They are often seen feeding in the meadows. The meadow's wildflowers change throughout the season, so taking this hike in June is a different experience than in August or May. Keep an eye out for pine martens, relatives of the weasel that live high in the branches of pine trees and are relatively common here. They are shy of people and hide well, so you have to stop for a while and search for them.</p> <h4>Sled Safely</h4> <p>Every winter, people get hurt badly while sledding in the park. <strong>The most common reason people get hurt is they sled when conditions are bad (icy snow, rock or tree hazards exposed, poor visibility), so if the snow isn't great or you can't see, don't sled! </strong>Don’t let an accident ruin your winter fun.</p> <ul> <li>When sledding, slide feet first.</li> <li>Consider wearing a helmet.</li> <li>Make sure your path is clear. Don’t slide near rocks, trees, branches, or other people.</li> <li>After sliding, look uphill. Move out of the way of people coming downhill after you.</li> <li>Don’t slide into roads or parking lots.</li> <li>Avoid hard-packed snow or ice, where speed and direction get out of control.</li> <li>Sliding devices that can be steered may be safer than others.</li> </ul> <p>In an emergency, contact a ranger or call 911.</p>",

        "notes": "Alvino House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/alvino-house.htm\n\nThe Alvino House is the oldest intact adobe structure in Big Bend National Park. The building represents the everyday life of the many families who lived and farmed along the Rio Grande. This building was constructed around 1901 by Cipriano Hernandez, one of the Hispanic settlers who farmed near Castolon. He raised vegetables and grain for sale to the mining camps. Corn, beans, squash, tomatoes, and melons were common crops grown by families along the Rio Grande. <br /> <br /> As the population grew, Hernandez enlarged his home and used the space to open a small store where he sold supplies to his neighbors. In 1918, Alvino Ybarra moved into the house. In 1922, Alvino married Teofila Luna and raised three sons and three daughters in the house. Even in this remote area, education was a priority, so the Ybarra children attended school for four months in Castolon, then four months in Terlingua, as there were not enough teachers to keep both schools open for an entire school year.<br /> <br /> Alvino earned his living by operating the engines that powered the cotton gin and the water pump that brought water from the Rio Grande to irrigate the fields. He worked from 5 a.m. to sundown, earning premium wages for the area of $1.50 per day. This was further supplemented by working as a La Harmonia Company tenant farmer. The Alvino House also served as a civil center for area residents. Alvino’s family set aside a room as a religious shrine, where a priest performed masses, baptisms, and weddings several times a year. The community also celebrated holidays at the Alvino House, coming together as friends and family.<br /> <br /> Teofila Ybarra died in 1936, but Alvino continued living here until 1957, when he moved to Alpine. Several of their grandchildren still live in the Big Bend region.The Alvino House affords a close look at a recently repaired and stabilized adobe structure. Adobe masons from Santa Helena, Mexico used their expertise to restore this structure in 1994. The men manufactured adobe bricks on the site, shored up the sagging roof, and repaired the walls. The berm around the foundation of the structure was built in 2008 to protect it from floodwaters.",

The beginning of the trail follows the Blue Creek drainage towards the mountains. As you climb, the trail passes through open grassland and eventually the pine woodlands of the Chisos Mountains. <br /> The Blue Creek trail ends at the junction with the Laguna Meadow Trail. From there, it's another 3.75 miles down to the parking area in the Chisos Basin, or a return of 5.5 miles.<br /> <br /> You can hike this trail either direction—starting in the mountains and hiking down to Homer Wilson Ranch or starting at the ranch and hiking up. It's best if you have two vehicles and can leave one at either end of the trail.<br /> <br /> For a pleasant day trip, walk up the Blue Creek drainage to the red rocks and return (about 3 miles round-trip, with 240 feet elevation gain). This short hike is particularly interesting for birders, butterfliers, wildflower enthusiasts, photographers, and geologists. <h3>Accessibility</h3> The lower part of the Blue Creek Trail is a sandy, rocky wash. Watch for rock cairns along the way. The trail climbs out of the wash at several points and the cairns help you locate entrance and exit points. The trail narrows and becomes steep and rocky as you ascend into the mountains.<br /> <br /> Parking for several vehicles is available at the trailhead. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife.

A walk along the Rio Grande leads to the entrance of a magnificent limestone gorge that splits the Sierra del Carmen Mountains. Along the way, look for ancient fossils that existed when this area was under an ocean, and pre-historic grinding holes that indigenous inhabitants used in food production.<br /> <br /> This area is also a great place for scenic photography. The colors on the Sierra del Carmen at sunset are well worth the journey. During summer months, it is best to explore the canyon in the mornings, since daytime temperatures often exceed 110 degrees. Water and good footwear are essential items here, and for any hike in the Chihuahuan Desert. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> From the parking lot, this trail climbs a small rise before descending to the Rio Grande. The trail surface is rock and dirt. Once down at river level, the trail transitions to sand and the remainder of the walk is a flat, pleasant stroll along the river. Eventually the high limestone walls and the river prevent further travel and it's time to turn around and head back to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> The paved parking lot provides parking for about 15 vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Bring plenty of water!</span></em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike.

        "notes": "Castolon Historic District\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/castolon-historic-district.htm\n\nThe buildings at Castolon are a remnant of Big Bend's pioneer and military history. Castolon experienced a rich cross-cultural mingling, as the Hispanic culture was a melding of Spanish and indigenous peoples of the region. Anglo-American settlers later entered the area, learning survival methods from the previous settlers and forming a bicultural community with the Mexican settlers. These rural families in Big Bend survived in a harsh landscape, compounded by the Mexican Revolution that began in 1910. During this time, bandits from Mexico took advantage of the chaos to raid small border communities, causing some families on both sides of the Rio Grande to abandon their homes.<br /> <br /> A raid on Glenn Springs in 1916 convinced the War Department that federal intervention was necessary for the safety of border communities. Thousands of soldiers were dispatched throughout the Big Bend area. Camp Santa Helena was established at present-day Castolon by U.S. Army troops of the 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> cavalries. Initially a series of tents, work began on a permanent post in 1919, with the first structures completed in 1920. The Mexican Revolution ended in late 1920 and the troops were reassigned elsewhere. The newly completed buildings saw minimal military use. In 1925, La Harmonia Company purchased the abandoned military buildings. La Harmonia Store was moved into the barracks building and an official post office was added to the store's services. The post office closed in 1954. La Harmonia Company was vital to the existence of individual ranchers and the farming families living in the remote villages of Castolon, La Coyota, El Ojito, and Terlingua de Abajo. The store remained in business until 1961, when La Harmonia Company holdings were incoporated into Big Bend National Park.<br /> <br /> Tragedy struck on May 22, 2019, when a fire in Mexico to jumped the Rio Grande. With temperatures around 110 degrees Fahrenheit, the fire spread quickly and showered embers on the shade structures of La Harmonia Store and the historic latrine. Despite valient efforts, structural and wildland fire crews could not safely extinguish the fire before both buildings suffered extensive damage. Luckily, firefighters saved many other buildings, artifacts, vital utilities, and nearby Cottonwood Campground. Although damaged, the buildings remain a rich remnant of Big Bend's pioneer and military past. The National Park Service is consulting with adobe experts, historic architects, and structural engineers to determine whether these structures can be salvaged or rehabilitated. A temporary restroom and concession was added to the area. The visitor center is now housed in the historic Garlick House.",

This steam engine was used to pump water from the Rio Grande to irrigate the cotton fields and other crops. The Morse engine was used to run the cotton gin. Originally, cotton was hauled to Marathon to be ginned, which proved costly and impractical. To save money, in 1923, a gin was built in Castolon. Ginning cotton removes the seeds, which decreases the weight and shipping costs.<br /> <br /> In the first year of operation, 146 bales of cotton were ginned from cotton grown by La Harmonia Company tenant farmers. Later, when cotton was found to be a viable crop, farmers from Johnson’s Ranch to Lajitas were bringing their cotton to Castolon to be ginned. In 1925, the gin had its best year with 251 bales. The arrival of the Pink Boll worm in 1927 was the beginning of the end for cotton in the region. By 1942, La Harmonia Company was ginning its last cotton crop of a mere 54 bales.<br /> <br /> This gin stood near Cottonwood Campground until 1978 when a flood swept most of it downstream. The foundation for the warehouse and remnant scraps of metal are still visible near the amphitheater.",

The Chihuahuan Desert receives most of its precipitation from summer thunderstorms sweeping off the Gulf of Mexico in July and August.

The female moth gathers the pollen into a tiny ball which she holds beneath her \"chin\".

Each of the four deserts of North America contain distinctive plants, called indicator plants, that grow exclusively in that desert environment. Lechuguilla is the \"indicator plant\" for the Chihuahuan Desert, as it grows in this region and nowhere else. Like its other relatives in the agave family (commonly known as century plants), the lechuguilla blooms only once and then dies. This plant lives between 3 to 20 years, storing up energy to produce its tall bloom stalk. While it can produce seeds, lechuguilla reproduces mainly from offshoots from the parent plant before it flowers. Did you know that the leaf of lechuguilla is composed of fibrous strands that are used to make rope, and the processing of this fiber was one of the early industries here in the Big Bend?",

These hills are the eroded remains of a volcanic sill, a body of dark volcanic rock that was shot up from a plume of magma deep in the earth. However, it did not erupt. A rock layer above the magma prevented it from continuing to the surface. The magma, under incredible pressure, instead found a weakness that made moving horizontally easier than breaking through the cap above it; thus it injected itself between two layers of light-colored limestone. This event happened over 10 million years ago when the rock around you was still deep underground. Erosion has since worn away those rocks, exposing the volcanic sill that was once hidden. Soils weathered from the sill are more acidic than the surrounding limestone soils, producing more favorable growing conditions for some plants, and less favorable for others.

The crops they planted and harvested included cotton, melons, and corn. These crops were either grown for their own consumption, or sold to provide income. <br /> This adobe house is the last remaining Daniels Ranch structure. It undergoes periodic conservation treatment that allows visitors to see a great example of adobe architecture. The entire system of irrigation ditches remain visible throughout the farm complex. The ditches extend from the building eastward through the campground, and almost 1/2 mile north of the Rio Grande Village visitor center. Some of the ditches are currently used to provide water to the campground and the Black Hawk nesting area.

It is a pleasant hike in the early morning or late afternoon hours when temperatures are moderate. The majority of the trail passes through scant desert vegetation, including creosote bush, cacti, and grasses. It is important to note that after a good rainfall the trail and surrounding soil turns into a clay mud that forms thick clumps on hiker's shoes and makes walking difficult. At 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the trailhead, the trail enters a (normally) dry wash. A metal sign marks the intersection. Pay close attention to this location before continuing, as it can easily be missed on the return trip. Take a left turn here and follow the rocky wash the remaining 0.5 mile (0.8 km) into Dog Canyon. High limestone walls quickly envelope hikers and one is able to walk between the towering cliffs of the canyon and out the other end. Most hikers turn around where the canyon ends and repeat the journey back to their vehicles. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The first 1.5 miles of the trail is fairly flat walking on a sand and dirt trail.

The Dorgan’s first lived in a two-room stone house. Later they built an impressive adobe home on top of the mesa. Roof width in the Castolon area was limited by the length of vigas (wood ceiling beams), which were typically from the small local mesquite or cottonwood trees. Dorgan used his expertise as an architect to design this atypical house. The petrified wood fireplace in the center of the house was more than just decoration; it provided a place for the vigas to meet in the center of the room, making his house twice as wide and deep as other Castolon homes.<br /> <br /> Dorgan owned pumps and irrigation equipment, which he leased to James Sublett for several years. Dorgan also sold vegetables and employed several area families, including the Garcia family of La Coyota, to crate and ship vegetables.<br /> <br /> The Dorgan’s left their Big Bend property in 1938 due to business and health issues. The Dorgan and Sublett business partnership also dissolved. In 1941, Dorgan leased the property to A.F. Robinson who intended to open the “Mexitex Resort”, evidently hoping to benefit from the national park which was being established in the area at that time.

The Great Depression had a tremendous impact on everyone in the area, some stuck it out, some left for \"better\" places. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1930s, the state of Texas began to purchase and acquire property in this part of Brewster County. On June 6, 1944, the state gave the federal government the deed to over 700,000 acres with the aim of establishing the first national park in Texas. Six days later, on June 12th, Congress acted and officially created Big Bend National Park.<br /> Dugout Wells is just one of many places in the park to see the remnants of early 20th-century farming and ranching history. ",

Then take the 1.4-mile (2.3 km) Emory Peak trail to the peak. The last 0.25 mile climbs steeply, and the final 25 feet require a scramble up an exposed rock face. The 360 degree view from the top of Emory Peak, the highest point in the park, is superb. The antenna and equipment found on the top are part of Big Bend's two-way radio system. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The hike to the top of Emory Peak involves a strenuous climb of about 2,500 feet along a dirt and rock trail. The last 25 feet requires a climb up solid rock without rope, rails, or other artificial handholds.<br /> You should not attempt the last mile of this hike when thunderstorms are threatening, especially during the monsoon months of July, August, and September. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike.

The word <em>tinaja</em> (pronounced \"tin-AH-ha\") is Spanish for \"large earthen jar\" and in Big Bend refers to natural water holes, usually formed by erosion. <br /> <br /> A small parking spot marks the trailhead. The trail to the tinaja is 1/2 mile each way, and provides access into a small canyon lined with spectacular limestone geology.  Walk up the canyon to the tinaja carved into the creekbed. The tinaja holds water year round. Be very careful along the edge. Desert animals seeking water are often lured to the steep walled tinaja, only to fall in and drown when they cannot climb out the smooth sides. <br /> <br /> The trailhead is located approximately 5 miles along the rugged, primitive <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/old-ore-road.htm\">Old Ore Road</a>.

Hidden in the brush are the remains of a corral with a central snubbing post, a dipping vat for sheep and goats, and a ranch house with a shady porch. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The rock and gravel trail follows the old road down a steep hill and across two drainages that may flood during the rainy season. The trail climbs the bank of Blue Creek and leads to the ranchhouse. Other features of the line camp are hidden in thick brush, connected by an indistinct trail. <h4>Hike Smart</h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike.

The area was also a popular place for ancient Americans for thousands of years. The confluence of Tornillo Creek and the Rio Grande was especially inviting as important food sources are available in greater quantities than the area further from the river. The hot water emanating from the edge of the river was, and is, inviting to all who found this spot. Evidence of ancient people is found on the rocks in the form of pictographs and petroglyphs. While the meaning is lost to time, one can ponder their relevance, or simply enjoy the view. <br /> <br /> J.O Langford had heard of the springs, and since he was in ill health, decided to homestead here since hot springs were purported to heal all ills. He improved the water catchment and started to develop a commercial enterprise that attracted tourists and those seeking health benefits. Mr. Langford left for a few years during the Mexican Revolution, but returned to begin business once again. He constructed the motor court, found just down the trail, to provide overnight lodging to guests. The business attracted customers from the United States and Mexico. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Maggie Smith took over operations and continued doing business even after the creation of the park.

A few crumbling foundations are all that remain of the community, although La Coyota was once home to nearly a dozen Mexican and Mexican-American families. In 1884, Don Severiano Chavarria moved to this area with two sons and two daughters. His third daughter, Petra, was born the following year. His family eventually expanded to include eleven sons and five daughters, and as new families moved to the area, a community was born.<br /> <br /> The family of Matilde and Theodora “Lola” Garcia also called La Coyota home. They built an adobe home and raised two boys and two girls. Mr. Garcia sometimes worked for his neighbor, Albert Dorgan, or as a cowboy for Cartledge’s ranching operation. He also worked for Homer Wilson on the Blue Creek Ranch at the base of the Chisos Mountains. In the winter, Garcia worked in the mercury mines at Terlingua, and his children attended school in Study Butte. Mrs. Garcia took care of the children, cows, goats, and chickens. The children helped at home and sometimes crated vegetables on Dorgan’s farm or rode horseback, helping their father with cattle roundups.<br /> <br /> The families of La Coyota fared well with plenty of meat, fish, water, and vegetables. They also bought supplies at the La Harmonia Store or from stores in Study Butte and Terlingua. But life was not without its difficulties. Measles, rashes, stomach disorders, and fevers were common. The families cured many illnesses using traditional remedies from desert plants and herbs, but advanced medical care was far away. Many of the graves in the local cemeteries are those of children.<br /> <br /> Please treat historic sites with respect. Remember that archeological and historical items are protected by law.

The soldiers, however, probably never occupied the building, as the Revolution ended and troops were withdrawn shortly after its construction. The buildings were purchased by Wayne Cartledge and Howard Perry, partners in La Harmonia Company. Perry was the millionaire owner of the Chisos Mining Company in nearby Terlingua, and Cartledge was his bookkeeper until they formed La Harmonia Company in 1918. Cartledge named the company “La Harmonia” as he hoped to encourage peaceful relations (harmony) in the area. La Harmonia Company was vital to the existence of individual ranchers and the farming families living in the remote villages of Castolon, La Coyota, El Ojito, and Terlingua de Abajo.<br /> <br /> Imagine this frontier store as it was in the 1920s-- stocked with a wide variety of merchandise that catered to the diversity of clients on both sides of the river. Screwworm medicine and saddles were available for use on local ranches. Patent medicines, quinine capsules, toothache drops, and liniment helped residents pull through without a local doctor. Staple groceries, shoes, and clothing were also for sale. More exotic items like wedding veils and lace could be specially ordered. Bundles of wolf, mountain lion, and skunk pelts (mostly from northern Mexico) added to the scene and smell. Conversations in English and Spanish filled the air. The store remained in business until 1961, when La Harmonia Company holdings were incoporated into Big Bend National Park.<br /> <br /> Tragedy struck on May 22, 2019, when a fire in Mexico to jumped the Rio Grande. With temperatures around 110 degrees Fahrenheit, the fire spread quickly and showered embers on the shade structures of La Harmonia Store and the historic latrine. Despite valient efforts, structural and wildland fire crews could not safely extinguish the fire before both buildings suffered extensive damage. Luckily, firefighters saved many other buildings, artifacts, vital utilities, and nearby Cottonwood Campground. Although damaged, the buildings remain a rich remnant of Big Bend's pioneer and military past. The National Park Service is consulting with adobe experts, historic architects, and structural engineers to determine whether these structures can be salvaged or rehabilitated.

Langford's impressive bathhouse is long gone; today the spring is contained by the foundation remains of the bathhouse, on the north bank of the Rio Grande. Relish a primitive bathing experience while enjoying unparalleled scenery.</p> <p>Along a stretch beginning upstream of Rio Grande Village, a series of thermal springs emerge adjacent to the Rio Grande. All of the hot springs in this region are believed to be related to normal faults. These Basin and Range type faults formed between 18 and 23 million years ago. Today, groundwater circulating deep in the earth becomes heated before it returns to the surface as hot springs.</p> <p>The most famous of the thermal features along the Big Bend of the Rio Grande is the Langford Hot Springs. Located where Tornillo Creek enters the Rio Grande, some four miles upriver from Boquillas Canyon and the Mexican village of Boquillas. The natural springs at the site are known as Boquillas Hot Springs. <em>Boquillas</em> is Spanish for \"little mouths\" and refers to the many small streams or arroyos that drain this part of the Sierra del Carmen range and flow into the Rio Grande. Later, when the springs were promoted for their health benefits, the settlement and spa resort there was called Hot Springs, and a post office by that name was established at the site in July 1914. Although there are several other small hot springs in the area, these larger and more accessible springs are the best known.</p> <p>Hot spring water is considered old water, fossil water, ancient and irreplaceable. Heated by geothermal processes and emerging at 105° F., the water carries dissolved mineral salts reputed to have healing powers. The water contains calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, and lithium. The springs' flow rate in 1936 was 250,000 gallons a day, but more recent measurements show a decrease. The therapeutic value of heat has long been touted as a remedy of both body and soul.</p> <p>Be aware that some hot springs can burn you either with the scalding effects of heat or the caustic nature of the water chemistry. Use caution when bathing and limit the exposure of children to the warm waters.</p> <h2><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Visiting the Langford Hot Springs</span></h2> <p>Contact <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/contacts.htm\">Big Bend National Park</a> for more information and before visiting to get any current conditions or updated information.  </p> <h3>The Rules</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Be respectful of others; soak only, and use no soaps or oils.</p> </li> <li> <p>Swimming is not recommended; be aware that adjacent river currents and depths can be unpredictable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Please help to keep the area clean by picking up trash.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alcoholic beverages and glass containers are prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>Overnight camping in the area of the Hot Springs is prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is illegal to purchase items from vendors operating on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Directions</h3> <h4><strong>Hot Springs Road</strong></h4> <p>The two-mile gravel road descends down a rough, narrow wash to the Hot Springs Historic District and trailhead area. <em>Note: Motor homes and oversize vehicles are prohibited on the one-way sections of the Hot Springs road.</em></p> <h4><strong>Hiking to the Hot Springs</strong></h4> <p>From the trailhead, the hot spring is a 0.5 mile round trip.

Shooting and trapping by ranchers, federal predator control agents, recreational hunters, and loss of habitat contributed to their decline. Individual bears occasionally wandered in and out of the park from Mexico, but only scattered sightings were reported from the 1940s through the 1980s. In the late 1980s visitors began seeing bears in increasing numbers, and in 1988 a visitor photographed a female with three young cubs in the Chisos Mountains. Observations increased in the 1990s, and in 1996 visitors reported 572 sightings in one year!

The peak's name comes from an old legend that describes how Spanish explorers found a vein of silver in this area and enslaved local people to mine it. According to legend, the workers eventually rebelled, killed their enslavers, and sealed the mine entrance to prevent further exploitation. There is no evidence to support this legend, and geologists don't believe that silver would form in the rocks of the Chisos Mountains. However, the name adds an air of mystery to this mountain. ",

In their final month, they will put all their energy into producing a huge flowering stalk that can grow up to 15 feet tall. Their yellow flowers attract nectar-feeding bats, hummingbirds, and many types of insects.

A good portion of the trail follows a gravel wash lined by Mexican persimmon, Mexican buckeye, and desert hackberry trees. The wash is bounded by volcanic hills with layers of yellow and orange ash-flow tuffs. Large congomerate boulders litter the valley bottom. The trail ends at the pouroff—a 100-foot tall vertical channel carved into rock that funnels water from the mesa above.<br /> <br /> During the rainy season, flashfloods may race down the wash. Be careful and don't get caught in the canyon during a storm. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The upper part of the trail is a fairly flat dirt and rock path. After about 0.25 miles, the trail descends into the wash via a series of uneven steps. The wash is gently-sloped, coarse sand and gravel. <br /> The trailhead is at the end of a paved road. Sixteen pull-in parking spaces and one handicap spot offer plenty of parking. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike.

From 1900 to 1943, Mariscal Mine produced 1,400 seventy-six pound flasks of mercury - nearly one quarter of the total produced in the United States! Now deserted, the mine and surroundings once provided the people who lived here an income, a community, and a home.<br /> <br /> A visit to Mariscal Mine conjures up images of hard-working men, women, and machines. With a little imagination, you can get a feeling for the work of these early pioneers and their contributions to Big Bend's rich human history. The remains of the mine stand today as a symbol of a time when \"quicksilver was king\" and as a vivid reminder of the cycle of human activities and nature's reclamation.<br /> <br /> The mine is located on the northern end of Mariscal Mountain, deep in the interior of Big Bend National Park. Easiest access to the area is via the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/primitive-dirt-roads.htm\">River Road east,</a> which begins just west of Rio Grande Village. The mine is located approximately 22 miles down the gravel road. This is a remote and primitive dirt road. A high clearance vehicle (<em>with at least 8 inches of clearance or more from the lowest point of the frame, body, suspension, or differential, to the ground</em>) is always required, and after any rains, the road will require four-wheel drive. Always check with a park ranger for current road conditions before setting out. Allow at least one-half day for this excursion.</p> <h4>Safety Precautions and Regulations</h4> <p>While exploring the area, remember to leave all objects in place in the park; collecting is prohibited. Because they are old, fragile, and unsafe, please stay off of the remaining structures. Avoid handling the bricks of the Scott Furnace and condensers or handling mine tailings as they may contain poisonous concentrations of mercury. Finally, be careful around the mine shafts; although most are fenced, they are vertical and deep, and other unfenced shafts may exist in the area.</p> <h4>Learn more about the Mariscal Mine:</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/learn/historyculture/mariscalmine.htm\">Mariscal Mine - Big Bend National Park</a></p>",

These areas contain little vegetation, making it hard for the ground to soak up the brief, but heavy rainfall associated with isolated thunderstorms. The variety of features here show the result of erosion carving both the hard and soft rock layers, some of which are nearly horizontal while others dip at steep angles.

Prior to 1920, settlers describe Tornillo Flat as a grassland covered by tobosa grass. Pronghorn once ran here over the grassy flats. This grassland provided some of the best range in West Texas, allowing for the birth and growth of successful ranches.<br /> <br /> However, decades of overgrazing by livestock began to eliminate the grasses. Drought killed what remained. Once the protective grass cover was removed, erosion stripped the precious topsoil away and the land lost its ability to hold water. <br /> <br /> Can damaged lands be restored? The National Park Service has taken on the challenge of restoring native grasses with a long-term project called \"Grasslands Not Badlands.\" Over the years, and through trial and error, park staff have researched and developed different techniques to encourage growth of native grass species. A successful method has evolved to lay lines of dead vegetation perpendicular to the flow of water across the landscape. These strips slow the flow of run off after it rains and let the soil absorb more moisture. This technique is visible on both sides of the road between mile markers 11 and 10. ",

From this mile marker, you should have a great view of the Chisos Mountains, located about 18 miles to the south. But some days the air quality is so poor that those mountains are lost in a haze of pollution. <br /> <br /> Over half of Big Bend's visibility impairment is due to sulfates, while organic carbons, nitrates, and wind-blown particles account for the remaining components. Sources of sulfate particles include coal-fired power plants, metal smelters, refineries, and other industrial facilities.<br /> <br /> Air quality here varies significantly by season. Prevailing winter winds are from the north and west, while summer winds are usually from the south and east. Air masses arriving from the southeast bring the highest concentrations of sulfates and create the poorest visibility. Research indicates that, during this peak period, pollution originates from sources in the eastern United States, east Texas, and northeast Mexico. <br /> <br /> What can be done? The National Park Service works cooperatively with the Environmental Protection Agency, the state of Texas, and Mexico to improve visibility in Big Bend. The use of modern emission-control technology on existing pollution sources, the careful placement and control of new industry, and the involvement of concerned citizens can help to restore visiblity.",

        "notes": "Mule Ears Trail\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/mule-ears-trail.htm\n\n<h4>Trail Information</h4> Roundtrip Distance: 3.8 miles (6 km)<br /> Elevation Change: 880 feet (243 m) cumulative elevation change<br /> Average Hiking Time: 2 hours<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Dogs and other pets are not allowed on any trails in the park.</em></strong><br /> <br /> The Mule Ears Spring trail is a hike through the desert to an historic corral and spring. For much of the journey, the trail crosses rolling desert terrain, descending into dry washes and climbing over low divides. Watch for cottonwood trees in the washes. Tallest of the desert trees, cottonwoods mark the location of a spring or water that is relatively close to the surface. Near the end of the trail, you'll skirt a large, rock corral. Continue past the corral and down the drainage to a small spring. The cool, shaded slope is covered with maidenhair ferns. Cattails line the slow-moving spring flow. Sit on the rocks and listen to the sound of water in the desert. Watch for birds coming into the trees, leopard frogs hopping into the water, and dragonflies patrolling the stream. <br /> <br /> Beyond the spring, the Mule Ears Trail connects to the Smoky Creek Trail. Smoky Creek is an 18.3-mile desert hike that connects to the northern end of the Dodson Trail. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> Watch for loose gravel and unsteady footing on this rolling dirt and rock trail. You'll need to navigate a number of short, but steep climbs out of the washes and across the divides.<br /> <br /> The paved parking lot at the trailhead provides parking for about 15 vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail. ",

At Castolon, in addition to the barracks, separate houses were built to house the commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers. These houses were barely used by the cavalry officers before the Mexican Revolution ended and they were assigned elsewhere. Originally, these houses had porches on each end of the building. However, after Wayne Cartledge purchased them in 1925, he modified the building by enclosing one side on each house to create kitchens for the residents.<br /> <br /> Over the years these houses have been occupied by the Cartledge family, La Harmonia Company employees, visiting researchers, and national park staff. One of the houses operates as a ranger station and a temporary Visitor Center. The original Visitor Center was destroyed on May 22, 2019 when a fire in Mexico jumped the Rio Grande.

In 1914, he sold the land to Clyde Buttrill, who hired James Sublett to operate the farm and store previously run by Hernandez. Sublett built the adobe buildings located here before selling the land to two Texas Rangers, Bates and Jones, in 1918. The next year they sold the land to the newly formed La Harmonia Company.<br /> <br /> The La Harmonia Store opened in early 1919 and soon became an important part of the Castolon community, due to the integrity and common sense of Wayne Cartledge. Cartledge developed a reputation as a fair businessman who helped his neighbors, regardless of citizenship or language. Fluent in Spanish and English, he settled disputes, translated letters, provided banking services, and acted as a wholesale distributor of American-made merchandise bound for the remote villages of northern Mexico. In many ways, Wayne Cartledge seemed determined to validate La Harmonia’s name by working for peaceful and harmonious relations between the people of western Texas and northern Mexico.",

Giant cane, or Arundo donax, is a Mediterranean species of river cane originally brought by Spaniards to Texas missions in the 18th century.<br /> The cane is problematic because it draws enormous amounts of water, displaces native vegetation, and narrows the river channel by stabilizing silt and gravel which would otherwise flow downstream. Methods for cane removal generally include using combinations of fire, bulldozers, herbicide, and labor-intensive hand tools. <br />  ",

At first glance, ocotillo (pronounced “Oh-co-TEE-yo”) looks like a tall, spindly shrub that died - a cluster of drab, gray stalks covered in sharp half inch spines, and no obvious signs of life like leaves along the branches. This bare bones appearance is actually part of ocotillo’s desert survival strategy. Plants lose most of their water through their leaves during photosynthesis. Ocotillo and several other desert plants have adapted to desert life by moving the photosynthesis into their stems. This strategy of photosynthesis is not as efficient or as productive as in typical plants, but the plants do save a lot of water and that is the principal issue for a desert dweller. Leaves are either not produced, or only produced during wet times of the year when the water losses are affordable to the plant. <br /> The real surprise though is in the spring when seemingly “dead stalks” of ocotillo burst into bloom. Slender clusters of bright red orange, tubular flowers form at the ends of the stalks, and in areas with abundant ocotillo plants it can look like a red haze is hanging just above the plants from a distance! Ocotillo are often mistaken for cactus, but in fact they are a member of a small, unrelated family of primarily South American plants, of which it is the northernmost representative. ",

Santa Elena Canyon is 8 miles (13km) long and 1,500 feet (450 m) deep. In some places the canyon walls are only 30 feet (9 meters) wide. The Rio Grande established its present course on basin-filling sediments that covered the rocks and faults we see exposed today. The river eroded through the surface layers and cut steep-sided canyons in the more resistant Lower Cretaceous limestones. Today you can see those ancient limestone formations exposed in the canyon walls. A popular way to explore the length of Santa Elena Canyon is on a two or three-day river rafting trip that begins in the town of Lajitas, located outside the national park.</p>",

Conditions change constantly at this location. Depending upon recent rains, Terlingua Creek may be dry sand, thick mud, or flowing water. Carefully assess conditions before attempting to cross. Many hikers try to keep their feet dry and take long circuitous routes up Terlingua Creek into dangerous cliff areas. This is NOT the maintained trail and can be extremely dangerous. </p> <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> <p>This trail may be impassable due to flooding during the summer rainy season. Check with park staff about the current trail condition. Wear old shoes in case the Terlingua Creek crossing is muddy. If the water here is deep and swift,<u> do not cross</u>.

In 1914, the Subletts moved into the Alvino House, running the store for four years before starting large-scale farming in the area. In 1918, Sublett purchased four sections of land at this location, and called his operation Grand Canyon Farms. Mr. Sublett was one of the first settlers in the Big Bend area to actively farm the Rio Grande floodplain on a large scale. Using mule-drawn Fresno scrapers and lightweight blades he owned from his days as an earth moving contractor for the Southern Pacific Railroad, Sublett leveled fields and improved irrigation in the Castolon area.<br /> <br /> Over the years, the floodplain the Subletts farmed has become overgrown with mesquite and tamarisk trees. The National Park Service is attempting, to a certain degree, to restore the historic landscape at the Sublett farm using mechanical brush removal and prescribed fire. When the property became part of Big Bend National Park, it was unfortunately demolished, as it was not part of the natural landscape and was not yet considered to be of historical value.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

The spring was once part of the Homer Wilson Ranch. Water for livestock was piped to a stock tank located just north of the present parking lot. You may see sections of the old pipe along the trail.<br /> The spring is marked by a dense thicket of willow, walnuts, and sumac. Depending on rainfall, the spring may create shallow pools of water as it flows a short distance across the surface. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The trail is narrow and rocky with several short, but steep, descents and ascents that take you across drainages. The entire trail is exposed until you come to the spring. Because of the exposure, this hike is best done during the cooler months or very early in the morning during the summer.<br /> A paved pullout at the trailhead provides parking for about 4 vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.",

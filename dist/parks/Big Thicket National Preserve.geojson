Named in honor of the National Park Service's centennial anniversary in 2016, the project has successfully seen over 100,000 longleaf pine seedlings planted by NPS staff, volunteers, students, and partner organizations.<br /> <br /> Why replant longleaf pines? This tree species was once one of the most abundant pine species in the southeastern United States; however, it has been reduced to less than three percent of its former range due to logging and fire suppression. A healthy longleaf pine savannah provides habitat for many birds, pollinators, and plants that live nowhere else. Texas trailing phlox, an endangered flower, can only be found in the longleaf pine forests of southeast Texas.</p> <h2>Getting Here</h2> <p>GPS Coordinates:<br /> 30.649656, -94.670071<br /> <br /> The Centennial Forest is located in the Big Sandy Creek Unit near Dallardsville, Texas.

Rosier grew up exploring the thicket and was fascinated with its diverse plant life. Uninterested in hunting for jobs or game animals, Rosier preferred to hunt for rare flowers. He would wander through the woods, sometimes for days, making observations of the plant and animal life he saw.<br /> <br /> Known as “Mr. Big Thicket,” Rosier was self-taught but knew just about every plant he encountered in the Big Thicket. He led popular guided tours for visiting professors, politicians, researchers, students, and just about anyone who wanted to learn about the thicket. His expertise contributed to greater awareness of the Big Thicket's biodiversity, and its need for protection.<br /> <br /> Rosier was an advocate for the creation of a Big Thicket park. He worked with grassroots organizations, including the Big Thicket Association, to push the state and national governments to protect the woods that he so dearly loved.<br /> <br /> Lance Rosier continued to guide people into the thicket until his death in 1970. His dream was finally realized when Big Thicket National Preserve was established on October 11, 1974. Though he did not live long enough to see his beloved Big Thicket become a park, his legacy lives on in the Lance Rosier Unit.</p>",

However, his well did not produce very much, and he abandoned it shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> In the years that followed, Saratoga drew interest from exploratory oil prospectors, known as “wildcatters,” and a small producing oil well was built on-site. <br /> <br /> In the early 1900s, the oilfield became commercially successful for the first time as oil production soared. Many large wooden derricks were built and construction began on a railroad to connect the town's oil and lumber industries with larger markets. The rapid growth from the oil boom slowed by the end of the decade, though wells in the 1950s and 1970s remained profitable.<br /> <br /> Production continues today with many small pumpjacks in action around the oilfield.</p> <h2>Private Property</h2> <p><strong>Note: </strong>The Saratoga Oilfield is on private property and trespassing is not allowed.

The original chimney was made of mud and the roof had cypress shingles. Outside, Jimmy’s wife, Elda, planted acorns that became the large oaks that loom over the cabin today. Next to the cabin, the Staleys had a vegetable garden surrounded by a hog-proof fence and an orchard of plum and fig trees.<br /> <br /> After living here for a couple of years, Jimmy Staley found out that his homestead was built on timber company land! The Kirby Lumber Company owned the property and tried to evict the family but eventually decided to let them remain after Jimmy signed an acknowledgement of tenancy.<br /> <br /> In 1962, Jimmy Staley sold the cabin. Later owners made improvements, including replacements of the roof and chimney. In 1977, three years after the establishment of Big Thicket National Preserve, the National Park Service bought the cabin and surrounding property. The cabin was used as the preserve’s visitor center until 2001.<br /> <br /> The inside of the cabin is not open but visitors may walk around the grounds and use the picnic tables.

Bald cypress is easily identified by its wide, buttressed trunk, needle-like leaves, and unusual root features called cypress knees.<br /> <br /> Cypress knees are whimsical in appearance, looking like a gathering of goblins. They are an above-ground extension of bald cypress roots, though scientists do not fully understand their purpose. Some studies suggest that the knees provide stability in the swampy conditions or help the roots with gas exchange.<br /> <br /> Visit during different seasons to see the swamp’s many moods. Spring and summer provide a spectacular amount of greenery. Fall brings a dramatic palette of color as bald cypress leaves turn a rich copper color. Winter’s mood is muted, as the trees’ bare branches are exposed in the chilly air.<br /> <br /> Though the swamp is quite scenic, it’s not entirely natural. An abandoned logging road on the west edge of the swamp acts as a dam, holding water in place that would normally flow down to Little Pine Island Bayou. As a result, it created the perfect conditions for a bald cypress swamp.</p> <h2>Explore the Swamp</h2> <p>Feeling adventurous? Explore the swamp on foot.

While vehicles can’t cross the bridge anymore, you can still walk across it.</strong><br /> <br /> It is not known when the bridge was built, but it likely carried loggers and oil workers across the bayou. After timber and oil production slowed, companies moved on to the next profitable piece of land, leaving behind empty bridges and roads.<br /> <br /> Little Pine Island Bayou flows slowly beneath the bridge. On its journey to the Gulf of Mexico, this water will flow into Pine Island Bayou near Bevil Oaks. Pine Island Bayou then flows into the Neches River north of Beaumont. Finally, the Neches pours into Sabine Lake near Port Arthur, where the Sabine River carries it out to the Gulf of Mexico.<br /> <br /> Along the bayou, dwarf palmettos add a jungle-like quality to the scenery. One of a handful of palmettos native to Texas, this variety is very tolerant of shade and freezing temperatures.</p> <h2>Walk the Old Road</h2> <p>Feeling adventurous? You can cross the Bridge to Nowhere on foot and follow the old road through the palmettos. The path ends after ½ mile at a pipeline right-of way.</p> <ul> <li>Uneven pavement—Watch your step on the Bridge to Nowhere.</li> <li>Watch out for snakes.</li> <li>Hunting is allowed here from October 1 to February 28. Wear orange if you enter the woods during hunting season.</li> </ul>",

Rising from the plains, over 800 ft. (244 m.) higher than the North Platte River, it has beckoned to hunters, explorers, emigrants, traders and vacationers over the centuries. For travelers from the east, it gives a welcome visual relief from the monotony of the plains. <br /> <br /> Named for Hiram Scott, an unfortunate fur trader who died near the base in 1828, the bluffs were once part of a higher plain. Only a few elevations remain after rivers carried away the soft sedimentary stone which wind, water and humans continue to erode. Layers of sandstone, siltstone, Brule clay, volcanic ash, and pipy concretions of limestone are exposed along the faces of the bluffs, telling the story of geologic processes in the area.  <br /> <br /> Although Chimney Rock, visible 23 miles to the east, is made up of the same layers as Scotts Bluff, it lacks the limestone that acts as a cap for these bluffs. Emigrants in the wagon trains commented on how long Chimney Rock might last, some giving it only a decade. In fact, Chimney Rock is the most frequently mentioned landmark in the pioneer diaries. Scotts Bluff comes in second, probably due to its size and its position next to the river where it caused wagon trains to divert to the south. <br /> <br /> Few people could enjoy this view until the 20th century. After Scotts Bluff National Monument was established in 1919, local residents lobbied the Park Service for easy access to the top. The first project was the Scout, or Zig Zag Trail on the east side along with a picnic area. In 1931 the director of the Park Service visited and agreed to build a road to the summit. Depression Era program enrollees dug tunnels, graded the road and parking area. Young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) planted trees, sodded the side of the road, built a picnic area in Mitchell Pass and built many of the present park structures of adobe.<br /> <br /> If you had the opportunity to protect an untouched Scotts Bluff, what improvements would you allow? <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A watercolor painting of a distinctive sandstone formation with a tall spire. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> Chimney Rock is obviously smaller than in the 19th century, but it is still visible on the horizon from this point.  <br /> Credit: \"<em>Chimney Rock</em>\" watercolor by William Henry Jackson, Scotts Bluff National Monument collection.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A black and white image of men working with hand tools to level the ground. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> Civil Works Administration enrollees level the summit parking area by hand in 1933.

At first it was just a barrier between them and their goals further west. Oregon had the fertile Willamette Valley, California had gold and Utah was the Promised Land. <br /> <br /> As they passed in their thousands: their animals devoured the grasses, their wagons ground deep paths and the people brought diseases to Native Americans who had no resistance. The presence of so many people crossing the plains disrupted the migration of several animal herds the Native Americans depended on for food, tools, clothing and housing. <br /> <br /> Some of the animals disappeared completely, others moved to ever shrinking habitats. The Prairie wolf and Audubon bighorn sheep are now extinct. Lone bears, elk, moose and antelope show up once every few years. The only bison in the area no longer roam free, they live on ranches instead. <br /> <br /> Once Nebraska opened to homesteading, settlers gradually made their way to the Scotts Bluff area. Using modern irrigation techniques, the North Platte River watered their crops and cattle, trees were planted as wind breaks and the face of the American prairie became what you see today. Soon the \"Great American Desert\" became a vital part of the nation's food production. <br /> <br /> What untouched areas are close to your home? Are they, or should they be, preserved? <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> Parallell wheel ruts are seen cutting through a prairie landscape.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> Scars from wagon wheels still mark the landscape.

Drinking water is the first thing that comes to mind for most of us. Wild animals are drawn to the water, making it a good place to hunt. Rivers provide natural pathways which travelers follow. Some rivers are navigable and boats transport people and cargo along them.<br /> <br /> Most people from the east did not consider the North Platte River to be a very good river. It was wide, shallow and silty with a sandy bottom. Many sources say it was the “49ers” who claimed “It is too thick to drink and too thin to plow.” Those who planned to drink the river water had to either filter it through cloth or allow the sediment to settle before drinking. Crossing it was dangerous since wagons would start to sink into the soft silt if they paused for even a moment.<br /> <br /> Water in the North Platte River may have been poor quality, but it was essential in the high, dry plains. Hunting was fair until the game was scared away by the sheer number of people traveling by. But the most vital role it played was as a guide for the people on the wagon trains. Following the river meant that they were on the correct path.<br /> <br /> Look at a modern map to see the number of large cities that are next to rivers and how many roads still follow them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Quote:</strong> “The water is miserable. The Platte River is about one mile wide, and a quick-sand bottom. The channel changes almost daily.”<br /> -Sherman Hawley; excerpt from letter sent from Fort Laramie June 20, 1849<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A black and white photograph of a bluff covered with scattered pines and sandy, shallow river below. ",

It was a land inhabited by nomadic people who followed the immense herds of bison. These Native American tribes knew and understood the prairie, its animals and plants. <br /> <br /> The Great Plains are very different today. They have been altered by modern people; both the bison herds and the plains Native Americans' nomadic way of life are gone. <br /> <br /> Thousands of acres of untouched prairie are lost to agriculture and development each year. Less than one percent of the original 400,000 square miles (256 million acres) of native prairie exists. What remains grows in small, fragmented acreages. Today the dominant native prairie plants at Scotts Bluff include needleandthread and blackroot sedge. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> Fire moves across grasses, leaving charred remains on the left-hand side.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> Prairie grasses and plants are seen below sandstone bluffs. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> Prescribed fire is used to maintain a restored prairie.

After that, fur traders traveled both ways to trap, trade and attend rendezvous. <br /> <br /> Once wagons traversed the trail, the reasons to travel along it multiplied with vast numbers of people moving west looking for land, riches and religious freedom. The number of people who turned around is unknown. <br /> <br /> Motives for returning to their starting points varied with the people. Some \"saw the elephant\" and quit in the midst of their westbound journey. Hardships, deaths and the realization that this was not what they wanted were all reasons to become a \"go-backer\" or turnaround. Other people made it to their destination and found it was not for them. Some returned for good and others came back only long enough to bring other family members to the west.<br /> <br /> Traders drove massive freight wagons both ways on the trail. Army units also rode the trail east and west as they watched for problems along the route. The short-lived Pony Express galloped each direction as they carried mail between St. Joseph, Missouri and San Francisco, California.<br /> <br /> With traffic running two ways through such a narrow pass, how do you think they avoided having traffic jams?<br /> <br /> <strong>Image: </strong>A watercolor painting of a large group of men on horses.

Since there were few forts in the early years, aid often came from the feared \"savages.\" Instead of attacking wagon trains as the eastern newspapers predicted, tribes often provided directions, offered ferry service, carried mail and traded for a variety of items among other aid. <br /> <br /> By the 1860's, though, the tribes became frustrated with the loss of their way of life and the breaking of treaties. The result was more frequent conflict.<br /> <br /> The army established Fort Mitchell, among others, in 1864 to help protect wagon trains from the growing unrest among the Native Americans. The 11th Ohio's Company F manned the adobe fort, located west of Mitchell Pass. Soldiers endured poor living conditions during the summers they occupied the fort. Their orders were to protect the pioneers. The fort was abandoned by mid-1866.<br /> <br /> Consider the challenges you face during a long journey.

Floods and lightning caused grass fires killed seedlings that tried to grow on the plains. Mixed tall and short grasses grew on the prairie around the bluffs, perfect grazing for the bison and elk that lived here. Only on top of the bluffs were trees able to grow. <br /> <br /> To the first people of this area, it was not barren. There was life everywhere. Along with game to hunt, there were fish in the river. Many of the plants had multiple uses including the yucca, prickly pear, chokecherry, sunflower, wild onion and wild licorice. The land was bountiful and appreciated.<br /> <br /> Wildlife, including bear, antelope, praiie wolves, coyotes and the all-important bison, roamed the area. What better spot to scout the location of the herds than from the top of the bluff?<br /> <br /> The first recorded sighting of the bluffs was by a party of men from John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Companyheaded east from Oregon in 1812. On Christmas Day, Robert Stuart wrote: \"The hills on the south have lately approached the river, are remarkably rugged and Bluffy, and possess a few Cedars.\" The first white men did not leave much of a mark on the prairie. There were few fur traders and they traveled across the plains quickly.<br /> <br /> What did your home look like before modern houses and landscaping changed it? <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A watercolor painting of Scotts Bluff Circa 1837.

The lower right hand side features an image of a gentle pass in the prairie known as Robidoux Pass.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Title</strong>: Choices<br /> <br /> <strong>Text</strong>: What route would you take? Wagon trains that arrived at Scotts Bluff had a choice to make. Although they wanted to stay close to the North Platte River, the bluffs were in the way. Traveling through the badlands next to the river was impossible for wagons. Before 1851 the ravines on the west side of the bluffs prevented wagons from going though the notch ahead of you. They could cross the river to the north side. That meant braving the water current and quicksand. Or they could take Robidoux Pass to the south and make a long detour.<br /> <br /> Robidoux Pass received its name from two brothers who built a trading post on the trail. A nearby spring of good water; a blacksmith available for repairs and the chance to buy or trade for needed items helped make this a decent route to travel. <br /> <br /> In 1850 soldiers from Fort Laramie or traders in competition with Robidoux created a one-wagon wide trail through the ravines. The new route brought them back to the river eight miles before the old one. Emigrants started to take advantage of the shorter route back to the river in the 1851 travel season. <br /> <br /> Visit Robidoux Pass and see if you think it would be a better route. <br /> <br /> <strong>Quote:</strong> From the 1851 diary of William C. Lobenstine<br /> \"We approached Scotch Bluffs ...The rock itself is separated nearly at its middle, having a pass here about fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending at both sides perpendicular to a height of three hundred to four hundred feet. The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is now preferred by nearly all the emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight miles from the old road.\" <br /> <br /> <strong>Image: </strong>Trade goods pictured include five metal rings, two rowels (the circular spikes that are part of a boot spur), beaded necklaces, and four metal dangles. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> The covered wagon trade lasted for only one and a half months each year.

In 1933, the top of the metal survey post in front of you was level with the rock surface. In just a few decades a considerable volume of sandstone has eroded away. <br /> <br /> One by one, the grains of sand that make up this sedimentary rock break off, then blow or wash away. Given time, the persistent action of rain, ice, and wind will reduce Scotts Bluff to the level of the surrounding flatlands. <br /> <br /> Erosion may happen slowly over time or suddenly with a rock slide. Weather elements often combine to make larger erosion events occur. <br /> <br /> Human footsteps greatly accelerate the erosion of soft sandstone formations. Please help to preserve Scotts Bluff for future generations by remaining on the hard-surfaced trails. <br /> <br /> What can you do to prevent erosion? <br /> <br /> <strong>Primary Image:</strong> Layers of soft, tan sandstone rock are seen capped with a layer of harder, gray limestone. <br /> <br /> <strong>Primary Image Caption:</strong> Cap layers of hard, erosion-resistant rock help to protect softer layers below. The cap rock in front of you is gradually breaking away, exposing the pale, easily-crumbled sandstone to the elements.

Although he had no prior experience, Jackson quickly learned to yoke and drive the multiple yokes (pairs) of oxen that pulled each wagon. Seventy years later he returned to dedicate the new Park Service museum on the east side of the pass. By this time he was a well-known photographer, artist, and supporter of emigrant trail history. Jackson guided the park rangers to this spot where he and his fellow bullwhackers bedded down for the night.<br /> <br /> Using memories of his own experiences, sketches he made during his travels and revisiting the sites, Jackson depicted scenes of trail life from the Missouri River to the west coast. His watercolor paintings grace many books about the trails and most of his collection was donated to Scotts Bluff National Monument in 1949. <br /> <br /> How do you memorialize your travels?<br /> <br /> <strong>Quote</strong>: \"Thursday, August 2nd. At noon we corralled ... 10 miles from Scotts Bluffs, which loom up before us in all their variety of outline. In the P.M. we drove up into the pass that leads through them.

Rising abruptly from the plains, it inspired some to write poetic descriptions in their diaries. It was a relief to people on their westward journey to Oregon and California to see the bluffs rise from the prairie. They were a milepost that meant a third of the trip was accomplished. They were also a sign that the plains were almost behind them and the mountains were about to begin. The easy portion was over and the difficult part was ahead.<br /> <br /> Emigrants were not the only ones to travel through the pass ahead. Riders for the short-lived Pony Express galloped east and west along the same path. Stagecoaches and the first transcontinental telegraph also followed the trail used by thousands.  Although the first railroad route across the nation ran a few miles south of Mitchell Pass, its impact was felt. Starting in 1869, travelers preferred the faster, safer transportation of the \"Iron Horse\" over the wagon trains. <br /> <br /> Discover more about the travelers of the past while exploring the exhibits at the Visitor Center and walking the trails. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A map of the central and western United States showing the routes of the Oregon Trail, California Trail, Mormon Pioneer Trail and the Pony Express. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> Northern overland routes to the west followed the Platte River towards the Rocky Mountains.

Like the famous Chimney Rock to the east, Scotts Bluff is an outlier formation to the Wildcat Hills, visible along the horizon to your right. <br /> <br /> Twenty-two million years ago, the surface of the plains was as high as Scotts Bluff - a gently sloping landscape composed of sediments from mountains to the west. About 3 million years ago, the Platte River and its tributaries began to erode the high plains. Bit by bit, water carried away massive volumes of soil and rock, creating canyons that grew wider and wider. <br /> <br /> Today only the Wildcat Hills, Scotts Bluff and other erosion-resistant remnants of the high plains remain. On the multi-layered cliff face ahead you can see many of the rock layers that once covered this region. <br /> <br /> How was the land around your home formed? <br /> <br /> <strong>Primary Image:</strong> A section of sandstone bluff known as Saddle Rock is seen with layers of rock.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image Captions:</strong> Slender horizontal bodies of rock called concretions are exposed in the rock here. The pale concretions are lime deposits from underground water. This layer of limestone provides a capstone which protects softer rock layers underneath. <br /> <br /> Large, shallow cavities appear on the cliff face where slabs of rock have fallen away.<br /> <br /> Knobs at this end of Saddle Rock have been protected from erosion by erosion-resistant cap rocks. <br /> <br /> These slabs of sandstone broke away from the cliff face and slumped downward. As they slowly disintegrate, the pieces become part of the slope below. <br /> <br /> Between this slab and the cliff face there's a crack wide enough to see through. Eventually the slab will fall away, and new cracks will appear. <br /> <br /> This white ash layer consists of tiny, wind-borne glass shards erupted from western volcanos. Underneath the ash, oxidation has stained the sandstone a rusty brown. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inset Image:</strong> Gray limestone concretions protrude from layers of sandstone. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inset Image Caption:</strong> Hard, pipe-like limestone concretions help to hold Scotts Bluff together.

Animals made thier paths along it and leading to and from it. Humans followed next; the first traveled lightly, leaving little trace of their passing. Occasionally they would climb the tall bluffs where the height allowed them to see far across the plains.<br /> <br /> It was not too long ago that new men started to use the river as a guide. These men looked for wealth. Fur traders traveled to and from the fur rich mountains to the west. Beaver and other furs were in demand for the fashonable people in the east. Soon buffalo robes were also popular. <br /> <br /> The traders tended to be loners who left little mark on the land since they rarely had more than a couple of horses or mules to carry their furs.<br /> <br /> Once South Pass was discovered and wagons could travel through the Rocky Mountains, the impacts on the land increased. Farmers coveted the fertile land in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. They brought families and friends to settle with them. When word of gold reached the eastern states in 1848, thousands traveled west. Few families crossed the plains as men flooded the trail expecting to become rich quickly in California, then return home.  <br /> <br /> Many emigrants moved west for religious reasons. The earliest wagons belonged to missionaries; the Marcus Whitman party was the first. Later, Mormons fled persecution in the east using the lesser traveled trail on the north side of the Platte River.<br /> <br /> The bluffs now watch over people who have chosen to live here as well as those who travel by. Modes of travel have changed, but the bluffs still serve as a landmark to those following the river. <br /> <br /> What events has a landmark near your home seen? <br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A watercolor painting that serves as a timeline for different groups and methods of travel along the Oregon Trail.

Many traveled on the south side while others stayed on the north side. What determined their decision? Usually it was a matter of where they started along the Missouri River. If they began their journey south of Council Bluffs, they stayed on the south side of the river. For those who embarked from Council Bluffs, as did most Mormons, the north side was their route. Traveling on the north side of the river also reduced the amount of harassment from non-Mormon “Gentiles.”<br /> <br /> Council Bluffs Road, the early name for the trail, served most of the Mormon emigrants as the path to Zion. To escape persecution in the States, Brigham Young, the leader of the church, decided that the valley of the Salt Lake in Utah Territory was far enough from other settlements to be safe. Handcart companies were formed to accommodate European converts with little money to cross the continent. For each group of approximately 20 handcarts, one covered wagon carried extra supplies and tents. The wagons also served as traveling commissaries, transporting food for the emigrants’ meals. Of the 70,000 Mormons who crossed the country to Utah, ten handcart companies brought almost 3,000 emigrants to Utah from 1856 through 1860.<br /> <br /> Each side of the river had its challenges. Since the forts were built on the more-heavily traveled south side of the Platte River, people on the north side had to make dangerous river crossings to visit the forts. Larger numbers on the south side meant poorer sanitation, more disease, and more competition for grazing and campfire fuel.<br /> <br /> What determines your route when you travel?<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A watercolor painting of a large group of emigrants crossing a river. Some of the emigrants push handcarts, while others walk beside covered wagons being pulled by oxen.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> This watercolor shows the mix of handcarts and covered wagons that made up a typical handcart company.

It was large enough to transport loads up to 8 tons, and was drawn by horses, mules or oxen. It was designed to help keep its contents from moving about when in motion and to aid it in crossing rivers and streams.The first known mention of the Conestoga Wagon was by Ben Garcia on December 31, 1717. It was named after the “Conestoga River” or “ Conestoga Township” in Lancaster Co, Pennsylvania.<br /> <br /> To protect the wagon contents against bad weather, a strong white canvas cover was stretched across the wagon. The covers were made of either tightly woven homespun hemp, cotton sailcoth or canvas.The canopy was roped to the sideboards and stretched tightly over the end bows. Fastened to the headboard and tailgate, a drawstring pulled the cloth cover securely together.<br /> <br /> The current Conestoga Wagon at Scotts Bluff was purchased and donated to the Monument by the Oregon Trail Museum Association in 1973.",

Over time, wind and water erosion slowly sculpted the rocks into their current courthouse or castle appearance. The rocks were first noted by Robert Stuart in 1812 and quickly became guiding landmarks for fur traders and emigrants. Travelers on the south side of the Platte river had a close-up view of these celebrated landmarks, which made them a popular item for emigrants to write about and sketch in their diaries.<br /> <br /> Today, the rocks are open to the public. Reaching them requires traveling on an unpaved road that is suitable for most vehicles when dry. At the end of the road is a hiking trail that leads to Courthouse Rock. Note, this trail used to lead to the top of the rock, but large sections of the trail have since eroded away. Use extreme caution when hiking. Open year-round, daylight hours. No tourist facilities at the site nor staff presence. </p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>In November of 1841, Rufus B.

        "name": "Fort Mitchell Site",
        "notes": "Fort Mitchell Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/fort-mitchell-site.htm\n\nA grouping of historical markers commemorate Fort Mitchell, which was constructed in 1864 to protect emigrants traveling along the Oregon/California Trails from attacks by Native American groups. The actual fort was located south of the markers on private property along the North Platte River. Please respect private property by viewing the site from the pullout.   <h3>Forgotten Outpost</h3> <p>During America’s westward expansion, the United States Army established hundreds of small outposts throughout the frontier to protect settlers, maintain communication with the West Coast, and serve as staging areas for military campaigns. Some of these posts have become an integral part of American history, such as Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley in Kansas and Fort Laramie in Wyoming. Most served less conspicuously and then faded into obscurity. One such outpost was Nebraska Territory’s Fort Mitchell.</p> <h3>Protecting the West</h3> <p>The American Civil War brought a new significance to the western territories. The great overland roads such as Santa Fe, Oregon and California Trails continued to carry vast numbers of emigrants and tons of freight. Western gold fields were producing ore that helped finance the Federal government’s war effort, and the newly erected transcontinental telegraph lines helped bind westerners to the Union. But eastern battlefields drained regular Army soldiers from the frontier and left vital western territories unprotected.To provide a military presence in the West, the Federal government sent a few state raised volunteer cavalry regiments to garrison forts that had been vacated by the regulars. Among these volunteers were the 11th Ohio Cavalry, under the command of Colonel William O. Collins, who arrived in Nebraska territory in 1862. After marching west to Fort Laramie, they were immediately assigned the task of patrolling, escorting freight wagons and stage coaches, and maintaining the telegraph lines along the Oregon Trail in central Wyoming. Eventually, other units from Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas joined the Ohioans on the frontier.</p> <h3>Fight to Control the Plains</h3> <p>Traffic over the roads continued unabated until early August 1864, when the plains erupted in an Indian war that pitted the volunteer soldiers against Sioux, Arapaho, and Southern Cheyenne warriors. Determined to drive the Americans from their lands, plains warriors swept out of Kansas and attacked homesteaders, stage stations and freight caravans all along the Platte River. For several weeks, all traffic and communications over the Oregon Trail came to a halt. In response to these depredations, several military expeditions sought out the warring tribes, but failed to bring them into battle. This led Brigadier General Robert Mitchell to work to assure that the overland roads would never again be at the mercy of a hostile enemy.</p> <h3>A New Strategy</h3> <p>The general planned to fortify each stage station along the Oregon Trail and detail troops to protect them. He also decided to build two new forts at strategic sites along the Platte River. To help defend the road that branched off the Oregon Trail and followed the South Platte to Denver, the first post was built near Julesburg, Colorado. For the first year of its existence, this post was known as Fort Rankin, and had a garrison of soldiers from the 7th Iowa Cavalry. It proved its value by withstanding two Indian assaults in the early weeks of 1865, and later served to protect workers during the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. The second post was placed along the North Platte River near Scotts Bluff. Official records documenting Fort Mitchell’s history are meager, but construction had begun by September 1, 1864, the date General Mitchell visited the site. The general’s aide-de-camp noted that the men of the 11th Ohio’s Company F were hard at work building the sod structure. Captain Jacob Shuman, the first commander of the as yet unnamed post, gave General Mitchell a tour of the site and described his plans for a sod stockade he hoped to have finished before winter set in. By the end of October, most of the work had been completed and the post was named for the general who had ordered its construction.</p> <h3>Conflict Grows</h3> <p>Hostilities on the plains intensified after November 29, 1864, when Colorado volunteer soldiers killed several hundred Cheyenne and Arapahos at Sand Creek, Colorado. Rather than bringing an end to the conflict, the massacre at Sand Creek resulted in renewed warfare and bloodshed. Convinced that the southern plains were no longer safe, several Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho bands began to move north to spend the winter in the remote Powder River region of Wyoming. However, enroute they encountered military forces stationed along the overland roads. First, they crossed paths with the 7th Iowa Cavalry at Fort Rankin. On February 2, 1865, the Indians stripped the post of anything useful. Two days later, they attacked a fortified telegraph station at Mud Springs, Nebraska. The Indians failed to cut the telegraph wires, allowing the 11 desperate soldiers at the tiny outpost to signal Fort Laramie for help. The first cavalrymen to respond came from Fort Mitchell. The siege continued until February 5th, when additional support arrived from Fort Laramie. After some additional skirmishing, the Indian bands crossed the frozen North Platte River and continued northwest.</p> <h3>Seeking Peace</h3> <p>The spring of 1865 saw a short-lived attempt at peace on the frontier. Tired of warfare, the Brule Sioux came in to Fort Laramie and asked to be allowed to live in peace near that post. The Army welcomed the gesture, but was unwilling to support the Indians with rations this far west, and decided to move the band to Fort Kearny in central Nebraska. The wary Sioux were allowed to keep their weapons for the journey, while the cavalry escort was not issued ammunition in hopes of avoiding confrontation. Distrust and fear of being moved near their enemies, the Pawnee, led the Brules to flee just three days into the journey. While trying to prompt the Indians into striking camp, the commander of the escort was shot. A skirmish ensued, and reinforcements were sent for from Fort Mitchell. Before relief arrived, the Sioux escaped by crossing the North Platte River and the outnumbered soldiers did not pursue.</p> <h3>Life at the Fort</h3> <p>For the next two years, Fort Mitchell continued to serve as a reassuring force to travelers on the Oregon Trail. Hundreds of freight wagons, emigrant trains and stage coaches passed Fort Mitchell. Detachments from the fort safely escorted them all, despite the fact that the post’s garrison never exceeded 100 men. Conditions at Fort Mitchell were crude and demanding. Endless hours of patrol and escort duty were interrupted only by the constant maintenance of the fort’s sod walls and corrals. Poor sanitary conditions and a monotonous diet of hardtack and salt pork added to the soldier’s hardships. Despite the poor living conditions, only one man is known to have died at Fort Mitchell. Following the end of the Civil War, regular army soldiers returned to the West, and one company of the 18th Infantry was stationed at Fort Mitchell. These foot soldiers were helpless against highly mobile Indian warriors, and once suffered the indignity of having 112 mules stolen from a freight train camped within sight of the fort.</p> <h3>Fading into Obscurity</h3> <p>No official record of the post’s abandonment exists, but Margaret Carrington, wife of Col Henry Carrington, made one of the last accounts of Fort Mitchell as an active military post. The Carringtons stopped at the site in June 1866, and described it as follows: “This is a sub-post of Fort Laramie of peculiar style and compactness. The walls of the quarters are also the outlines of the fort itself, and the four sides of the rectangle are respectively the quarters of offices, soldiers, horses and the warehouse of supplies”. Soon after, Fort Mitchell faded into obscurity. The sod walls quickly deteriorated, and wind and rain removed all signs that the post ever existed. Today, plows turn up occasional reminders of Fort Mitchell in the form of rusted metal artifacts. Although no physical indications of the post remain, nearby Mitchell Pass preserves the name and serves as a reminder that for three years, Fort Mitchell stood guard along the Oregon Trail during an important period in American history.</p>",

As the name implies it was not powered by an animal, but was pushed or pulled by the individual.

It was often seen as an economical means of bringing impoverished Mormon converts west to Salt Lake City. <br /> <br /> A typical handcart was 3 feet wide by 4 feet long. It had a shallow box about 9 inches high. Wheels were 4 feet tall and could carry an approximate load of several hundred pounds. Most converts were limited to what they could carry because of weight restrictions set by the Mormon Church and the capacity of the handcart.<br /> <br /> Across the front of the cart was a cross bar that allowed the cart to be pushed or pulled. Some carts also sported a canvas top resembling miniature covered wagons. Since carts were often made entirely of wood they were often noisy and subject to frequent breakdowns.

They were usually nine feet high with a twelve foot long bed. The bed of a Murphy wagon had a straight box, unlike its more famous counterpart, the Conestoga, which had a curved box.

        "notes": "Robidoux Pass\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/robidoux-pass.htm\n\n<h2>History of Robidoux Pass</h2> <p>The earliest travelers to use Robidoux Pass were probably trappers, traders and missionaries who took their pack trains up the North Platte River to the Rocky Mountains in the 1820’s. In 1830, wagons of fur trading cavavans were the first to use the pass and reach the Rocky Mountains, showing the way for the thousands of emigrant wagons to follow. The first wagon train through the pass was the Bidwell-Bartleson Party in 1841. Despite its water and wood, overland travelers were never satisfied with Robidoux Pass because it took them so far away from the North Platte River. A second gap in the bluffs, today called “Mitchell Pass”, skirted the base of the highest promontory and lay closer to the river. Historian Merrill Mathes noted, <em>“Up to and including 1850, the Robidoux Pass route was used almost exclusively by the successive waves of fur traders, missionary parties, soldiers and emigrants. In the year 1851, travel was about equally divided between the two routes. From 1852 onward, Mitchell Pass was heavily favored, although Robidoux Pass was occasionally used.”</em></p> <h3>Who was Robidoux?</h3> <p>Although all the facts are not fully established, it appears that he was Joseph E. Robidoux, oldest son of the Joseph Robidoux who founded St. Joseph, MO. The other “Frenchman” seen there was his uncle, Antoine Robidoux, who earlier achieved pioneering fame in Utah and California. The younger Joseph may well have been the Robidoux who led the first American Fur Company contingent by Scotts Bluff in 1830.</p> <h3>Old Robidoux Pass</h3> <p>Robidoux Pass is a gap passing through the Wildcat Hills about 9 miles west of Gering, Nebraska. The Pass was the route of the Oregon/California Trail from 1841 through 1850. After 1850, the route passed through Mitchell Pass at Scotts Bluff National Monument. Robidoux Pass has an elevation of 4,554 feet.To use Robidoux Pass, travelers had to swing south away from the North Platte River and proceed nearly 30 miles before they rejoined the river near Horse Creek. Fortunately, springs and nearby cedar trees in the pass provided water and wood for their journey.</p> <h3>Robidoux Trading Posts</h3> <p>The trading post at Robidoux Pass was established by either Joseph or Antoine Robidoux. Traders at this post exchanged goods with Indians for beaver skins and buffalo hides. The post also held a temporary monopoly in providing provisions and services to overland travelers and had a blacksmith shop on site that offered emigrants an opportunity to make repairs to trail-damaged wagons and tend footsore oxen and mules. <br /> <br /> There was a second Robidoux Trading Post located in Carter Canyon. It was inhabited by Antonie Robidoux, his Native American wife, and their 5 children. Other trading posts are known to have existed near the pass at the same time as the Robidoux Trading Post. One such trading post was owned by the American Fur Company. Following the opening of Mitchell Pass in 1851, which provided a shorter trail, Robidoux Pass and the trading posts fell into disuse.</p> <h3>What became of Joseph Robidoux?</h3> <p>Joseph E. Robidoux was reported to have died accidentally at Scotts Bluff, but no grave has been identified. There is evidence that he returned to the Great Nemaha Indian Agency in northern Kansas in the late 1850’s and died in obscurity. It is also thought that Antoine Robidoux died in 1860 in St. Louis, Missouri.</p> <h3>Robidoux Pass Today</h3> <p>Today, none of the historic buildings remain at Robidoux Pass. White posts mark the original route of the emigrant trail. Early accounts of the trip through this area note several burials at the site, two of which can still be seen today, including the “Dunn” grave, one of only 7 marked burial sites along the Oregon Trail. Tools, wagon implements, bullets, and other materials have also been found in this area. After the Mitchell Pass route was improved, the Robidoux Pass route faded into obscurity; it was too far out of the way and too far from the water source of the North Platte River.</p> <h3>How To Get There</h3> <p>Today, Robidoux Pass lies on private property, but is still accessible by the general public who are encouraged to respect the wishes and rights of the owners. A gravel road one mile south of the intersection of Five Rocks Road and Old Oregon Trail leads to the site of the old trading post described by a historical marker.</p>",

This is a good example of the effects erosional forces have on the sand and siltstone which makes up the majority of the bluff. Wind and water have over time sliced away a portion of the rock that was connecting this to the rest of the bluff. Erosion of the bluff occurs slowly and is usually unseen by humans. Wind, rain, and snow wears the bluff away. It slowly washes away grains and particles of sand, silt and ash. Most of the rock slides that occur in the park happen within this the Brule Formation. The Brule Formation is large and makes up one third of the exposed rock of the bluffs. <br /> <br /> Now look above the tunnel entrance. Do you notice the thick band of volcanic ash? It’s a whitish color on top and a brownish color on the bottom. This layer is several feet thick in some places. Between 28 to 32 million years ago, massive volcanic eruptions occurred in mountain ranges west of here, some as far away as present day Nevada. Ash from these eruptions was carried eastward by winds. It then fell as ashfall on what would one day be western Nebraska. ",

One is located to the east of the Visitor Center. The other trailhead is located along the North Overlook Trail at the summit of Scotts Bluff. </p> <p>Imagine hiking on Scotts Bluff’s most popular trail and running into a regular who hikes the trail daily for exercise - or perhaps members of a local high school cross country team training for an upcoming meet. Though hiking the paved trail could be considered a workout, a majority of the hikers simply do it to experience the environment – to see and count the geological layers of the bluff, or even to see the needle and thread grass or the mysterious spiderwort flower. Others want to see the soaring raptors or the western box turtle slowly crawling on the prairie. Still others use the trail to walk through the foot tunnel dug as a test prior to the Summit Road’s vehicular tunnels in 1933. These are all possible by hiking the Saddle Rock Trail. <br /> <br /> The first one-third of the trail from the visitor center is relatively level as you travel across the prairie to Scott’s Spring. The spring’s namesake is also the monument’s: fur trader <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/hiram-scott.htm\">Hiram Scott</a>. Legends tell of his remains being found near this location in the spring of 1828. Scott was believed to have either been abandoned or voluntarily left behind by fellow trappers as he could not walk. The spring is fed by a natural “cistern” that collects rain and snowmelt from the bluff and releases it to the surface.<br /> <br /> The second one-third of the trail climbs to the foot tunnel. As you ascend you may see the roller coaster riders of the air, the cliff swallows and white-throated swifts. The swallows construct mud nests, grouped together in colonies, and plastered to the vertical cliffs. Looking like a cigar with wings, the Speedier Swifts are one of but a few species of birds able to survive through the winter by becoming partially dormant. The monument vicinity is one of only a few areas in Nebraska where they are known to breed.</p>   <p>Few birds can afford to expend the amount of energy required to hover in one place; however, the American kestrel is an exception. It uses the technique in hunting small rodents and insects. A small jay-sized hawk, it can be identified by the pointed wings and rufous (reddish) back or tail. Other birds in the area include prairie falcons, golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, and turkey vultures.<br /> <br /> The last one-third of the trail is the geological lesson from the foot tunnel to the summit. The bluff is the result of eroding sediment layers. It is only preserved by the hard, concrete-like caprock sections which still protect the softer sandstone, siltstone, and volcanic ash below. The white layer of volcanic ash visible on the top of the tunnel is believed to have been blown here from volcanoes in what is now known as the Great Basin in Nevada and Utah. The pipy concretions formed by lime deposits in ground water seen along the trail act as reinforced rods. Along with the caprock sections, these rods help anchor and slow the erosion of softer sediments.</p>   <p>Above the tunnel, where there are numerous signs alerting you to stay on the trail, you can see the trail's namesake formation – Saddle Rock. The last two-thirds of the trail passes through a very active rock fall area. Because rocks break off regularly and either slide or fall down the steep side of the bluff, staying on the trail is imperative.</p> <p>This area is occasionally closed following rock falls until the debris can be safely cleared. Check at the visitor center for current trail conditions.</p>",

At first, emigrants had to take a detour south and use Robidoux Pass, a natural gateway, to get through the bluffs. This mostly stopped in 1850 when a new route was opened at Mitchell Pass. Located close to the North Platte River, this route saved emigrants nearly 15 miles of travel. The route, though, was narrow, due to the land's geography. As such, more than 300,000 emigrants, and their wagons and livestock, had to travel on the same strip of land. Eventually, deep ruts formed as a result of this traffic. These ruts are still visible today and are now a part of Scotts Bluff National Monument. A section of them has been developed into a walking trail with interpretive waysides.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>In 1845, General Philip St. George Cooke marveled at the strange formation that rose before him.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Looming afar over river and plain was 'Scott's Bluff,' a Nebraska Gibralter; surmounted by a colossal fortress and a royal castle, it jutted on the water. . . .

First, note how the contact between the Whitney and the Gering is very irregular instead of flat like we saw at the previous stop. Some geologists believe this is evidence that there is no gap in the geologic record here at Scotts Bluff National Monument. Other geologists, however, believe that this contact represents a hiatus of up to four million years at the Monument.<br /> <br /> Speaking of millions of years, we tend to think of geology as a very slow process, taking place over the course of millions, if not hundreds of millions of years. Sometimes changes to the landscape happen quickly though. Just below Saddle Rock are the remains of a large rockfall that happened in 1974. Much of the erosion at Scotts Bluff takes place through such rock falls. Another rock fall took place in this same general area in the year 2000. Geologic processes continue to shape Scotts Bluff, sometimes in ways that are very obvious. <br /> <br /> To get to the last stop on the Saddle Rock Geology Walking Tour, head down the trail, out of the ravine to an area where the vegetation looks a bit different. In the summer you will notice greener, more verdant vegetation. In the winter you might see a trickle of water off to the right side of the trail. ",

Scotts Spring is the only natural spring located in Scotts Bluff National Monument and issues from cracks within Whitney Member siltstones. Scotts Spring is typical for a spring that discharges from siltstone in that it discharges little water and is located in an area of structural weakness. Despite the fact that little water is discharged here, the spring is an important source of drinking water for the animals that call Scotts Bluff home and the vegetation found here includes species of plants that are typically found in wetter environments, like willows. <br /> <br /> We hope that you enjoyed your walk through geolgic history here at Scotts Bluff National Monument. In a way, you have walked back in time. Starting at the Monroe Creek-Harrison Formations that were depositied up to around 25 million years ago, you then walked down into the older Gering Formation which is up to 28 million years old. Finally you made your way down into the Whitney Member, which is roughly 30 million years old. While these ages make geology feel like something that shaped the monument in the past, remember that these geologic changes are still happening today. For that reason, we hope you will return to the Monument in the future to see how geologic processes have changed this special place. ",

The Orella badlands are visible from this point. A large number of vertebrate fossils were collected from this area prior to 1919 when the area was incorporated into Scotts Bluff National Monument. Today, fossil collecting is prohibited.<br /> <br /> It stands to reason that the oldest layers of sediment would be the ones at the bottom of Scotts Bluff. Those oldest exposed sediments can be seen here from the North Overlook. The Orella Member is the lowermost member of the Brule Formation. The overlook is about 800 feet (244 meters) above the North Platte River and provides a panoramic view of the fertile cropland in the North Platte Valley, which is about six miles (9.7 kilometers) wide at this location. Upstream from this point, the North Platte River drains an area of 24,330 square miles (63,000 square kilometers) starting in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Because reserviors were built to retain spring snowmelt for summer irrigation, the flow of the river is much less variable than it was in past and the channel is considerably narrower than it previosly was. Most of the water used for irrigation in the Platte River Valley is obtained from canals that divert water from the North Platte River in Wyoming and Nebraska. One of three canals that pass through the monument, the Mitchell-Gering Canal, can be seen traversing the badlands from this overlook. <br /> <br /> To get to the next stop on the tour, backtrack on the North Overlook Trail, following the east sides of the loops to the start of the Saddle Rock Trail. As you head to the next stop on the tour, think about why the badlands below have eroded away so much, but Scotts Bluff still stands 800 feet above the river.",

This caprock helps protect the underlying softer rocks, sandstones and siltstones, from erosion. The morphology of these calcite-cemented \"pipy\" concretions typical of the Arikaree Group is well displayed here. The concretions maintain a consistent northeast-southwest orientation over much of the southern Nebraska panhandle and formed when calcium carbonate (limestone), precipitated from groundwater, cemented together sand grains (Pabian and Swinehart 1979; Swinehart and Loope 1987). Clasts of these concretions occur in a number of intraformational gully fills in western Nebraska and indicate that the concretions formed shortly after deposition of the host sand. Note the small diameter verticle tubules preserved in many of the concretions. <br /> <br /> To get to the next stop on the tour, hike down the trail to just beyond the second switchback.

In other locations, like here, it is found alone within layers of other rock. <br /> <br /> To continue the tour, head down the trail to the next stop, at the set of concrete stairs.

The very fine to fine-grained sandstone along this cliff face is cross-stratified or cross-bedded, meaning some of the layering of sediments is at an angle to the main bedding plane.<br /> <br /> Cross-bedding suggests that the sandstone here was deposited in an environment where a flowing medium was involved, usually water or wind. Geologists interpret the structures here as products of wind-ripple migration on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/geology/aeolian-landforms.htm\">aeolian</a> dunes. <br /> <br /> To continue with the tour, continue down the trail about 75 feet from the concrete stairs.

Below that point the sandstone is \"massive\", meaning it lacks evidence of layering. The minerology (chemistry, crystal structure and physical properties) and grain size of the two units is similar. Geologists believe that the lack of depositional sedimentary structures here is due to either a much slower sedimentation rate and intense bioturbation (disturbance of sediments by animals), or the trapping of sediment by vegetation so that laminations were never present. <br /> <br /> To get to the next stop on the tour, head down the trail to the area between the second and third of the northeast facing switchbacks on the trail.

This trail also connects to the 1.6 mile Saddle Rock Trail which leads to the Visitor Center.</p> <p>The North Platte River valley is six miles wide at this location. Before reservoirs were built, the flow of the river was much more variable and its channel was much wider than it is now. The stark, barren and deep ravines of the badlands below were too difficult for wagons to traverse and forced wagon trains through Mitchell Pass instead. The badlands were formed from rapid erosion of a sedimentary layer known as the Brule formation. The Brule layer is quite soft and erodes easily, but, retains enough lime so that once the water leaves the surrounding sediment, it compacts and hardens leaving the moonscape.<br /> <br /> Two man-made intrusions visible from the North Overlook within the monument boundary pre-date the establishment of the national monument in 1919. The irrigation canals were dug in the 1880's to early 1900's, to provide the life for farming in the valley. In 1911, the Union Pacific Railroad crossed the badlands and transports coal from the Thunder Basin of north central Wyoming through the national monument.</p> <p>To many of the pioneers crossing the flat and treeless prairie, the sight of Scotts Bluff topped with evergreens provided welcome relief from the monotonous landscape of the plains. The trees seen on the summit and in the canyons are the same type seen in pioneering days: Ponderosa Pines and Rocky Mountain Junipers.<br /> <br /> Along the trail, the highest point on the bluff is marked at 4,659 feet (1,420 meters) above sea level. This marker, now exposed, sticks up above the surface of the surrounding rock, showing the amount of erosion that has occurred since the marker was placed in 1933.</p> <br />  ",

By the time the wagons reached the bluff, they had traveled one third of the 2,170 mile trip to Oregon. The bluff symbolized a new phase of the journey, leaving the plains and getting into the mountains. Today, from the South Overlook you can see the route the pioneers took through Mitchell Pass. You can also clearly see four of the five rock formations of Scotts Bluff. Crown Rock, Dome Rock, Eagle Rock, and Saddle Rock can all be seen from the South Overlook. The remaining rock formation is Sentinel Rock, which is blocked from view at the overlook by Eagle Rock.<br /> <br /> In 1844, James Clyman wrote \"<em>These hills are finely stored with game such as Black tailed deer, antelope, mountain sheep and sometimes Buffaloe, Elk and Grisled Bear.\" </em>Other than the mule and white-tailed deer (and the re-introduced bighorn sheep in a state reserve ten miles south of the national monument), these animals are no longer present. The mammals which can be found in the monument include mule and white tail deer, badgers, coyotes, skunks, red fox, raccoons, porcupines, cottontail and jack rabbits, and prairie dogs.</p> <p>Rabbits and mule deer are often seen on the summit.

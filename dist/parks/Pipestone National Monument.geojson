One of the survivors, Abigail Gardner, revisited the site in 1892 and pointed out the campsite, which was on the grassy flat area in front of you. Typically, people did not camp on this prairie because it is considered a neutral, sacred ground. They generally camped on higher ground and entered the actual quarry area for the  purpose of obtaining pipestone. ",

They learned from various tribes that warriors, to prove their bravery, jumped from the cliff onto the top of Leaping Rock roughly 12 feet away and jammed an arrow into one of the cracks. It was also said that occasionally, a woman might refuse the attention of a warrior until he had shown his bravery by jumping onto Leaping Rock. <br /> <br /> One Mandan warrior told the painter George Catlin, “I am a young man, but my heart is strong. I have jumped on the medicine-rock - I have placed my arrow on it and no Mandan can take it away. The red stone is slippery, but my foot was true - it did not slip.”      <br /> <br /> It was a dangerous ritual. Catlin wrote about seeing a Dakota father mourn the death of his son, who had slipped while making the attempt. On July 4th of Joseph Nicollet’s famous 1838 expedition, 25-year-old John C. Fremont (who later became a famous explorer and Civil War general) jumped onto Leaping Rock and placed an American flag on it. <br /> <br /> You may notice inscriptions on the surrounding rocks from early settlers.

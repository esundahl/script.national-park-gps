Discover the Potomac River up close here at Great Falls Park with sweeping views of the river and its largest falls. Dynamic river forces have exposed ancient metamorphic bedrock and created unique and rare plant communities. Archeology suggests that indigenous people used the area as fishing and seasonal hunting grounds. Early Americans saw the falls as an obstacle to trade and settlement. In 1785 they built the Potowmack Canal to make the river navigable for trade and settlement in lands to the West. Here, and along the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail, you can explore the wonders of the Potomac- the Nation's River.  <h3><br /> Have a Safe Experience</h3> Welcome to Great Falls Park. We hope that you enjoy your time exploring the Potomac River Gorge, but please remember to keep your own safety in mind. If you aren't adapted with long sturdy legs and wide spreading toes like we Herons, it will be easy for you to slip off the rocks at the river's edge of get carried away by the swift currents or whirlpools. Enjoy your visit and please come again!<br /> <br /> \"If someone is pulled in, they can expect to go under. If you can imagine going through a washing machine, that's what it will feel like. Your pants will probably be sucked off, your shoes will pop off. It will probably try to suck your shirt off, and the river will probably try to pull you right to the bottom.\"<br /> <br /> The Potomac River can be deadly due to very long currents, unpredictable hydraulics and undertows. Swimming and wading is strictly prohibited, and rock hopping is strongly discouraged near the river's edge. <br /> <br /> Since 2001, there have been 24 fatal drowning incidents, and 112 near miss situations in this area of the Potomac River. ",

Migratory fish depend on its constant flow to survive. The American Shad symbolizes the struggle that many aquatic organisms face when trying to find a healthy and dependable habitat to breed. <br /> <br /> Once plentiful here, and an important food resource for centuries, the American Shad's population nearly collapsed by the mid 1900s. Pollution, overdosing, and human alterations to the river's flow have seriously impacted aquatic organisms in this region. <br /> <br /> Some fish, like the American Shad and the American Eel, cover vast distances during their annual migration between Great Falls and the Atlantic Ocean. Many other fish species and aquatic life depend on the Bay's water and freshwater tributaries year round. <br /> <br /> The fish passage constructed at Little Falls Dam within the Potomac Gorge enables fish to move upriver. Removing obstructions and constructing fish passages are important ways to help migratory fish like shad, eels, herring, and perch reach spawning habitat. <br /> <br /> Restocking programs have also been critical to boosting the depleted shad fishery- now very slowly recovering. Seen here, local community members release baby shad they raised into the Potomac River.<br />  ",

Like a giant funnel it gathers water from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia as it travels 383 miles to the Chesapeake Bay.<br /> <br /> When it reaches Great Falls, the river narrows and drops 76 feet into a canyon called Mather Gorge. Changing weather conditions in the river's watershed affect the character of the river at Great Falls. <br /> <br /> During dry periods the river shrinks to a trickle on the face of a rock wall. At average flow, the river cascades over the rocks into a 25-foot deep pool. Within 72 hours after a snow melt or heavy rains upstream, the Potomac swells. Sometimes the flow is so great that all the water cannot force its way through the narrow entrance of Mather Gorge. When this happens, the river backs up, covers the falls and floods the riverbank. ",

Although it is among the earliest and best surviving examples of an early American canal system, its national importance relates not to its engineering or commercial success, but instead to its direct connections to important public questions of the day and to the formative events that led to the development of the United States Constitution. Among those questions were the debate over federal authority to regulate interstate commerce, the need for internal improvements to link the country, and the role government would play in accomplishing such projects.  <br /> <br /> Visionary American leaders including George Washington and James Madison played pivotal roles in both the Potowmack Canal Company and the formation of the nation. Meetings initiated as part of the formation of the Potowmack Canal reinforced the need to clarify and strengthen the role of the central government in trade and commerce. Trade conferences that took place at the beginning of the Potowmack Canal venture directly influenced James Madison and others to create the 1787 Constitutional Convention. </span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"background:white\">Prior to the American Revolution, George Washington wished to develop transportation routes from the eastern seaboard to the vast western territories. After years of petitioning, his dreams were finally realized in the 1780s. Along with James Madison, Washington proposed a canal as one element of an overall strategy to unite the new country. By January 1785, both Maryland and Virginia had passed the legislation needed to build a canal.</span></span><br />  </p> <p style=\"margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"background:white\">In March 1785, representatives from Maryland and Virginia successfully negotiated a broad agreement for the joint use of the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay at George Washington's Mount Vernon. The report of the meeting also called for an annual conference on commercial matters between Maryland, Virginia and other states.The first of these meetings occurred the following year at the Annapolis Convention, where several states called for a constitutional convention to draft a cohesive federal constitution. The Potomac improvements, which would be organized by the new Patowmack Company, thus helped crystallize sentiments for national unity. </span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"background:white\">In May 1785, Washington was elected the first president of the Patowmack Company. Its goal was to reduce navigation hazards in the river and its tributaries, for example, by clearing out sandbars and rubble and by blasting channels in shallow places. Workers constructed five “skirting” canals at places where obstacles were too large to be removed and the river was not navigable. The canal at Great Falls is the best preserved example of these by-passing waterways.<br /> <br /> The work was difficult and dangerous. The company hired free people, but also utilized indentured servants and enslaved people living in the vicinity. Washington often traveled to the construction sites to observe and direct the process. In 1789, he resigned from the company to become the first president of the United States.</span></span><br />  </p> <p style=\"margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"background:white\">Floods and accidents plagued the construction of locks at Great Falls and delayed the opening of the canal by years. Even after the canal was fully operational in 1802, fluctuations in weather and water level drastically affected operations. The erratic and limited operating schedule discouraged traffic, which limited income from tolls, the only source of revenue.</span></span><br />  </p> <p style=\"margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"background:white\">Near the canal construction, Revolutionary War hero, “Light Horse” Harry Lee, the father of Robert E. Lee, founded Matildaville (named after his wife). Here the Patowmack Company stationed its headquarters and created housing for workers. In the little town, one could find a market, gristmill, sawmill, foundry, inn, and ice house. Boardinghouses and other small homes also emerged to meet the increasing demands of canal patrons.</span></span><br />  </p> <p style=\"margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"background:white\">Thousands of boats headed to Georgetown used the skirting canals to successfully transport goods such as flour, whiskey, tobacco, and iron. Vessels heading upstream, which was much more difficult, brought manufactured goods such as cloth, firearms and hardware towards Cumberland. The downstream trip took three to five days. The upstream journey, which required laborers to pole against the current, lasted ten to twelve days.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"background:white\">During the 1820s, Virginia and Maryland politicians advocated for the construction of another canal to connect the Chesapeake Bay and the Ohio River. In 1825, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (also known as the C&O Canal) was chartered. Shortly thereafter, in 1828, the Patowmack Company closed. The new canal company continued to operate the Patowmack Canal until 1830. In that year, the company dismantled the working parts of the locks, thereby rendering it nonfunctional. Since that time, nature has taken its course with the derelict canal, although major elements of it survive as ruins. Matildaville likewise declined, although some of its structures continued to be used on a sporadic basis. The traces of the town can still be seen on the landscape today.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"background:white\">As the predecessor to the C&O Canal, the Patowmack Canal helped usher the new country into an era of bustling transportation and economic expansion. The canal was intimately linked with important public issues of its day: Federal authority over matters pertaining to interstate commerce, the need for the creation of internal improvements to link distant parts of the new nation, and the role of government in accomplishing such projects.<br /> <br /> <br /> For more information visit </span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grfa/learn/historyculture/canal.htm\">The Potowmack Canal</a><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"background:white\"> </span></span><br /> <br /> <br />  </p> <p><a href=\"http://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=bb5013ee-e288-4334-9c66-08fb860faf3a\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">National Historic Landmark Nomination</span></a><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> of the Potowmack Canal Historic District.</span><br />  </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</span></a><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

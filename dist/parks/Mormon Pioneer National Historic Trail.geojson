        "notes": "\"Two Sides of the River\" Wayside\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/two-sides-of-the-river-wayside.htm\n\n<strong>Description of Wayside:</strong> Low-profile wayside that is 42 x 24 inches. It has a brown rectangular base with two short rectangular pillars anchored into a stone wall supporting the wayside panel. The panel is framed in brown metal. The wayside is located at the far northern end of the North Overlook Trail overlooking the North Platte River.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Layout</strong>: At the top of the wayside is a thin black banner with white text. Aligned to the left is \"Scotts Bluff National Monument\". Aligned to the right is the text \"National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior,\" and finally the National Park Service arrowhead. The title of the wayside is below the black banner in large black font. The panel has a light blue background. Black text is arranged in three columns on the upper half of the wayside. Below the text are three images. <br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Title</strong>: Two Sides of the River<br /> <br /> <strong>Text:</strong> The Platte River served as a buffer between people.<br /> <br /> Emigrants followed the Platte River for up to 650 miles (1,046 km) depending on where they first joined it. Many traveled on the south side while others stayed on the north side. What determined their decision? Usually it was a matter of where they started along the Missouri River. If they began their journey south of Council Bluffs, they stayed on the south side of the river. For those who embarked from Council Bluffs, as did most Mormons, the north side was their route. Traveling on the north side of the river also reduced the amount of harassment from non-Mormon “Gentiles.”<br /> <br /> Council Bluffs Road, the early name for the trail, served most of the Mormon emigrants as the path to Zion. To escape persecution in the States, Brigham Young, the leader of the church, decided that the valley of the Salt Lake in Utah Territory was far enough from other settlements to be safe. Handcart companies were formed to accommodate European converts with little money to cross the continent. For each group of approximately 20 handcarts, one covered wagon carried extra supplies and tents. The wagons also served as traveling commissaries, transporting food for the emigrants’ meals. Of the 70,000 Mormons who crossed the country to Utah, ten handcart companies brought almost 3,000 emigrants to Utah from 1856 through 1860.<br /> <br /> Each side of the river had its challenges. Since the forts were built on the more-heavily traveled south side of the Platte River, people on the north side had to make dangerous river crossings to visit the forts. Larger numbers on the south side meant poorer sanitation, more disease, and more competition for grazing and campfire fuel.<br /> <br /> What determines your route when you travel?<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A watercolor painting of a large group of emigrants crossing a river. Some of the emigrants push handcarts, while others walk beside covered wagons being pulled by oxen.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> This watercolor shows the mix of handcarts and covered wagons that made up a typical handcart company.

A Nebraska State Historical Society interpretive marker provides more information about these raids. There is also a granite marker a half mile to the mile north across the Little Blue River. From the state marker, look east toward the hillside to see a series of parallel wagon ruts heading toward your location. These wagon ruts, which are on private property, are remnants of the Oregon Trail. <br /> <br /> The sign reads, \"1864 Indian Raids. During the Civil War, many regular troops were withdrawn from Plains military posts to fight in the east. The Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho, seizing this opportunity, attempted to drive white settlers from their land.<br /> <br /> Beginning on August 7, 1864, the Indians made concerted attacks on stage stations and ranches along the Oregon Trail, hitting nearly every settlement for 400 miles from Julesburg to Big Sandy. Travel ceased for two months.<br /> <br /> The most severe attacks were along the upper Little Blue River where about 100 people were killed. Several died at Oak Grove, but others escaped and Pawnee Ranch was successfully defended. At 'the Narrows' the Eubanks families were attacked and seven killed. Mrs. Eubanks, two children and Miss Laura Roper were taken prisoner and held captive for months. Teamsters were killed, wagon trains burned and ranches were smashed or burned. Settlers fled east to Beatrice and Marysville or northwest to Fort Kearny on the Platte for protection. Troops and local militia companies attacked and drove back the Indians in the battle of the Little Blue on August 17, 1864. Major raids ceased but skirmishes continued through the fall.\"</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(State Highway 14 near Nelson, Nebraska)</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/1864_indian_raids.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The hollow bristled with brush and its boulder-choked bottom was too narrow for wagons to pass. The Donner-Reed wagon party grubbed a dangerous sideling trail along the sloping bank before dropping, exhausted, into their first camp beyond the Weber River. Mormon pioneers improved the rough track, but despite their efforts, many wagons over the years tumbled sideways off the trail. Dixie Hollow narrows and becomes impassable to wagons.<br /> <br /> Broad Hollow, which drains into Dixie Hollow near the Donner-Reed campsite of August 11, provided a detour around the Dixie Hollow chokepoint. The pioneers veered northwest up Broad Hollow, turned west across a wide bench, and then dropped south again to East Canyon Creek and through today’s East Canyon State Park.<br /> <br /> A monument marks the location where pioneers turned west. Some researchers think the two-track to the right of the monument may be the original trail alignment, but it might be a more recent ranch road. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Southwest of Henefer, Utah)</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The Lander Cutoff, a government wagon road explored and developed in 1857-1860 by topographical engineer Frederick W. Lander, diverged from the primary route of the California Trail at present-day Burnt Ranch, following older paths used by American Indians and trappers of the fur trade. Western historian Will Bagley estimates that more than 100,000 overland emigrants crossed this region by way of the Lander Cutoff. The graves of two known overland emigrants (Joseph Barnett, d. 1844, and Charles H. Miller, d. 1859) and as many as six unidentified burials of the trails era are located on the ranch. Many more emigrant graves are believed to exist at and around the site.<br /> <br /> During the 1800s, this location was the site of extensive Shoshone Indian villages; trading post, stagecoach, mail, and telegraph operations; a military outpost; emigrant and military encampments; and armed conflicts between the US Army and the Sioux and Cheyenne. In fact, Burnt Ranch takes its name from the burning of a stage station at Ninth Crossing during the Utah War in 1857, and by Sioux warriors in 1866 and 1868. It has been the headquarters of cattle ranching operations since the 1880s and remains so today.<br /> <br /> Trail remnants and historical remains of the developments and activities at Burnt Ranch have been determined to be nationally significant and eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Located approximately 8 miles SE South Pass City, Wyoming)<br /> <strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> No cell service.  Poor roads.  Prior Planning with an organized group is a must.<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Near North Platte, Nebraska, the Platte River splits into two major forks, with the South Platte running towards Denver and the North Platte heading northwest towards Fort Laramie. Emigrants knew that at some point they had to cross the South Platte and start following the North Platte. Several crossing sites were used, but the Upper Crossing was the most important because it led to the best approach to the North Platte. However, this meant traveling over California Hill, which necessitated a steep climb of 240 feet in 1<sup>½ </sup>miles. Deep ruts, which are still plainly visible today, were created as the wagons were dragged up the hill.

Over time, wind and water erosion slowly sculpted the rocks into their current courthouse or castle appearance. The rocks were first noted by Robert Stuart in 1812 and quickly became guiding landmarks for fur traders and emigrants. Travelers on the south side of the Platte river had a close-up view of these celebrated landmarks, which made them a popular item for emigrants to write about and sketch in their diaries.<br /> <br /> Today, the rocks are open to the public. Reaching them requires traveling on an unpaved road that is suitable for most vehicles when dry. At the end of the road is a hiking trail that leads to Courthouse Rock. Note, this trail used to lead to the top of the rock, but large sections of the trail have since eroded away. Use extreme caution when hiking. Open year-round, daylight hours.

Defensive Breastworks (Echo Canyon) positioned along the rim of the cliff to the right are barely visible in several places from the canyon floor. Mormon militiamen, fearing an attack on Salt Lake City by the U.S. Army, built the low rubble walls above the emigrant road in 1857. The breastworks would protect the defenders as they fired down on approaching federal troops.

Thousands of emigrants on the Oregon and California trails shared the path with these handcarts.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Martin's Cove, 47600 West Hwy 220, Alcova, Wyoming)</p> <p>You can experience handcart travel by using one of the visitor center's handcarts (no charge) to travel the site's trails. In addition, the visitor center contains several exhibits that tell the Mormon story and the emigrant trail story. Overnight camping and free tours are available. Also found at the site is Martin's Cove, the place where 500 Mormons took shelter from a deadly blizzard in 1856. The cove is reached by following a three to four mile round-trip hiking trail.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/subsection/historic-sites/wyoming/martins-cove?lang=eng\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

        "notes": "Donner Hill\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/donner-hill.htm\n\n<p>Donner HIll hammered yet another nail into the Donner-Reed coffin. For 12 days the emigrants had gnawed a track through the rugged Wasatch wilderness, and now, at the very edge of the Salt Lake Valley, limestone outcrops and dense willows blocked their exit from the mouth of Emigration Canyon. The discouraged travelers pulled to the left out of the creek bottom and up the 200-foot-high ridge that thereafter would bear their name. The effort nearly used up the strength of their oxen. The next year Brigham Young’s vanguard pioneer party, having more men for the labor, opened a road through the blockage, avoiding the hill climb, in just 4 hours’ time. The current roadbed approximates their route.<br /> <br /> Today, Emigration Canyon is widened and the top of Donner Hill has been leveled to make room for residential development. But the hill is still impressive and Emigration Creek, edged by willow and scrub oak, still runs along the south side of Emigration Canyon Road. Visitors can easily envision how this spot looked in 1846-47.<br /> <br /> The evening of their arrival on July 22, the Donner-Reed Party encamped a short distance beyond the hilltop with the broad Salt Lake Valley stretched at their feet. A grassy park along the ridge, adjacent to Crestview Drive, is named Donner Park in commemoration of that campsite. The next day the emigrants descended the ridge and traveled across the valley to the Jordan River. From there, the Donner Reed Party continued along the south shore of the Great Salt Lake.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Emigration Canyon, near Rotary Glen Park)</p> <p>On the right at odometer mile 20 is another small sign for Donner Hill. A stone monument commemorating Donner Hill is on the left where the road curves to the south. At that location the hill is in front of you, easy to see, with a condominium at the top. Use caution when crossing the oncoming lane to enter or leave the widened road shoulder at the monument. Then continue down Emigration Canyon Road around the S-curve. If traffic permits, turn left at odometer mile 20.6 into an unmarked entrance for Rotary Glen Park. If you miss the entrance, turn left onto the next paved road, Crestview Drive, and turn around at a safe location to return to the intersection. Turn right and make an immediate right turn into Rotary Glen Park. Now go left across the parking lot and follow the dirt access road to the east. End at a gravel parking lot.<br /> <br /> Look across the small reservoir toward Donner Hill, the ridge to the northeast. The emigrants ascended the ridge on the north side of the condominiums. From this vantage, the steepness of the climb is evident. Take the opportunity here or at the picnic area to the west to explore Emigration Creek.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Later, the livestock pens were moved outside of the city. The 1894 City and County Building occupies the site today, and a monument commemorating the Mormon pioneers is located at the northwest corner of the square. (The monument is erroneous in stating that the vanguard Mormon pioneers camped at this location — the 1847 vanguard pioneer company camped on the banks of City Creek, southwest of what is now Exchange Place, the nights of July 23-25, 1847. The area is now occupied by buildings and the creek is channeled through an underground conduit.)<br /> <br /> As the Mormon pioneers approached the Salt Lake Valley, they split into four groups: a party of scouts at the front; a party of roadbuilders; the main camp of pioneers; and then Brigham Young, who was sick with Mountain Fever, with a caretaker, two days later. The scouts, roadbuilders, and main camp merged at the mouth of Emigration Canyon, where they had to break through the limestone ledge that had forced the Donner Party to crawl up out of the canyon. They entered the valley together the following day, July 22, and then moved to City Creek (downtown) on July 23. Brigham Young didn’t reach the valley until July 24.<br /> <br /> Curbside parking is available on the streets bordering Washington Square.<br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Site Information</span></p> <p><b>Location</b> (400 South Street and State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah).</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/mormon-pioneer-trail-salt-lake-city-itinerary.htm\">Mormon Pioneer Trail: Salt Lake City Itinerary</a></h2> <p>This site is on the Salt Lake City Itinerary.

As this ferry could not meet the high demand, Brigham Young tasked a crew of 100 men to build a new boat and improve three river landings. Despite their best efforts, it eventually became too late to continue any further west for the year. Continuing into the mountains beyond was too risky as few European American emigrants had gone this far before, leaving the Mormon Pioneers uncertain as to what lay ahead. This, a section of land stretching for 12 miles east of Council Bluffs, is where the Saints would spend the winter of 1846. Hundreds of wagons and thousands of emigrants formed 33 temporary settlements. Low on food and supplies, exhausted, and with disease running rampant, these temporary settlements became the permanent, final resting place for hundreds of emigrants.<br />  <br /> The Center's website is www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/historic-sites/nebraska/mormon-trail-center-at-historic-winter-quarters?lang=eng</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Iowa School for the Deaf, 3501 Harry Langdon Blvd, Council Bluffs, IA 51503)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities </strong><br /> Today the site of the Grand Encampment is part of the Iowa School for the Deaf's campus.

Once discovered by mountain men in the early 1800s, the 24-mile passage eventually became a thoroughfare for pack trains, commercial and emigrant wagons, Forty-niner brigades, military columns, handcart processions, the Pony Express, the Overland Stage, and the transcontinental telegraph. The Donner-Reed Party was the third emigrant wagon party to pass through the canyon.<br /> <br /> Today Echo Canyon is still a busy transportation corridor, occupied by I-80, the Union Pacific Railroad, a segment of the Old Lincoln Highway (the nation’s first coast-to-coast automobile highway), and modern communications and utility lines. More than 160 years of development have altered the canyon, but fascinating traces of 19th century uses still are visible.<br /> <br /> As you enter I-80, look ahead and to the right toward the bare rampart of Castle Rock, an emigrant landmark near the head of Echo Canyon.

Imagine those emigrants' despair upon reaching this spot and seeing the jagged, blue-gray peaks of the Wasatch Mountains on the horizon ahead. From here, both wagon companies had to grub a rough track over divides and mountains and down a series of willow-packed canyons and creek bottoms in order to reach the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. The effort cost the Donner-Reed party 13 days, one of a series of troubles that caused the group to be trapped by blizzards in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Utah Highway 65, about 5.5 miles southwest of Henefer, Utah)<br /> Hastings Cutoff and Mormon Trail Wagon Ruts at Hogsback Summit (southwest of Henefer), marked by white fiberglass trail posts, are clearly visible along the right side of the road beyond the fence line at the Summit and Morgan County boundary.

After months on the trail, traveling over 1,200 weary miles, it was heart- wrenching to discover that the most difficult part of the journey still lay ahead. Some people must have broken down and wept. Others gritted their teeth with determination and moved southwest down off Hogsback Summit to challenge the mountains and canyons that lay ahead.</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“...arrived [July 19] on the suummit of the dividing ridge and put a guide hard up, \"80 miles to Fort Bridger\"...

        "notes": "Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/mormon-pioneer-national-historic-trail.htm\n\n<p>The story of the Mormon Trail is rooted in the beginnings of a unique American religion. In 1827, 21-year-old Joseph Smith announced that he had unearthed a set of golden plates, inscribed with the tenants of God’s true church. Smith said that he had been directed to the plates by an angel named Moroni, who also had given him divine tools for translating the ancient inscriptions into English. Smith used these to produce new Scripture called the <em>Book of Mormon</em>. In 1830, in western New York, he organized a legal entity that would become The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His followers, who regarded Smith as a prophet, became known as Mormons.</p> <p>Important differences between mainstream Christianity and Mormon doctrine quickly emerged, but it was primarily hostilities over land, business, and politics that caused Smith repeatedly to move church headquarters. Driven out of Missouri in 1838, the Mormons finally settled along a bend of the Mississippi River in Illinois. There they established a community they called Nauvoo, a Hebrew word meaning “beautiful place.” It was at Nauvoo that Smith cautiously began introducing the Old Testament practice of “plural marriage,” or polygamy, among select church leaders.</p> <p>Thousands of converts flocked to Nauvoo, soon making it the largest town in Illinois. Neighbors initially welcomed the orderly, industrious settlers despite their religious differences. But relations gradually soured, with complaints centering on Mormons’ clannish business practices, accusations of theft, their electoral sway, and Smith’s political aspirations. Meanwhile, dissent emerged within the church as rumors leaked of secret plural marriages. After an opposition newspaper publicly accused the prophet and other leaders of polygamy, Nauvoo’s city council and Smith declared the paper a public nuisance and Smith ordered destruction of its press. For that he and others were arrested and jailed at Carthage, Illinois. On June 27, 1844, a mob broke into the jail and murdered Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum. Other vigilantes attacked Mormon farms around Nauvoo in an attempt to expel them.</p> <p>Brigham Young stepped up as Smith’s successor and began planning an orderly, spring 1846 evacuation of some 15,000 faithful to the Great Basin, Mexican-held territory beyond the Rocky Mountains. However, as anti-Mormon violence heated, Young decided to organize a vanguard of church leaders to depart in late winter, hoping that would pacify the vigilantes until the main body of Mormons could start west in April. On February 4, 1846, the first wagons ferried across the Mississippi to Iowa. This group halted after five miles and set up camp at Sugar Creek for a lengthy wait as Young and his associates concluded business at Nauvoo. Meanwhile others, anxious not to be left behind, drifted over to join the Sugar Creek camp. Young’s vanguard company unexpectedly swelled from his intended 1,800 emigrants to around 3,000—many without their own wagons and provisions.</p> <p>On March 1, 1846, some 500 Mormon wagons lurched northwesterly across the winter-bare Iowa prairie toward the Missouri River. Their route is the Mormon Trail.</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

        "notes": "Mount Pisgah Historic Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/mount-pisgah-historic-site.htm\n\n<p>Mt. Pisgah was a semi-permanent settlement or waystation on the Mormon Pioneer Trail located in southcentral Iowa between Nauvoo, Illinois, and the Missouri River. Parley Pratt was sent ahead on the trail to locate waystations for the saints who didn’t have enough food or were sick. The largest of these was Mt. Pisgah, near the banks of a branch of the Grand River<br /> <br /> The Mormon pioneer Vanguard Company arrived here in mid-May 1846, on the edge of the United States’ settled land. With a nearby spring for drinking water, Mount Pisgah was an ideal location for a second camp and resting place. A group of men were sent ahead of the companies to plow a great field, plant seeds, and build shelters for those that would be left at this location. In the first four days these men had planted nearly 1000 acres of crops. They planted corn, buckwheat, beans, potatoes, peas, cucumbers, pumpkins, and squash in a great field protected by a split rail fence. Over 2000 Mormon travelers lived temporarily in dugouts and cabins at the Mt. Pisgah waystation. Some stayed for a matter of months while others called Pisgah home for several years. <br /> <br /> The waystation was available for Mormon Travelers between 1846-1852. Many of the new settlers never were able to leave this site for their new home in the west and are buried in unmarked graves at the site. The site is marked today by a monument which was placed there in Fall of 1888 and was to memorialize the more than three hundred saints who lost their lives at Mt. Pisgah.<br /> <br /> The site is now a mix of privately and publicly owned lands. The county park area has wayside exhibits, historical markers, a monument, and a pioneer cemetery. Much of the village site itself is located on adjacent private pasture lands, which the owner opens to interested visitors and tour groups. Traces of wagon roads and outlines building footings are visible in places.<br /> <br /> Visiting Mt. Pisgah today permits you to feel and visualize all that Parley Pratt when he trotted his horse down this slope for the first time on May 1846. These were his words in 1846,</p> <blockquote> <p>“Riding about three or four miles through beautiful prairies, I came suddenly to some round and sloping hills, grassy and crowned with beautiful groves of timber, while alternate open groves and forests seemed blended in all the beauty and harmony of an English park, while beneath and beyond, on the west, rolled a main branch of Grand River”. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(1741 Mt Pisgah Rd, Thayer, IA 50254)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities </strong><br />  Currently, Mt. Pisgah contains three sections:<br /> 1. <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/historic-sites/iowa/mount-pisgah-monument?lang=eng\">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints monument and cemetery</a>: open to the public.<br /> 2. <a href=\"https://www.mycountyparks.com/county/union/Park/Mt-Pisgah.aspx\">Mt.

Heavy rains made the roads impassable. For about two weeks in early April, a group of about 300 wagons camped nearby at Locust Creek. Everything they owned was damp and supplies were running low. Warming weather increased their risk of rattlesnake bites and fire.<br /> <br /> At Locust Creek, poet and camp clerk William Clayton received good news. He learned that his wife had given birth to a healthy baby boy back in Nauvoo, Illinois. In honor of his son’s arrival, Clayton wrote the lyrics to the Latter-day Saints’ beloved anthem “Come, Come, Ye Saints” (originally titled “All is Well”).

The approximately 500 wagons camped in this area due to sickness and the terrible weather conditions. <br /> <br /> Leaving Nauvoo in late February of 1846, approximately 500 wagons and 3000 people led by Brigham Young crossed the Mississippi River into Iowa and traveled into Van Buren County. Due to thawing conditions and rain, the roads became difficult to traverse and the main Mormon group stopped to make camp at a spot known as Richardson’s Point. Located near the Van Buren/Davis County line, the Saints stopped and stayed in this region from March 7th<sup>t</sup>to March 19th. The Saints broke camp on the 19th<sup>h</sup>and continued their journey westward. <br /> <br /> Richardson’s Point was used as a stopping spot for many as others fled Nauvoo. One would have thought the two graves would have been forgotten due to the location of the grave placements deep within the timber, but they weren’t. The local community seemed to have never forgotten them. As early as 1910-1915, it has been recorded that local school children would go to the graves with their teacher and pick Mayflowers to put on them. One of these children, Harold Brown, lived approximately a mile from the graves and made this his home until his death in the 1980s. Harold could always find the graves to show interested people. In 1963, Hazen Bonar and his brother tried unsuccessfully to find the graves for a pair of Mormon missionaries. The missionaries returned in 1965 and, again with the Bonar brothers, the graves were discovered. The Bonar’s grandparents had homesteaded nearby properties in the 1840s and undoubtedly witnessed the large Mormon camps firsthand. In 1981, Wallace and Jane Maugar, with help from Wallace’s cousin Ila Garrett and her husband Bud, began searching for the graves themselves. Wallace was actually Edwin Little’s great-great-great grandson. The Maugars did not physically find the graves until 1983 and returned in 1985 with two funeral home markers and two headstones for the graves. The Maugars and Garretts should be given credit for their diligence. They carried bags of concrete, rock, water and tools into the woods by hand to accomplish their deed. Before, the only original visible markers were a granite headstone and limestone footstone on the Tanner grave. <br /> <br /> Clarence Klodt purchased the 240-acre farm that the graves were located on in 1970 from the Bonar family, an unbelievable acquisition even by today’s standards as some of the land was virgin prairie and a plow had never touched it. There was never a clear path to the graves. The only marker to the graves was a piece of tin stuck in an oak tree about 500 feet from the graves. As time went on, interest slowly picked up about the graves. <strong>Read more...</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/richardson-s-point-additional-history-mormon-pioneer-trail.htm\">Additional History & Information</a></h2> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(11251 County Road J40, Milton, IA, Van Buren County)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.traveliowa.com/destination/richardson-s-point---mormon-trail/13476/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

This is the right place.” Inside the 450-acre park is the National Pony Express Monument with a replica Pony Express station, a dramatic Avard Fairbanks sculpture of a relay rider changing horses, and several interpretive wayside exhibits. Statuary Walk east of the Pony Express monument includes other sculptures and the 60-foot high This Is the Place Monument, with bronze figures of Brigham Young and other early church leaders.<br /> <br /> Around the monument base are <em>bas relief </em>depictions of significant figures in Utah history. Beyond the nearby visitor center is Heritage Village, a reconstructed village of original pioneer-era buildings where costumed docents and historical interpreters share history and demonstrate early crafts and trades. Young visitors can ride ponies and trains, make crafts, and pet farm animals here.<br /> <br /> This Is the Place Heritage Park, near the location where Brigham Young first surveyed the valley in July 1847, represents the Mormon arrival. But as the City of the Saints grew from a rustic frontier village to a bustling territorial capital, many California-bound travelers paused here for a layover to rest, re-supply, or spend the winter — or, as in the case of English adventurer Sir Richard Burton, to satisfy their curiosity about Brigham Young and the Mormons.

Known as the Loess Hills region, unique deposits of windswept loess soils left behind by the last Ice Age rise 200 feet above the plains along the river. <br /> <br /> The Western Historic Trails Center is the perfect place to spend an afternoon learning about history, enjoying a musical performance, or even just to stretch your legs. The building itself was designed and built by the National Parks Service as a center of exploration in 1997. Here, visitors have the opportunity to retrace the steps of pioneers who came after Lewis and Clark, walking not only the trail blazed by the two intrepid explorers but also the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Mormon Trail.<br /> <br /> Exhibits include sculptures by Timothy Woodman, photos, maps, and quotes pertaining to the trails and America's history of Westward Expansion. Outdoor picnic areas offer a tranquil place to enjoy the sunshine and scenery. Walking and biking paths wind through 400 acres of prairie along the scenic Missouri River, offering a glimpse into what the two explorers and the Corps of Discovery observed more than 200 years ago. <br /> <br /> Admission is free. School and group tours are available, but require advance scheduling by calling the center at (712) 366-4900.

Their fight began in 1846 here at the Old Courthouse when Dred and Harriet began their long legal battle for their rights. Their case began here, but over the course of eleven years it made its way to the Supreme Court where the final verdict helped push the country to civil war. The Scott family didn’t find the freedom they sought through the legal challenge, but their courage and determination in filling this case helped bring about freedom from enslavement for all Americans.",

It was a major engineering feat, the largest bridge built at that time and the very first steel bridge. Completed in 1874, it is the oldest bridge standing on the Mississippi River.

The flood affected many Midwestern states and caused 50 deaths and billions of dollars in damages.

How did it affect your family and friends? Do you think the river will ever reach this high again?  <br /> <br /> This place is not accessible if you are unable to use stairs.

It was also where Virginia Minor's case for a woman's right to vote came to trial in the 1870s. An important building in the history of St. Louis and the history of Civil Rights, the Old Courthouse is currently closed to the public. <br /> <br /> St. Louis' Old Courthouse is listed in the National Park Service's National Underground Railroad <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/index.htm\">Network To Freedom.</a> The Network to Freedom recognizes sites, programs and facilities with verifiable associations to the Underground Railroad. The phenomenon popularly known as the Underground Railroad has been broadly defined by the National Park Service as the \"historic resistance to enslavement through escape and flight.\" The Old Courthouse is linked with the story of the Underground Railroad, and with that of slavery, as a property associated with legal challenges to slavery. It was a public forum as well as a courthouse. Enslaved people were auctioned from its steps in estate settlements, while one man's suit for freedom helped plunge the country into Civil War. The Old Courthouse was the site of over 300 suits for freedom, but one gained notoriety. In 1847, Dred Scott, with his wife Harriet, sued for, and were granted, their freedom. After many appeals, the case was decided upon by the Supreme Court. The decision stated that slaves were property, and as such, had no right to sue. The Dred Scott Decision hastened the start of the Civil War.",

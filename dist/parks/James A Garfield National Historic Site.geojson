Garfield\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/campaign-office-of-james-a-garfield.htm\n\n<div>In October 1876, when James and Lucretia purchased a farm in Mentor, Ohio, the property included a small building at the rear of the main farmhouse. It was used as a dormitory by farmhands. Garfield “resolved to gut the old house…and fit it up for a library.” By the following spring, he had hired a crew of carpenters to build large black walnut bookshelves. He even helped lay the flooring himself which he remarked about in his diary April 25, \"old pleasure which I felt 27 years ago, when I learned how to lay flooring\". As he moved into the building, he realized he had more books than he could store and had to have two more sets of shelving built. Some varnish on the floors and the hanging of a reading lamp completed the building on July 21, 1877, and it functioned as Garfield’s private library for the next few years.<br /> <br /> The election of 1880 transformed it by necessity into a telegraph office, a consulting office, and what we now refer to as the Campaign Office. During the campaign, two telegraph lines were installed and ran directly to the desks. The building became a flurry of activity, with messages pouring in from all corners of the country. Garfield’s secretary Joseph Stanley-Brown and several staffers worked night and day inside, receiving and recording incoming messages. Stanley-Brown recalled that \"the floor was almost always hopelessly littered with papers.\"<br /> <br /> The Campaign Office had five desks, two telegraph sets, a wet press, and a large number of books. The telegraph operator, O.L. Judd, continued receiving messages on both telegraph sets in this building right up until the Garfield Family left for Washington, D.C. and Garfield’s March 4, 1881 inauguration as president. After his assassination in 1881, his wife Lucretia, built a memorial library in the main house. As the construction of the library began, the Campaign Office was moved to its current location behind the house. By 1895, the grandchildren used the building as a playroom. <br /> <br /> The Garfield children: Harry, James, Mollie, Abram, and Irvin donated the family home and outbuildings to the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1936. <br /> <br /> Joseph Stanley-Brown was asked for his recollection of what the Campaign Office was like when the WRHS was starting the restoration process. His response folllows:</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><br /> \"It was used by the former owner as a dormitory but when sold, the partitions were taken out and the single large room which resulted was devoted to office purposes. It remains partically unchanged from what it was as I first saw it, about the middle of June in 1880. Around the walls were bookcases extending almost to the ceilings, the base being widened out and enclosed by panelled doors. These small closets formed convenient places for the storage of stationary and other articles requiring protection. The book shelves were largely filled with government reports and other official publications that would not have graced the general household library, lodged (in) the enlarged residence.<br /> <br /> The office was most meagerly furnished. A small upright globe-shaped stove, which burned hard coal, furnished heat as the autumn came on. There was a small flat topped table with one drawer. This was supplemented later by a carpenter-made cross-legged tabke about three feet by four feet... There were three or four chairs of style of that day, as indictated by the drawings. A small table carried a letter press and all communications sent out, if important, were duplicated by means of wet tissue paper sheets bound in book form.\" </div> <div><br /> Today, visitors can view the inside of the Campaign Office front door. There is a glass barrier between the artifacts and outdoor elements. The layout of the building is as when James A. Garfield used it during his campaign. </div> <div><br />  </div> <div><br />  </div>",

Garfield's death in 1881, Mrs. Garfield began to transform the farm into more of a country estate. The construction of the Carriage House and Horse Barn in 1893 was one of many changes made. </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><br /> \"On April 24, 1893, Lucretia signed 'Article of Agreement' with J.A. Reaugh and Son of Cleveland for 'all the carpenter work and glazing' for a 'frame barn,' a project to be finished by mid-June....\" </div> <div><br /> The building was shaped like the letter, L which reflected Mrs. Garfield’s sense of style even in such practical buildings. Mrs. Garfield designed the building with two purposes in mind: 1. to house the carriages and 2. to provide stalls for the horses. The carriage horses were different from their farm horses in that they were more majestic looking.This was a 2-story structure with the top floor used for storing hay, which was dropped down through a shoot, and an apartment for workers.  <br /> <br /> The building fell into disrepair and was overgrown with shrubs and bushes. In fact, if you visited the home before the restoration in the lated 1990s you would not have necessarily relaized that it was here at all. <br /> <br /> The National Park Service did a multi-million dollar restoration to the property and besides the main home, campaign office, this building was repaired and converted into the site's Visitor Center. The horse stalls were converted to exhibit spaces, but a feed box and stall doors are still visible. The brick floor inside the Carriage House is original and the site movie is shown there today. One of the stories told is about one of Garfield’s horses, named Mollie. One day Mollie was in her stall and she kicked the stall so hard that the indentation of her hoof can still be seen today.  </div>",

You ought to have seen the chicken-house. Once it was brown and the other paint was light and they painted it blue(?) on the corners. The doors and windows are in on the new chicken-house, but they aren't in the old chicken-house.\"</div> <div><br /> Construction of the new coop was complete by November of 1893 and it was outfitted with 40-pound galvanized metal chicken troughs. The building and area around was surrounded by a six-foot net and there was an incubator, possibly from the original coop, installed as well.<br /> <br /> In 1896, Mrs. Garfield decided again to increase the number of chickens on the farm. \"I have sent off a letter to Mr. Stohl telling him to send the new Incubator and Brooder. If we are to try for chicks again, we will need two or three roosters...\"<br /> <br /> In the 1930s three of the grandson's, Jimmy, Bobby and Dick, wanted to know if chickens could float. So, the three boys decided to fill the coop with water and the chickens floated out of the coop.  <br /> <br /> Today, remnants of the chicken coop can be seen in the concrete block remains adjacent to the parking lot.  The chicken yard was paved over for the parking lot. The original brick “patio” was recently uncovered.<br /> <br /> To learn more about this building please listen to the site's two cell phone tours. <a href=\"https://jaga.oncell.com/en/stop-list-122999.html\">Click here</a> to listen to these tours.</div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div>",

Lucretia remarked there was \"gas enough to supply the town.\" Construction of a well and derrick began shortly after the discovery. <br /> <br /> There is no record that specifies that a building was built for tank, so it may have been a building used for the orchards. By 1885, Mrs. Garfeild was using gas inside the home for cooking, lighting and heating. In 1892 a new line was dug because the original was not supplying enought for the property. The well itself was 820 feet deep when completed and seemed to supply enough gas to \"run the World's Fair\", according to Uncle Joe Rudolph.  <br /> <br /> In 1893, the construction a new building began, the Carriage House and Horse Barn. Plans for this new building included the construction of a stone-walled polygonal gas holder connected by a straight fire wall partition. Joseph Stanley-Brown, Lucretia's son-in-law, wrote this on the new structure, \"around the gas urn would afford opportunity for more efficient treatment.\" The gas well was tested again in 1901 and eventually emptied in 1910.  <br /> <br /> Today the gas holder, attached to the Carriage House and Horse Barn, stand as a testament to the every changes of a working farm in the late 19th Century. Visitors are welcome to look inside the gas holder and view the gas well used by the Garfield family.  ",

Garfield. A woman of strong character atypical of the Victorian lady, she showed pluck, courage, and intelligent command of situations that would have presented formidable challenges to other women of her time. After her husband’s assassination in 1881, she managed the affairs of the farm and family. Her involvement in the construction of the windmill at “Lawnfield,” her Mentor, Ohio home, did much to reveal her determined and intelligent nature.  </div> <div><br /> <strong>The Evolution of a Project- Design  </strong>   <br /> Problems with the main well prompted the replacement of an earlier windmill. In 1894, a new well, tower, storage tank, and larger windmill were constructed. Lucretia Garfield influenced the fine details of the project from start to finish. Letters to her sons reveal her role: </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"> </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>...if it is to be a permanent structure we should make it….sufficiently artistic to be in keeping with any future improvement we hope to make… Whatever we do now is of consequence to the grove as well as to the old home, and I want you all to be pleased.</em></div> <div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>-Lucretia to James R. Garfield, February 10, 1894 </em></div> <div><br /> While Lucretia had her own opinions about the project, she was also responsive to those of various family members. She drew a design with a round tower that they rejected, perhaps for reasons of cost or style. </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div><strong>Evolution of a Project—Money Matters    </strong></div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div>Once the design was completed, Lucretia involved herself in the details of its construction, with the goal of keeping the costs down:     </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"> </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Can you explain why a tank 15 ft by 15 ft and holding 600 barrels costs not half as much as one 11 ft by 20 ft…. And holding less than 500 barrels? The former would be put up for $195.00, the latter with only a few steel beams and window guards added, for $440.00. Again, is not Mr. Reough’s estimate too large? I really cannot see how he can make such a simple structure cost more than or as much as, he would build a summer cottage for. ... I cannot afford to build an expensive tower, neither will I consent to put up a stupid, inconvenient unsightly thing.        </em></div> <div style=\"margin-left: 160px;\"><em>-Lucretia to James R. Garfield, March 22, 1894 </em></div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Everything you write about yourself and the home affairs made me happy, except the estimates for the tower. They were simply ridiculous. Architects and contractors all seem to conspire to get the most money for the least work. I think I will go home and oversee the whole thing myself. I built a home once, bought all the material and hired workmen and although it was in wartime, I have never done anything so cheaply since, nor ever had anything better done.           </em></div> <div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>  - Lucretia to James R.

Lucretia consulted with her son Abram, an architectural student at M.I.T., about the difficulty of engineering a stone arch at the base of the windmill. With his help, the project was finally completed. Lucretia was pleased with the project, yet chagrined at the final price: $2196.00. In a final letter, Lucretia could not resist penning a comment about the value of schooling:     </div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><br /> <em>The arches are finished after one had been taken down three times, and a second twice. Finally they are not noticeably bad, and [the contractor] has learned a lesson. It may not have cost him as much as a year at M.I.T.] but the mortification of failing to understand such a simple principle in mathematics and thereby to have so blundered, more than offsets the cost of a little more study.      </em></div> <div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><em>- Lucretia to Abram Garfield, June 17, 1894 </em></div> <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"> </div> <div><strong>Reconstructing Lucretia’s Dream </strong> <br /> <br /> Lucretia Garfield understood the importance of the windmill to the function of her farm and home. But over the years, neglect and storm damage made the tower unsafe. It was taken down in 1939. The base was capped. The well was still used, but the structure was no longer beautiful. Through an anonymous donor the National Park Service and the Western Reserve Historical Society restored this prominent feature of the landscape. After over 4,000 hours the foundation, original stone pump house, the tower and windmill were replaced. In May 1998, the scaffolding came down. Mrs. Garfield’s dream once again stands 62 feet above the farm she and her family cherished.  </div>",

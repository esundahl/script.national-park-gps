In order to enter the fort, two rivers had to be crossed- the Laramie River and the North Platte River. Over the years, at least nine different sites were used to cross the Laramie and at least four different sites were used to cross the North Platte. These sites offered various ways to cross the rivers including fording, taking a ferry, or using a bridge. The only one of these crossings that is still easily found is the third crossing of the North Platte. At this location, the iron girder bridge that was built in 1876 still stands.

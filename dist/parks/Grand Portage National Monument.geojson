Living history interpreters demonstrate seasonal crafts and several types of birchbark homes. These may include building a bark canoe and bark basketry, processing wild rice, boiling maple syrup, tanning hides, finger-weaving, drying, cooking and smoking fish, and growing <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/historic-gardens-at-grand-portage.htm\">heirloom vegetables</a> in the Three Sisters garden.</p> <h3><b>Familiar Location</b></h3> <p>Fur traders constructed their posts near Native villages for survival and convenience. By the 1760s, a summer rendezvous was already a well-established tradition on Grand Portage Bay. As well as trade, activities included socializing, marriage, ceremonies, dancing, and music. Perhaps 1,000 or more Native peoples (Anishinaabeg Ojibwe, Cree, and Assiniboine) gathered or visited the Bay during the summer.</p> <h4>Long Habitation</h4> <p>Archeological investigations during the early 1960s revealed Native habitation in the Grand Portage Bay area at least 2,000 years ago. Lithics or stone artifacts such as notched projectile points, two small end scrapers, an oval blade knife, chert and small flakes of native copper were discovered in two areas close to Grand Portage Bay. The artifacts were located just above a post-glacial lake beach pre-dating Lake Superior. Point styles and beach dates connect the sites to the late Archaic and early Woodland periods 4,000-2,100 years ago (ca. 2,000 B.C.-100 A.D.).</p>",

It was built on a poor site which necessitated the use of pilings to level the foundation. Archeologists speculate that it belonged to an independent trader because adequate space still existed for additional NWCo. warehouses inside the stockade. It may have housed trade goods and supplies destined for Athabasca country in the far Northwest. These goods, packed in 90-pound bales, were carried from here to canoes waiting at Fort Charlotte, 8½ miles distant at the far end of the Grand Portage. From there they headed west through today’s Boundary Waters and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/voya/index.htm\">Voyageurs National Park</a>, and beyond to the fur country of the far west, the famed <i>Pays d'en Haut</i>, where the company’s fur posts awaited new supplies.</p> <h3>Historical Building Trades and Canoes</h3> <p>Today you can watch interpreters inside demonstrate woodworking, coopering, lathe work, basketry, carving, and canoe works. The warehouse also houses a collection of bark canoes to protect them from damaging sunlight. Two of them – a 38-foot Montreal Canoe (<em>canot du maître</em>) and a 26-foot North canoe (<em>canot du Nord</em>), both constructed by Bill Hafeman – hang from the rafters. These are the two main types of canoes in the trade that came from the East (Montreal) and went to the West (interior of the continent). Another, a ricing canoe donated by a local family, is over 80 years old.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/canoes-of-grand-portage.htm\">The role of canoes during the Fur Trade.</a></p>",

Here, the owners of the company discussed necessary business with their clerks from the far reaches of the interior trading posts. The company owners traveled from Montreal to exchange information with the people acquiring furs across the riverways of the continent. When a day's business finished, tables were pushed aside for dancing and socializing to make up for long winters of isolation.</p> <h3><strong>Today's Great Hall</strong></h3> <p>The four partners' bedrooms are set up as exhibit spaces to further explain the story. One room is as a bedroom. Another shows the process from beaver to fine hat. A third room is a London street with products derived from fur bearers, and the fourth is set up as a trading post. </p> <h4>Selfie Station</h4> <p>A corner of the Great Hall is hung with blanket coats (capotes) and different hats for people to try on for memorable selfies.</p> <h2>Excavating History</h2> <blockquote> <p><em>This evening the gentlemen of the place dressed and we had a famous ball in the dining room, and for musick [sic] we had the bag-pipe the violin, the flute and the fife, which enabled us to spend the evening agreeably. At the ball were a number of this countries ladies, who danced not amiss.</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">Daniel Willaims Harmon at his first rendezvous as a new clerk for the NWCo, April 29, 1800</p> </blockquote> <p>The dining hall Harmon wrote about was rediscovered by Minnesota Historical Society archeologist Ralph Brown during the fall of 1937. After delineating the stockade the previous summer, Brown discovered foundations inside the stockade constructed from fine-grained sandstone. Measuring 95 by 30 feet, the foundation is the largest inside the stockade. The first reconstructed Great Hall was completed in 1940 by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/civilian-conservation-corp-indian-division-at-grand-portage.htm\">CCC Indian Division</a>. It burned to the ground when struck by lightning in 1969. The Great Hall now standing was completed in 1972 and reflects the post and beam French-Canadian architecture common to NWCo depots.</p>",

Midsummer, the North West Company held business meetings and entertained their clerks and trading partners. To celebrate this reunion, a professional chef and baker joined the numbers who traveled here in the summer months from Montreal. He would employ local Native women to prepare elaborate five course meals that included soups, stews, fancy roasts and fish, scones and shortbread, and even fresh roasted coffee. Livestock such as cows, pigs, and chickens came aboard ships to create European-style fare. The menu also featured specialty dishes like haggis, blood pudding, and syllabub (a frothy cream and wine dessert popular at the time).</p> <p>Look around to see kitchenware of the time, watch staff prepare food on the hearth or bake bread in an outdoor bread oven. While you’re there, learn what the voyageurs ate on their journey and see what Native goods made it on the menu.</p> <h3><strong>Evidence of Use</strong></h3> <p>Archeological excavations of the kitchen area during 1970-71, yielded almost 14,500 artifacts. The remains of a fireplace were also discovered and behind it a small stone-lined dry well or cooler with its wooden floor still in place.

Bonjour! </em>Welcome to the Depot! </p> <p>The North West Company built the Depot in this strategic location at the beginning of <em>Gichi Onigamiing</em> (the Great Carrying Place), <em>le <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/trailhead-for-gichi-onigaming-the-grand-portage.htm\">Grand Portage</a></em>. In the days of the fur trade, a great variety of people passed through these gates to do business with the North West Company. Inside, the Great Hall was the site of the company’s annual shareholder meeting. Men of wealth from Montreal and Scotland conferred with men of action – partners who spent the winter on the frontier and negotiated trade for beaver and other pelts destined for European markets. The partners also met with leaders from nearby Anishinaabe (Ojibwe), Cree, and Assiniboine villages to formalize trading relationships. Within the Depot walls, there were also a company store, tradesman shops, and storehouses for trade goods, furs, and supplies for the summer. The company’s partners, as well as clerks and canoe guides, all lived here during their stay. Come inside the palisade and travel back to the time when Grand Portage was the center of the fur trade world! </p> <h3>The Function of the Gatehouse</h3> <p>Ascend the stairs to the Gatehouse lookout tower. Look east for Montreal canoes rounding Hat Point laden with trade goods. The view to the west watches over the Grand Portage trail. Keep a close eye on cook fires outside the palisade!</p> <p> </p>",

Similarly, the 24' North canoes at Fort Charlotte returned with trade goods to villages in the northwest where the Native trappers lived. The <i>canots de maître </i>(Monteal canoes) carried trade goods, collected in Montreal from around the world, to the North West Company depot on the lake. This two canoe system, one size for the Great Lakes and the other for rivers meeting in the middle, enabled the company to move goods across most of the continent in a single summer season each year.</p>",

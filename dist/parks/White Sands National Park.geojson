The stems that attach the leaves to the tree are flat instead of round. This helps the leaves twist in the wind allowing them to not be blown off the tree in the high-speed winds that often happen here. The roots run deep into the ground and hold the trees in place, so they don’t lose their grip during windstorms. During the fall, the green leaves of the cottonwood will start to turn yellow to orange in color.<br /> Migratory birds will use the groves of cottonwoods as resting points. The trees give them a place to stop and rest during their long journey.",

If so, you explored some concession establishments that were a long time in the making. Visitors who came to White Sands in the 1930s and 40s used to purchase their snacks, sleds, and souvenirs from a large trailer in the dunefield operated by Tom Charles and his White Sands Service Company. He might have even once parked it in the flat interdune area in front of you.<br /> <br /> Charles is known to some as the “Father of White Sands,” as he was instrumental in the park’s designation as a National Monument, and eventually became its first Superintendent. Besides selling trinkets and food items, his company also took visitors on private auto tours throughout the dunefield. They made their way over even the tallest dunes in what would now be a vintage car, and, surprisingly, rarely got stuck!<br /> <br /> If you were to create your own tour or concessions company here at White Sands, what services would you offer?</p>",

Is there anything there that looks like it doesn’t belong? After making a note of where the closest trail marker to you is, saunter towards this curious conundrum when you think you've spotted it.<br /> <br /> If you’re now standing near the red clay pieces scattered about, you’re not only on the road to successfully finding the focus of this stop – you’re on the road that used to lead into White Sands when it was first designated as a National Monument in 1933. This road served as the main access point to the Monument for most of the 1930s, and was finished just in time to welcome an estimated 776 cars on Opening Day. That was nearly five thousand people, all exploring where you are today!<br /> <br /> While the road added a nice splash of color to the otherwise white dunes, it had a natural inclination to get washed out during periods of heavy rains. Within a few years, the old clay road was replaced by the asphalt pavement you probably rode in on today. But its remaining pieces still caused confusion among new visitors, and countless drivers found themselves lost by following this now destinationless road. To keep people on the right track, Civilian Conservation Corps members eventually removed most of the old clay road in the 1940s.<br /> <br /> As it is in all National Parks, these fragments of history are protected by law. Please take care to Leave No Trace and take nothing from the dunefield, including sand, plants, and pieces of this historic road.</p>",

Layers of gypsum were left behind as the sea emptied and filled over and over, and you can still see them as light layers of rock in the surrounding mountains.<br /> <br /> Water carries dissolved gypsum down to the basin, then evaporates, leaving behind gypsum crystals. Those crystals are then broken down into smaller and smaller pieces until they are the sand you just dug into.<br /> <br /> The dunes have been here for around 7,000 years! The secret to keeping all this sand in place is shallow underground water acting as an anchor. Much like a paper towel sucking up water, the dunes act like the paper towel and the water holds them in place. When you feel the wet sand a few inches down, you’re feeling the dunefield’s anchor.",

White Sands National Park is among the most unique places on planet earth featuring expansive gypsum sand dunes. However, White Sands is so much more than just the dunes. Here life within has evolved against a white backdrop which provides a natural laboratory to study rapid evolution. For human visitors, the Tularosa Basin is a place we come to for insights into our past, present, and future as human beings. This tour will show the value of White Sands as a natural wonder, ecosystem, and a place for human enjoyment.

Today it is rare for many people to have the opportunity to appreciate the everchanging night sky, but it is always there night after night whether we take notice or not. When the world shifts to darkness, most of us humans settle into our homes, close our eyes, and go to sleep. Out here at White Sands however, the park residents relish in the darkness. When visitors are done with their picnics, sledding, and taking selfies the park gets dark, quiet, and nocturnal animals emerge to start their day. This is when moths appear, fluttering from yucca to yucca, making sure they will bloom again next season. Bats squeak, flap, and swoop for prey. Kit foxes’ tiny paws scuttle along the dunes, chasing creatures with tinier paws. A bobcat lurks through the dunes, its eyes aglow in the moonlight. You may associate darkness with evil, uncertainty, and danger, but darkness is essential for all living things. The absence of light allows natural rhythms to take place. Artificial light disrupts this rhythm and alters the behavior of nocturnal animals. Imagine trying to sleep with the lights on or getting up for breakfast in the middle of the night. For us, darkness signals the end of the day and for nocturnal animals the beginning of theirs. In the absence of light, they can navigate, nest, hunt, and hide. Beyond helping nocturnal critters maintain their groove, the night sky has been an inspiration since the beginning of human history. On a clear night, how many stars can you see from your house? What can you do to see more? Perhaps a porch light or a bright floodlight is trespassing on your vision. The more artificial light that is near you, the fewer stars you will see. With few large population centers nearby, the remoteness of White Sands makes it an oasis for nocturnal animals to live undisturbed and for visitors to catch awe-inspiring views of the Milky Way. Tonight, and during your travels, we encourage you to keep your eye on the sky. Observe the darkness in different locations and recognize that this valuable resource is disappearing as we sleep.",

During the day, they stay in their dens to keep out of the heat. A kit fox will grow up to 20 inches (6 crayons) in length and weigh around five pounds. They have hair between their toes which helps them get more traction on the sand. This adaptation helps them to move fast and catch their prey. In the desert, there is very little access to running water. The kit fox gets all the moisture it needs from the food it eats instead of drinking. While it prefers small mammals such as mice, the kit fox will also eat lizards. <a> </a>",

Pocket mice will store seeds in their burrows to eat later. If there aren’t enough seeds around, they will also eat leaves, stems of plants, and small insects. The white coloration of the Apache pocket mouse makes it hard for predators to see them. The more a mouse blends in with its habitat, the more likely it will live a long life. With each life cycle, the mice will become lighter because of the process of natural selection. In other words, the lighter mice will survive long enough to reproduce. They spend most of the day under the ground to keep out of the heat of the day. They will block up the den opening during the day to keep the cool night air inside. The tracks of the Apache pocket mouse resemble the movement of when you pretended to be a frog by putting your hands in between your feet on the ground and hop forward.",

Lizards that escape getting caught due to their white color live longer. If you live longer, you will have more offspring. Their babies will inherit the bright white color and then, in time, pass the coloration onto their own offspring.<br /> <br /> You can sometimes see them running around the dunes catching bugs. The lizards talk to each other by bobbing their heads, just like you have probably seen other kinds of lizards do. They do have ears, but they are not visible like ours.

If you see the Backcountry Camping Loop Trailhead in front of you, you’re in the right place.<br /> <br /> White Sands is far more than just a sandbox. Over time, this land has been home to countless creatures and people. It’s been a site for research and recreation, sleds and snapshots. Just as the landscape shifts and changes every day, the way recent humans have utilized this place has changed, too. As we begin our voyage to explore how the ways we use this landscape has changed over time, remember that nothing is permanent – especially not the world’s largest gypsum sand dunes. Keep in mind that you may need to adjust your location to get a better view along the way.<br /> <br /> Here are a few more tips to help you make the most of this self-led tour:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Read up on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/hiking-safety-tips.htm\">hiking safety tips</a> before setting off on foot.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bring plenty of water! We strongly recommend having at least a gallon of water per person, per day. <strong>There is no drinking water available in the dunefield.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Always know where you are, and keep a keen eye on the trail markers both behind you and ahead of you. The backcountry trail markers will all have the spade symbol on them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Please be respectful of visitors setting up camp at the designated sites along the trail, and try to avoid wandering into campsites uninvited. We’re not Goldilocks, and the beds probably won’t fit “just right.”</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now if you’re ready to begin, you can continue along the trail. <br /> <br /> Let’s go!</p>",

Many plants can’t grow inside the sand because they will blow away in the wind. The plants that grow in the sand have all found different ways to survive here. A plant pedestal is one such way of surviving. It is a tall structure of hardened sand. Pedestals form when the plant takes up water from the soil. When the soil dries out, the sand will compact around the root system. The wind blows the loose sand away from the root system, exposing the pedestal underneath. Hoary rosemary mint leaves have shiny white hairs all over. The hairs help protect the plant from the sun.

How far do you think you can see? On most days you can see for miles, including the surrounding mountain ranges. Now I want you to imagine those mountains becoming obscured. A windstorm has picked up. You can feel it beating against the side of your car. It’s howling all around you. As the wind increases, visibility decreases. You can see a mile away. Then 500 feet. The yucca on the next dune is no longer visible. Then 100 feet. You can no longer see the sledding family. Then 20 feet. Then 5 feet in front of you. You are in the middle of white-out blizzard conditions, but instead of snow, it’s gypsum sand. If you were to try to leave your vehicle, assuming you could get the door open, the result would not be pleasant, gypsum would sandblast its way into every nook and cranny, the feeling of thousands of tiny needles against your skin. Moving only a few feet away from your vehicle could result in total disorientation. Now, what are some words you would use to describe our theoretical encounter? (pause) Wild? Dangerous? Perhaps even violent? As humans, we ascribe violence to nature quite often. Violent storms, volcanoes, and floods are found throughout most of the world. All these forces we may fear or try to prevent, help create the stunning landscapes and natural beauty we love – and the environment you are currently looking at. Eventually, the windstorm subsides, revealing pristine dunes, no footprints insight, with patterns of ripples coating its surface. Dunes move to new destinations, covering plants and revealing fresh ground for others to grow. Seeds fly to those new homes. From the beginning to now, without wind, this landscape would not exist. To change selenite, the crystal form of gypsum, to sand, the wind erodes the landscape. Crystals bounce off each other, collide, and break into smaller and smaller pieces, until they’re the size of a grain of sand, piling high to form the dunes you are seeing. Even though the dunefield loses sand during these windstorms, the wind also carries in new sand, keeping the dunefield in balance.",

A death? Or was it a leisurely day like today exploring in a park like this? Why did this one day have a long-lasting impact on your life? These special days that change our lives are unique for each one of us but we all undoubtedly have them. Even rarer than a day that has a special significance to just you, are days that have an undeniable impact on every person on earth. If you had been standing here in the early morning of July 16<sup>th</sup>, 1945, you would have been witness to such an event. As you look out over the dunes to the north, imagine you are here before sunrise and a blinding flash of light appears in the distance before fading away without explanation. The first shot of the atomic age had been fired 60 miles to the north at the Trinity Test site. For three years in near-total secrecy scientists and workers at three sites across the United States had been developing a new kind of weapon designed to bring a swift end to World War II. Known collectively as the Manhattan Project, the Trinity Test was the culmination of their years of work and within weeks of the successful test here in New Mexico the first atomic weapons would be dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, avoiding a full-scale invasion of Japan, but inflicting hundreds of thousands in civilian casualties. To this day they are the only nuclear weapons to have been used. However, the opening of the nuclear age at the Trinity site has had untold impacts on the world we live in. The potential for nuclear weapons to end human existence through mutually assured destruction has dominated global politics throughout the Cold War and into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. It has brought benefits to society in the forms of nuclear energy and medicine, but the adverse impacts cannot be ignored. In communities downwind from nuclear testing sites or uranium mines, the consequences have been devastating with high rates of cancer and birth defects. The Trinity Test is the point in time when the Pandora’s box of the atomic age was opened, and these sands bore witness to that moment.",

Sixty of those species are entirely new to science.<br /> .<br /> This moth research is critical because moths are a great indicator of a ecosystems health.

As you look up the trail leading into the dunes you will see desert scrubland vegetation on either side of the trail. Perhaps this is greener than you were expecting to see at a place with a name like White Sands. Here towards the front of the drive is a meeting point of two unique ecosystems that allows a diverse community to thrive. On Dune Life Nature Trail just up the path from the parking lot, you’ll find yourself in another world where snow white dunes are dotted with dune adapted plants such as soaptree yuccas, Rio Grande cottonwoods, and hoary rosemary mint. Across the park road towards the Sacramento Mountains to the east, you will see the Chihuahuan Desert scrubland full of low-growing, thorny fauna such as creosote bush, mesquite, ocotillo, and varieties of cacti. In the dunes, you’ll find full-time residents like kangaroo rats, bleached earless lizards, and over 60 species of moth found nowhere else on earth that have become color adapted to the blindingly white environment. The largest predator that lives full time in the dunes is a kit fox which weighs in at a whopping 4 pounds! Animals residing in the dunes are small, compact, and efficient with their water, never taking a drink in their life. But the White Sands community is more than just what’s found in the dunes. On the edge of the dunefield where the sand meets the desert scrubland, the park receives some interesting visitors. Larger mammals like bobcats, coyotes, badgers, and even porcupines that couldn’t survive in the dunes year-round make their way into the dunes to get the resources they need and then return to their homes in the scrubland. These temporary visitors to the dunes are no less of a part of the dunefield community whether their impact is big or small. Your visit to White Sands today is also a temporary one where you might come to hike, sled, or enjoy a picnic and then return home with memories to last a lifetime. Whether you’ve come from near or far to be here today by taking the time to explore White Sands you have become part of the White Sands community!",

You'll love bringing your furry companions with you to the park, too.as long as they are non-disruptive, on a leash no longer than six feet, and are under physical control at all times.</p> <p>We ask you to follow these simple rules for everyone's enjoyment and safety:</p> <p><strong>Pick up after your pet.</strong><br /> Please help keep White Sands clean and beautiful for your enjoyment and for the enjoyment of future generations. Cleaning up after your pet allows the area to remain sanitary and keeps diseases from spreading—helping to keep you and your family as well as your pet safe and healthy! Please consider the many people who walk barefoot, play, and sled in the sand—no one wants to step or sled into pet waste.</p> <p>For your added convenience, White Sands National Park has two designated pet walking stations complete with pet poop pick-up bags to help facilitate with the removal of pet excrement. Both are located outside the visitor center;one is adjacent to the women's restroom and the other is behind the picnic tables.</p> <p><strong>Keep pets on a leash.</strong><br /> Leashing your pet ensures your much-loved friend doesn't run away and get lost. It also prevents them from tangling with hazards such as cacti and rattlesnakes. Federal law prohibits dogs from being off the leash in public areas (36 CFR 2.15). The leash can be no longer than six feet (2 m).</p> <p><strong>Give pets plenty of water.</strong><br /> Like you, pets get thirsty too. Especially in the summer pets can become dehydrated very quickly. They can also suffer from heat stroke and die.</p> <p><strong>Do not bring pets inside the visitor center.</strong><br /> While we love seeing pets in the park, they are not allowed in federal buildings (36 CFR 2.15).</p> <p><strong>Do not leave pets unattended, especially in vehicles.</strong><br /> It is prohibited to leave a pet unattended and tied to an object (36 CFR 2.15).</p> <p>Temperatures at White Sands National Park can reach extreme highs. Pets should never be left alone inside your vehicle. Within just ten minutes, the inside vehicle temperature will become 25 degrees warmer than the outside temperature. Within 30 minutes, inside temperatures can rise over 30 degrees. Pets left unattended in hot vehicles have suffered severe organ damage or even death.</p> <br /> <strong>Service Animals</strong><br /> Service animals are allowed in all facilities and on all trails unless an area has been closed by the superintendent to protect park resources.<br /> <br /> <strong>Definition of Service Animal</strong><br /> The 2010 revision to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a \"service animal\" as a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.<br /> <br /> Dogs which are not trained to perform tasks to mitigate the effects of a disability, including dogs used purely to provide comfort or emotional support (\"therapy animals\"), are considered pets.",

Sweat evaporates quickly. Your body loses water rapidly in the desert. Always carry extra water with you. When your water is half-gone, return to your car.<br /> <br /> One gallon (4 Liters) of water per person per day is recommended, as well as high-energy snacks such as fruit, nuts, and energy bars. Fill up water containers at the visitor center. There is no water available in the dunefield.<br /> <br /> In addition, it is important to balance food intake with fluid consumption, lest you run the risk of becoming dangerously debilitated and severely ill. <strong>Hyponatremia </strong>may occur when a person drinks too much water without replenishing electrolytes or eating salts. If a member of your party begins to experience nausea, muscle cramps, or disorientation, yet they are well hydrated, they may need salt. Crackers, pretzels, and sports drinks should be consumed to keep up sodium levels in the body.<br />   <figure><img alt=\"Graphic of a ringing cell phone\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Phone_Thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Phone\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Bring a <em>fully</em> <em>charged</em> cell phone</h3> <p>Start your day with a fully-charged cell phone. Bring a portable charger if you have one. There are no outlets for charging cell phones at the park. Turn your cell phone off or put in airplane mode while walking in the dunes. Conserving your battery for emergencies could mean the difference between life or death.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"A phone with text \"Call 911\"\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Emergencies_911_Thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Call 911\" /></figure> <h3><br /> In an Emergency Call 911</h3> Data and cellular signal strength can vary drastically throughout the park. Sometimes you can text when you are unable to make a call. In an emergency situation with limited cell reception, text a friend and have him call 911 for you. You may not be able to call 911 if you are using a cell phone from outside the United Sates. Consult your mobile service provider for instructions on how to access emergency services with your device prior to venturing out into the dunes.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"Graphic of hands pointing at a green map\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Plan_Ahead_and_Prepare_Logo_Thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Hands pointing to map\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Have a Plan and Share It</h3> Tell someone who is not in your party where you are going and when you will return. Know the weather forecast and what time the sun sets. Be prepared for the weather and ensure you have enough time to complete your hike.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"Three hikers on a trail surrounded by grass\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_visitors_hikers_thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Hikers on Trail\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Hike with Friends</h3> It is not recommended to hike alone. Always keep your children in sight. Children can wander, and separating from your companions can mean getting lost.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"Composite image of orange post, flash light, compass, and cell phone.\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Know-Where-You-Are_Thumbnails.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Know Where You Are\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Know Where You Are</h3> It is easy to become disoriented in the dunefield. Wind moves sand and erases your tracks. GPS can be unreliable. While hiking, pay attention to and follow trail posts, each marked with a specific color and symbol. Knowing the trail markers is critical if you become lost. Look carefully for the next trail marker before continuing. If you cannot see the next marker, do not continue, turn around and return to your car. Plan your hike so that you are back at the trailhead before sunset.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"One man standing and two children sitting on a white sand dune\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Staying_Found_Stop_Do_Not_Wander_Thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Lost\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Do Not Wander if Lost</h3> Carry a park map and compass and keep landmarks, such as water towers, in view. If you become lost, stop and sit on top of a dune. Wandering can endanger your life and make finding you more difficult. Use a mirror or piece of aluminum foil to flash sunlight towards potential rescuers. Call 911.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"A pile of gear and hiking supplies spread on an orange tarp\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_BePrepared_Thumbnails.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Gear\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Be Prepared</h3> The sun reflecting off the white sand is intense year round and can cause severe sunburns. Wear a hat, sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher, and sunglasses. Apply sunscreen to all exposed areas, even in winter. Wear clothing that is appropriate for the day’s weather: loose, light-colored clothing during warmer months, and warm clothing during cooler seasons. Remember that temperatures can drop drastically after sunset – anywhere from 20 to 30 degrees.<br /> <br /> In addition, take the park map, a flashlight and extra batteries, a whistle, a signal mirror, a first-aid kit, and extra clothes that can be layered for varying weather.<br />   <figure><img alt=\"Three people eating at a picnic table\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_RestOften_Thumbnails.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Rest at Picnic Table\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Rest Often</h3> Heat illness can occur fast. Take frequent breaks in the shade. There are picnic areas with sheltered tables along Dunes Drive. You can also bring your own sun shelter or sun umbrella. Exposure to full sunshine can increase heat index values by up to 15°F (9°C). The sun’s UV rays are the strongest at midday. Plan your visit for early morning or late afternoon when the sun is lower.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"One hiker walking on white sand dunes\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_KnowLimits_Thumbnails.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Hiker\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Know Your Limits</h3> <h4>Altitude</h4> The elevation at White Sands is 4,235 feet (1,291 m). This may have an effect on those traveling from lower elevations. Allow time for your body to acclimate by adjusting your activity level. Take frequent breaks and drink water. Common symptoms of altitude sickness include headache and loss of appetite. Pace yourself and pay attention to how you are feeling.",

The Tularosa Basin has been a place where we as humans have been coming for thousands of years, even before the dunefield you see today formed. If you had been standing here during the last Ice Age, you would have witnessed a climate that was much cooler, wetter, and greener with a massive lake known as Lake Otero that was the size of the present-day Great Salt Lake in Utah. These were the conditions that lured the Ice Age megafauna like Columbian mammoths, giant ground sloths, dire wolves, camels, and more. This abundance of large game is likely what attracted these early human migrants to this basin. The presence of humans and megafauna at White Sands is not from the discovery of bones or artifacts, but from the preservation of fossilized footprints in the ancient lake sediments. Today, these fossilized footprints have to be cataloged and studied rapidly because as quickly as they appear at the surface, they will continue to erode away with the wind in just a matter of years. These footprints will never tell us everything we want to know about what human and megafauna life at the time was like, but they do provide snapshots. A group of humans stalked a giant ground sloth on a hunt. A woman struggled and slipped through the mud for over a mile with a set of children’s feet appearing occasionally as she briefly sets her child down before moving on. A giant ground sloth made a footprint that became a puddle where children’s footprints show them splashing in the water. Sets of teenagers fossilized footprints carbon-dated to around 23,000 years old, older than any definitive evidence of human habitation yet found in North America. What will be remembered about your visit to White Sands today?",

Gypsum, the material that makes up the sand dunes, is among the most common on earth and is widely used as a construction material in drywall, plaster of Paris, and concrete. Despite gypsum being found on all seven continents, this place is worthy of being a National Park because gypsum sand dunes are among the rarest geologic features on earth, with only 3 in the entire world! The process of building this geologic wonder has been a long time in the making. In the mountains to the east or west, you may see lighter layers. This is gypsum! It was deposited 280 million years ago by a shallow inland sea that advanced and receded across the southwest, leaving behind the massive deposits of gypsum that make up the white sand today. Flash forward to 70 million years ago when colliding plate tectonics uplifted the horizontal gypsum layers in a massive mountain building event. Around 20 to 30 million years ago these plate tectonics began to pull apart creating the two separate mountain ranges you see today, the San Andres Mountains in the west and the Sacramento Mountains in the east. In between the mountain ranges where you now stand the earth fell away forming the Tularosa Basin. Finally, the ancient Rio Grande River flowed into the Tularosa Basin between 2 and 3 million years ago bringing with it sediments that eventually blocked any water carrying gypsum from flowing out of the basin. Later in this tour, you’ll explore the modern geologic forces that have sculpted these dunes, but without the perfect series of geologic coincidences to set the stage none of this would be possible.",

That vaguely familiar feeling might be rooted in seeing White Sands on the big screen, mid-90s <i>MTV</i>, or even as the backdrop of an advertisement for your favorite car. Since 1950, this park has been featured in dozens of films, ranging from classic spaghetti Westerns to modern action, science fiction, documentaries, and comedy movies. On top of being a great spot for yoga instructors to film their classes, this dunefield was even used in a promotion for the Olympics.<br /> <br /> Whether it’s rugged cowboys or old school boybands that pique your interest, it’s possible you’ve followed along some famous footsteps on your hike today. Take a closer look at the landscape the next time you spot some dunes in a video, too – it might be White Sands that you’re watching!<br /> <br /> Want to see White Sands on the big screen sooner rather than later? Swing by the Visitor Center to watch our captivating 17-minute orientation film, which is shown every half hour, on the hour. If the Visitor Center isn’t showing the film, the DVD is available for sale at the non-profit park store.</p>",

On the signs detailing the trail, you will also see an overhead picture of the dunes. Imagine you are a bird of prey soaring over the dunes searching for a tasty snack in the form of a lizard or small rodent. As you look down on the endless waves of white dunes you might think that the dunefield is entirely barren other than the yuccas and rosemary mint dotting the landscape. However, darting in the interdune are small, white color adapted critters doing their best to go unseen. White Sands provides one of the best examples on earth of rapid adaptation to a unique environment. These white sand dunes have only been here for around 7,000 years and in such a short time the animals that call them home have shown remarkable adaptation to their environment. Unlike the surrounding desert, at White Sands it is survival of the lightest! Over generations, certain traits like color give animals an advantage in a given environment and pass on their advantageous traits to their descendants. Here you’ll find that being white color adapted not only helps an animal hide from predators, but it also keeps them cool in the scorching summers by reflecting sunlight away. The rapid change in habitat in the Tularosa Basin has led to an explosion of white, endemic species found nowhere else on earth. Just as isolated islands lead to unique, specialized species of animals, the unusual environment of the dunefield has led to lizards, moths, mammals, and even a species of fish that are found only at White Sands.  ",

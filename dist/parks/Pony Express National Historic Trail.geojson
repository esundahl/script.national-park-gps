A Nebraska State Historical Society interpretive marker provides more information about these raids. There is also a granite marker a half mile to the mile north across the Little Blue River. From the state marker, look east toward the hillside to see a series of parallel wagon ruts heading toward your location. These wagon ruts, which are on private property, are remnants of the Oregon Trail. <br /> <br /> The sign reads, \"1864 Indian Raids. During the Civil War, many regular troops were withdrawn from Plains military posts to fight in the east. The Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho, seizing this opportunity, attempted to drive white settlers from their land.<br /> <br /> Beginning on August 7, 1864, the Indians made concerted attacks on stage stations and ranches along the Oregon Trail, hitting nearly every settlement for 400 miles from Julesburg to Big Sandy. Travel ceased for two months.<br /> <br /> The most severe attacks were along the upper Little Blue River where about 100 people were killed. Several died at Oak Grove, but others escaped and Pawnee Ranch was successfully defended. At 'the Narrows' the Eubanks families were attacked and seven killed. Mrs. Eubanks, two children and Miss Laura Roper were taken prisoner and held captive for months. Teamsters were killed, wagon trains burned and ranches were smashed or burned. Settlers fled east to Beatrice and Marysville or northwest to Fort Kearny on the Platte for protection. Troops and local militia companies attacked and drove back the Indians in the battle of the Little Blue on August 17, 1864. Major raids ceased but skirmishes continued through the fall.\"</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(State Highway 14 near Nelson, Nebraska)</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/1864_indian_raids.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Russell and William B. Waddell who joined Majors in an attempt to gain a government contract to supply western forts.<a href=\"#2\">[2]</a> Already an experienced Santa Fe Trail dealer, Majors had the knowledge and equipment, while Russell and Waddell had the capital, to secure the government contract. For a short time, the company had a “virtual monopoly of the army freighting business in the west and southwest.”<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a> <br /> <br /> The 300-acre farmstead was dissected by the westernmost US border, making part of the property outside US jurisdiction and, thus, untaxable. The company’s barns, mule sheds, grazing lands, wagon and blacksmith shops, and other business-related entities were located on the portion of property located in the Kansas Territory.<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a> A caravan camp was used to load the heavy freight wagons which would travel the trails.<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a> <br /> <br /> The home was built in 1856, most likely using the labor of enslaved people.<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>  The “T” shaped floorplan with recessed front porch makes it a unique iteration of the Greek revival style in Kansas City.<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>  Today, it is one of the oldest buildings in Kansas City, as one of only 4 pre-Civil War buildings left standing.<a href=\"#8\">[8]</a> Though the house remains, many of the other original structures are gone and the land has been divided into distinct plots. Among the lost structures were living quarters for the 16-17 people enslaved by the Majors’.<a href=\"#9\">[9] </a><br /> <br /> In 1930 Louisa P. Johnston, Majors’s great grand-daughter, travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the house abandoned. She bought the house in 1932 and, for the next forty years, worked to preserve the property. In 1984 the Alexanders Majors House Museum was opened to the public for tours and events. In 2010 the house partnered with the John Wornall House and Museum to create one nonprofit dedicated to preserving both properties.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(8201 State Line Road (east side of road near 85th Street), Kansas City)<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.wornallmajors.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <br /> <br />   <div> <p id=\"ftn1\"><em><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Marc Simmons, Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers (Santa Fe, NM: Ancient City Press, 1984), p. 61.</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Martha Kusiak, “Alexander Majors House,” National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form.

The hollow bristled with brush and its boulder-choked bottom was too narrow for wagons to pass. The Donner-Reed wagon party grubbed a dangerous sideling trail along the sloping bank before dropping, exhausted, into their first camp beyond the Weber River. Mormon pioneers improved the rough track, but despite their efforts, many wagons over the years tumbled sideways off the trail. Dixie Hollow narrows and becomes impassable to wagons.<br /> <br /> Broad Hollow, which drains into Dixie Hollow near the Donner-Reed campsite of August 11, provided a detour around the Dixie Hollow chokepoint. The pioneers veered northwest up Broad Hollow, turned west across a wide bench, and then dropped south again to East Canyon Creek and through today’s East Canyon State Park.<br /> <br /> A monument marks the location where pioneers turned west. Some researchers think the two-track to the right of the monument may be the original trail alignment, but it might be a more recent ranch road. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Southwest of Henefer, Utah)</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

So far, only three rider fatalities at the hands of warriors are securely documented including that of a Hispanic rider. The Hispanic rider was Jose Zowgaltz, who was ambushed as he crossed the thick aspen bottoms of Edwards Creek. Zowgaltz galloped to Cold Springs Station, south of the ambush site. Suffering a mortal abdominal wound, he slipped bleeding from his saddle upon entering the station and soon died. The rider's death was recorded by assistant station keeper J.G. Kelley, who had to ride Zowgaltz's return relay two days later. Kelley raced his pony through the leafy green tunnel of aspens \"like a streak of greased lightning\" and once clear, paused to look back. The bushes along the trail trembled suspiciously; Kelley suspected they concealed warriors who had been unable to get a clear shot at him.<br /> <br /> Intact, standing ruins of the Cold Springs Pony Express Station where Jose Zowgaltz died still remain.

Travelers on the south side of the Platte river had a close-up view of these celebrated landmarks, which made them a popular item for emigrants to write about and sketch in their diaries.<br /> <br /> Today, the rocks are open to the public.

Note, this trail used to lead to the top of the rock, but large sections of the trail have since eroded away. Use extreme caution when hiking. Open year-round, daylight hours. No tourist facilities at the site nor staff presence. </p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>In November of 1841, Rufus B. Sage recorded,</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A singular natural formation, known as the Court House, or McFarlan's Castle . . . rises in an abrupt quadrilangular form, to a height of three or four hundred feet, and covers an area of two hundred yards in length by one hundred and fifty broad. Occupying a perfectly level site in an open prairie, it stands as the proud palace of Solitude, amid here boundless domains. Its position commands a view of the country for forty miles around and meets the eye of the traveler for several successive days, in journeying up the Platte.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (five miles south of Bridgeport, Nebraska on Highway 88)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/scotts_bluff/courthouse_jail_rocks.html\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

For the Mormon militia, this seemed a strategic location to stop or delay approaching federal troops. Defensive Breastworks (Echo Canyon) positioned along the rim of the cliff to the right are barely visible in several places from the canyon floor. Mormon militiamen, fearing an attack on Salt Lake City by the U.S. Army, built the low rubble walls above the emigrant road in 1857. The breastworks would protect the defenders as they fired down on approaching federal troops. Because they are made of local sandstone from the cliffs and were meant to be unobtrusive, the structures can be difficult to see.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Echo Canyon, Utah)</p> <p>Pull into a turnout on the right side of the road to view a large wooden sign that describes the Mormon defense preparations in Echo Canyon. Continue to the next turnout, 1/4 mile beyond, and pause at Summit County’s brown tour sign No. 7 for Billboard Bluff. From the turnout, look up at the base of the cliff face to see 19th century roadside advertisements painted directly onto the rock. (These are unassociated with the Utah War.)<br /> <br /> Travel 1/10 mile, watching for brown Summit County tour sign No. 6 on the left. From the tour-stop sign, face the cliff to the right of the road and look along the rim to see a low stone wall. Then turn and look east across the freeway to the bluffs on the opposite side of the canyon. Just below the alignment of telephone poles that crosses the slope, a faint horizontal line in the earth is sometimes visible, depending on the quality of the light and vegetation. The line is what remains of a defensive trench dug by the Mormon militia. Approaching federal troops were to be caught in crossfire from between the cliff-top breastworks and the entrenchment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

For 12 days the emigrants had gnawed a track through the rugged Wasatch wilderness, and now, at the very edge of the Salt Lake Valley, limestone outcrops and dense willows blocked their exit from the mouth of Emigration Canyon. The discouraged travelers pulled to the left out of the creek bottom and up the 200-foot-high ridge that thereafter would bear their name. The effort nearly used up the strength of their oxen. The next year Brigham Young’s vanguard pioneer party, having more men for the labor, opened a road through the blockage, avoiding the hill climb, in just 4 hours’ time. The current roadbed approximates their route.<br /> <br /> Today, Emigration Canyon is widened and the top of Donner Hill has been leveled to make room for residential development. But the hill is still impressive and Emigration Creek, edged by willow and scrub oak, still runs along the south side of Emigration Canyon Road. Visitors can easily envision how this spot looked in 1846-47.<br /> <br /> The evening of their arrival on July 22, the Donner-Reed Party encamped a short distance beyond the hilltop with the broad Salt Lake Valley stretched at their feet. A grassy park along the ridge, adjacent to Crestview Drive, is named Donner Park in commemoration of that campsite. The next day the emigrants descended the ridge and traveled across the valley to the Jordan River. From there, the Donner Reed Party continued along the south shore of the Great Salt Lake.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Emigration Canyon, near Rotary Glen Park)</p> <p>On the right at odometer mile 20 is another small sign for Donner Hill. A stone monument commemorating Donner Hill is on the left where the road curves to the south. At that location the hill is in front of you, easy to see, with a condominium at the top. Use caution when crossing the oncoming lane to enter or leave the widened road shoulder at the monument. Then continue down Emigration Canyon Road around the S-curve. If traffic permits, turn left at odometer mile 20.6 into an unmarked entrance for Rotary Glen Park. If you miss the entrance, turn left onto the next paved road, Crestview Drive, and turn around at a safe location to return to the intersection. Turn right and make an immediate right turn into Rotary Glen Park. Now go left across the parking lot and follow the dirt access road to the east. End at a gravel parking lot.<br /> <br /> Look across the small reservoir toward Donner Hill, the ridge to the northeast. The emigrants ascended the ridge on the north side of the condominiums. From this vantage, the steepness of the climb is evident.

Once discovered by mountain men in the early 1800s, the 24-mile passage eventually became a thoroughfare for pack trains, commercial and emigrant wagons, Forty-niner brigades, military columns, handcart processions, the Pony Express, the Overland Stage, and the transcontinental telegraph. The Donner-Reed Party was the third emigrant wagon party to pass through the canyon.<br /> <br /> Today Echo Canyon is still a busy transportation corridor, occupied by I-80, the Union Pacific Railroad, a segment of the Old Lincoln Highway (the nation’s first coast-to-coast automobile highway), and modern communications and utility lines. More than 160 years of development have altered the canyon, but fascinating traces of 19th century uses still are visible.<br /> <br /> As you enter I-80, look ahead and to the right toward the bare rampart of Castle Rock, an emigrant landmark near the head of Echo Canyon. The Mormon pioneer company headed by Brigham Young, who had taken ill with a tickborne infection, camped near here on July 14, 1847.

The Oregon and California trails, along with several others, converged here to cross the river. Seeing a great business opportunity, in 1852 Francis Marshall moved to Marysville from Missouri with the purpose of establishing a ferry on the Big Blue. On a knoll a short distance from the river, Marshall built his base of operations. He then constructed a rope ferry across the river and charged up to $5.00 per wagon to use it. The ferry was very popular- at times, thousands of emigrants would be camped here, waiting for days for their turn to cross.

The first wagons, belonging to the Donner-Reed Party, crossed this divide in 1846, followed in 1847 by Brigham Young's vanguard party of Mormon pioneers. Imagine those emigrants' despair upon reaching this spot and seeing the jagged, blue-gray peaks of the Wasatch Mountains on the horizon ahead. From here, both wagon companies had to grub a rough track over divides and mountains and down a series of willow-packed canyons and creek bottoms in order to reach the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. The effort cost the Donner-Reed party 13 days, one of a series of troubles that caused the group to be trapped by blizzards in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Utah Highway 65, about 5.5 miles southwest of Henefer, Utah)<br /> Hastings Cutoff and Mormon Trail Wagon Ruts at Hogsback Summit (southwest of Henefer), marked by white fiberglass trail posts, are clearly visible along the right side of the road beyond the fence line at the Summit and Morgan County boundary.

Modern historians have dubbed this summit \"Heartbreak Ridge\" to describe the feelings of many early Mormon Pioneers who crested this ridge. After months on the trail, traveling over 1,200 weary miles, it was heart- wrenching to discover that the most difficult part of the journey still lay ahead. Some people must have broken down and wept. Others gritted their teeth with determination and moved southwest down off Hogsback Summit to challenge the mountains and canyons that lay ahead.</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“...arrived [July 19] on the suummit of the dividing ridge and put a guide hard up, \"80 miles to Fort Bridger\"...

The original wooden structure was replaced by a brick building in 1888, but some of the original posts and beams were reused.<br /> <br /> In 1950, the Goetz Foundation restored the building to its 1888 brick appearance and established a museum dedicated to the Pony Express, the Pony Express National Memorial. <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (914 Penn St, Saint Joseph, MO 64503)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.ponyexpress.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

President Dwight D. Eisenhower agreed to be the honorary Chairman of the organization. Waddell F. Smith, grandson of one of the Pony Express' founders William Bradford Waddell, was elected President of the Centennial Association. <br /> <br /> The National Pony Express Centennial Association organized a re-ride of the route of the Pony Express, with 500 riders traveling both directions between Sacramento and St. Joseph from July 19th through 28th of 1960. President Eisenhower sent letters in the mochila to each of the governors in the eight trail states. A special commemorative stamp was issued and placed on these envelopes. These stamps carried the date of July 19, 1960, the starting date of the re-ride and had a special cancellation stating Russell, Majors and Waddell as founders, owners and operators.<br /> <br /> Besides the commemorative re-ride, commemorative letters and envelopes were carried across the trail. The U.S. Mint created two large Centennial Medals, a Founders Medal, and a Termination Medal. One thousand Colt Special Edition Centennial Revolvers were produced and sold to riders. The remaining funds were used to mark trail sites with memorials like the one found here, just outside the entrance to the Scotts Bluff National Monument Visitor Center. ",

From St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California the Pony Express could deliver a letter faster than ever before.<br /> In operation for only 18 months between April 1860 and October 1861, the Pony Express nevertheless has become synonymous with the Old West. In the era before electronic communication, the Pony Express was the thread that tied East to West.</p> <p>As a result of the 1849 Gold Rush, the 1847 Mormon exodus to Utah and the thousands who moved west on the Oregon Trail starting in the 1840s, the need for a fast mail service beyond the Rocky Mountains became obvious. This need was partially filled by outfits such as the Butterfield Overland Mail Service starting in 1857 and private carriers in following years.</p> <p>But when postmaster general Joseph Holt scaled back overland mail service to California and the central region of the country in 1858, an even greater need for mail arose. The creation of the Leavenworth & Pike's Peak Express Company by William H. Russell, Alexander Majors and William B. Waddell became the answer. It was later known as the Pony Express.</p> <aside> <blockquote> <p><strong>Ad in the Sacramento Union, March 19, 1860</strong></p> <p>\"Men Wanted\"<br /> The undersigned wishes to hire ten or a dozen men, familiar with the management of horses, as hostlers, or riders on the Overland Express Route via Salt Lake City. Wages $50 per month and found.</p> </blockquote> </aside>   <p>On June 16, 1860, about ten weeks after the Pony Express began operations, Congress authorized the a bill instructing the Secretary of the Treasury to subsidize the building of a transcontinental telegraph line to connect the Missouri River and the Pacific Coast.</p> <p>The passage of the bill resulted in the incorporation of the Overland Telegraph Company of California and the Pacific Telegraph Company of Nebraska. While the lines were under construction the Pony Express operated as usual. Letters and newspapers were carried the entire length of the line from St. Joseph to Sacramento, but telegrams were carried only between the rapidly advancing wire ends.</p> <p>On October 26, 1861, San Francisco was in direct contact with New York City. On that day the Pony Express was officially terminated, but it was not until November that the last letters completed their journey over the route.<br /> Most of the original trail has been obliterated either by time or human activities. Along many segments, the trail's actual route and exact length are matters of conjecture. In the western states, the majority of the trail has been converted, over the years, to double track dirt roads. Short pristine segments, believed to be traces of the original trail, can be seen only in Utah and California. However, approximately 120 historic sites may eventually be available to the public, including 50 existing Pony Express stations or station ruins.</p> <p><br /> <strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

A plaque, located near the entrance of the Tribune Building a few doors north of the monument, lists Utah Pony Express riders and superintendents. The Tribune Building stands at the former site of Salt Lake House, a historic hotel where many notable travelers, including Mark Twain and Sir Richard Burton, stayed while visiting Salt Lake City on their way to California. Because the daughter of a Pony Express rider stated that her father had slept at Salt Lake House, the hotel long was assumed to have been a Pony Express home station. However, recent research has determined that the mail station originally was directly across the street from the hotel. After several months of use, the station was relocated a block north.<br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Site Information</span></p> <p><b>Location</b> (163 South Main Street, Salt Lake City, Utah)</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/mormon-pioneer-trail-salt-lake-city-itinerary.htm\">Mormon Pioneer Trail: Salt Lake City Itinerary</a></h2> <p>This site is on the Salt Lake City Itinerary.

The station-house was no unfit object in such a scene, roofless and chairless, filthy and squalid, with a smoky fire in one corner, and a table in the centre of an impure floor, the walls open to every wind, and the interior full of dust.\" - Sir Richard Burton, 1862</p> </blockquote>   <p>No two Pony Express stations are identical. They were built in a variety of ways using the resources found at each station's location. To know what one now in ruin used to look like, two items are used- descriptions written when the building was intact and items discovered during archeological surveys. Having both provides the best guess about a station's appearance and the activities of the people who lived in them.<br /> <br /> Sir Richard Burton, traveling by stagecoach, visited Sand Springs Station in 1862. The above quote is his description of the station. In the years afterwards, Sand Springs was buried by the sand. It was not re-discovered until 1976, when an archeological team found the ruins. The team surveyed the station as they unburied it and discovered numerous artifacts. But overall, the items did not sync with Burton's description. And the ruins did not match records showing Sand Springs was a Pony Express relay station- the building is twice the size of the average one!<br /> <br /> The mystery was answered when the 1976 survey items were evaluated. One discovery was the ruins seen today are for a building that was constructed in three different phases. Importantly, a close look at room #4 reveals it is not attached to the structure- it was added after the original station was built. This room is half of the building; when added, it created a building twice the size of the Pony Express relay station. The survey also found telegraph insulators, resister wire, ox shoes, wagon parts, and a ceramic item made in 1896. Together, they solve the Sand Spring's mystery. The ruins are from a Pony Express relay station, and from an overland stage station, a telegraph station, and the home and corral of two prospectors. 50 years of history in remote western Nevada is found in the ruins.<br /> <br /> Sand Springs Station is a National Park Service Vanishing Treasure.

At first, emigrants had to take a detour south and use Robidoux Pass, a natural gateway, to get through the bluffs. This mostly stopped in 1850 when a new route was opened at Mitchell Pass. Located close to the North Platte River, this route saved emigrants nearly 15 miles of travel. The route, though, was narrow, due to the land's geography. As such, more than 300,000 emigrants, and their wagons and livestock, had to travel on the same strip of land. Eventually, deep ruts formed as a result of this traffic. These ruts are still visible today and are now a part of Scotts Bluff National Monument.

It opened the West to settlement by providing a route over the Continental Divide that wagons could negotiate. Everyone who followed the Oregon Trail through Wyoming used this sagebrush and grass covered saddle. A wide and deep path was created as thousands of wagon wheels and livestock hooves steadily eroded the ground. The Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historic Trails passed through here.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>On July 12, 1846, Edwin Bryant made his way</p> <blockquote> <p>\"up a very gentle ascent to the south pass of the Rocky Mountains, or the dividing ridge separating the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific. The ascent to the Pass is so gradual, that but for our geographical knowledge . . . we should not have been conscious that we had ascended to, and were standing upon the summit of the Rocky Mountains-the backbone . . . of the North American Continent.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (From South Pass Rest Area, go south on Wyoming Highway 28 for 0.9 miles to reach Oregon Buttes Road (Fremont County 445). Turn left (southeast) onto this well-maintained dirt road. Drive 2.8 miles, slowing where the road begins curving to the right. Turn right (west) onto the two-track road that begins near the curve and drive 0.8 miles.)</p> <p>South Pass National Historic Landmark, which is managed by the Bureau of Land Management, preserves these still visible ruts. The landmark is free and open to the public. Amenities are scarce; only a few monuments and signs mark the South Pass crossing. Roads in the landmark are all unpaved, but the main ones are maintained, gravel roads suitable for most vehicles when dry.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.wyohistory.org/field-trips/south-pass-and-its-monuments\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Thousands of emigrants passed this way during the peak emigration years of the 1850s. Hundreds died of disease, principally of Asiatic cholera. It is believed that a grave near here is of one such victim. Of all those who died, only a few graves are known. On August 3, 1859, a surveyor noted the grave and its marker: Memory of Susan O. Hail of Lafayette County, Missouri Who died June 2, 1852 Age 34 Yrs. 5 months 12 days. That marker, since destroyed, was of polished workmanship, unlike most trail gravestones. It is said her husband returned to Missouri, had the stone made, and brought it to this spot on the prairie.

Mormon tradition holds that when Brigham Young first gazed on the valley from this vicinity on July 24, 1847, he experienced a heavenly vision that led him to declare, “It is enough. This is the right place.” Inside the 450-acre park is the National Pony Express Monument with a replica Pony Express station, a dramatic Avard Fairbanks sculpture of a relay rider changing horses, and several interpretive wayside exhibits. Statuary Walk east of the Pony Express monument includes other sculptures and the 60-foot high This Is the Place Monument, with bronze figures of Brigham Young and other early church leaders.<br /> <br /> Around the monument base are <em>bas relief </em>depictions of significant figures in Utah history. Beyond the nearby visitor center is Heritage Village, a reconstructed village of original pioneer-era buildings where costumed docents and historical interpreters share history and demonstrate early crafts and trades. Young visitors can ride ponies and trains, make crafts, and pet farm animals here.<br /> <br /> This Is the Place Heritage Park, near the location where Brigham Young first surveyed the valley in July 1847, represents the Mormon arrival. But as the City of the Saints grew from a rustic frontier village to a bustling territorial capital, many California-bound travelers paused here for a layover to rest, re-supply, or spend the winter — or, as in the case of English adventurer Sir Richard Burton, to satisfy their curiosity about Brigham Young and the Mormons.

Located about 1,400 air miles southwest of Anchorage, Adak Naval Base remained active until the late 1990s. It is one of eight National Historic Landmarks in Alaska that was designated to commemorate the World War II in Alaska.</p> <h4>Attacks on American Soil</h4> <p>When the Japanese bombed Unalaska Island and invaded Attu and Kiska islands in June 1942, American defenses in the Aleutians consisted of an army and naval base at Unalaska and an army airfield on nearby Umnak Island, both 700 miles east of Kiska. Although bombers could reach Kiska, they could not be escorted by shorter-range fighters. The need for an Aleutian advance base further west became urgent. Establishing a base on Adak, about 250 miles from Kiska, allowed U.S. forces to mount a successful offensive against the two Japanese-held islands. Construction began on September 1, 1942 and was completed by the end of 1943 with the first bombers carrying out missions from the base on September 14, 1942.</p> <p>As the most westerly American base Adak allowed for intensified bombing (with fighter plane protection) of the Japanese garrisons. As the most westerly naval operations base from the fall of 1942 to the end of the campaign, it provided support to the ships and submarines of the North Pacific Force in their fight against the enemy in northern waters. Its excellent harbor provided shelter for the assembly of a large task force for the assault on Kiska. And its rugged tundra-covered terrain and fierce weather provided ideal conditions for training the Allied invasion force in amphibious warfare in the Aleutians. Had a northern invasion of Japan's Home Islands occurred, as was once proposed, Adak's Reserve Depot would have provided the essential materiel for such an undertaking.</p> <p>Attu, Kiska, and much of Adak are part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 1913.</p> <h4>Learn More About WWII in Alaska</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/wwii-nhl-aleu-campaign.htm\">World War II had a major impact on Alaska</a>.

It is one of eight National Historic Landmarks in Alaska that was designated to commemorate the World War II in Alaska.</p> <p>Despite significant successes throughout the first half of 1942, the Japanese realized that they could not fight a protracted war against the United States’ industrial might. By destroying the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Midway and establishing bases on Midway and in the Aleutians, along with Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia Islands, the Japanese hoped to establish control over the western Pacific. In doing this they hoped to be able to negotiate a peace treaty with the United States. The coordinated attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Midway, along with the Japanese occupation of Attu and Kiska in June 1942 marked the peak of Japan's military expansion in the Pacific. Americans, believing that the occupation of Attu and Kiska Islands was the pretext for an invasion of the United States, were greatly alarmed. For Japan, after suffering a disastrous defeat at Midway, it was the only positive result of their plan.</p> <h4>Recapturing Attu Island</h4> <p>For Americans, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/attu-battlefield-and-us-army-and-navy-airfields-on-attu.htm\">the recapture of Attu</a> was an important morale booster because they had little to cheer about at that time. The battle was significant in that it demonstrated the worthiness of the American soldier against his enemy and it illustrated the loyalty of the Japanese soldier to his cause. In terms of numbers engaged, Attu ranks as one of the most costly battles in the Pacific. In terms of Japanese killed, the cost of taking Attu was second only to lwo Jima with only 29 out of 2,250 soldiers surviving the battle. Of nearly 3800 American soldiers, 549 were killed in the battle. Mistakes made and lessons learned in amphibious landings, tactics, and logistical planning made significant contributions to future U.S. Pacific operations. Post-battle bombing raids on Japanese territory from Attu tied up significant numbers of Japanese defense forces and demonstrated that the Home Islands were not safe from air attack and, possibly, invasion from the north.</p> <p>Attu, Kiska, and much of Adak are part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 1913.</p> <h4>Learn More About WWII in Alaska</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/wwii-nhl-aleu-campaign.htm\">World War II had a major impact on Alaska</a>.

Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears, U.S. Army is one of eight historic landmarks that commemorate World War II in Alaska.</p> <h2>Details on Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears</h2> <p>Commissioned in September 1941, Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears were the first bases the Japanese attacked during the Aleutian campaign. The US Navy’s first military installation on Amaknak Island was a radio station complex built in 1911, but it wasn’t until 1940 that the military bought land and started construction on the Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base (NOB) and Fort Mears. Initial construction was done by civilians from the Siems-Drake-Puget Sound Construction Company, but after they were evacuated in June 1942, the Navy Seabees took over.<br /> <br /> At its peak operation, there were over 5,600 Navy personnel and almost 10,000 Army personnel stationed on side-by-side Amaknak and Unalaska Islands. The NOB provided a naval air station and a deep-water port. Both the NOB and Fort Mears were designed by Michigan architect Albert Khan. Fort Mears was located on Margaret Bay.  </p> <h3>Housing</h3> <p>Housing was predominantly two-story dormitories which housed 63 men each, built in the standard quartermaster plans (700 series). The buildings were modified to accommodate drying rooms, arctic entries, and blackout windows. Additional civilian contractors were housed in the refurbished 1889 freight and passenger ship, <i><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aleu/learn/historyculture/upload/3-SHELTERED-SEAS-508-final.pdf\">SS Northwestern</a>,</i> beached for easy access. It also provided power, even after it was bombed by the Japanese on June 3, 1942, until the powerstation was completed.<br /> <br /> After the bombing, military planners began housing people in small, randomly dispersed cabanas, Quonset huts, and Pacific huts to be less of a target for enemy attacks. Existing white barracks (and other buildings in the main grid of buildings) were camouflaged with olive-drab paint, nets on the roof, and rubbing the exterior with mud and water. Additional buildings were set into hillsides and covered with sod.<br /> <br /> According to the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), “Pacific Huts were erected extensively on Alaskan military bases during the peak years of wartime construction (1942-43). Used by both the army and the navy, they proved to be ideal as they were lightweight, easily assembled, and impervious to wind and water. … Modeled after the Quonset Hut, the Pacific Hut was made of prefabricated laminated wood sections, using forest products instead of critical materials such as steel.”</p> <h3>Other Buildings</h3> <p>Socializing, entertainment, and recreation took place in mess halls, theaters, officers' and enlisted men’s clubs, recreation halls, and beer halls. United Service Organizations (USO) entertainers sometimes performed with the 206<sup>th</sup> Coast Artillery Band, stationed in Dutch Harbor. Other times, individual comedians, actors, or musicians performed on stage. These acts were to promote troop morale, which could be low in the cold, windy, dangerous Aleutian Islands. Famous actors, comedians, and singers including Joe E. Brown, Bob Hope, Frances Langford, and Olivia de Haviland all visited the Aleutian Islands. Other USO entertainers probably also visited the remote island chain.<br /> <br /> Chapels and military chaplains offered solace to soldiers and sailors, while morgues and cemeteries housed the dead. Other buildings included warehouses, repair shops, ammunition storage and magazines, bunkers, powerhouse, hospitals, command posts, administrative buildings, training buildings, post offices, radio buildings, hangars, and others.<br /> <br /> After the war and decommissioning of Fort Mears and the NOB, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aleu/learn/historyculture/removal-maps.htm\">returned local residents</a> repurposed abandoned building material, canned goods, clothes, and even ammunition. The building material was useful in repairing war damage (and looting) to their homes, churches, and other buildings. In the late 1980s, most of the remaining military buildings were demolished, as part of a remediation effort by the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p> <ul> <li>For detailed information on individual buildings, check out the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tripideas/aleu-driving-guide.htm\">driving guides.</a></li> <li>Explore the photo galleries below to see what Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears looked like during World War II.</li> <li>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=location%3Aunalaska&st=image&c=50\">Library of Congress’s collection of HABS and Office of the Quartermaster General photographs</a>, documenting many of the Dutch Harbor World War II structures before they were demolished in the 1980s.</li> </ul> <h2>Learn More About WWII in Alaska</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/wwii-nhl-aleu-campaign.htm\">World War II had a major impact on Alaska</a>.

It was built to provide air defense for the Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears at Dutch Harbor located 65 miles to the east. On June 3 and 4, 1942, U.S. Army pursuit planes took off from Fort Glenn to surprise and fight Japanese bombers returning from their attack on Dutch Harbor. In July and August 1942, after the Japanese invasion of Kiska and Attu Islands, U.S. bombers left from Fort Glenn to launch bombing missions over Kiska and Attu.</p> <p>Original plans for Fort Glenn's airfield called for construction of three runways measuring 5000 feet by 175 feet, support facilities, and quarters for 121 officers and 2,491 enlisted men. Within a year troop capacity for the air base, garrison, and harbor facilities was increased to 11,982 persons, peaking at approximately 13,000 in April 1943. While the flatness of the terrain was ideal for an airfield, one of the greatest drawbacks affecting all the airfields in the Aleutians was the unforgiving wind patterns called williwaws. Fort Glenn served as a proving ground for early problems of airstrip construction on unstable Aleutian tundra.

At 897 feet above sea level the fort is the highest coastal battery constructed along the coast of the United States. The fort was constructed in 1940 to protect the Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base from a seaborne invasion fleet. The June 1942 attack on Dutch Harbor prompted an upgrade of the fort that was completed by early 1944. At full development Fort Schwatka had over 100 structures supporting the soldiers of the two coast artillery units that manned the cannons and antiaircraft guns. Barracks, storehouses, a recreation center, officers club, quonset huts, latrines, administration, and support buildings all served the needs of an estimated 250 soldiers stationed on this lonely mountain.<br /> <br /> Battery 402 was the center point for the “iron ring” defense of Dutch Harbor – a series of strategically placed defense installations and observation posts along the coastlines of Amaknak and Unalaska Islands. Anti-submarine netting stretched across Iliuliuk and Captains Bay backed up the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aleu/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">“Iron Ring.\"</a> (Fort Learnard and Battery 298 were the other large fortifications.) Smaller installations were constructed at Hill 400 on Amaknak Island, Fort Brumback in Summer Bay, Hog Island in Unalaska Bay and Fort Mears Garrisons in Unalaska Valley provided additional strength.<br /> <br /> Engineers designed the structures here to withstand bomb blasts, earthquakes, and gale force winds. Today, many of the structures of Fort Schwatka have collapsed, but the gun mounts and lookouts are among the most intact in the entire United States.<br /> <br /> Fort Schwatka was largely abandoned by 1948 and in 1950 the Coast Artillery was abolished as separate branch of Army. Coastal defenses are part of a by-gone era – remnants of the general thinking by the public, Congress, the military about national defense that existed prior to World War II. After World War II, radical new forms of weaponry – jet aircraft, nuclear bombs and guided missiles – as well as our greater vulnerability to attack anywhere in the nation made these structures obsolete. The thin strip of protection along the nation’s shores would no longer suffice.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aleu/planyourvisit/upload/Fort-Schwatka-Self-Guided-Booklet-08-06-07-508-v2.pdf\">Download the free Fort Schwatka Self-Guided Tour</a> (accessible PDF, 25.8 MB) to learn more. <br /> <br /> Looking for other things to do around Fort Schwatka?

Japanese military leaders mistakenly believed that the April 18, 1942 Doolittle Raid was launched either from Midway or the Aleutians. By taking and establishing bases on Midway and in the Aleutians they believed that they could prevent further attacks and establish control over the north and central Pacific.  </p> <p>The initial Japanese landing took place on June 7, 1942, when the Third Special Landing Force (550 Japanese naval men) stormed ashore. Over the next few months, additional units arrived and the occupation force eventually grew to about 5,640 military and 1,170 civilians. Despite this sizeable force, it was not sufficient to construct an airfield, roads, living quarters, and defenses, all at the same time. During the fourteen-month occupation, the Japanese came under increasing American air and naval attacks. One day after their landing, June 8, 1942, an American patrol plane discovered the enemy's ships in Kiska Harbor. Three days later, ten bombers flew from Umnak airfield, to attack Kiska for the first time. From then on, Eleventh Air Force planes bombed Kiska regularly despite cloud cover and fog. American submarines and surface vessels added punishment to Japanese attempts to reinforce and protect Kiska. As early as July 5, 1942, American submarines torpedoed three Japanese destroyers at the entrance to Kiska Harbor, sinking one and severely damaging the others.</p> <h4><br /> Japan Withdraws from Alaska</h4> <p>With the fall of Attu on May 30, 1943, and the virtual cutoff from the Home Islands the Japanese began planning \"Operation KE\" for evacuation of Kiska. On July 28, 1943 under cover of fog two cruisers and six destroyers dropped anchor in Kiska Harbor in early afternoon. The garrison was ready, having destroyed or booby-trapped weapons, equipment, and supplies. As if on cue, the fog lifted within the harbor and in only fifty minutes, 5,183 men boarded the ships and they headed home. The vital airfield was still incomplete when the Japanese withdrew from Kiska. This withdrawal caused the utmost embarrassment to the United States when, eighteen days later, a huge Allied force of 34,000 men invaded the deserted island. The event was best summed up by the army's commanding general in Alaska, Simon B. Buckner, who said, \"To attract maximum attention, it's hard to find anything more effective than a great big, juicy, expensive mistake.”</p> <p>Attu, Kiska, and much of Adak are part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 1913.</p> <h4><br /> Learn More About WWII in Alaska</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/wwii-nhl-aleu-campaign.htm\">World War II had a major impact on Alaska</a>.

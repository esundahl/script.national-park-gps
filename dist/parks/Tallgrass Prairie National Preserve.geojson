One-room schoolhouses would soon spread across the West as settlers established themselves, believing that only through education and knowledge could a child one day fully participate in American society. The school was operational from 1882 to 1930 and was attended by nearby children. School attendance ranged from 3 to 19 students with all eight grades.<br /> <br /> School is located one mile north of the visitor center and is accessible by car. Turn left out of the visitor center parking lot and travel north on K-177 for one mile, going beyond the school. Make a left turn onto the gravel access road that makes its way to the school. Be careful, as the turn is on a curve. The building is open during the main visitor season from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., but the interior is still viewable through the windows.",

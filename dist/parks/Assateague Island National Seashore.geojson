Recreating at Assateague Island is a great way to connect with nature and enjoy the unspoiled beach. While hanging out at the beach is relaxing, don’t get too relaxed about safety. Check out a Surf Rescue demonstration, Monday, Wednesday, or Friday at 10 am to watch how lifeguards respond to a variety of safety hazards and emergencies.<br /> North Beach is accessible from the first parking lot to the left after entering through the fee booths and is lifeguarded seasonally. North Beach Crossover #3 (by the Snack Shack) will take you directly to the center of the lifeguarded beach. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/asis/planyourvisit/surf-and-beach-safety.htm\">Beach and Surf Safety page</a> for this season’s lifeguard schedule.  <br /> <br /> <b>Fun with Flags:</b>When you recreate within the lifeguarded beach, you will notice a variety of flags flying on the boundaries or from the lifeguard tower. These flags are serving not only to designate boundaries, but also to communicate potential hazards. Learn below what each flag stands for.Yellow with black circle flags are permanently placed 50 yards beyond the lifeguard area and represent a safety zone. No fishing, rigid craft, no open beach fires and no dogs permitted between these flags.   <ul> <li>Red over yellow flags represents the area supervised by lifeguards. For safety, recreate within the boundaries of these flags.</li> <li>A solid yellow flag indicates a moderate warning for surf conditions. Caution should be exercised.</li> <li>A red flag indicates a high hazard exists such as strong surf and seaward currents.</li> <li>Double red flags indicate a severe hazard and a closure is in effect. Visitors will be kept out of the water until the hazard subsides.</li> <li>A purple flag indicates potentially dangerous marine organisms such as stinging jellyfish are present. </li> </ul> For more information, check out our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/asis/planyourvisit/surf-and-beach-safety.htm\">Beach and Surf Safety page.</a> <p> </p>",

Swimming off the beach of Assateague Island is a great way to experience the beauty of the Atlantic Ocean. The conditions at the beach and in the ocean vary daily and it is important to be aware of any potential safety precautions before going for a swim.<br /> The lifeguard supervised beach is designated by two red over yellow flags: one indicating the south boundary and one indicating the north boundary. No floats are permitted in the lifeguarded beach except for Coast Guard approved life jackets. Fifty yards beyond each of the lifeguard flags are yellow flags with a black circle in the middle. These flags designate a protected beach area. This area is designated as swimming only. No fishing, surfing, rigid crafts or contained fires are permitted within this boundary.<br /> In the Virginia district of Assateague Island, the beach in front of parking lot #2 is seasonally lifeguarded. Check our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/asis/planyourvisit/surf-and-beach-safety.htm\">Beach and Surf Safety page</a> for this season’s lifeguard schedule, beach flag definitions and other safety tips.<br /> <br /> <b>Don’t let your dip turn into a drift:</b><br /> Often swimmers have entered the water in front of their beach towel and when they exit find themselves yards down the beach from their belongings of family. How does this happen?<br /> Barrier islands and oceans are in a constant state of change. One contributing variable to daily conditions at the beach is current. A “littoral” or “longshore” current is one that is traveling either north to south, or south to north along the beach front. The direction and speed of this current can be influenced by wind direction and speed. When we enter the water and float, tread water or ride the waves in, we are unknowingly being pulled north or south due to this longshore current. Lifeguards post the direction and speed of this current daily on their operations board by the lifeguard stand.<br /> To avoid being swept down the beach, use a distinct marker on the beach you can see from the water. Frequently look back for your marker and relocate yourself accordingly.",

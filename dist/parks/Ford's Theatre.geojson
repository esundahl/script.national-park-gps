        "name": "Murder Bay, Washington, DC",
        "notes": "Murder Bay, Washington, DC\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/murder-bay-washington-dc.htm\n\nBetween 15th and 12th Street on the south side of Pennsylvania Avenue, once stood a neighborhood in Washington DC which by the 1850s had a very poor reputation. It’s not hard to imagine why - the smell would have been horrendous. Only three blocks south, on what is now Constitution Avenue, was the Washington City canal. Originally built for commerce, by the Civil War the canal had been abandoned and was informally used as a city sewer. Everything was thrown in, from dead animals to waste. In 1863, the Secretary of the Interior called it \"a shallow, open sewer, of about one hundred and fifty feet in width, (sometimes called a canal,) which stretches its filthy surface through the heart of the city.” With so many in DC temporarily here for the war effort, this undesirable area became home to saloons, gambling establishments, and brothels for those seeking diversions. Was this why the neighborhood was nicknamed Murder Bay by some? We may never know. But while the area was unsanitary, overcrowded, and unpleasant, many people did live here, by desperation or necessity. The Civil War more than doubled the number of those living in the city and notably included formerly enslaved African Americans seeking freedom, who were legally referred to as contraband. The military argued that since the Confederacy called them property, the Union Army had the right to seize and hire them. Many so-called contrabands moved into DC in the time leading up to the Emancipation Proclamation, and were paid to build many of the fortifications around the city. Looking for places to live, in a city undergoing a housing crisis, they established contraband camps north of the White House and here along the canal. They were joined in this area by others who found themselves in difficult circumstances.  Life was difficult for these men, women, and children who lived here, and they suffered from impoverished conditions, disease, and crime. For those living here, why did they seek refuge in such horrible conditions? We will never know. They had the greater goal, though, of seeking freedom which they achieved on April 16, 1862, when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act that freed those enslaved in the District of Columbia. While they gained this freedom, they suffered from hardships that others in the city did not face.",

        "notes": "National Theatre, Washington, DC\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/national-theatre-washington-dc.htm\n\nThe current building was finished in the 1920s and is the sixth theater on this spot. The first National Theatre was built here in 1835, but less than 10 years later it burned down. Theaters were notorious firetraps at the time, and many burned. It was rebuilt only to burn down again in the late 1850s, after which it remained vacant for over five years.At the start of the Civil War, as the National was being rebuilt, there were only two theatres in the capital, the Washington Theatre and Canterbury Hall. Canterbury Hall was a variety theater, which would later become vaudeville. Opening its doors in 1804, the Washington Theatre was the oldest theatre in DC, situated on the corner of 11<sup>th</sup> Street and Pennsylvania Avenue where the IRS building is today. During the first two years of the war, the Washington Theatre filled the entertainment void, as it was the only respectable theatre in town. On January 23, 1862, the Washington Theatre hosted President Abraham Lincoln and his wife Mary, where they saw an Italian opera. President Lincoln returned the following year in April to see a comedy with his son, Tad. Ironically, two weeks later, the actor John Wilkes Booth started leasing and managing the theatre. He continued to manage it for the next six months, before giving up his lease to the actress Laura Keene whose path he crossed again at Ford’s Theatre on April 14, 1865.By 1863, the Washington Theatre now had competition. On tenth street, John T. Ford had opened a new theater, Ford’s Theatre. Additionally, the National was finally finished, now called Grover’s Theatre for its manager, Leonard Grover. During the Civil War, this theatre became a place where the city residents escaped from the horrors of war. The three-story theater could hold over two thousand people. On the first floor and lower balcony, were the most expensive seats. The upper balcony were the cheap seats, set aside for the working class. Conveniently, Grovers provided them with a saloon. This third level, which was segregated, was likely the only option for African Americans seeking entertainment. Grover’s was also a favorite spot for the Lincoln family who attended numerous plays at the theater. On April 14, 1865, Tad Lincoln was here watching Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp when he learned the horrible news that his father had been shot at Ford’s Theatre.",

        "notes": "Willard Hotel, Washington DC\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/willard-hotel-washington-dc.htm\n\n<p>American author <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sama/learn/historyculture/hawthorne.htm\">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a> observed in the 1860s that \"the Willard Hotel more justly could be called the center of Washington than either the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/us-capitol.htm\">Capitol</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whho/index.htm\">White House</a> or the State Department.\" From 1847 when the enterprising Willard brothers, Henry and Edwin, first set up as innkeepers on the corner of 14th Street and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/paav/index.htm\">Pennsylvania Avenue</a>, the Willard has occupied a unique niche in the history of Washington and the nation.<br /> <br /> The site upon which the Willard stands was originally part of the farm of David Burnes. In 1816 John Tayloe built a row of six two-story-and-attic houses as an investment. By 1818 the corner was being used as a hotel. In 1847 Benjamin Ogle Tayloe leased the establishment to Henry A. Willard and his brother, Edwin. Edwin withdrew from the management, to be replaced by his brother Joseph C.Willard in 1849. In 1853 the brothers purchased the entire row of houses from Tayloe's heirs, uniting the buildings architecturally in a major remodeling. In 1858 the Willards expanded again, purchasing the property of Col. James Kearney on the southwest corner of 14th and F Streets. They demolished the Kearney Mansion and built a six-story addition to the hotel. Next an adjoining Presbyterian Church on F Street was acquired and converted to an auditorium known as Willard Hall. In succeeding years, as business increased, the roofs of the conglomerate hotel were raised to allow for vertical expansion. Finally, at the turn of the century, the Willard underwent a massive transformation.<br /> <br /> The new Willard, designed by New York architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh and erected by the George A. Fuller Company, was hailed at its opening as Washington's first skyscraper. Completed in 1904, the new building saw an addition of 100 rooms in 1925, broadening the F Street facade by about 49 feet. The property remained in the Willard family until 1946, closed in 1968, and underwent extensive renovation, again opening its doors in 1986.<br /> <br /> Presidents <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/zachary-taylor.htm\">Taylor</a>, Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Lincoln</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ulysses-s-grant.htm\">Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wiho/index.htm\">Taft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woodrow-wilson-prophet-of-peace-teaching-with-historic-places.htm\">Wilson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/moru/learn/historyculture/calvin-coolidge.htm\">Coolidge</a>, and Harding stayed at the Willard. Other notable guests have included Charles Dickens, Buffalo Bill, David Lloyd George, P.T. Barnum, Lord and Lady Napper and countless others. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/walt-whitman.htm\">Walt Whitman</a> included the Willard in his verses and Mark Twain wrote two books there in the early 1900s. It was Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, irritated at the Willard's high prices, who coined the phrase \"What this country needs is a good 5-cent cigar.\"<br /> <br /> The Willard Hotel is located at 1401-09 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 15, 1974 and is part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/paav/index.htm\">Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site</a>.</p>",

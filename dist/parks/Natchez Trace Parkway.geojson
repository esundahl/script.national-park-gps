One of the sections ran from Port Gibson toward Jackson, Mississippi but the route veered from the original Trace to reach Raymond in the spring of 1863. Federal Army General U.S. Grant marched his Union army over this route after crossing the Mississippi River and capturing Port Gibson, Mississippi.<br /> <br /> On May 8, 1863, Grant's forces drew fire from a Confederate brigade, commanded by Confederate Brigadier General John Gregg, located on the southern edge of Raymond, Mississippi three miles east of this location. After a day of bitter fighting the Confederates retreated toward Jackson, Mississippi leaving their wounded in the county courthouse. This convinced General Grant of the need to capture Jackson, Mississippi in order to assure success of his army's forthcoming siege of Vicksburg. ",

The settlers founded these missions to share their zeal for the Christian gospel with the local Choctaw population. In additions to bible studies, the missions’ agendas often included farming, carpentry, weaving, housekeeping, and the standard reading writing and arithmetic.The Choctaw story of creation includes that the Great Spirit molded the Choctaw people from the moist soil of Nanih Waiya, a mound located near Philadelphia, Mississippi.<br /> <br /> In the early 1800s, federal policy for the Choctaw Indians was that of Christian assimilation. Early nineteenth century Indian Agents such as John C. Calhoun and Thomas McKenney used Christian missionaries to mold indigenous people into what they felt was the model American society. While this policy aimed to negate the traditional beliefs of the Choctaw people, the tribes saw the benefits of learning reading, writing, and arithmetic, knowing these skills would aid them in doing business with the ever-increasing numbers of settlers.  <br /> <br /> Bethel Mission was a half mile northwest of the pull-off.",

        "notes": "Brashears Stand and Old Trace, Milepost 104.5\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/brashears-stand-and-old-trace.htm\n\nBrashears Stand is named after Turner Brashears, who moved to the area in the late 1700s. He became a trader with the Choctaw and learned their language.<br /> <br /> In 1806 Turner Brashears placed an advertisement in the Natchez newspaper about his stand labeling it “A house of Entertainment on the road leading from Natchez to Nashville.” Travelers on the Natchez Trace generally seemed to be pleased with their treatment and accommodations at Brashears Stand. In 1807 Reverend Jacob Young, a Methodist preacher, wrote “Near the line that divided the Choctaw Nation from the Mississippi Territory stood a fine public house kept by a man by the name of Brashears...He treated us very well but knew how to make a high bill.” In addition to earning money from his stand operation, Brashears prospered by selling land and enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are no remnants of Brashears Stand visible at the site.<br /> <br /> Brashears Stand is also a trailhead for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/walking-or-biking-the-chisha-foka-multi-use-trail.htm\">Chisha Foka Multi-Use Trail</a><br /> <br /> There is a boardwalk here that leads to the <a href=\"https://mscrafts.org/\">The Bill Waller Craft Center, Home of the Craftmen's Guild Of Mississippi.</a><br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional iformation.<br />  ",

Trace travelers no doubt talked about Levi's stand. It was nicer than most, and offered respite from the miles of footsteps that defined a Trace journey. Inns, or stands, provided occasional shelter for travelers along the Natchez Trace from the 1790s to the 1840s. These stands offered food to eat and food for thought: local news, information, and ideas. The ever-changing mix of diverse people – whites, American Indians, African Americans – interacted at the stands on a regular basis.<br /> <br /> It was Colbert's negotiating and language skills that sustained him as a tribal leader. Bilingual, with a Scottish father and Chickasaw Mother, he took advantage of the opportunities in both cultures. Across several decades, Colbert sat among the Chickasaw during treaty talks. Using his knowledge of both white and Chickasaw society, he protected both the Chickasaw homeland and his own interests. <br /> <br /> A dogged negotiator, at the time of his death in 1834, Colbert was trying to amend an 1832 treaty to gain better terms his the Chickasaw people.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are no remnants of Levi Colbert's stand visible at the site except for where the spring comes out of the ground. A short trail leads to the Buzzard Roost Spring where it is easy to picture how precious the small spring was to trace travelers. A short decent on steep steps will reveal a quiet haven set in a cool and shady glen, the perfect retreat for a hot summer day.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS.

Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.",

These mounds were created by American Indians in what was known as the Middle Woodland Period between 100 BCE-100 CE. The mounds range in height from 5-feet to 14-feet. <br /> <br /> Originally, there were six mounds at this site. However, in the 1940's five of them were excavated by National Park Service archeologists. The two largest mounds were rebuilt. These mounds acted as epicenters for ceremonial and religious activities for the American Indians who built them. Exotic trade goods and other artifacts were uncovered in the excavations which gives evidence to a vast and varying trade network throughout the southeast.<br /> <br /> Today, the spirit of Bynum Mounds remains strong. Over a span of 2,000 years, American Indian people have felt a powerful bond with this culturally significant site. Descendants of the mound builders, like the Chickasaw, still return here to their homeland to reconnect with their culture and ancestors. <br /> <br /> A paved accessible, 200-foot path loops around the site past the mounds, next to the forest, and through the interpretive shelter.<br />  ",

The Choctaw’s homeland (Chahta yakni aboha) included lands that became the states of Mississippi and Alabama, but the land was gradually ceded to the U.S. Government. The last cession was made in 1830, following the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek.<br /> <br /> Between 1807 until 1820 Silas Dinsmore held the job of Choctaw Agent. His job included representing the interests of the Choctaw while implementing U.S. policies. As part of his job, he checked passports, collected debts, insured that the Choctaw were paid for lands ceded to the United States, and taught farming methods. Because of the cessions of land, the Choctaw Agency had to move four times in order to remain within tribal boundaries. <br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/planyourvisit/chishafoka.htm\">Chisha Foka Multi-Use Trail</a> for additional information.",

Time means little in a forest, but a 15 minute adventure along this short trail will take you through the last days of a Tupelo-Bald Cypress swamp and into the first stage of a mixed hardwood bottomland forest. Water Tupelo thrives in lowlands and swamps because it can survive with its roots completely submerged underwater. The swollen base, called a buttress, helps support the tree. Bald Cypress, another swamp lover, is easily recognized by its knees. It was once thought these knees were breathing organs but it is now believed they merely give additional support to the towering tree. As the swamp is filled, other species of trees are able to survive and reproduce. Beech, hickory, red oak, chestnut oak, ash, elm and many others comprise the mixed hardwood forest that is taking over the area. Cole Creek will always be here but as the swamp fills in and the hardwood forest becomes established the creek will be more and more limited to its banks.

Built and used between the years 1200 C.E. (current era) and 1600 C.E., this 35-foot-high mound covers eight acres and measures 770 feet by 435 feet at its base. Two secondary mounds sit atop the primary mound, bringing the total height to approximately 60 feet. The larger one at the west end measures 190 feet by 160 feet by 30 feet high. Early records suggest there were six, smaller mounds located along the sides of the primary mound, but visual evidence of these smaller mounds has long since disappeared.<br /> <br /> <strong>Building the Mound</strong><br /> The builders of these flat-topped mounds are called Mississippians, named for the concentration of their villages and mounds in the Mississippi River Valley.<br /> <br /> Imagine groups of people walking with empty baskets, looking for the perfect location to collect soil for building the mounds. Once found, they may have used digging sticks or their own two hands to collect soil, load up their baskets, and walk back to their village. Baskets would have been emptied, soil stomped down, and the process repeated over and over again to create a mound that was 35 feet high. How many people, how many hours, days, or even years of labor were put into creating this mound?<br /> <br /> There are many mysteries that remain regarding mound construction.<br /> <br /> <strong>Social Significance of the Mounds</strong><br /> The villages of the Mississippians are marked by flat-topped earthen mounds that are scattered throughout the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. Sometimes a single large mound dominated the village or ceremonial center. More often, the mounds were arranged around a rectangular plaza. At Emerald Mound, however, the village ceremonial center was on top of the mound. There is evidence of a village site near the mound that was destroyed by cultivation. <br /> <br /> The mounds of the Mississippians were used for burials, temples and ceremonial structures. Archeologists believe the mounds were the setting for elaborate civic processions, ceremonial dances, and intricate and solemn religious rituals.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

        "notes": "French Camp, Milepost 180.7\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/french-camp.htm\n\nLouis LeFleur first traded with the Choctaws at a bluff now part of Jackson, Mississippi. About 1812, he established his stand 900 feet to the northeast on the Natchez Trace.<br /> <br /> Because of the LeFleur's nationality, the area was often called \"French Camp,\" a name retained by the present village.<br /> <br /> LeFleur married a Choctaw woman. Their famous son who changed his name to Greenwood Leflore, became a Choctaw chief and a Mississippi State Senator. Named after him are the city of Greenwood and the county of Leflore.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were there stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River, so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land, many American Indian nations did, including the Chickasaw and Choctaw. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time, stands generally bore the last name of the owners.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> Just off the Natchez Trace Parkway you can visit our friends at the <a href=\"https://www.frenchcamphistoricvillage.com/\">French Camp Historic Village</a> and discover how early American life used to be in this quaint log cabin village.",

        "notes": "Gordon House Historic Site, Milepost 407.7\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/gordon-house-historic-site.htm\n\nSomewhat stark and a little imposing, the Gordon House you see today masks the welcome it once gave to travelers and locals alike. The brick home of Captain John Gordon and his family, built in 1818, was one of the more impressive homes in the area. It was a landmark for travelers of the Old Trace, letting them know that soon they would be in Nashville, Tennessee, where simple human comforts could be found after weeks of walking on a well-traveled but rustic trail. The Gordon family called it home, but it was a business as well. A ferry provided a safe way for travelers and locals alike to cross the Duck River, and the grounds provided boatmen on their way home a place to sleep for the night.<br /> <br /> In the early 1800s, this site was just inside Chickasaw Territory, and any business needed a Chickasaw representative. In 1802, a partnership formed between Gordon and Chickasaw Chief William Colbert. <br /> <br /> <strong>Building the Gordon House</strong><br /> While Gordon was away again in 1818, Dolly maintained the home front. Gordon did, however, send her instructions at least once on how their new house should be built.<br /> <br /> “The windows to be placed on each side of the front door of the large room, and on the right of the door of the small room… The rest I leave with yourself.” <em>Letter from John Gordon to Dolly Gordon</em>, 1818.<br /> <br /> The house layout was typical for the time—a Federal-style, modified hall-and-parlor plan—but the brick from which it was made created one of the most elegant homes on the Tennessee frontier.<br /> <br /> <strong>If We Could See Inside</strong><br /> Even though you cannot enter the Gordon House today due to safety concerns, you can imagine a large, vibrant family filling the home. If we could pull back the curtains, we may see a well-worn floor from children playing. Through one front door, you may imagine seeing the family gathered around the fireplace—a room where many daily activities took place. The narrow staircase leads upstairs to two bedrooms. Through the other front door, you would see the formal parlor, where guests would visit during the day, or where people would sleep at night.<br /> <br /> The Gordon House was not the only building on the land, as you see today. An exterior kitchen, a smokehouse, barns, coops, and servant’s quarters are all possible buildings that filled the 1,515 acre site.<br /> <br /> <strong>From Family Home to Historic Site</strong><br /> Shortly after the Gordon House was completed, travel on the Old Trace started to slow down and almost came to a stop. The stand and trading post were no longer necessary, but the ferry remained operational for almost 100 years due to the high use by local residents. It was not until 1896, when a bridge was built over the Duck River, that the ferry was abandoned.<br /> <br /> When John Gordon died of pneumonia in 1819, Dolly continued to run the farm with the help of her children and enslaved people. Cotton, cattle, and hogs all helped to support her family. At the time of her death at the age of 80, her son-in-law wrote, “She bore the burdens of their home, and was as brave and heroic as he.” She lived here until her death in 1859.<br /> <br /> The Gordon House had numerous owners before the National Park Service acquired the site in 1973. In 1974, the home was nominated and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The exterior was soon restored to its 1818 appearance, as you see it today.<br /> <br /> For more information on the Gordon house see<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/gordonhouse.htm\"> Gordon House: A Home on the Nathez Trace</a>.",

He was accompanied by Pernia and James Neelly’s, the US Indian agent to the Chickasaw, enslaved servant. James Neelly remained farther south, looking for horses that had escaped the previous night. Lewis stayed in the cabin while Pernia and Neelly’s enslaved servant stayed in the stables. Mrs. Grinder and her children stayed in the kitchen separate from the house. In the middle of the night Mrs. Grinder heard two gun shots and found Lewis bleeding from his wounds. By sunrise on October 11,1809, Lewis was dead. Historical accounts support the probability of suicide. When Neelly arrived later in the day, he arranged to have Lewis buried a few hundred yards from Grinder’s Stand.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are noknown drawings or descriptions of what Grinder's Stand look like. The house itself was destroyed before the state of Tennessee erected the monument to Meriwether Lewis in 1848.

        "notes": "Grindstone Ford and Old Trace, Milepost 45.7\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/grindstone-ford.htm\n\nGrindstone Ford - This ford marked the beginning of the Choctaw Nation and the end of the Old Natchez District. Nearby Fort Deposit was a supply depot for troops clearing the Trace in 1801-1802, and troops were assembled here during the Burr conspiracy allegedly to separate the western states from the Union. The site takes its name from a nearby water mill.<br /> <br /> The half mile-long trail to the left of the wooden sign takes you to the Old Trace and Grindstone Ford. Boatmen, also known as Kaintucks, on foot or horseback crossed here, northbound, after floating cargo down to Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans and Natchez, Mississippi. Soldiers splashed across from the north to protect the Natchez District from British and Spanish threats during the War of 1812. For post riders, American Indians, and preachers, Bayou Pierre was the line between two nations.<br /> <br /> Daniel Burnett's stand stood near here. Burnett was the speaker of the Territorial House of Representatives, a principal negotiator with the Choctaws, and a framer of the state constitution but his stand was unpretentious. His guests supped on mush and milk in a room filled with their own gear and Burnett's supplies. From here you may follow their path along the Old Trace to Grindstone Ford.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional Information.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/war-of-1812-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">War of 1812 on the Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> This site is not accessible to vehicles taller than 11 feet in height.",

During the spring of 1541 de Soto demanded 200 porters from the Chickasaw Nation. The Chickasaw’s refused de Soto’s request and attacked the Spanish camp. The Spanish lost about 40 men and most of their supplies.<br /> <br /> Hernando de Soto himself died in May of 1542. The de Soto expedition is controversial, he is thought of by some as a great military leader. Many others view him as destructive, brutal and arrogant. His expedition through the Southeast US can be summed up by one the Spanish survivors “Our quest for new colonies and treasures of gold was a failure. As survivors we were happy to just escape with our lives.”",

This boundary ran from a point 12 miles east of Vicksburg southward to the 31<sup>st</sup> parallel.<br /> <br /> First surveyed in 1778, it was re-affirmed by Spain in 1793, and by the United States in 1801.Since 1820, it has served as the boundary between Hinds and Claiborne Counties, Mississippi.</em> <h4>Red Bluff Stand</h4> <br /> <em>“John Gregg at the lower Choctaw Line respectfully informs he public, and travellers particularly, that he keeps constantly on hand a large and general supply of GROCERIES, ground Coffee ready to put up, Sugar Biscuit, Cheese, Dried Beef, or Bacon, and every other article necessary for the accommodation of travellers going through the nation on very reasonable terms. His is also, prepared to shoe horses on the shortest notice.”<br /> <br /> Established in 1802, this hostelry o the Indian boundary was for several years the last place a northbound traveler could get provisions.</em>",

        "notes": "McGlamery Stand, Milepost 352.9\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/mcglamerystand.htm\n\nIn frontier language, a stand was an inn or trading post--sometimes both--usually located on a well traveled route. Such a place was established on the Old Natchez Trace, near here, in 1849 by John McGlamery. Although the stand did not outlast the Civil War, the name did. The nearby village is still known as McGlamery Stand. This stand was established more than three decades after the height of travel on the Natchez Trace and was in operation for about 12 years before closing at the beginning of the Civil War.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are no remnants of McGlamery Stand visible at the site.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.",

Stuart arrived in 1820, the Chickasaw people were entrenched in adapting to the changes in their homeland. Stuart was part of the party of mission workers who in January 1821, felled the first tree at the mission site that symbolized the “civilization” of the area.The Chickasaw people were aware that having their children educated according to the missionary standards would benefit the Chickasaw people in adapting to the changing world. The numbers of Chickasaw children sent to the school exceeded the capacity and a new school was built two miles north of the Monroe Mission.The people of the Chickasaw Nation are exceptional when it comes to adapting to changes and moving forward, while at the same time, not forsaking their traditions and heritage.

        "notes": "Mount Locust Historic House, Milepost 15.5\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/mount-locust-historic-house.htm\n\nMount Locust is a location that has been settled on by many different people and under many different flags during its long history of human occupation that dates back as far back as 600 C.E. (Common Era), long before Europeans first stepped foot in the area. There is archeological evidence of two separate American Indian occupations on the site. The first was between 600 and 800 C.E during what is known as the Coles Creek culture and based on archeological findings it seems those who occupied the area lived in small, family-based groupings where they fished, hunted, and gathered, and made pottery much as their ancestors had in the past. The second occupation was a village site in a field southwest of the historic house that consisted of at least seven mostly circular structures that dated back to between 1000 to 1350 C.E during Plaquemine culture.<br /> <br /> Centuries later, John Blommart began what would become known as Mount Locust around 1780, but his stay was short. Blommart’s former business associate, William Ferguson, and his wife Paulina purchased Mount Locust in 1784 and built the Mount Locust historic house, which is now one of the oldest structures still standing in the area. William and Paulina owned and operated the farm until William’s death in 1801. A short time later Paulina married James Chamberlain, an overseer at Mount Locust, and they continued to build the growing plantation.<br /> <br /> Between 1785 and 1820, an increasing number of boatmen known as \"Kaintucks,\" were floating flatboats down the Mississippi River to sell their goods at the markets in Natchez and New Orleans. Without an efficient way to navigate back up the Mississippi River, the boatmen walked north on the Natchez Trace to make their way home. The growing number of travelers compelled the Fergusons to turn their home into a \"stand,\" which was nothing more than a crude inn. The family offered the boatmen a meal of corn mush and milk with meager sleeping arrangements on the porches and grounds. The boatmen paid just 25 cents for the much-needed food and accommodations the stand provided.<br /> <br /> After the invention of the cotton gin in the late 1700's, cotton became a popular cash crop in the South. Mount Locust was no exception as it was a thriving cotton plantation through the early to mid-1800's. During the, \"King Cotton\" era, a number of families were forced to endure the bondage of slavery and forced labor at Mount Locust. Archeologists believe 12 to 16 slave cabins once stood on the property, with four to five people occupying each dwelling. On the west side of Mount Locust, a cemetery holds the remains of 43 enslaved people.<br /> <br /> The end of the plantation system after the Civil War led to a slow decline at Mount Locust. Eventually the National Park Service took over the property in 1938, with the last of the Chamberlain leaving in 1944. Overall, Mount Locust was a home to the Ferguson-Chamberlain family for five generations.<br /> <br /> Visitors are encouraged to tour the grounds of Mount Locust. A short walk behind the house will take you to the enslaved person cemetery, the Ferguson-Chamberlain cemetery, and the brick kiln site, where slaves made the bricks to build parts of the Ferguson-Chamberlain home.",

However, Lewis died near here in the early morning hours of October 11, 1809.<br /> <br /> To learn more about the Meriwether Lewis Death and Burial Site see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/exploring-the-meriwether-lewis-site.htm\">Exploring the Meriwether Lewis Site</a>.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/war-of-1812-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">War of 1812 on the Natchez Trace </a>for additional information.",

Hoping to hold the frontier, Congress in 1800 established a post route from Nashville, Tennessee to Natchez, Mississippi.<br /> <br /> The Trace, then a series of American Indian trails, had drawn from the Secretary of State the bitter comment \"The passage of mail from Natchez is a tedious as from Europe when westerly winds prevail.\" To speed the mail, President Jefferson ordered the Army to clear out the trail and make it a road starting in 1803.<br /> <br /> Post Riders, carrying letters, dispatches, and newspapers, helped bind the vast, turbulent frontier to the Republic. However their day passed by the mid 1830s when steamboats, running from New Orleans, Louisiana to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, robbed the Trace of it usefulness as a main post road.",

Only the Natchez Trace, part of which remains here, made inroads into tribal territory.<br /> <br /> When the Chickasaw ceded the land to the United States in the early 1800s the Natchez Trace became a boundary. The land behind you became government property under the 1805 treaty. In 1816 the tribe ceded a much larger tract including the land in front of you.<br /> <br /> In 1837 the Chickasaw were removed from their homeland. Chickasaw Removal is the most traumatic chapter in Chickasaw history. As a result of Congress’ Indian Removal Act, the Chickasaw people were forced to remove to Indian Territory. The foresight and skilled negotiating practices of Chickasaw leaders led to favorable sales of Chickasaw lands in Mississippi. This allowed the Chickasaw Nation, unlike other tribes, to pay for our own removal.<br /> <br /> Chickasaw families were met with hardship and death along the Removal, traveling hundreds of miles in extreme cold and heat; however, Chickasaws suffered less than other tribes because they controlled their departures and chose favorable seasons to travel. This undoubtedly saved many lives that otherwise could have been lost.<br /> <br /> Other tribes removed to Indian Territory were the Cherokee, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole. The Chickasaws were one of the last to remove. In 1837, They signed the Treaty of Doaksville with the Choctaw Nation and purchased the right for the settlement of the Chickasaw people in their own district within Choctaw Territory. Most Chickasaws removed to Indian Territory from 1837-1851. However, Chickasaw families continued to arrive in Indian Territory up to the 1890s, as evidenced by Chickasaw tribal enrollment in the Dawes Rolls.<br /> <br /> As the Chickasaw began to move into their district, they discovered Plains Indian tribes roaming freely across the lands. These tribes still lived a migratory lifestyle and made frequent raids on Chickasaw homesteads. The Plains Indian tribes did not understand the United States removing other tribes onto their historic homeland. To fulfill the treaty promise to protect the removed Southeastern tribes, the federal government built Fort Washita and Fort Arbuckle to maintain peace between the various tribes. Chickasaws still desired their own separate territory to restore governmental authority for their people and separate affairs from the Choctaws. In 1856, the Chickasaws separated from the Choctaws and created their own constitution for their own separate lands.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/trail-of-tears-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">Trail of Tears on the Natchez Trace Parkway </a>for additional information.",

Afterwards, with Choctaw permission, improvements to this section of the Old Trace began. In 1805, the Choctaw allowed inns, known as stands to be built along the route to provide basic food and shelter to travelers. By 1811, Noble Osburn opened a stand near this spot. He was known to treat equally his Choctaw neighbors and American travelers. In 1821 at <span style=\"color:null;\"><span name=\"_span_1\">LeFleur’s Bluff along the Pearl River, the city of Jackson was founded and a year later became the state capital. As a result, the postal route shifted slightly east from here to go through the new capital leading to the demise of the stands along this section of the Old Natchez Trace. <br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.</span></span><br /> <span name=\"_span_1\">S<span style=\"color:null;\">ee </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.</span>",

One of the largest Middle Woodland era mound sites in the region, Pharr Mounds was near a sizable village. The people there attracted trade for everyday items and ceremonial objects.  <br /> <br /> A vast trading network stretched from southeastern US to the shores of Lake Ontario. Over hundreds of linked trails, objects of copper, mica, greenstone, and shell found their way to Pharr Mounds. People from small local villages then came here to obtain exotic goods.  <br /> <br /> Cultures around the world and across time built monuments and lasting memorials. Mounds like these are some of the earliest remaining monuments in North America. <br /> <br /> Skillfully designed and built, these mounds are a source of wonder and pride.

Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans.

Alligators can sometimes be seen in the water. Herons, egrets, and other water birds are common here. It's also a great spot for fishing.<br /> <br /> The Pearl River, named after French Explorer Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville, for the many native plants that he found here, is the focus of this scenic area. The river marks a boundary between Mississippi and Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The Pearl River is a river in the U.S. states of Mississippi and Louisiana. It forms in Winston County, Mississippi from the confluence of Nanawaya and Tallahaga Creeks. It is 490 mi long. The Yockanookany and Strong Rivers are tributaries. Northeast of Jackson, the Ross Barnett Reservoir is formed by a dam.<br /> West of Picayune, MS, about 50 mi above the mouth, the river forks. The East Pearl River empties into Lake Borgne where the dredged Pearl River Channel meets the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The discharge flows eastward past Grand Island through St. Joe Pass and into the Mississippi Sound. The West Pearl River, on the other hand, flows into The Rigolets, then into Lake Borgne. Both discharges eventually reach the Gulf of Mexico.<br /> The Pearl River serves as the 116-mi boundary between Mississippi and Louisiana, in its lower reach near the Gulf of Mexico.<br /> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has undertaken three significant navigation projects in the Pearl River Basin. In 1880, Congress authorized a 5 ft navigation channel on the West Pearl River from Jackson to the Rigolets. That project was discontinued in 1922. Beginning in 1910, a channel was dredged from the mouth of the East Pearl River into Lake Borgne, a project which is maintained on an irregular basis. In 1935, the West Pearl River Navigation Project was authorized. It provided for a navigation channel from Bogalusa to the mouth of the West Pearl River. The project includes a canal with three locks. The Corps of Engineers placed the project in \"caretaker\" status in the 1970s because of a decline in commercial traffic. Maintenance dredging resumed in December 1988.<br /> In the 1950s, underwater concrete sills were constructed to help maintain water levels in the navigation channel. This has prevented Gulf sturgeon and other migratory species from accessing upstream areas. A rock ramp constructed in 2003 helps fish navigate over one of the sills, but environmental groups propose further work to mitigate the effects of the navigation project.<br /> Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 caused extensive damage in the Pearl River. Bottom sediments and marsh vegetation—including uprooted cypress and oak trees—blocked the mouth of the West Pearl and other parts of the channel, preventing navigation and diverting flow. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries and other agencies removed 27,000 cubic meters of debris.</span><br />  </p>",

Settlement of the area began in the late 1790's and continued until about 1860, reaching a peak of approximately 2600 people. Several businesses were established at different times, among them carpenters, wheelwrights, a well digger, cabinet makers, a cotton gin maker and blacksmiths. By the mid-1800's there was also a church, post office, a Masonic Lodge, and possibly a school.<br /> <br /> During the four years that the Civil War raged, many areas in both the North and the South would experience its devastation. A letter written in 1863 stated, \"My slaves, horses, and mules are carried off, my fences torn dowand my crops destroyed...\" <br /> <br /> In the summer fall of 1878, yellow fever struck the area. Pastor J.W. Sandwell on November 18, 1873, wrote that there were 180 yellow fever cases and 43 deaths. Although Rocky Springs tried to recover after the yellow fever epidemic, in the early 1900's boll weevil struck, a beetle that feeds on cotton buds and flowers, devastating the cotton crop. After this final disaster, the population declined rapidly and the last store in the area closed its doors during the 1930's.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the nearby spring no longer flows and today only the church and cemetery, two rustling safes and several abandoned cisterns remain of this once prosperous rural community.",

        "notes": "Sheboss Place, Milepost 400.2\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/shebossplace.htm\n\nThe widow Cranfield operated an inn, known as a stand, here with her second husband, an American Indian, who spoke little English. According to legend, when travelers approached with questions about accommodations, he would only point to his wife and say, \"She boss.\"<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are no remnants of Sheboss Stand visible at the site and exact location of the house is unknown.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/trail-of-tears-benge-route-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">Benge Detachment</a> of Cherokee people on the Trail of Tears passed this location on an unimproved path into Hickman County Tennessee in late 1838.

The natural corridor that became the Natchez Trace dates back many centuries. Long before Europeans first came to the area, what would become the Old Natchez Trace started out as animal trails that were utilized American Indians tribes. As the United States expanded westward in the late 1700's and early 1800's, growing numbers of travelers trampled the rough trail into a clearly marked path. Where the ground was relatively soft with loess soil, thousands of walkers, riders, and wagons wore down these paths into \"sunken\" sections, such as this one you see before you. Hardships of journeying on the Old Trace included heat, mosquitoes, poor food, hard beds (if any), disease, swollen rivers, and sucking swamps. This stop also gives you one of the more iconic pictures of the Natchez Trace. Take 5 minutes to walk this sunken trail and let your imagination carry you back to the early 1800's when people walking 500 miles had to put up with these discomforts and where a broken leg or arm could spell death for the lone traveler. ",

The trail is 2500 feet up and back. <br /> <br /> The terrain along the northern Parkway differs from that further south. Here, the land is rocky. Erosion is at work. The combined efforts of the stream, rain, and plants form a powerful force. Bedrock is being reduced to boulders, and boulders to stone, gravel, and sand. The eroded bedrock is then washed downstream.In the flatlands along most of the Parkway, sediments carried downstream settle out and come to rest, forming a soft, silty bottom. But a glance at the rocky streambed of Sweetwater Branch provides a vivid lesson in erosive power and undercuts the notion of “solid rock.”<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">What to look for:</span> <ul> <li>Interactions between plants, water, and rock</li> <li>Plants breaking down rocks</li> <li>The effects of erosion by water</li> <li>Running water gradually wears away small particles of rock, shrinking and smoothing the larger rock left behind.</li> <li>Rock being reduced to progressively smaller particle sizes</li> <li>When combined with organic matter, the smallest rock eventually become soil.</li> </ul> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Where Rock and Water Meet</span><br /> The interplay of rock and water shapes the landscape around you. Close your eyes. Listen. Sniff the air. Even without seeing, you can tell this place differs from others along the Parkway. The difference is rock – exposed beds of limestone and sandstone that effect how the forest looks, sounds, even smells. In the flatlands further south, you do not hear the rush and splash of a cascading stream that breaks down the rock. The rushing creek rounds off edges, tumbles boulders downstream, erodes them down to stone, gravel, sand-grain sized, and eventually to soil. While areas to the south have been shaped by deposited material, this area is being shaped by erosion.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Silent Stonemasons</span><br /> Working their way into cracks and crevices, roots help break down the rocky terrain. A plant can be an irresistible force. Roots from trees or walking ferns probe into cracks or fractures in the rock. In time as they grow, they wedge rocks apart or cause pieces to break off. Aided by the repeated freezing and thawing of water, the slow, silent, relentless power of growth can reduce rock to rubble.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Rock Today, Soil Tomorrow</span><br /> Rock breaks down into soil, and the kind of soil it forms affects what grows. Soil consists of tiny particles of rock mixed with decaying matter from plants and animals. Different kinds of rock form different kinds of soil.The soil found here results largely from the breakdown of limestone, which has alkaline properties, like baking soda. Alkaline soil reacts chemically with acid from rain and neutralizes it. Hardwood trees (rather than pines) favor this kind of soil, so the rock helps determine what kinds of plants grow here.",

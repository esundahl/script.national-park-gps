The mural, which was completed sometime between 1833 and 1846, is a visual tribute to a historic treaty that was negotiated in 1831 by Kenneth McKenzie, the manager of Fort Union, between the Assiniboine and Blackfeet tribes. The treaty was a significant achievement for the American Fur Company, as it allowed for extensive trade and commerce in the beaver-rich territory of the Blackfeet. Prior to the treaty, the Blackfeet were hostile to American incursions, but the successful negotiation changed the course of history and opened up new opportunities for peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit.<br /> <br /> The mural depicts a painting of eight people gathered for trade negotiations. In the center, an American Indian and a trader are shown shaking hands in a cordial manner. The left side of the image shows three American Indians watching the meeting, while the right side shows three white traders observing the proceedings. The mural's centerpiece is a powerful painting of a golden-brown eagle clutching a greenery branch and four arrows in its talons, symbolizing the strength and unity of the tribes involved in the treaty. The eagle image is shown hovering above the trade negotiations, underscoring the importance of the treaty and its significance in the history of the region.</p>",

The Assiniboine tribe controlled the land on which Fort Union was built and requested the fort's construction to establish a mutually beneficial relationship with the fur traders. The fort's strategic location at the intersection of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers made it a vital hub for trade and commerce. The Upper Missouri Tribes and the traders collaborated to establish trust and cooperation, resulting in mutually beneficial relationships. As a result of the exchange of goods and ideas, both the tribes of Upper Missouri and the fur traders benefited, leading to long-lasting relationships.<br /> <br /> Despite their main purpose of defense, the bastions also served other crucial functions. They served as storage facilities and housed the fort's employees and visitors. <br /> <br /> In 1832, the renowned artist George Catlin used one of the bastions as his studio. The bastion provided an ideal environment for Catlin to unleash his creativity, with its isolation, natural light, and ventilation. It's also worth mentioning that the Northeast Bastion, located across the courtyard, is an exact replica of the bastion used by Catlin. In the Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs and Conditions of North American Indians, Volume I, Catlin describes his studio in the second level of the bastion. He writes, “My easel stands before me, and the cool breech of a twelve-pounder makes me a comfortable seat, whilst her muzzle is looking out at one of the port holes.”<br /> <br /> Learn More:<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=ED4B1514-CD85-44D0-9545-4ED894AFC3B7\">Southwest Bastion Park Video</a>",

        "notes": "The Bourgeois House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-bourgeois-house.htm\n\n<p>The Bourgeois House was originally designed as a simple French Colonial structure, named after the fort's Bourgeois or site manager. According to Bourgeois Edwin Denig's 1843 account, the house was 78 feet wide, 24 feet deep and had a story and a half. Denig also mentioned that the front porch added both comfort and appeal. In 1850, the American Fur Company expanded the house into a classical revival building with a two-story porch and a full second floor. <br /> <br /> The Bourgeois at Fort Union was responsible for managing the trading post and serving as the primary agent of the American Fur Company. It was a highly prestigious and powerful position due to the significance of Fort Union as the most important trading post on the upper Missouri River for almost four decades. The Bourgeois had a range of responsibilities, including managing trading post operations, hiring workers and contractors, procuring trade goods and provisions, managing finances, establishing friendly relationships with area Upper Missouri tribes, maintaining order within the post, hosting important visitors, managing smaller trading posts upriver from Fort Union, observing and scouting trading posts of competing companies, and serving as a liaison to the American Fur Company offices in Saint Louis. The Bourgeois received a fixed salary of $1,200 to $1,500 per year plus a percentage of the post's profits. Additionally, the Bourgeois House provided comfortable living accommodations and a household staff that included rooms, offices, and a large dining room for management staff meals. As well, as the Bourgeois' intermarried into the Upper Missouri tribes, the Bourgeois House was also a family home. <br /> <br /> One woman who lived in the Bourgeois House was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fous/learn/historyculture/natawista-iksina-medicine-snake-woman.htm\">Natawista Iksina</a>, a member of the Blood band of the Blackfoot Nation. At the fort, it was common for the managers or engagés to marry an American Indian woman. The partnership of a Euro-American man and an Indian woman gave the woman a number of advantages that were social, economic, and political. Additionally, an Indian and Euro-American partnership helped to ensure positive trade and social relations with the wife’s people and the fur traders. As a result, Natawista was one of many Indian women who married a Euro-American man at Fort Union. She and Culbertson married around 1840, when she was 15 and he was 30. Thereafter, she was a powerful woman and a diplomat between the Blackfoot and the Euro-American traders who helped to create strong relationships between the two.  <br /> <br /> Today, the reconstructed Bourgeois House serves as the park's Visitor Center, exhibit center, bookstore, resource library, archives, and administrative offices.</p>",

        "notes": "Trade House - Clerk's Office\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/trade-house-clerk-s-office.htm\n\n<p>The Clerks Office often served as a meeting place for the Bourgeois and important American Indian leaders. In October 1851, Bourgeois Edwin Denig and Cree Chief Le Tout Pique met, and Fort Union clerk Rudolph Friederich Kurz sketched the event. The sketch shows Le Tout Pique standing in the center with his arm outstretched, while Edwin Denig remains seated in his armchair.<br /> <br /> Such meetings were significant events between the tribes and traders. They established the value of hides and trade goods and helped create lasting alliances and friendships. The exchange of gifts and news over a fine meal, coffee, and tobacco preceded discussions of trade and prices and often took several hours. These gatherings were as much a social affair as they were a business, and their success allowed Fort Union to operate peacefully for 39 years, from 1828 to 1867.<br /> <br /> Kurz's sketches of Fort Union life offer a glimpse into the past and were instrumental in the fort's reproduction. The furnishings of the room in the sketch of the meeting with Le Tout Pique serve as the basis for the room's actual furnishings. The paintings on display in the room are replicas of Kurz's works. Edwin Denig himself is depicted in the portrait on the east wall, and Denig's dog, Natoh, is seen in the sketch of the October meeting on the south wall.<br /> <br /> Despite the lack of modern technology, such as computers and electricity, the Clerk's Office functioned much like a typical office today. The fur company clerks compiled handwritten ledgers in which they tracked inventories, logged expenses, and balanced accounts. This was necessary to keep the fort running and profitable. The clerks had to be literate and able to do arithmetic. They were also required to have a good understanding of the different trade goods and their sources. Every spring, keelboats and steamboats arrived carrying trade goods from around the world. The clerks' job was to inspect every item and ensure they were in good condition. They also tracked the stock of goods in the fort's warehouse and were responsible for placing orders for future deliveries.<br /> <br /> Since new supplies from St. Louis took a year or more to arrive, the fort could not afford to run out. If supplies ran out, tribal trading partners would go to American competitors nearby or Canada's Hudson Bay Company. The clerks were paid quite well for the time, making between $800 to $1,000 per year, the equivalent of $25,000 to $30,100 today. They also received a suit of clothes and a top hat annually as part of their pay. Single-room living quarters were provided in the dwelling range on the west side of the fort's interior. The clerks took their meals at the high table in the Bourgeois House, rather than at the low table with the Engagés or other lower status workers. The Bourgeois House was a place of luxury and comfort, furnished with the finest china, silverware, and linens. The Trade House was a place of great importance, where the past and present intersected, and where the future of the fort was decided.<br /> <br /> Learn More: <br /> Watch an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=32A82B53-C039-4EA5-A018-B15D7CFF99D3\">interpretive clerks office talk</a></p>",

        "notes": "Trade House - Reception Room & Trade Room\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/trade-house-reception-room-trade-room.htm\n\n<p>The Trade House consisted of two rooms, with the Reception Room being the most important one. This is where the leaders of the Tribes would meet with the Traders from the American Fur Company to negotiate the terms of their trade. The room itself was minimalist, with only one bench for sitting, but adorned with curios from both cultures.<br /> <br /> When a band from the Upper Missouri Tribes arrived to trade, they were greeted in the Reception Room by the trader, one or two laborers, and an interpreter if needed. A fire was lit in the fireplace, and food and drinks were served. After the meal, pipes were passed around, and the trader made a speech emphasizing friendship and peace. The tribal leader then spoke, repeating many of the same things the trader had said, and described how his people had survived the winter and any recent hardships. Gifts were exchanged, with the trader giving the chief items like black powder, coffee, sugar, tobacco, or even a musket, while the tribal leader might present the trader with a bow and arrows in a skin quiver, a rawhide storage bag, or a beaded and quilled pipe bag. Once the gifts had been exchanged, the two men began to negotiate the trade. The tribal leader spread out a buffalo robe and other furs for the trader to examine, and the trader carefully inspected them while the tribal leader and his men talked about how they had obtained them. After this, the trader retrieved some of the newest items from the Trade Shop, and both parties examined each other's wares before serious negotiations began. This initial trade was pivotal to each negotiator. For the tribal leader, he is setting the price his people will expect for their robes this year. The better price he can set the more value their robes are worth. For the trader, he is negotiating the fort's profits for the year but he must not undervalue the robes. If he gives too poor of a trade value the tribe may not come back net year as there are competition forts up and down the Missouri River and just north of the site in Canada all vying for the same furs. The price for each robe would be set in trade good, not cash value as cash had no meaning on the upper Missouri. When the negotiations were concluded, the trade began. The tribal leader will inform his people what the trade is for this season, and then all persons in the band would trade individually for items they needed based on the price set by their tribal leader. If the price was set as, for example, a knife, tin pot and yard of cloth, not everyone in the band would need those exact items, but they would understand the relative worth of them and be able to use that worth to negotiate for items they did desire. In this way, over 25,000 to 50,000 buffalo robes were slowly and methodically traded each year at Fort Union. Men and women would divide the hides in their families and trade for what they each needed. The band then visited old friends and family in the fort, feasted, and relaxed. After a week or so, the entire band, having acquired all they needed or wanted, broke camp one morning and moved on through the breaks. After a few parting salutations, the band disappeared until the following year.<br /> <br /> The Trade Shop was a showroom that stocked over 200 different items. These items could be categorized as either laborsaving or ornamental. Laborsaving items were those that were manufactured, such as fabric, metal knives, and copper or tin cook pots. These items were durable, long-lasting, and helped save labor by eliminating the need to hunt, butcher, and tan an animal hide to make clothing or cooking utensils. Ornamental items, on the other hand, were purchased for their decorative value, such as silverwork ear wheels, ear bobs, and brooches, glass beads, fabrics, vermillion mineral pigment, brass tacks, and small tin and copper tinklers (cones). Some of these items were made on-site, with blacksmiths and tinsmiths employed to create tin and metal work, including arrowheads and spearpoints. The Fort Tailors made ready-made shirts and elaborate jackets called \"Chiefs Coats\", which were one of the most expensive items traded in the Trade House. However, most of the manufactured items were imported from overseas, including fabric from France, beads from Italy, woolen blankets from England, and guns from Belgium.</p> <br /> Learn more: <br /> Watch an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=F65164D9-B903-45D5-8A0F-DE2C373F6C3B\">interpretive trade house talk</a>.<br /> Watch a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=60741151-AFD2-4035-BB89-7CF1E11F9A80\">reenactment of a typical trade scene</a><br />  ",

This was the principal warehouse and business center at Fort Union. <br /> <br /> Here, furs and robes were processed for shipment to St. Louis. Meat was stored in a center room. Visitors and employees bought necessities in the retail store and packed away their baggage in another chamber. ",

This was the take-off point to the wilderness, trains and gold fields beyond. The vast prairie lay before them.<br /> <br /> In summer, Indian encampments could be seen nearby. Tepees dotted the landscape and smoke curled from cooking fires. <br /> <br /> Years after Fort Union ceased operations, the prairie gave way to railroads, hay fields and farming. Today, the native grasses have been restored through a restoration program. ",

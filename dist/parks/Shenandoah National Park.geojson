Enrollees were required to take an oath, swearing to obey those in authority and follow all rules and regulations. Some of the boys adjusted more easily to a regimented life than others. Those who had come from rural backgrounds tended to have an easier time with the labor than those from more urban backgrounds. Others suffered from homesickness and deserted, finding the sudden transition from a familiar life at home to life in an Army-run camp too jarring. For the majority, however, the benefits outweighed the negatives.<br /> For those who had been unemployed, with no prospects on the horizon, the CCC gave them a sense of purpose. Their time in the Corps improved their mental as well as physical health and taught them a sense of discipline which was to prove useful in the future.<br /> As enrollee George Moody, Jr. said afterwards:<br /> \"The CCC showed me a lot of rights and wrongs, it grew me up, grew a bit faster than I would have grew otherwise. It kept me out of trouble, chances are. It showed me how to gain responsibility, get out and fend for myself in a proper way.\"</p>",

(Although some older WWI veterans were also allowed to enroll.) Unofficially, some of the CCC boys lied about their ages to enter the Corps.<br /> CCC enrollees earned 30 dollars a month, a dollar a day, but $25 were automatically deducted and sent back home to their families, thus spreading the economic benefits of the program to the whole country. The remaining five dollars were often spent at the camp store or when they were out for a night on the town.<br /> Initially, some local towns were hesitant to have CCC camps built nearby, fearing the consequences of having so many newcomers to the area. But as the economic benefits of having a CCC camp also spread to the local communities, and the work projects started to show concrete results, opposition often faded away.

The chestnuts were a food source for both humans and animals and the timber was a valuable building material. The now dead trees were a wildfire and safety hazard.

Unemployment reached as high as 12 million people, equivalent to 25% of the eligible working population. People had lost their savings and livelihoods, bread lines were long and morale was low.<br /> Adding to the economic woes, the United States was also facing severe ecological issues. Drought conditions, poor farming practices and indiscriminate timber harvesting were contributing to the erosion of the nation's soil. In addition, the chestnut blight, a fungus, felled the mighty American Chestnut tree, a key part of both the ecology and economy here in the Appalachian region.<br /> Elected into office to bring some respite to the nation's problems, President Franklin Roosevelt set about to create a \"New Deal,\" implementing work-relief programs to aid the economy and the environment but also to bring people a sense of hope and purpose.<br /> The Civilian Conservation Corps, known as the CCC, was one of the most successful programs to come out of this era. Over the course of nine years, between 1933-1942, more than two million men (and a few women) were put to work helping to heal, and improve, our nation's public lands as well as give themselves a brighter future.<br /> The proposed Shenandoah National Park was the very first National Park site to have a Civilian Conservation Corps camp. The men arrived here on May 15th, 1933 and set to work to help construct the camp. Then they tackled the project of building a National Park.</p> <h3>Touring the CCC Camp</h3> <p>As you walk through this site of CCC Camp NP-2, think of the \"boys\" of the CCC and the legacy that they left for us to enjoy today. The former site of each building is marked with a sign and outlined with metal stakes. Start from this spot and make your way down the \"Company Street\" past the office, mess hall and towards the five barracks. Then make your way back to the technical, recreation and education buildings.<br /> <br /> If you are not there already, go to the Homepage, hit \"Tours\" then \"Big Meadows CCC Camp\" to follow the tour of the camp.</p>",

For the young men who came in with minimal or poor education, they learned how to properly read and write. Others learned the technical and construction skills that would serve them well in their later careers. Many saw parts of the country they had never seen before.</p> <h3>The Nation Benefits</h3> <p>The nation as a whole benefitted tremendously from their efforts in reforestation and the conservation of natural resources. Billions of trees were planted throughout the United States, helping to combat the effects of erosion and drought. Hundreds of parks and recreation areas, both at the state and national level, were created, allowing Americans opportunities to connect with nature in ways that had not been possible before. Vacations were suddenly affordable to people who didn't have much money. Buildings and infrastructure were built with such craftsmanship that they are still in use today.<br /> This is not to say that the Civilian Conservation Corps was a perfect program. At times it was disorganized, enrollees deserted (particularly in the later years), it was racially segregated, and women were only allowed to be minimally involved. Opportunities for an even greater good were missed. But the program more than accomplished what it set out to do; it benefitted the economy, helped to restore our environment and addressed the issue of youth unemployment, giving purpose and pride to the enrollees.<br /> Moreover, the fact that many young men had experience with military discipline and living would prove valuable as the country had to make the transition to war.</p> <h3>The End of the CCC</h3> <p>By 1942 conditions in the United States and the world had changed. The Civilian Conservation Corps was shut down as the economy had improved and enrollment dropped; men were needed to fight in World War II. The last of the CCC boys left Shenandoah in June 1942.<br /> Yet the conservation movement they helped to create lives on in our Parks and in the many youth conservation projects of today.</p>",

Despite the many agencies involved, the CCC was up and running with incredible speed. From Roosevelt's initial meeting with his Cabinet regarding the CCC on March 9, 1933 to the CCC boys arrival here at Shenandoah on May 15, 1933, only 68 days elapsed. (The very first CCC Camp, Camp Roosevelt in nearby Luray, Va, was established even earlier on April 17th.) It was one of the largest, and fastest, peacetime deployments ever in United States history.<br /> By the summer of 1933, over 250,000 men had been enrolled across the country in the CCC. Ultimately, there were camps in every state of the U.S plus the territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.<br /> In addition to the CCC boys, there were LEMs (locally employed/experienced men), older men from the local communities who came in with the trade skills necessary, e.g., masonry and carpentry, to help guide the projects.</p>",

Though the CCC did not engineer and build the road itself (that was done by the Bureau of Public Roads) they designed and created the overlooks as well as worked to control the erosion on the hillsides created from it's construction. Additionally, they planted hundreds of thousands of trees and plants, including mountain laurel, creating the beautiful \"natural\" landscaping we enjoy today as we take a drive along the road.</p> <h3>Trail Work</h3> <p>Hundreds of miles of hiking and horse trails in Shenandoah National Park were created by the CCC. As part of that work, they had to remove and shift much rock, which included building retaining walls to support the trails. They also built shelters along the trails.</p> <h3>Park Infrastructure</h3> <p>The boys of the CCC were also responsible for helping to build structures that we still use today. Portions of the campground at Big Meadows, Pinnacles Picnic Ground Shelter and Park Headquarters, to name just a few places, were built by them.<br /> Additionally, they constructed more unseen, but no less important, aspects of the Park including trenches for water and utility lines.<br /> Building materials, including stone and timber, were locally sourced from the park as much as possible so as to better blend into the environment.</p>",

Although only a few gravestones are left, generations of the Foxes are buried here. Observe your surroundings. Can you imagine what this spot would have been like when the Fox family still held funerals here? What did this space mean to the family?<br /> If you are visiting in spring, you may discover flowers that the Fox family planted years ago - frilly old fashioned daffodils and narcissuses, deep purple bearded irises. On the ground of the cemetery look for periwinkle, a low vine also called \"myrtle\" or \"cemetery weed.\" Periwinkle has blue-violet flowers nestled against dark glossy leaves that make an attractive ground cover and was commonly planted around cemeteries.</p> <h3>How do you protect history?</h3> <p>All cultural resources in Shenandoah are protected. Many cemeteries in the Park are maintained by the families to this day. These places and the history they hold may not last forever - which is why we need to appreciate them while they are still around.<br /> Some history here is already lost. Near here and along the trail you'll find blackheart cherry trees, which the Foxes planted for their fruit. During a visit here in 1976, Lemuel Fox Jr. recalled one of these cherry trees in the cemetery, \"I picked many a cherry off that tree. Blackheart cherries...Be plowing corn, and I'd get up there and eat cherries, rest the horse. I'd set up in the tree and eat cherries.\" This cherry tree that Lemuel remembered was knocked down in a storm a few years past. Other trees that were here were also knocked down - a few tulip trees and spicebushes. The result of this loss is the sunny clearing here today. Can you imagine what this spot will look like in another 20 years? What about 100, or 500 years?<br /> The forest is always changing, and some of that change means that, over time, we will begin to lose the clues of lives once lived here. Some of the loss, like open cornfields becoming forest and the slow crumbling of rock walls may not be immediately evident. As you walk to the next stop just a little ways down the trail, think about what you can do to protect this history.</p>",

A short section of the trail here is on the Merchant property. Today, the rock foundation of Merchant's barn lies under thick spicebush and multiflora rose.<br /> After the turn, you will be walking along an old county road which once connected the Fox family to the town of Front Royal. To your left (and possibly not even visible through the dense forest) is a rusting wire fence over piled rocks. This was once a wall that separated a field from the road. Imagine the fence new, the field cleared, and the barn standing tall. Imagine the wagons, and later cars, traveling down to Front Royal to the markets, or maybe to a social dance.<br /> The time on this road is yours: to think, to explore, to discover what you may. In the summer look for the blackberries and wineberries that line trail. Keep an eye out for bright red cardinals in the winter. You may spot bear or deer along the old road foraging for food. In the fall, as vibrant colors come out, try to identify different trees - dogwoods, hickories, maples, sassafras, black gums, and oaks. Look for wildflowers in the spring as the sun is still shining through the forest canopy. Or, simply enjoy walking a road that many people have walked before.</p>",

These rock piles are one of the few large, visible artifacts of the Fox's farm. What could these rocks be? A wall, a fence, part of a barn, a house?<br /> Lemuel Fox Jr. said that he would add rocks to the piles as he found them while plowing the cornfields. The original purpose of these rock piles is unknown.</p> <h3>Where do these rocks come from?</h3> <p>The rocks piled here are greenstone, volcanic rocks found in much of Shenandoah. Greenstone formed hundreds of millions of years ago when tectonic plates drifted apart and created rifts in the earth's surface. Ancient lava flows rose through these rifts, covering valleys and lapping up against hills and older mountains. The lavas were composed of basalt. Eventually heat and pressure metamorphosed the rock and new minerals like chlorite and epidote grew within the basalt. These minerals give the rock the greenish color that they have today and distinguish greenstone from unaltered basalt.<br /> Greenstone is found on some of the most well-known peaks in the Park, including on Hawksbill and Stony Man. Greenstone also forms rich soil - an attractive feature for settlers looking to farm. Today, much of this greenstone is covered by lichen with trees growing through the crevices. Does the plant life surrounding the rock piles give you a clue as to how long it has been since people moved these rocks?<br /> When you find evidence of human habitation along this trail - look at the surrounding forest. Think about how quickly the forest grows and what other artifacts from the lives of the Fox family may have been lost for good.</p>",

Lemuel's grandson Lemuel Fox Jr. courted his future wife, Maude Vaught on the family property. By the time of the establishment of Shenandoah National Park, the Foxes and extended family lived in several frame houses built between the cleared pastures and fertile fields of the hollow.<br /> Today, the Fox Hollow Trail winds through places where everyday life and memorable events took place, from plowing with draft horses to weddings and burials.

When do you think people made this? Who made this?<br /> If you guessed that the Fox family did not build this you would be correct. This is a springbox built after the Fox family left. At one time this springbox helped provide a water supply to the dining room at Dickey Ridge Lodge, currently Dickey Ridge Visitor Center. Though the Fox family did not build this springbox, they did use the water here for their farming and other daily needs.<br /> Opposed to the Fox family and many other mountain residents who lived in the hollows, the people building Shenandoah National Park in the 1930s wanted to highlight the views. So, Skyline Drive and all of the facilities and services for the Park followed the mountain ridge. The hollow homes, the lands cleared for grazing and farming, were eventually reforested and obscured from visitors' views. Yet visitors still needed running water, and the hollow provides that.</p>",

        "notes": "Fox Hollow Stream: Life Abounds\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/fox-hollow-stream-life-abounds.htm\n\n<p>A stable water source would have been one of the most important factors in finding a place to live for Thomas and Martha Fox when they began farming here in the 1850s. This water not only provides for farming and human life, but also for a wide variety of plant and animal life as well. One of the reasons Shenandoah is so lush, and how much of the vegetation here seems to grow faster than other places, is the prevalence of water sources like this one here.</p> <h3>Where does this water come from?</h3> <p>The groundwater here is under your feet. As water filters from the earth's surface down to the groundwater table it is purified by the rocks and nutrients it passes through. Water travels through the pores within and between individual rocks and pebbles, sometimes being stored for years, before eventually emerging as a mountain spring or stream. The water here will join the Shenandoah River, and from there flow into Chesapeake Bay, then finally into the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> The quality of water is directly related to air quality. Acidification is the primary threat to streams in Shenandoah. Acidification occurs when sulfur and nitric oxides produced from fossil fuel burning, especially from coal, react in the air to form acid compounds that then deposit onto the landscape. Think about all the ways this water could be used from the time it begins its journey on this mountain stream until it reaches the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> Though this hollow is at times a quiet, enclosed space, what happens here can affect people and ecosystems far outside these hills. Likewise, these hills and this forest are constantly impacted by outside forces. As you travel forward, continue to look for signs of the Fox family's home, but keep in mind the rapid pace of change all around.</p>",

Certain trees, maybe a tall red oak here, a white pine over there, or this sycamore before you were spared. How would you decide when to leave a tree be? Would you be after the shade it could provide, or maybe need it as a landmark, or maybe even just decide that you liked it the way it was? For all the ways this land has changed since Lemuel played and worked here in his youth, this tree is a constant. This tree has witnessed the removal of the old forest and the growth of a new forest in its stead. In the middle, this tree was a part of the daily life of the Fox family who lived just up the road.</p> <h3>Fostering Wilderness</h3> <p>Much of the wilderness in Shenandoah follows the story just told. The mention of wilderness might conjure up images of places so expansive that no person has ever stepped on the same ground twice, or a place so remote that it is free of the impacts of human industry. Shenandoah's wilderness is not these things.<br /> The wilderness that surrounds you, and the nearly 80,000 acres of federally designated wilderness in the Park, exist as wilderness because people decided to make it so. Early park managers advocated for reforestation and creating a place with a natural aesthetic; they wanted it to look like a beautiful forest. To those ends, the Civilian Conservation Corps maintained nurseries with Table Mountain pine, pitch pine, bittersweet, Virginia creeper, and dogwood, just to name a few. The CCC planted trees and other vegetation in areas that had previously been cleared for farming or grazing livestock. When left to nature, black locusts, sassafras, and pines are the first trees to take over, soon to be followed by longer-lived species like oaks and hickories.<br /> Today, wilderness in the Park is crucial habitat to many plants and animals, along with providing recreational opportunities for people who may not be able to enjoy quiet mountain trails anywhere else. This is why Shenandoah National Park exists. This forest that surrounds you here is something to be cherished. Likewise, the family that lived and labored here during another time should not be forgotten.</p>",

As the forest opens up, imagine what the whole hollow would have looked like if it were cleared like this. When you think about living in the mountains, do you think of a hollow - low, narrow, enclosed on either side - or do you think of a home with a sweeping view?<br /> The cleared pastures and farmland certainly would have created some views for the Fox family, but the view was a secondary consideration compared to the necessities of life. Unlike the Fox family, who cleared land to farm, Shenandoah National Park clears land for the views. All along Skyline Drive you will find overlooks with clearings in front of them, just like this one. These clearings allow visitors to see down the hollows, into the valley, and out to rural Virginia.<br /> The next time you are at an overlook, look into the hollows, those small narrow spaces between the ridges, and know that there is history hidden under the lush forest canopy.</p>",

Built in 1911, it was the home of Addie Nairn Pollock, co-owner of Skyland Resort and wife of Skyland founder George Freeman Pollock. The lodge's living room has been historically refurnished to reflect how Addie lived around 1915. The lodge also houses an exhibit, \"The Women of Skyland,\" which documents the lives of several women who frequented the resort in the roaring 20s. Although from very different backgrounds, they all held in common the need to reach beyond many of the social barriers of the time.<br /> <br /> The lodge is open for visitation during our Ranger program season, generally late spring through autumn (<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/rangerprograms.htm\">view ranger program schedule</a>). Please note that no bags, food, or drinks are allowed in the building.

In order to ensure your safety and make the most out of your hike, be sure that you understand the basics of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hiking-basics.htm\">hiking safety</a> before you set out on your adventure. Aside from these basics, there are a few more things that you need to know before hiking Old Rag:</p> <h4>Know Your Limits</h4> <p>Be sure that you are physically able to complete the hikes on Old Rag Mountain. Most hikes in this area are long, and there is significant elevation change with a strenuous rock scramble that requires good upper body strength. Often, children and shorter adults need assistance navigating the rock scramble.</p> <h4>Bring a Map</h4> <p>There are several different <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hikes-oldrag.htm\">ways to hike Old Rag</a>, so make sure that you pick the best route for you. Compare the different options and print or download the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/upload/OldRag_RoadTrail.pdf\">Old Rag trail map</a> so that you have it with you while you're hiking.</p> <h4>Pack Lightly</h4> <p>Although you need to be sure you have plenty of water and food, it is a good idea to pack as lightly as possible. Most hikers prefer fanny packs to backpacks, which can be difficult to maneuver through the rock scramble.</p> <h4>Avoid the Crowds</h4> <p>Planning your hike on a weekday will likely enhance your experience since Old Rag can become very crowded on weekends. At times, the parking lot will be full, and there can be long lines and substantial waits at some of the narrow rock scrambles. During periods of peak visitation (summer and fall), you may want to consider a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hikes-nocrowds.htm\">less-crowded hike</a>.</p> <h4>Leave Your Pets at Home</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Pets</a> are prohibited on the Ridge, Saddle, Ridge Access trails, and from Post Office Junction to Old Rag Shelter. </p> <h4>Know the Camping Regulations</h4> <p>Legal overnight camping sites are very limited in the Old Rag area as camping is prohibited above 2,800', so be sure to properly <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/backcountry-camping.htm\">plan your backcountry trip</a>.</p> <h4>Note the Numbers</h4> <p>You will notice numbers beneath the trail blazes on Old Rag. These are reference numbers for Search and Rescue personnel, so take note of the numbers as you pass them. If you need to report an incident, referring to the number you are closest to will help Park staff respond to you more quickly.</p> <h4>Tread Lightly</h4> <p>Old Rag is host to many rare and endangered plants that live in the rocky environment of the granite boulders. These plants are particularly susceptible to trampling, so please stay on the trail and observe all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/learn/nature/romp.htm#CP_JUMP_5704545\">rock outcrop management closure areas</a>.</p> <h4>Hiking Old Rag in the Winter</h4> <p>Be sure to carry microspikes or traction coil devices for your boots with you when you hike Old Rag. Even when it's perfectly clear in lower elevations, trails can be be icy and snow-covered during colder weather, and these devices can protect you from a nasty fall.</p> <h4>Parking</h4> <p>Although Old Rag Mountain is within the boundaries of Shenandoah National Park, most people approach it from the Park's eastern boundary, instead of from Skyline Drive. You are still required to pay an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">entrance fee</a>, but parking at the lots operated by the National Park Service is free. Landowners with property adjacent to the Park are charging a fee for parking on their property, but <strong>paying a private citizen to park does not exempt you from the Park entrance fee. </strong>Parking is prohibited along the road shoulders.</p> <h4>Directions</h4> <p><em>Do not rely exclusively on your mobile GPS, Google Maps, or similar automated navigation systems to get to the Old Rag parking area. Routes can be misleading and incorrect, and cell service is unreliable</em></p> <p><strong>Sperryville to Old Rag Parking:</strong> From Route 211, turn onto Route 522 and follow it south for 0.8 mile.

This National Historic Landmark was the beautiful, rustic getaway of President Herbert Hoover and First Lady Lou Henry Hoover during their time in the White House. This restful spot provided the couple respite and rejuvenation throughout a tumultuous presidency and was the backdrop for historic meetings during one of our nation's most difficult times: the Great Depression. A visit to the exhibits at Rapidan Camp will reveal a different perspective of the First Couple and provide you with the same respite and rejuvenation prompted by the beauty and serenity of this special place.</p> <h4><strong>A National Historical Landmark</strong></h4> <p>Rapidan Camp earned the distinction of being named a National Historic Landmark in 1988 as \"Camp Hoover,\" the common name of the camp during the years it operated as a government retreat. The camp was deemed nationally significant because of its association with the Hoovers and their presidential administration. In addition to providing the president and his family respite during tumultuous times, the camp is also significant because of the important meetings, conversations, and decisions made here. Hoover said, \"I have discovered that even the work of government can be improved by leisurely discussions of its problems out under the trees where no bells or callers jar one's thoughts.\"</p> <h4><strong>Getting Here</strong></h4> <p>Rapidan Road, which lies across from Byrd Visitor Center (mile 51.2) and leads several miles down to Rapidan Camp, is closed to all private vehicles. There are still several options for visiting the camp, however:</p> <ul> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Ranger-led Tour</strong><br /> Starting with a shuttle ride from Byrd Visitor Center, Ranger-guided tours of Rapidan Camp include time inside both the Brown House and the Prime Minister's Cabin, as well as time exploring the grounds and gardens within this historic landmark. Tours are available by reservation only and are typically offered during the spring, summer, and fall. Visitors may <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/ticket/facility/251745?q=Rapidan%20Camp%20Tours\">book a reservation</a> up to 6 months in advance and up to 4 hours before the tour.</li> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Hiking</strong><br /> We recommend the 4-mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/rapidan-camp.htm\">Rapidan Camp hike</a> from the Milam Gap parking area, although you may also choose to do the longer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/mill-prong-laurel-prong.htm\">Mill Prong - Laurel Prong Loop hike</a>, or the Mill Prong Horse Trail that is down Rapidan Road and to the right.</li> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horseback Riding</strong><br /> Rapidan Camp is also accessible with a horse, by riding down Rapidan Road from the Rapidan parking area (mile 51.3) and returning the same way. Please take the time to review our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/horseback_riding.htm\">horseback riding rules and best practices</a> before taking this trip.</li> </ul> <h4><strong>Getting Around</strong></h4> <p>Within Rapidan Camp, each building, existing and obliterated, is marked with a sign, and most of them are on the main path. You can peruse the exterior interpretive panels year-round. When caretakers are here, (typically during the spring, summer, and fall) you can visit the exhibits in the Brown House and Prime Minister's Cabin.<br /> <br /> The Brown House is historically refurnished to reflect the Hoover era. The Prime Minister's Cabin houses an interpretive exhibit about the Hoover's and their life at Rapidan. If you're up for a walk, follow the trail up to the site of Five Tents and/or take the President's Walk, a beautiful stroll along the creek to the sluice built to divert the natural Laurel Prong to feed the Marine-built Hemlock Run.</p>",

He likes to be near enough to hear the water murmuring.\" As plans developed, the Hoovers endeavored to extend that courtesy to all their guests instructing the Marines to build Hemlock Run. The Laurel Prong was diverted by an upstream sluice gate creating the two-thousand-foot-long water channel that meanders through the forest and past several of the camp's buildings. Where the channel passes between the President's Cabin and the Prime Minister's Cabin, existing rock outcrops and boulders were incorporated into the channel to for a small waterfall called Hemlock Falls.

The napkins are sometimes of checked gingham.\"<br /> <br /> Meals, too, were rustic.

The Rapidan has long been known as a premier trout stream and was, perhaps, the biggest consideration of the Hoovers when choosing the area for their camp. President Hoover once claimed that he believed that \"God does not subtract from your life the time you spend fishing.\" Note: Hoover lived to be 90 years old!<br /> <br /> This bridge was washed away in a flood in the late 90s and was replaced.</p>",

Today, just over 2,500 historic places bear this national distinction.\" So, it is worth noting that Rapidan Camp earned this distinction in 1988 as \"Camp Hoover,\" the name the camp came to be known as during the years it operated as a government retreat. The Park restored its historic name when the camp was restored in the early 2000s.<br /> <br /> The Camp was deemed nationally significant because of its association with the Hoovers and their presidential administration. In addition to providing them respite during a tumultuous time, the Camp is also significant because of the important meetings and conversations held and decisions made here. Hoover said, \"I have discovered that even the work of government can be improved by leisurely discussions of its problems out under the trees where no bells or callers jar one's thoughts.\"</p>",

Like the other fireplaces in the camp's buildings, this massive stone chimney was built by the Marines who were stationed here. Initially, President Hoover refused to have the soldiers stationed here, but was convinced by the War Department that they could provide security and \"carry out considerable military training.\" The Hoovers were adamant that they personally pay for the expenses of their retreat.</p>",

After choosing the Rapidan site, they carefully manipulated and enhanced its natural elements - terrain, boulders, water, and plantings. Their greatest natural artifice, Hemlock Run was created by diverting part of Laurel Prong so that its waters flowed through the heart of the camp in cascading layers, forming waterfalls and feeding the stocked trout pond. Their goal was to be sure every guest could hear the sounds of water from their cabins. From here you can take a lovely stroll out to what remains of the sluice the Marines constructed to fill Hemlock Run. To the sluice and back is a level walk of about 1/2 mile.</p>",

Although President Hoover was never known to take the easy way out and spent his time in waders among the trout rather than casting from the porch, it was a wonderful place to entertain their many guests and enjoy the outdoors. When the weather or nightfall drove them inside, the Brown House interior was just as welcoming.

Moreover, it is a constant reminder of the democracy of life, of humility and of human frailty - for men are equal before fishes. And it is desirable that the President of the United States should be periodically reminded of this fundamental fact - that the forces of nature discriminate for no man.\"<br /> - Herbert Hoover<br /> <br /> Fishing was the primary motivation for building Rapidan Camp at the headwaters of the Rapidan River. Although the Camp came to be much more than a great place to fish, the President's favorite activity provided much needed respite. Hoover's physician, Admiral Joel T. Boone said, \"I never saw him happier than when he was on the Rapidan.\"<br /> <br /> As part of the construction of naturalistic water features throughout the camp, the Marines built this trout pond. Reports of its actual use vary somewhat; some calling the trout in the pond \"pets,\" others reporting it as a place to keep the non-native Rainbow trout, and still others describing it as a holding tank for trout intended for dinner. However, many who wrote of the pond remember daily feedings of beef hearts, a fact borne out by household receipts.</p>",

The Valley witnessed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jackson1862-valley-campaign.htm\">Stonewall Jackson’s adept 1862 Valley Campaign</a>, General Robert E. Lee’s advance to the Confederate “high tide” at Gettysburg, the Virginia Military Institute Cadets’ valiant charge at New Market, and U.S. General Philip H. Sheridan’s final campaign to crush Confederate ambitions for the Valley—which included \"the Burning,\" the fiery destruction of the region’s agricultural bounty.<br /> <br /> Today, the Valley’s historic towns and preserved landscapes offer a wealth of sites where you can experience the region’s dramatic Civil War story. You can also explore the spectacular natural beauty of the Valley via historic roadways, winding mountain roads, leisurely walking tours, or challenging hiking trails to spectacular overlooks.  And you can enjoy the wide variety of other experiences that the Valley has to offer: natural wonders, history and heritage sites, arts and culture, and dining and lodging in the Valley’s historic towns.<br /> <br /> In 1996, Congress designated eight counties (Augusta, Clark, Frederick, Highland, Page, Rockingham, Shenandoah, and Warren) in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia as the <a href=\"http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/\">Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District</a>. The purpose of this <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/heritageareas/index.htm\">National Heritage Area</a> is to preserve and interpret the region’s significant Civil War battlefields and related historic sites. That effort is led by the <strong>Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation</strong>, which works with partners to preserve the hallowed ground of the Valley’s Civil War battlefields, to share its Civil War story with the nation, and to encourage tourism and travel to the Valley’s Civil War sites.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District is home to the following NPS units:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cebe/index.htm\">Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historic Park</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm\">Shenandoah National Park</a></p> </li> </ul>",

Valley.\" In 1740, he built a mansion in the Piedmont region near Nethers in Rappahannock County. The privately-owned Thornton's Gap Turnpike Company was formed to build a road over the mountains at Thornton's Gap. The toll road opened in 1806.<br> <br> During the Civil War, the Great Valley of Virginia was known as the \"breadbasket of the Confederacy\" and so was the scene of intensive military action and much destruction. But the Blue Ridge Mountains witnessed only limited military actions and few depredations as the contending armies merely passed through on their way to larger confrontations.<br> <br> Thornton was one of many passageways that led across the Blue Ridge. Two others were the Gordonsville Turnpike that crossed the Blue Ridge at Fishers Gap and Swift Run Gap Turnpike that crossed at Swift Run Gap. But when Skyline Drive was completed in the 1930s, the National Park Service chose to limit vehicular access to the mountaintop and closed the many roads that crossed the ridge. Today, many of these historic routes are maintained as fire roads or provide limited access for administrative purposes.<br> <br> Prior to the building of Skyline Drive by the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) during the Great Depression, the lost town of Beahm was located at Thornton Gap.</p>",

Board of Education of Topeka that segregation in the public schools of the nation was unconstitutional. One of the first big tests of that decision came at Little Rocks Central High School. On September 23, 1957, nine African Americans attempted to enroll in the formerly all-white school. Arkansas Governor Orville Faubus called in the National Guard to “prevent violence” and to keep the students from entering. After a federal judge forced Faubus to remove the troops, the Little Rock police were unable to control the crowd and violence erupted. To enforce federal law, President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101<sup>st</sup> Airborne Division to protect the students, who entered the school and began attending classes. Tensions remained at the high school for some time, but an important first step in school integration had been taken.</span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Central High School is an operating public school and is not open for visitors to tour on their own.

Within this space are nine benches and nine trees to provide seating and shade for a visitor to sit and reflect in this tranquil landscape.<br /> <br /> The arches and accompanying sculptures, designed by Michael Warrick and Aaron Hussey, surround a poem etched into a concrete circle – “The Spirit of Central High.” Inside the arches are reflective photographic panels showing the history of Central High from its construction before 1927, through its struggle for desegregation in 1957/The Lost Year as well as recent images of Central High School’s student life and activity.<br /> <br /> The Central High Commemorative Garden was dedicated on September 25, 2001 - the 44th anniversary of the Little Rock Nine's successful entrance into Central High School under protected escort by the 101st Airborne. The nine trees accompanied by nine benches symbolize the strength of the Little Rock Nine line the garden path and offer a place to contemplate the past, present and future. The beautifully landscaped garden of winding paths leading to a circular plaza features triumphant arches in the middle of the garden. As major contributors to the sculpture, Dr. and Mrs. Tom Bruce envisioned the Commemorative Garden sculpture as representing \"the Spirit of Central High:' Dr. Bruce proposed that the Commemorative Garden would 'celebrate the ability of people to overcome adversity and to recognize and honor triumph of the collective good over the betterment of a few:' <br /> <br /> With a design derived from the front facade of Central High School, the sculpture's brick and con­crete arches stand as testa­ment to the courage of the students and the school. The sculpted figures on the arches represent Central's racially diverse student body - the legacy of the Crisis. <br /> <br /> On the interior of the arches, Warrick and Hussey explore the Central High School story through a mirror-like photo collage that documents the school's history and reflects the visitor's image in the photos. Beginning with the construction of Little Rock Senior High School in 1927 at the top of the collage, the photos descend through the decades of segregation into the struggle for integration and the present student population. Images of recent graduates represent the continual foundation that Central High School builds for the future of Arkansas, the nation and the world. <br /> <br /> Located across the street from Central High School National Historic Site, visitors can learn more about the Crisis and all of the photographs on the arches in the Visitor Center. The Commemorative Garden has an accessible ramp on its south and east entrances which leads through the entirety of this contemplative space.<br /> <br /> The Commemorative Garden was made possible by: Dolores F. and Thomas A.

        "notes": "Elizabeth Eckford Bus Bench\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/elizabeth-eckford-bus-bench.htm\n\nOn Wednesday, September 4, 1957, ten African American students attempted to enter Central High for the first time. The previous evening, the principals of Dunbar and Horace Mann had informed these students that they would be going to Central the next day. Daisy Bates, President of the Arkansas Conference of Branches for the NAACP, had called the families of the students to inform them of the logistics for that Wednesday morning: do not come to Central High alone, but meet near the school around 8:30 a.m. where a group of local African American and white ministers would escort the students to the high school.<br /> <br /> Elizabeth Eckford did not receive notice about this plan of action - the Eckfords do not have a telephone. Mrs. Bates intended to try to reach the Eckfords on Wednesday morning, but forgot in the hurried pace of the morning. Elizabeth rode a bus to Central, approached the school just before 8:00 a.m. and saw the soldiers of the Arkansas National Guard surrounding the school. Barred by the soldiers in several failed attempts to be allowed past their ranks, Elizabeth found herself in the throes of an angry mob of protesters numbering over 300+ on Park Street. Chants [\"Two, four, six, eight! We don't want to integrate!\"], racial epithets, terroristic threats and spit descended down on this fifteen-year old student as she attempted to make her way to the end of Park Street where perceived safety awaited her at another bus stop and bench. After arriving at the bus stop, Elizabeth waited for 35 minutes; in the interim, she is denied entrance to Ponder's Drug and supported by Benjamin Fine and Grace Lorch.<br /> <br /> \"The mob of twisted whites, galvanized into vengeful action by the inaction of the heroic state militia, was not willing that the young school girl should get off so easily. Elizabeth Eckford had walked into the wolf's lair, and now that they felt she was fair game, the drooling wolves took off after their prey. The hate mongers, who look exactly like other, normal white men and women, took off down the street after the girl.\" - Buddy Lonesome, <i>St. Louis Argus</i><br /> <br /> \"Here she is this little girl, this tender little thing, walking with this whole mob baying at her like a pack of wolves seeking to destroy a little lamb.\" - Benjamin Fine, <i>New York Times</i><br /> <br /> Unveiled in 2018, a replica of the bench stands in the place where Elizabeth's first attempt at integration ended on that September day. The bench and surrounding plaques are the result of a student-led project by the Central High School Memory Project in collaboration with the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service, the National Park Service and other partners. The Memory Project, a group inspired by the American Memory Project at the Library of Congress, immerses students in the oral history of civil rights and human rights through hands-on, inter-generational learning and requires students to analyze causes/effects of historical events as well as the resulting impact on both individuals in their families and institutions in our communities.<br /> <br /> The bench is a place for reflection, a space to remember the nonviolence demonstrated by a fifteen-year-old in the face of surrounding violence.

Bates Home is nationally significant for its role as the de facto command post during the Central High School desegregation crisis in Little Rock, Arkansas. The house served as a haven for the Little Rock Nine, the group of African American students who desegregated Little Rock Central High School, and as a place to plan the best way to achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> As the president of the Arkansas State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Daisy Bates symbolized the legal fight to desegregate the public schools after the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> that found segregated schools unconstitutional. Mrs. Bates combined her public roles as the state NAACP president and co-publisher (with her husband, L.C.) of the <i>Arkansas State Press</i> to become a mentor to the nine teenagers (known as the Little Rock Nine) who ultimately desegregated Central High School.<br /> <br /> Throughout the desegregation crisis, the Bates' home became the official pick-up and drop-off site for the Little Rock Nine's trips to and from Central High School each school day and, consequently, a gathering spot for the Nine and members of the press. As a result, the Bates home was a frequent target of violence by segregationists. In August 1957, a rock crashed through the living room window with a note attached that read \"STONE THIS TIME. DYNAMITE NEXT.\" Two crosses were burned in the front yard on different occasions and shots were fired into the house from a passing car. Over the course of the 1957-58 school year, this home \"became a fortress\" with a volunteer guard committee, flood lights and frequent calls to the police.<br /> <br /> The perseverance of Mrs. Bates and the Little Rock Nine during these turbulent years sent a strong message throughout the South that desegregation worked and the tradition of racial segregation under \"Jim Crow\" would no longer be tolerated in the United States of America. The Bates house stands as a symbol of the role of civil rights advocates who fought against legal and social obstacles to educational opportunity for African American youth during a period of southern massive resistance to desegregation.</p>",

        "notes": "Kansas: Brown v Board of Education National Historical Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/brown-v-board-of-education-national-historical-park.htm\n\n<p>Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park (Brown v. Board or the park), located in Topeka, Kansas, covers two acres and includes the historic Monroe Elementary School, which served African American students during the segregation era. The neighborhood in which the park is located is a few blocks southeast of downtown Topeka. The neighborhood includes residences, light industry, small businesses, and vacant lots. Brown v. Board interprets the people, places, and events that contributed to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed segregation in public education. Furthermore, the park interprets the integral role of the Brown case in the civil rights movement, preserves the former Monroe Elementary School and associated cultural landscape, and assists in the interpretation of related local, national, and international resources that further the understanding of the civil rights movement.<br /> <br /> The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) is one of the most pivotal opinions ever rendered by that body. This landmark decision highlights the court’s role in affecting changes in national and social policy. Often when people think of the case, they remember a little girl whose parents sued so that she could attend an all-white school in her neighborhood. In reality, the story of Brown v. Board of Education is far more complex.<br /> <br /> By 1951, the country had experienced tremendous change that brought the nation closer to ending legal segregation. As the Cold War ideologies of the Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global counterpoints, the practice of racial segregation became an international issue, rather than a domestic issue. As the United States sought new allies to counter Soviet gains in Eastern Europe, it needed to shed the hypocrisy of advocating freedom and equality for all on the international stage while denying basic rights to its African American citizens at home. As a result, President Truman in 1947 used executive authority to order desegregation of the military. The Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the racial restrictive covenants that prevented African Americans and other minority groups from purchasing property in white neighborhoods. Additionally, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) won numerous legal victories to integrate colleges in Oklahoma, Texas, and Missouri that established a new legal precedent to challenge segregation in public schools. After nearly 60 years of “separate but equal,” the NAACP and the nation were on the verge of a major victory against segregation.<br /> <br /> In late summer of 1948, members of the Topeka, Kansas, chapter of the NAACP volunteered to challenge the “separate but equal” doctrine governing public education. Following a strategy mapped out by Thurgood Marshall, head of the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, Topeka Branch President McKinley Burnett continued to petition the Board of Education to voluntarily desegregate the public schools while branch lawyers began putting a case together and signing up plaintiffs, often recruiting friends and neighbors. A group of 13 parents agreed to participate on behalf of their 20 children. In the summer of 1950, the branch notified the NAACP in New York that the school situation in Topeka had grown unbearable and they were prepared to go to court.<br /> <br /> In December 1952, the U.S. Supreme Court had on its docket cases from Kansas, Delaware, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, and Virginia, all of which challenged the constitutionality of racial segregation in public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court had consolidated these five cases under one name, Oliver Brown et al. v. the Board of Education of Topeka. One of the justices later explained that the U.S. Supreme Court felt it was better to have representative cases from different parts of the country. They decided to put Brown first “so that the whole question would not smack of being a purely Southern one.”<br /> <br /> This collection of cases was the culmination of years of legal groundwork laid by the NAACP in its work to end segregation. None of the cases would have been possible without the many individuals who were courageous enough to take a stand against the segregated public school system.<br /> <br /> Each of the five cases that collectively formed Brown v. Board of Education at the Supreme Court level varied in their specifics. Lack of buses to distant schools, poor facilities, and absence of basic equipment and supplies were among the evidence in the cases outside of Kansas. In Topeka, the African American schools were housed in good quality buildings with supplies and teacher pay commensurate with the city’s white schools. However, children of the plaintiffs were denied access to their much closer neighborhood schools. Instead, they had to attend more distant facilities designated for their race. On May 17, 1954, at 12:52 p.m., the U.S. Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision stating that it was unconstitutional—a violation of the 14th Amendment— to separate children in public schools for no other reason than their race.<br /> <br /> At the end of the Civil War, those recently freed from bondage began to migrate out of the South. In 1874, the Kansas state legislature enacted a civil rights law making it illegal for any business serving the public or operating under a municipal license to discriminate on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This protective law, coupled with the availability of land through the Homestead Act, resulted in a flood of African Americans looking for a safe place to settle in Kansas. Thousands of “Exodusters,” as they became known, fled the violence and legal discrimination of the South with the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The question of how to educate the children of the new arrivals remained a subject of debate. Kansas settled on voluntary segregation of public elementary schools in larger cities, with an emphasis in Topeka on providing materially equal facilities for African American children. This policy stood firm from the 1920s until the time of the Brown decision.<br /> <br /> Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site was established in Topeka, Kansas, on October 26, 1992, by Public Law 102-525. The park opened to the public in 2004 on the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling. The Monroe Elementary School had, with the Sumner Elementary School in Topeka, been designated a national historic landmark in 1987.<br /> <br /> By Public Law 117-123, the site was redesignated Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park on May 12, 2022. The park works with many partners to explore through exhibits, education programs, interpretation, and special events the story of Brown v. Board of Education in the context of the ongoing civil rights struggle.<br /> <br /> In October 2019 The Brown v. Board Of Education National Historical Park became part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a>. <br /> <br /> <em>The</em> <em>African American Civil Rights Network (AACRN) recognizes civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation.

In the era of Jim Crow laws and at a time when Supreme Court-mandated policy allowed educational facilities to be \"separate but equal\", Little Rock Central High School admitted only white students during its first three decades. These students received greater educational opportunity than did their African American counterparts throughout the city.<br /> <br /> The landmark <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision in 1954 held separate educational facilities to be inherently unequal. Three years after <i>Brown</i>, Little Rock Central High School became the epicenter of a direct challenge to federal authority and enforcement not seen since post-Civil War Reconstruction.In September 1957, angry mobs, the governor of Arkansas and the Arkansas National Guard blocked two attempts by African American students to enter and integrate the school. Later dubbed by the media as the Little Rock Nine, this group of students succeeded on their third attempt. They entered classes on September 25, 1957, escorted by the 101st Airborne, which had been ordered by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to enforce the ruling and prevent interference with court orders of integration.<br /> <br /> Despite the presence of troops, the Little Rock Nine faced harassment—verbal and violent, private and public, latent and life-altering—throughout the school year. The following year, voters chose in a special election to reject immediate racial integration of all schools within the Little Rock School District, allowing four local high schools to be shuttered for an entire school year.<br /> <br /> Today, Little Rock Central High School is still a functioning 9th - 12th grade facility and is not open to the public. Visitors to the National Historic Site can schedule a ranger-led program in advance (if available) which often go to the front grounds of the school (check park website for available dates). If ranger-led programs are unavailable or not part of your visitation plan, you may walk on the front ground and/or up a stairway to the main entrance at the front of Central High School only.<br /> <br /> Little Rock Central High boasts impressive statues of four figures over the front entrance representing Ambition, Personality, Opportunity and Preparation. At the 1927 dedication, Lillian McDermott, then-president of the School Board, claimed that the new school \"would stand...for decades to come [as] a public school where Ambition is fired, where Personality is developed, where Opportunity is presented and where Preparation in the solution of life's problems is begun.\" A new statue by Clay Enoch entitled “United” featuring two figures working to close two open and intertwined circles stands guard adjacent to a side entrance on the building’s east side. Note: the stairway and front entrance are not accessible from outside the school; the lower landing and reflecting pool are accessible from the south sidewalk in front of Central High School.<br /> <br /> Little Rock Central High School, the only operating high school designated as a National Historic Site, is important beyond its past.

        "notes": "Magnolia Mobil Gas Station\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/magnolia-mobil-gas-station.htm\n\n<strong>“What Is Significant About the Gas Station?” </strong><br /> <br /> Visitors to the site often are curious about the restored gas station and how it relates to the stories of Central High School. The Magnolia Mobil service station located at the corner of Daisy L. Gatson Bates Drive and Park Street was built in the 1920s, about the same time that Little Rock Central High School was built. Throughout the years, the building has served as a gas station, a hangout for students, a temporary “office” for reporters during the desegregation crisis, storage for a wholesale florist business, and a National Historic Site visitor center. <br /> <br /> <strong>The History of the Gas Station </strong><br /> <br /> This service station was built for the Magnolia Petroleum Company of Texas in the 1920s. Called the “Southwest” model, this station in Little Rock was identical to many others across Texas and Arkansas. The Magnolia Petroleum Company was one of many regional oil companies owned by Magnolia Oil Corporation. Founded as Vacuum Oil Company of Rochester, New York by Matthew Ewing and Hirman Everest in 1866, the company became a subsidiary of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Corporation of Ohio in 1879 and later a part of the Standard Oil Trust. In response to a 1911 Supreme Court decree against monopolies, the Standard Oil Group was broken into thirty-four companies. One of the successor companies, Standard Oil Company of New York (SOCONY), acquired full interest in the Magnolia Petroleum Company of Texas and some other regional oil companies before merging with the Vacuum Oil Company (another member of the Standard Oil Group) in 1931. <br /> <br /> As Socony-Vacuum, the company led the way in pioneering lubricants and new energy sources. The name changed to Socony Mobil Oil Company in 1955, Mobil Oil Corporation in 1966, and Mobil Corporation in 1976. In the late 1950s, the station featured both Mobil and Magnolia signs to capitalize on regional and national brand identification. The station was in operation into the 1980s, when it closed and the building was acquired by the wholesale florist that was once located across the street. The company used it for storage until 1996 when Central High Museum, Inc., a nonprofit organization, purchased the property to use as a visitor center. The Mobil Foundation assisted in restoring the exterior of the station to its 1957 appearance. Mobil’s corporate archives supplied the architects with the original specifications for the vintage signage, the paint scheme, and the gas pumps. The visitor center opened in September 1997 for the 40th anniversary of the desegregation events at the school. <br /> <br /> In November 1998, President Clinton signed legislation designating Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site as a unit of the National Park Service. Central High Museum, Inc. donated the property to the National Park Service; the station served as the interim visitor center until September 2007 when the new permanent center opened on the 50th Anniversary of Central High's integration. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>During the 1957-58 School Year </strong><br /> <br /> The service station was one of the few businesses in the immediate neighborhood and had a pay telephone on site. During the early days of the desegregation crisis, when reporters from all over the state, nation, and world converged on Little Rock, many phoned in their reports from the station. The press included a number of local and international reporters from magazines and newspapers such as <em>The New York Times, Life, Look, Arkansas</em> <em>Gazette, Arkansas Democrat, Arkansas State Press, Der Spiegel </em>(a German Periodical), <em>Chicago Defender,</em> and <em>Baltimore Afro-American</em>. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, television was entering mainstream America as a medium for news, and the events in Little Rock were among the first major news events to be televised. Reporters representing the major networks featured live footage of the events as Arkansas National Guard troops, on orders of the governor, kept nine African American teenagers out of the school. <br /> <br /> <em>“...the world media took a moral stand on Little Rock and they were horrified...there was so much media coverage, even though we knew [the people in the crowd] were crazy we also knew that they would have to be really crazy to kill one of us in public.”</em><br /> Minnijean Brown-Trickey, Little Rock Nine<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

        "notes": "Paul Laurence Dunbar High School\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/paul-laurence-dunbar-high-school.htm\n\n<strong>Construction</strong><br /> <br /> By the late 1920s, the school for African-American students, Gibbs High School, could no longer accommodate growing class sizes. After a fire destroyed parts of Gibbs, the Little Rock School bulit Dunbar in 1929. Construction of Dunbar cost $400,000. Because the school board spent $1.5 million in 1927 to build the new Little Rock Senior (now Central) High School for white students, funding was unavailable to complete Dunbar. As a result, parents and community members sought private funds to help build the school. Funding from the Julius Rosenwald Foundation and the Rockefeller General Education Fund helped pay for Dunbar's construction. <br /> <br /> <em>\"[Dunbar] was something that the Black community could point to with pride and say that the school belonged to the Blacks ... and that even though we were separate, that we did achieve educationally.\"</em><br /> Ellen Turner Carpenter <br /> National Dunbar Alumni Association (NDM) Collection, University of Arkansas at Little Rock Archives and Special Collections <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Who was Paul Laurence Dunbar? </strong><br /> <br /> Hailed by Frederick Douglass as \"the most promising young colored man in America;' Paul Laurence Dunbar rose from meager beginnings to become the premier African-American poet of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dunbar was born on June 27, 1872, in Dayton, Ohio. His parents were former slaves from Kentucky. His mother, Matilda Murphy Dunbar, worked hard to support her family after Dunbar's father left, and she fostered a lifelong love of learning in her children. <br /> <br /> By the age of fourteen, Dunbar published poems in the Dayton Herald. During his lifetime his poetry was published in such mainstream journals as Atlantic Monthly and Saturday Evening Post. Dunbar married a young writer, Alice Ruth Moore of New Orleans, and soon began working at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, from 1897-98. Dust from the stacks of books aggravated his health problems and in 1906, Dunbar died from complications of tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> Throughout his short life, Dunbar gave poetry recitals across the United States and Europe. His use of dialect and colorful language earned him acclaim as the \"poet laureate of the Negro race.\" A collection of his poems was published in 1913, seven years after his death. <br /> <br /> In recognition of his accomplishments, many schools throughout the country are named in honor of Dunbar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Separate and Unequal </strong><br /> <br /> <em>\"I just couldn't wait until I finished elementary school so that I could enter Dunbar.\"</em><br /> Boston L. Torrence, Jr. <br /> NDAA collection/UALR Archives and Special Collections <br /> <br /> Although Dunbar was a model school for African Americans in Arkansas before integration, facilities available to whites and African Americans remained unequal. Dunbar High School housed both a junior and senior high school, as well as a junior college. Classes emphasized vocational and liberal arts training for all pupils. Students could earn a high school diploma, a trade certificate, or both. They also could prepare to attend college or enter the workforce, equipped with a marketable skill. The school played a large role in nurturing the children of Little Rock's African American community. Students from other parts of Arkansas came to Little Rock to live with relatives in order to have the opportunity to study at Dunbar. <br /> <br /> The curriculum at Dunbar provided the students with an understanding of their heritage and of African American achievements. Dunbar High School became known as a model of academic excellence for African Americans in Arkansas despite its limited facilities and funding. Dunbar gave students the foundation they needed to continue their educations and many Dunbar students earned advanced degrees. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Comparisons between Paul Laurence Dunbar High School and Little Rock Senior (Central) High School [from inception until 1955]</strong><br /> <br /> Cost to build<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - $400,000 in 1929<br /> Little Rock Senior High School - $1,500,000 in 1927<br /> <br /> Funding<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - Rosenwald Fund and Rockefeller General Education Fund <br /> Little Rock Senior High School - Little Rock School Board <br /> <br /> Student Capacity<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - 1,600<br /> Little Rock Senior High School - 3,000 <br /> <br /> Square Footage of School<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - 200,000 sq. feet<br /> Little Rock Senior High School - 600,000 sq. feet<br /> <br /> Classrooms<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - 34<br /> Little Rock Senior High School - 100<br /> <br /> Textbooks<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - \"Hand-me-downs\"<br /> Little Rock Senior High School - Purchased New<br /> <br /> Library Books<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - 5,000<br /> Little Rock Senior High School - 11,000<br /> <br /> Athletic Facilities<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - No gymnasium or practice fields <br /> Little Rock Senior High School - Gymnasium & stadium <br /> <br /> Salary for School Principal<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - $344 per month<br /> Little Rock Senior High School - $500 per month<br /> <br /> Levels of Instruction<br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar High School - Junior High, High School, Junior College <br /> Little Rock Senior High School - High School, Junior College <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Dunbar Magnet Middle School Today </strong><br /> <br /> In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court mandated an end to racially segregated public schools when it rendered the<em> Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em> and <em>Brown II </em>decisions in 1954 and 1955, respectively. The Little Rock School Board developed a plan for gradual desegregation beginning at the high school level. In 1955, Dunbar High School became a junior high and Horace Mann opened as the new senior high school for African-American students. <br /> <br /> Between 1955 and 1999 Dunbar served as a junior high school and now it is a Magnet Middle School, offering specialty classes in international studies. In the fall of 1980, Dunbar was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. <br /> <br /> Over the years Dunbar graduates have formed nationwide alumni chapters to promote the civic, educational, and social interests of their communities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

During this time Philander Smith College opened its doors to the students. The faculty provided tutorial opportunities for the students to enable them to stay current with their studies and rejoin their white classmates. </p> <p><em>“Realizing that the dilemma of integration wasn’t going to be resolved quickly, everybody seemed to be concerned about our falling behind in our schoolwork. Teachers from our community along with other professionals were offering to give us books and to tutor us. It felt good to dress in school clothes and go to Philander Smith, our community’s college. For part of each day, I studied schoolwork and spent time with my eight friends, enjoying a thimbleful of normality.” </em></p> <p>Melba Patillo Beals, Little Rock Nine</p>   <p><strong>The Faculty Responds </strong></p> <p>Dr. Ozell Sutton attended Philander College and graduated in 1950. He was the president of the Little Rock chapter of Philander Alumni. He recalled his involvement in tutoring the Little Rock Nine.:</p> <p><em>“The subject of the tutorial was how do we get through this?  We learned strength, vitality, and throughout the civil rights movement that young people were our contacts with what ought to be. They (Little Rock Nine) forced me to act out my commitment...I learned how to struggle, and what it means to be committed...Philander was there, willing and ready to assist.” </em></p>   <p><strong>Philander Students Continue the Fight </strong></p> <p>In March 1960, nearly 50 students participated in a sit-in demonstration at Woolworth’s lunch counter in downtown Little Rock. Store managers closed the lunch counter and five Philander Smith College students were arrested after refusing to leave. They were charged with loitering and with “creating a disturbance in a public place.” Chief of Police Eugene Smith reported that all five were “sitting there with their backs to the counter” reading books and magazines. </p> <p>George Howard, Jr., an attorney for the five students argued in court that the arrests were a violation of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. He said that criminal laws should not be used to help private business owners deprive customers of equal treatment. </p>   <p><strong>September 1997  </strong></p> <p>In 1997, President Bill Clinton attended a candlelight vigil at Philander Smith College in observance of the 40th anniversary of the Central High desegregation crisis. In his speech, he stated, </p> <p><em>“...Parents and family members who were threatened with the loss of their jobs, neigh­bors who gave them everything from money to food to transportation and, of course, the faculty here at Philander Smith, who volun­teered to tutor them, [gave] an extraordinary gift. And I would say to all of you who were involved in that, they all turned out pretty well, and I thank you for that.” </em></p>   <p><strong>What Is An HBCU? </strong></p> <p>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are postsecondary institutions that were originally founded for the purpose of providing educational opportunities for African Americans before and after the Civil War. </p> <p>Today, there are over 100 HBCUs, located in 20 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. They include accredited two- and four-year as well as graduate and professional institutions.<strong> </strong></p>   <p><strong>Philander Smith Today</strong></p> <p>Philander Smith College was established in Little Rock in 1877 to provide educational opportunities for former slaves following the Civil War. The college was opened under the supervision of the Freedmen’s Aid Society of The Methodist Episcopal Church, and it was named Walden Seminary.  In 1882, Adeline Smith, widow of Philander Smith-an Illinois philanthropist-donated $10,500 to Walden Seminary. The school’s trustees renamed the institution Philander Smith College in recognition of this gift. Philander Smith College awarded its first baccalaureate degree in 1888 and became accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1949. </p> <p>Today, Philander Smith College is one of four historically black colleges and universities in Arkansas and is affiliated with the United Methodist Church and the United Negro College Fund.  The college places special emphasis upon the importance of service among its faculty and students and encourages their participation in the greater Little Rock community.  Among its illustrious alumni, Philander Smith College includes Dr. Joycelyn Elders, former U.S. Surgeon General, Charles Adams, an inventor who developed the U.S. Postal Service sorting machine, and Huburt “Geese” Ausbie, former Harlem Globetrotter. <br /> <br /> <em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/hbcu\">Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve the historic structures on HBCU campuses, funded restoration and renovation work on the James Monroe Cox Administration Building at Philander Smith College in 2018. </em></p>",

While most of the CVNHP is located within the Lake Champlain Basin, the designation extends southward into Bennington and Saratoga counties. The legislation also contains CVNHP activities to the counties that border Lake Champlain, Lake George, the Champlain Canal and the Upper Hudson River.<br /> <br /> The LCBP works in partnership with government agencies from New York, Vermont, and Quebec, private organizations, local communities, and individuals to coordinate and fund efforts which benefit the Lake Champlain Basin's water quality, fisheries, wetlands, wildlife, recreation, and cultural resources.

Most of the hike gradually gains elevation, leading to a scenic overlook with a bench. The last 100 yards to the summit is strenuous. At this section of the trail, a handrail assists walkers with the uneven footing up the steep terrain to the peak. Give the rail a wiggle to ensure firmness before use. Please remain on the trail, and don't cut the switchbacks.<br />  </p> <p><strong>History</strong></p> <p>The Faulkner trail was carefully constructed in 1937 by Marianne Faulkner in memory of her husband Edward Daniels Faulkner. She designed it to mirror gentle \"cardiac health\" trails in the spa town of Baden Baden, Germany. It connects the town of Woodstock with the trails of Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Park.</p> <p>The Faulkner Trail has been continually maintained and repaired by groups including: the National Park Service Rivers Trails and Conservation Assistance Program; the Billings Park Commission;Vermont Youth Conservation Corps and the Student Conservation Association.</p>",

        "notes": "Gardens at Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller NHP\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/gardens-at-marsh-billings-rockefeller-nhp.htm\n\nWhen Frederick Billings bought the Marsh property in 1869, he immediately hired Robert Morris Copeland to design the Mansion's grounds. Copeland, a well-known Boston landscape architect, planned formal gardens encircling the house and a reconfigured front drive. He took down the white picket fence built by the Marsh family and created a much larger front lawn from former pasture land.<br /> <br /> In keeping with the romanticism that prevailed in landscape design, Copeland created curving beds with natural lines. Billings also ordered the construction of two Adirondack-style summer houses, a Swiss cottage-style structure called a belvedere, greenhouses and a garden shed.<br /> <br /> In 1899, Billings' widow Julia Parmly Billings retained the services of Charles A. Platt, a celebrated landscape and structural architect who summered nearby in the Cornish Art Colony in Cornish, New Hampshire. Platt added garden seats and a fountain and may have designed the terrace gardens that still exist today. In 1902, Mrs. Billings hired Martha Brooks Hutcheson, one of the first female landscape architects in America, to redesign the approach to the house. Ten years later, Ellen Shipman, who was also connected with the Cornish Art Colony, redesigned the formal plantings near the Mansion.<br /> <br /> When Laurance and Mary Rockefeller took over the property in 1954, they hired landscape architect Zenon Schreiber, who made extensive additions to the property, including a waterfall garden and rock gardens.<br /> <br /> Today, the gardens at Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park include an azalea and rhododendron garden, rock garden, cutting garden, a hemlock hedgerow, a dense stand of Norway spruce, and many other plantings, all expressing the many-layered design and development of the gardens and grounds through four generations of dedicated stewardship.<br /> <br /> For information on garden tours visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mabi/planyourvisit/guidedtours.htm\">Guided Tours</a> page.

A mansard roof, pointed gable dormers, tall chimneys and a verandah were added and the trim was painted in two or more different colors.<br /> <br /> In 1885, Billings hired the renowned architect and author Henry Hudson Holly to remodel the house in the newly-fashionable Queen Anne style. The mansard roof was removed and Holly added much ornamental brickwork. The third story and service wing were enlarged and the interiors were redecorated in lavish Victorian style. The Tiffany Glass Company of New York designed several stained glass windows and provided the wallpapers and fabrics for the newly-decorated home.<br /> <br /> After Billings' death in 1890, his wife, Julia, and daughters, Laura Billings Lee, Mary Montagu Billings French, and Elizabeth Billings, took over the care of the property.<br /> <br /> The Billings Mansion remained virtually unchanged until 1954, when Mary Billings French's daughter, Mary French Rockefeller, inherited the home and estate with her husband, Laurance Rockefeller, son of John D. Rockefeller Jr. While the Rockefellers updated rooms and replaced many wallpapers, paints and upholsteries, the house remains an excellent example of the Queen Anne style.<br /> <br /> In 1967, the house was designated as a National Historic Landmark. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, dedicated the house in a special ceremony, attesting to the care and sense of heritage with which Mary and Laurance Rockefeller preserved the property. In June of 1998, on the opening day of the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park, Mrs. Johnson returned to Woodstock to rededicate the house with a plaque honoring all three generations of conservationists who have lived on the site.<br /> <br /> The mansion exterior, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/gardens-at-marsh-billings-rockefeller-nhp.htm\">gardens</a>, and grounds are open year-round from dawn to dusk. Tours of the interior mansion are available from May-October.

It was designed in the 1870s by Detlef Lienau, the architect best known for his introduction of the mansard roof to the United States. The two-story Belvedere, which means \"beautiful view,\" features a low-profile cruciform shape cross-gable roof with wide overhanging bracketed eaves, fanciful scrollwork detailing, and a second-story verandah reminiscent of a Swiss cottage.<br /> <br /> In the 1950s, the Rockefellers hired architect Theodor Muller to renovate all the buildings on the property. Muller remodeled the Belvedere's interior including the Bowling Alley, complete with a soda fountain, and added pool changing rooms. The last major change to the Belvedere Complex occurred in the early 1960s when the Rockefeller family had a fallout shelter constructed in the basement of the Belvedere, beneath the Bowling Alley. Designed by Muller during the height of the Cold War era, the shelters were intended to protect the family in the event of a nuclear war. Today, the complex is virtually unchanged since the end of the Rockefeller era and is still furnished and decorated with the family's belongings.<br /> <br /> The exterior of the Belvedere is accessible to visitors year round.

        "notes": "Craters of the Moon, the Oregon Trail\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/craters-of-the-moon-the-oregon-trail.htm\n\n<figure> <h2>History</h2> <h3>A Safer Alternative</h3> </figure> <p>The Oregon Trail followed the course of the Snake River, about 100 miles south of the monument. In 1852, John Jeffrey began promoting a spur trail which traced traditional Shoshone migration routes. He wanted to generate business for his ferry at the mouth of the Blackfoot River. Although the cutoff received some use from 1852-1854, it was not until a decade later that a large percentage of Oregon Trail traffic chose the route.</p> <p>In 1862, an emigrant party asked guide Tim Goodale to lead them west from Fort Hall on the cutoff pioneered by Jeffrey. They hoped the alternate trail would enable them to reach the Salmon River gold fields more directly. Goodale succeeded in leading a group of 1,095 people, 338 wagons, and 2,900 head of stock safely from Fort Hall to Boise. It took this enormous wagon train -- the largest to travel any section of the Oregon Trail -- over 3 hours to get into or out of camp.</p> <p>By 1862, the Northern Shoshone and Bannock tribes were beginning to resist the intrusion of emigrants into their homeland. Skirmishes occurred between the Shoshone and emigrants near <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/massacre-rocks-state-park.htm\">Massacre Rocks State Park</a>. The growing hostility along the trail resulted in increased demand for a safe alternative. In 1863, seven out of every ten wagons en route from Fort Hall to Boise took Goodale's Cutoff instead of the main Oregon Trail.</p> <h3>Skirting the Lava Flows</h3> <p><br /> The 230-mile spur headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte, a conspicuous landmark on the Snake River Plain. From there it passed near the present-day town of Arco, wound through the northern part of Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, went southwest to Camas Prairie, and ended at Fort Boise. This journey typically took two to three weeks.</p> <p>Goodale's Cutoff took its toll on the travelers and their wagons. The rugged lava restricted travel to one lane, so progress was slow.</p> <p>The path along the edge of the lava flows was circuitous. The emigrants typically passed through in late July, the hottest part of the summer. Wood dried out in the desert air and shrank, causing wheels and boxes to come apart. Pioneers wrote of finding pieces of broken wagons littering the trail.</p> <p>For nearly 50 years, westward-bound pioneers used Goodale's Cutoff. Later, miners moving ore to railroad depots and stagecoaches carrying passengers to the towns of southern Idaho took the route. But the advent of the railroad and automobile led to the demise of Goodale's Cutoff as a wagon route. Today those driving US-20, which follows sections of the route, need not concern themselves with survival and can take time to appreciate the unique beauty of the harsh landscape.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location: </strong>Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along Highway 20/26/93 between Arco and Carey.</p>   <ul> <li>The route winds through the northern end of the monument out of sight of the road and intersects the highway 3.5 miles west of the visitor center. From that point on, watch for the dirt road as it follows the edge of the lava flows north of the highway.</li> <li>The cutoff is particularly easy to pick out 5.7 miles west of the visitor center, where the road drops down a steep incline. Look to the slope north of the road, where several earlier routes through this notch are visible. The highest road is Goodale's Cutoff.</li> <li>At Lava Lake, 11.3 miles west of the visitor center, there is a historical marker which describes Goodale's Cutoff.</li> </ul> <p>Goodale's Cutoff is not accessible by car within Craters of the Moon. Check at the visitor center for more information on where to see the trail.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/crmo/index.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Individuals seeking challenge and solitude will find both while cross-country hiking through the sage-brush covered flats and rugged lava flows of the monument and preserve.</p> <h3>Travel Restrictions</h3> <p>Cross-country motorized travel is not allowed anywhere within the preserve except immediately adjacent to roads and trails for purposes of parking, turning around, or passing another vehicle.<br /> <br /> Additional travel restrictions are in effect in certain areas to protect wildlife and sensitive features. Roads designated with seasonal closures may only be used during the open period. Permission from private land owners is required to cross private land unless legal access is provided by a federal, state, or county road.</p> <h3>Safety</h3> <p>Outside of the developed monument, there are no services and marginal phone coverage in the park. Exploring these areas requires special planning and an awareness of potential hazards. Bring a map, compass or GPS, a reliable form of communication, first-aid kit, sun protection, fire extinguisher, shovel, and plenty of water, food, and fuel. Always let someone know where you are traveling to and when you will return. <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/idaho/craters-of-the-moon\">A full travel map can be downloaded from the BLM's website.</a></p> <h3>Prevent Wildfires</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Never park or drive on dry grass. The exterior of your exhaust system can reach temperatures up to 1000°F, igniting fires in dry vegetation. Vegetation can also gather on top of your exhaust system causing it to ignite. Equipping your vehicle with a proper exhaust system and spark arrestor may help to prevent this.</p> </li> <li>Include a fire extinguisher and a shovel in your vehicle as standard equipment.</li> <li>Fireworks are prohibited on both BLM and NPS land.</li> </ul> <h3>Hunting</h3> <p>Hunting is permitted within the BLM monument and in the NPS preserve. Firearms may only be used for lawful hunting in accord with state law in these areas. No trapping is allowed in any area managed by the NPS. For the protection of your health and the health of wildlife, hunters are encouraged to use non-lead bullets.</p> <h3>Grazing</h3> <p>Grazing is permitted within the BLM Monument by ranchers with valid permits. If you encounter sheep or cattle on a road or trail, make them aware of your presence and move by slowly without startling them. If you open a gate, please close it properly to keep livestock where they are supposed to be.</p>",

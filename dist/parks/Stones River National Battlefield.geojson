Rosecrans, arrived at Murfreesboro. Troops occupied this area along McFadden’s Lane (called Van Cleve Lane today). As night fell, soldiers struggled to sleep in the freezing mud without campfires, knowing a major battle was imminent. For thousands, that night would be their last.</em><br /> <br /> On December 30, 1862, the Union army set its lines with its left lying on the Stones River, running south along McFadden's Lane. This line stretched for about three miles. The Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by General Braxton Bragg, held roughly parallel positions from a quarter to half mile to the east.<br /> <br /> While the men in blue and gray tried to rest, the commanders planned the coming fight. Generals Rosecrans and Bragg ultimately came up with similar plans.

The Confederate divisions of Generals McCown and Cleburne smashed into the right flank of the Union lines near the intersection of Gresham Lane and the Franklin Pike. The Union right crumbled and were soon sent flying north and west in disarray.<br /> <br /> Further down the Union line, Gen. Philip Sheridan had his men up and ready to fight by 4 AM. As the Confederates descended upon their position, they stopped and beat back attacks to their front. However, they soon had to contend with the threats to their right and rear as the Union line continued to fall back. Sheridan's division bent backwards as they struggled to keep the enemy in front of them. In the process, two of Sheridan's brigade commanders, Gen. Joshua Sill and Col. George Roberts, were killed. Some of Sheridan's regiments lost more than half their men before they moved north of the Wilkinson Pike to the cover of the dense cedar forest.While Sheridan's division slowly bent back to the Wilkinson Pike, Gen. James Negley's men stood their ground. They beat back several Confederate attacks from the east.</p> <p>Private J.E. Robuck of the 29th Mississippi Infantry described the fighting here:<br /> <br /> <em><strong>\"Our regiment was on a large field in which corn had grown, but the stalks had been cut. The Yankees had planted a battery in the cedar grove across the field, and the... regiments were ordered to charge and take the battery. When we started across the field I thought those were the deepest middles between corn rows that I had ever seen... They were among the trees, while were in an open field, so they were just mowing us down like weeds. We were ordered to fall down … to escape their bullets, shells and cannon balls. I changed my opinion about the middles – they appeared to be entirely too shallow.\"</strong></em><br /> <br /> By 10 AM, the Confederates had pushed Sheridan and Negley into a \"V' formation. Sheridan's lines faced south, while Negley's division still fired to the east. This dangerous position risked seeing both divisions cut off from the rest of the army as the Confederates attacked from all sides.<br /> <br /> Yet, they had no choice! Orders had arrived from Gen. Rosecrans informing both generals that they must hold to buy time for the rest of their army to regroup along the Nashville Pike.<br /> <br /> Upon receiving their orders to stand fast, Gen. Negley's men sought safety among the limestone outcroppings and trees behind them. It worked for a time. The Union forces here stalled nearly half the Confederate army for two hours. At noon, Sheridan's lines finally broke. This allowed Confederate soldiers to begin to surround Negley's men from the rear. The boys in blue found their rocky shelter had now become a death trap.<br /> <br /> Learn more about the fighting in the Slaughter Pen by watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Uu78fYVs0\">this video</a> from our friends at the <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/\">American Battlefield Trust</a>.</p>",

Pursuing Confederates entering the cotton field were greeted by cannon fire. A Texan recalled, “the artillery opened up on us . . . and it seemed that the heavens and the earth were coming together.” At dark both sides dug in for the night. Rosecrans’s army had been pushed back three miles, but the Confederates had failed to capture the pike.</em><br /> <br /> As the fighting raged on in the Slaughter Pen, Gen. Rosecrans was spending the time bought by Sheridan and Negley well. Rosecrans canceled his attack across the Stones River and sent reserve units into the fight. He rallied the shattered and fleeing troops from the earlier Confederate assault. To support them, he positioned large numbers of artillery on the heights between the road and the railroad. Here, over thirty cannons had a clear shot at the Confederates as they emerged from the forest.<br /> <br /> Rosecrans reformed his line into a horseshoe to protect the Nashville Pike. This vital road was Rosecrans only means of retreat should the army falter. If the Confederates could take the road, Union defeat would be certain.<br /> <br /> Confederates arrived piecemeal at the tree line south of the Nashville Pike. Tired, running low on ammunition, and disorganized, they had been moving nonstop since the attack began that morning. The thick cedar forest had slowed their advance and cut them off from their supply wagons.<br /> <br /> Gen. James Rains was one of the first Confederate commanders to arrive at the edge of the tree line. He seized the initiative and ordered his men forward towards the Nashville Pike. A storm of musket and cannon fire tore through the Confederate ranks and killed Rains almost as soon as he left the cover of the trees. Their attack soon fizzled out.<br /> <br /> Gen. George Maney thought a larger attack would fare better. He ordered his men to hold at the fence line to wait for more Confederate forces before attacking, but his attack failed as well. That afternoon, ever larger Confederate attacks continued to push across the fields towards the Nashville Pike. Each time, they stalled and broke under the relentless and devastating fire of Union infantry and artillery.<br /> <br /> As the day ended, it became clear that the Confederates would not be able to take the Nashville Pike here. They could only hope their comrades further down the line were more successful.<br /> <br /> Learn more about the struggle for control of the Nashville Pike by watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_KUEMN1zxE\">this video</a> from our friends at the <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/\">American Battlefield Trust</a>.",

The Chicago Board of Trade Battery sprang to action as the Pioneer Brigade poured volley after volley into the gray ranks. Canister charges forced the Confederates back to the cedars.</em><br /> <br /> Shouts of “Give them hell!” rose up from the men who fought on this ground. As the Confederates broke through the tree line onto this field, two untested units anchored this part of the Union line: The Chicago Board of Trade Battery and the Pioneer Brigade.<br /> <br /> The Chicago Board of Trade Battery's creation was in response to President Lincoln's call for 300,000 volunteers. The unit took on the name of their sponsors, the wealthy businessmen and merchants of the Chicago Board of Trade. The Stones River Campaign was their first taste of combat. Their assignment was to support another unit, the Pioneer Brigade, as it carried out its duties.<br /> <br /> Union General William S. Rosecrans understood that an army on the march was only as good as the roads that carried them. To address this, he ordered that two men from each company in the army be selected for their skill with an ax and shovel to serve in a Pioneer Brigade. The Pioneers built and repaired roads, bridges, and fortifications. When the army encountered the enemy, they were to return to their original units and take up arms.<br /> <br /> When the fight came to the Pioneers at Stones River, there was no time for them to return to their original units.<br /> <br /> On the afternoon of December 31, 1862, the Confederates attacked the Union troops here three times. The Confederates came within 50 yards of the Union line before they faltered. A Union sergeant of the Pioneer Brigade recalled “t<em>he rebel flag, seen dimly through the smoke and trees, wavered, started forward, and then surged back. Yes! There was no mistake about it! It was going back!</em>”<br /> <br /> The Chicago Board of Trade Battery fired nearly thirteen hundred rounds into their attackers that afternoon. The Union counter-charged, and the line moved forward about a quarter of a mile to a small ridge lost earlier in the day.<br /> <br /> The Chicago Board of Trade Battery and the Pioneer Brigade had passed their baptism of fire, and by doing so, kept the Nashville Pike in Union hands.",

Confederate General Bragg thought that Union General Rosecrans would retreat back towards Nashville. Instead, Rosecrans decided that they should stay and fight, and prepared to defend his position.<br /> <br /> Union Gen. Horatio P. Van Cleve's division, commanded by Gen. Sam Beatty, moved down the dirt road leading from the McFadden family farm to the river. They crossed and took up position on a hill east of the river that stood as the highest ground on the battlefield. The soldiers worked through the night to fortify three lines of defense.<br /> <br /> On the morning of January 2, 1863, Confederate Gen. John C. Breckinridge discovered the Federals had taken the high ground. He immediately reported the situation Gen. Braxton Bragg. Bragg knew his chances of victory were slim if he left his enemy in control of that position. He ordered Breckinridge to take the hill.<br /> <br /> Gen. Breckinridge reluctantly ordered his 4,500 men to attack with one round loaded and bayonets fixed to their muskets. The assault began at 4 PM. The Confederates charged forward and drove the enemy from the hill. They reformed and began pursuing the fleeing men in blue. For a moment, victory seemed to be within the Confederates' grasp.<br /> <br /> Along the opposite bank of the river, Union artillery trained their guns on the gray mass and waited for the chance to change the tide of the battle. As the Confederates came within range, the cannons began to fire. The earth shook and explosions ripped the air.

James St. Clair Morton designed the earthworks of Fortress Rosecrans. It covered more than 200 acres and protected supply warehouses and the railroad. Union engineers designed the fortress to hold up to 10,000 troops. The supply depot inside stored enough food, equipment, and ammunition to supply an army of 65,000 men for up to 90 days. It played a vital role during the campaigns to drive the Confederates from middle Tennessee and seize the vital railroad junction at Chattanooga, Tennessee.<br /> <br /> This fortress was a powerful deterrent and never came under attack. The defenses included nine perimeter lunettes bristling with cannons, curtain walls to cover the spaces between the lunettes, and four interior fortifications called redoubts that could serve as a last line of defense.<br /> <br /> Today, only fragments of the fortress survive. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stri/index.htm\">Stones River National Battlefield</a> preserves Lunettes Palmer and Thomas, Curtain Wall No. 2, and Redoubt Brannan.

It is the oldest American Civil War monument still standing in its original battlefield location.<br /> <br /> Col. William B. Hazen's brigade played a central role in the fighting at the Round Forest on the first day of the Battle of Stones River. Hazen's men held their position between the Nashville Pike and the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad through four Confederate attacks. The brigade's determined resistance ended the advance of the Confederate Army of Tennessee and kept it from pushing the Union Army of the Cumberland back to Nashville.<br /> <br /> After the battle, Hazen and Col. Isaac C. B. Suman, 9th Indiana Volunteers, felt there was a need for a monument to honor the soldiers who died at Stones River. Lt. Edward Crebbin, Company F, 9th Indiana, led a detail of soldiers who built the monument between June and October 1863.  They placed the monument in the midst of the 55 soldiers buried in the brigade cemetery. In 1864, two soldiers from the 115th Ohio Infantry carved the inscriptions on the monument.<br /> <br /> Two other monuments appeared on battlefields prior to 1863. A monument commemorating the death of Col. Francis S. Bartow at the First Battle of Manssas was destroyed during the second battle on that site. The 32nd Indiana Monument originally marked the site of the Battle of Rowlett's Station (December 17, 1861). It was later moved to Cave Hill National Cemetery and is now located at the Frasier International History Museum in Louisville, Kentucky.<br /> <br />  </p>",

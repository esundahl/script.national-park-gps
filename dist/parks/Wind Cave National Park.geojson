You can see some of these to the right of the trail. Snags attract many forms of wildlife. For example some insects, such as longhorned beetles, lay their eggs in slips cut into the bark. When the larvae emerge from the eggs, they initially bore into the nutritious inner bark and eventually tunnel through the wood before developing into adult beetles. Some boreholes may be seen if you look closely at these snags.</p> <p>The longhorned beetled and the other insects found on the snags are an important food for many types of birds.

As soon as a rocky mass is pushed upward, forces of erosion slowly begin to level it again. Wind and rain wear it away, grain by grain. Freezing water expands, enlarging small cracks until the rocks begin to crumble.</p> <p>Lichens are often the first organisms to colonize the rocks. The dead lichens combined with dust from the air to become soil for mosses and small plants. As plant roots fill the cracks, the rocks break apart and the formation of soil continues.

Under most conditions, the forest expands its range and competes with the prairie for water and space. Wet years provided the moisture that allows young pine seedlings to establish themselves on the prairie. Given time and the right conditions they eventually will crowd out the grasses.</p> <p>Fire acts as the balancing mechanism, burning off trees and maintaining the prairie. Due to fire suppression practices over the past century, the forest has expanded. With the increase in forest size there has been a corresponding decrease in the amount of water flowing from the mountains. Trees, even ponderosa pines, need more water than grasses, so the streams of the Black Hills are smaller than they used to be, because of fire suppression. Historically, the lands of Wind Cave National Park burned every 8-12 years.</p>",

Fires opens the canopy of the forest allowing a healthy sub-canopy. The sub-canopy provides food and habitat for forest birds, mammals, and insects. Fire creates and maintains open areas needed by animals large and small. Fire thins the doghair stands allowing the remaining seedlings the space to grow.</p> <p>People have only recently recognized the importance of fire in maintaining healthy ecosystems. More than 100 years of fire suppression have resulted in heavy build-ups of dead vegetation and dense stands of trees. Because of these conditions, today’s wildlife tend to be larger, burn otter, and spread faster and farther. This makes them more severe, more dangerous, and more costly in human, economic, and ecological terms.</p> <p>Today in Wind Cave National Park, wildfires are suppressed.

This collision created the Rocky Mountains, but also produced a rippling effect in the earth's crust producing the dome mountains that we now call the Black Hills.<br /> <br /> The Rockies and the Black Hills greatly influence weather by creating a barrier for storms. Clouds, coming from the north ro west, are forced upward and cooled causing moisture to be released in the northern hills, or to be diverted around the hills.

Look around and you will see that three of the park's ecosystems meet at this very spot. Where ecosystems meet is called an edge. This edge is exciting becasue it has characteristics of the forest, prairie and riparian areas, making it very diverse. Forest animals, such as deer and elk, feed along the edges during dawn and dusk then return to the shelter of the forest during the day. Edges provide both food and shelter, which is why you will often see more wildlife in these areas.<br /> <br /> Edges are constantly changing. As the trees drop pine cones onto the prairie, seedlings begin to grow. When fire sweeps across the land it burns the young seedlings, reclaiming land for the prairie. In years between fires, seedlings again flourish. This cycle has occurred throughout history under natural conditions. As you hike look for signs of the fire cycle. Also, think about why many animals prefer to live \"life on the edge.\"",

Fire is probably the most significant force in a pine forest, but something as commonplace as the falling of a large tree can open the forest canopy and let sunlight reach the forest floor. Then, after a few years in that sunny place, conditions are right for the growth of grasses, wildflowers, and some shrubs. Conditions are also right for the sprouting of pine seedlings from the surrounding trees. This combination of grasses, shrubs, and seedlings provide ideal cover and food for wildlife.",

For instance, you might find yourself asking, \"why am I suddenly walking in a ponderosa pine forest? Why is it here?\" For an answer, you need to consider two things, moisture and soil. <br /> <br /> Moisture is necessary in every community. The movement of water through the soil and the amount of water available to vegetation is influenced by soil texture. Because ponderosa pine trees grow best on well-drained, silty soils they are usually found on the park's hilltops where this type of soil exists. These pines seldom grow in the middle of the prairie due to unfavorable soil conditions and a lack of moisture.<br /> <br /> Moisture is also important for the germination of pine seeds. Once germinated, the nourishment contained in the seed enables it to send down a fast-growing tap root. Because this root grows deeply, the seedling can better survive wind and drought. Look for seedlings as you walk. Do they grow close together or far apart? Why would this happen?",

The cones of a ponderosa pine require two years to mature before releasing their seeds. Once released, the seeds must have the right conditions to germinate and grow. Growth depends on soil texture, plant competition, seedling condition, and moisture. Moisture is the critical factor. The ponderosa pine’s fast growing taproot seeks out moisture at many levels within the soil. But even before germination the seed may be eaten by mammals or birds.</p> <p>If conditions are right, many seeds may germinate and the seedlings must compete for survival. Trees growing close together are called “doghair”. Fire is the major force that things these doghair stands, allowing the surviving trees to get the required nutrients, moisture, and sunlight.</p>",

While Smokey has done a great job of reminding us to be careful with fire, we must be aware that fire can also be a friend. <br /> <br /> Consider these ponderosa pines. They are prolific and under the right conditions, like the ones found here, many seedlings will survive. This creates very dense stands of small trees like you see beyond the fence. Because of competition for nutrients, moisture, and sunlight, few seedlings grow into mature trees. Historically, fire has prevented the trees from becoming overcrowded by killing many of the smaller ones. This thinning also allows more sunlight to reach the ground encouraging grasses to grow on the forest floor. As you walk the path, notice how fire has thinned out the forest yet left many trees standing. <br /> <br /> Although fire is beneficial to the forest, human structures and lives must be protected. Today, the National Park Service is using prescribed fire, one started under carefully calculated conditions, to keep the soil and vegetation healthy and in a more natural state. ",

Her style is unique in that she teaches from example and rarely announces an exam. As a student of nature, you will need to do lots of field work - closely observe and expect the unexpected. <br /> <br /> Because fire can be beneficial or destructive, it is a hard lesson to learn. But destruction is often greater when we interfere with its natural cycle. Since the first Euro-American settlements in the 1880s until the early 1970s, fire was immediately suppressed. As a result, many of the forests have become crowded and stagnant with large amounts of forest debris. Increases in dead material has meant more fuel is available to produce hotter, more destructive fires.<br /> <br /> At Wind Cave National Park, managers are attempting to catch up with the fire cycle, yet reduce the odds of fire spreading to buildings or neighboring lands. To reduce fuels, managers remove part of the forest's understory. The tree stumps in front of you serve as an example. However, beyond the fence no fuels were removed. In 1991, a wildfire burned this area. Comparing the forest beyond the fence with the one here, you can see how fuel removal reduced the severity of the fire in the campground. Removal of fuels may become less common as prescribed burns allow us to catch up with fire's natural cycle.",

As you've seen the prairie, forest and riparian ecosystems blend to create a truly spectacular landscape. However, when viewing the park over a distance it is easy to conclude that the land, with its gentle rolling hills, lacks complexity. This deception in itself is amazing. In a way the terrain is somewhat like the sea. From the shore it appears to be little more than rolling waves. Who would suspect, without close examination, that below the surface lies a complex web of life that may never be fully understood? That complexity and the forces that make it possible are important to a balanced ecology. <br /> <br /> Wind Cave National Park is working to protect this balance by allowing natural processes to continue to shape the land. This is a difficult task. There are many challenges to be met, such as the encroachment of non-native plants onto the prairie and misunderstandings of the importance of fire.<br /> <br /> As you travel across the prairie, along the riparian habitat or through the forest, think of the broad spectrum of life that each supports.

Continue north on route 87 for 4.4 miles. Just before you enter Custer State Park, turn onto a gravel road called NPS 5. Drive 4 miles to a lone pine tree on the right side of the road. Park at the gravel parking area to the left. Look to the valley below.<br /> <br /> The Spearfish Formation is composed of red shales and siltstones, both are extremely fine grained sedimentary rocks. The red color comes form iron oxides. The Spearfish Formation is often called Red Valley. The shales and siltstones have formed a valley because they are easily eroded in the semi-arid Black Hills climate.<br /> <br /> The Inyan Kara Group consists of iron rich sandstones and claystones that form the hogback ridge that defines the outer rim of the Black Hills.<br /> <br /> If you want, take a walk toward the valley. Can you see evidence that water has eroded the shales and siltstones?<br /> <br /> As the last stop on the geology driving tour, you are invited to continue your drive through the park. Driving north along NPS 6 will take you along Red Valley into Custer State Park. Alternatively, continuing south on NPS 5 will take you out of the park to 7-11 Road (Custer County Road 101).

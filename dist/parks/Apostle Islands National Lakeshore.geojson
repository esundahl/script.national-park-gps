Although the Bayfield Peninsula lies just over a mile away, visitors are rewarded with the isolation and solitude of an island experience. Low cliffs of brown sandstone or banks of broken stone and red clay meet Lake Superior along Basswood’s shoreline. An isolated sandstone block, called “Lone Rock” or “Honeymoon Rock” lies off the island’s north tip. A dense growth of forest is broken only by several small clearings, the result of historic activities. The geology; the forests; and evidence of logging, quarrying, and farming are all vital components of Basswood’s story - a story to be “read” by the observant island visitor.</p> <h4 itemprop=\"name\">Boating, Camping, Hunting, and Hiking</h4> <p itemprop=\"name\">Apostle Islands National Lakeshore offers visitors the opportunity to experience and enjoy a variety of natural and cultural features. Visitors must do their part to help protect park resources. Please follow the seven principles of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/leavenotrace.htm\">“Leave No Trace”</a> outdoor ethics.<br /> <br /> A 70 foot long dock is located midway up the west side of the island near the outlet of a small stream. The maximum depth of water at the end of the dock is 4-6 feet. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">Boaters</a> planning to moor overnight are cautioned that this dock is exposed to winds from the southwest and northwest. A rock landing is located at the south end of the island near campsite #1. Captains are encouraged to monitor marine weather forecasts for weather and wave conditions. Persons traveling to the island in small boats, canoes or kayaks should pay attention to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/weather.htm\">weather conditions</a> and proceed with caution. Permits are required for all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping-permits-reservations.htm\">camping</a> and are available at the national lakeshore visitor center in Bayfield. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/basswood-campsites.htm\">Campsites:</a> four are located at the south end of the island near the brownstone quarry. Two more are located near a clearing 200 yards from the dock. A group campsite is in the clearing, along with a vault toilet.<br /> <br /> A special <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/hunting.htm\">deer hunt</a> for hunters using muzzle loading rifles takes place on Oak and Basswood islands in October. A limited number of permits are available. Contact Apostle Islands National Lakeshore's superintendent for details.<br /> <br /> Hiking: a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">5 1/2 mile loop trail</a> begins and ends near a clearing up the hill from the dock. </p> <h4 itemprop=\"name\">Brownstone, Lumber, and Crops</h4> <p>The Lake Superior brownstone industry began in 1869 when sandstone from Basswood Island was selected for Milwaukee County’s courthouse. Steam drills and derricks cut and moved the stone and, by 1871, brownstone was being shipped to Chicago to replace buildings lost in the great fire. In 1883, the new courthouse in Bayfield (now Park headquarters) was built of Basswood Island brownstone. Changing architectural styles and the economic crash of 1893 brought an end to the brownstone industry.<br /> <br /> Logging on Basswood Island began in conjunction with quarry activities and continued until the 1950s. Eastern hemlock, one of the first species harvested, was important to the leather industry. Two million board feet of white pine were harvested from the island’s northeast side in the 1890s. In the 1940s, a small logging camp was located in what is now a campground near Basswood Island’s dock. This operation harvested aspen and fir for pulpwood and yellow birch for veneer.<br /> <br /> Several farmers have taken advantage of the island’s extended growing season. The McCloud-Brigham farm, located in the north central portion of the island, was the largest. None of the five buildings once at the site remain standing.</p> <blockquote> <p><span style=\"color:#663333;\"><em>“A Mammoth Pumpkin weighing eighty-one pounds, a snake cucumber about four feet long, and some monster potatoes, which measure no less than eight inches in diameter. They are the products of Basswood Island, that wonderful place for farm products of mammoth proportions.”</em> - Bayfield County Press, 1877.</span></p> </blockquote> <p>Richard McCloud filed a homestead claim for property on Basswood Island in 1865. By 1871 he built a log home and cultivated five acres. The farm provided produce, including six varieties of onions and ten varieties of corn, for workers at the Strong, French & Co.’s quarry on the island. Richard McCloud and his brother Joseph operated the farm until Joseph’s death in 1900.<br /> <br /> In 1903, E. K. Brigham and his five sons began logging Basswood Island. They established their logging camp at the former McCloud farm. The camp housed as many as 50 men. The Brighams found markets far and near for the island’s white pine, hemlock, oak, and other hardwoods. Some timbers were cut in 24 foot lengths and shipped all the way to England for dock construction. Other trees were cut in three foot lengths and hauled across the ice to Bayfield to burn in the school furnace. After the timber was cut, the Brighams converted the old bunkhouse into a summer home. They planted several hundred apple and cherry trees at the farm and raised as many as seventeen cows. Although the property was never farmed after E. K. Brigham’s death in 1923, it stayed in the family until 1967.</p>",

It is the farthest north of the 22 island archipelago. The small island boasts intricate sandstone sea caves, a one mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">hiking trail</a> connecting the north and south end of the island, a lighthouse, and one<span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">campsite</a> near the dock on the southern end of the island. The sea caves and cliffs under the lighthouse are some of the most alluring within the national lakeshore. The carved delicate arches, vaulted chambers, and honeycombed passageways are a beautiful sight to behold. </p> <h4>Lighthouse</h4> <p align=\"left\">The history of Devils Island centers around the lighthouse. The eighth and final lighthouse was lite in the Apostle Islands on Devils Islands in 1891. A two-story, red brick, Queen Anne- style keeper's dwelling and a building for the steam fog signal were completed at this time, but the light was placed in a temporary tower. The tower, made of wooden timbers, held a fourth order, red light.</p> <p align=\"left\">A two-story, brick and shingle house similar in design to the keeper's dwelling was built for the assistant keepers in 1897. Work began on the permanent tower, an 82- foot tall steel cylinder, that same year. Although the tower was ready in the fall of 1898, there was a three year delay in supplying it with a lens. A third order lens from the Paris firm of H. Lepaute finally arrived in April 1901. The permanent tower was placed in service shortly afterward, and the temporary tower torn down the same year. The lighthouse was originally designed as a plain, self-supporting cylinder, but the high winds of its exposed location caused the tower to shake so badly that light keepers complained that the motion sometimes extinguished the lamp. In 1914, the Lighthouse Service reinforced the structure with external braces, alleviating the problem and giving the tower the appearance we see today.</p>   <p align=\"left\">Devils Island's flashing red light became a major landmark along trans-Superior shipping lanes. The station's steam fog signal was replaced in 1925 with a compressed air diaphone and a radio fog beacon. Ships on the lake could use the time delay between the radio and audible signals to determine their distance to the station. Devils Island eventually became the last manned station in the Apostle Islands. As the other lights were automated, the Coast Guard maintained a five-man crew on Devils Island to watch over the beacon and perform periodic maintenance on the other island lights. This era finally ended in 1978, when the Devils Island light was automated as well. When the Coast Guard detachment hauled down their flag, it marked the end of over a century of light keepers tending lights in the Apostle Islands.</p> <p align=\"left\">The lighthouse at Devils Island is the only one among the Apostles group to retain its original Fresnel lens, though there was a three-year period when the lantern room was empty. The U. S. Coast Guard removed the third order Fresnel lens from the tower in 1989 and replaced it with a smaller, plastic beacon. The National Park Service repaired the lens and returned it to the tower as a display in 1992. While technological advances aid navigation, the need for lights as navigational tools has decreased. Overtime lighthouses have acquired a significance beyond their importance to mariners. They represent a fascinating period in the historic development of the region. They also remind us of the brave men and women who tended these remote outposts to make life safer for sailors navigating the waters of the Apostle Islands.</p>   <br /> <b style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem;\">Visiting the Lighthouse</b> <p>Although Devils Island is relatively remote, the lighthouse is a popular destination for experienced boaters and sea kayakers. There best landing site is at the south end of the island near the dock.  Tour boats do not usually stop at Devils Island, but the Apostle Islands Cruise Service offers excellent views of the lighthouse from the lake. Visitors who do reach the island will find the lighthouse staffed with a volunteer light keeper during the summer season. </p> <br /> <br />  ",

This seasonal visitor center was brand new in 2020. Exhibits on the grounds tell the story of Little Sand Bay (LSB) and the challenges and joys of living in the North Woods, including the restored Twilite fish tug, Ojibwe Elder, park staff, and community members audio stories, and the John Nelson cabin.<br /> <br /> This has become an increasingly popular <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/kayaking.htm\">kayak</a> launch for paddlers heading out to Sand and York Islands for day trips as well as overnight <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">camping</a>.

This area is maintained by the Township of Russell and includes a pavilion, beach, boat launch, and the Little Sand Bay Campground. </p> <h4><strong>History of Little Sand Bay</strong></h4> <p>Two thirds of the mainland unit of the Apostle Islands, including Little Sand Bay, is within the Red Cliff Band Reservation. The land at LSB was ceded to the Federal Government in 1842. Today, we fly the United States flag and Tribal Flag to honor our relationship with the tribal community and to promote tribal history, lifestyles, and teachings of the traditions for the next Seven Generations of the Anishinaabe. <br /> <br /> In the late 1920's the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/historic-hokenson-brothers-fishery-apis.htm\">Hokenson brothers</a> started a commercial fishing operation out of LSB. For more than 30 years the small family-owned business grew out of LSB and you can tour the grounds to see their twine shed, pile driver, dock, and herring shed. Many of the interpretive displays are located outside, including the renovated Twilite fishing boat to showcase how technology evolved to make fishing in the 1930's-1950's more efficient. </p> <h4><b>South Shore Club</b></h4> <p>In 1923 a group of Russell Township residents founded the South Shore Club. They envisioned a resort on the shores of Lake Superior to entice tourists and outside investment. Club members cleared a new road to LSB and established the South Shore Subdivision with lots available for development. Several of the lots near the beach were reserved for a park to keep the area open to the public. Members of the South Shore Club established a tradition of picnics and other activities at the park, but the lots sold slowly, and few buyers constructed any buildings. One notable exception was Herman Johnson Jr.<br /> <br /> Hermie obtained lots in the South Shore Subdivision in the 1930’s. He moved his fishing business from Sand Island to LSB and built a log cabin, dock, icehouse, and twin shed. He and his wife Agnes opened a general store and tavern in March 1941 and developed a tourist attraction that operated through the early 1970s. You could find anything from diesel to root beer floats. Locals would come to LSB to socialize, watch a baseball game, and picnic on the beach. Johnson would take guests out on his fishing boat called the Sand Bay and show them an honest days work on the water. The NPS used the store as a visitor center until 2017. Elements of the current visitor center reflect the style of Hermie’s store.</p>",

It was the last island added to the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Most of the park was established in 1970 but a 1986 act of Congress authorized the inclusion of “approximately 200 acres of land at the mouth of Chequamegon Bay known as Long Island” into the park. The island is composed almost entirely of sand and has no obvious bedrock pedestal beneath it. Perhaps most importantly, Long Island (at least for now) is not an island at all! It changed from an island to a continuous part of a peninsula many times, usually persisting in one form or the other for a few decades. It is presently part of a peninsula and has been since the mid-1970s.</p> <h4><b>Getting There</b></h4> <p>Public access to Long Island is by private boat, water taxi, or kayak. The land on the peninsula east of the park boundary belongs to the Bad River Nation. The tribe controls and limits use of their lands. Water depths are very shallow at all approaches to the island. Most visitors beach their boats.<br /> <br /> No maintained trails exist on this island. In spite of challenging access and lack of facilities, the island remains a popular place for summer activities like swimming, sunbathing, picnicking, and walking on the beach.The island has one designated campground, located about one half mile southeast of the LaPointe light station. The site includes a picnic table, bear resistant food locker, fire ring, and privy. A permit is required to camp here.</p> <h4><b>One Island… Two Lights</b></h4> <p>Long Island is the only Apostle Island to have two active navigational lights. In 1858, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/historyculture/long-lights.htm\">LaPointe lighthouse</a>, a one and one-half story wood frame dwelling with a short square tower on the roof, was built on the north shore of Long Island as the second lighthouse in the Apostles. In 1997, the U.S. Lighthouse Board replaced the original lighthouse with two new towers, one to the east and one at the end of Chequamegon Point to the west of the first lighthouse. The new LaPointe light tower is a 67-foot-tall cast iron cylinder, while a 42-foot pyramidal skeletal tower stands at Chequamegon Point. By 1987, beach erosion near the foundations of the Chequamegon Point light tower forced the U.S. Coast Guard to move the tower about 100 feet back from the shore. The move damaged the tower – the beacon now rests on a nearby modern cylindrical structure.</p> <h4><b>Unique Habitat</b></h4> <p>The wide undisturbed beaches on Long Island are not only attractive to people but are the only places in the state where a small endangered bird successfully nested in recent years. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/piping-plovers-on-the-move-apis.htm\">Piping plovers</a>, sand colored shorebirds, arrive on Long Island in late April to early May to lay their eggs in shallow nests. Well camouflaged eggs and young may go unnoticed to visitors.</p> <h2><b>FYI</b></h2> <p>Island visitors must be aware of the following:</p> <h4><b>Closures</b></h4> <p>Fencing protects piping plover nests from predators and human activity. When you arrive at an area that is closed due to piping plover nesting activity, you may see a metal fence enclosure (approximately 12 feet across) surrounded by signs and a twine fence (approximate 100 feet across).</p> <h4><b>Poison Ivy and Deer Ticks</b></h4> <p>Long Island is the one place in the national lakeshore where poison ivy is common. The short plant, with clusters of three leaflets, is scattered across many of the vegetated dunes on the island.Deer ticks, common on Long Island, can transmit Lyme disease and Ehrlichiosis. If you notice a rash, flu-like symptoms, or joint pain following a tick bite, call your physician.</p> <h4><b>Park Rules</b></h4> <p>Long Island visitors are subject to the same National Park Service rules and regulations that apply in the rest of the national lakeshore. Particularly note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Respect all areas fenced or posted for the protection of wildlife.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dogs must be on a leash six feet or shorter at all times – 36 CFR 2.15 (a) (2).</p> </li> <li> <p>Permits are required for camping – 36 CFR 1.6 (g) (1).</p> </li> <li> <p>Visitors MUST pack out all trash.</p> </li> </ul>",

It is a small island of only 1.1 miles in width and has 8.3 miles of shoreline. A unique and controversial lighthouse history lead to the island having not one, but two lighthouses. Camping, hiking, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">boating</a>, and history await you on Michigan Island.</p> <h4><strong>Camping and Hiking</strong></h4> <p>There is one <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">campsite</a> available on Michigan Island that can be reserved on <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/251865\">Recreation.gov</a>. A one mile sand spit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">hiking</a> trail starts behind the light station at the vault toilets and goes to the sand spit and campsite on the southwest corner of the island. A small dock is available for boats below the lighthouse at a first come first serve basis. </p> <h4>Lighthouse</h4> <p>The story of the Michigan Island Light Station embodies the sweeping changes overtaking the Lake Superior region during a turning point in history. Living at a light station was much like it was at an isolated rural farm in the nineteenth century. Food and supplies had to be brought in by boat or else produced or collected on the island. Hunting, fishing, and berry picking throughout the islands was common practice. In the late 1800s a tramway was built to help haul supplies up the incline to the lighthouse from the dock. Roswell Pendergast, Keeper from 1869-1874, planted exstensive apple, cherry, peach, plum, and pear trees in the 1870s, and in the twentieth century the Lane family maintained and expanded the orchards. NPS staff have re-planted and maintain these orchards for visitors to enjoy. </p> <h4><strong>A Change In Plans</strong></h4> <p>There are two light towers at Michigan Island. One was supposed to be built somewhere else and the second originally was elsewhere! The original plans called for the lighthouse to be built on Long Island, to guide ships to the port of LaPointe, on Madeline Island. Since LaPoint harbor was on the west side of the island, the lighthouse inspector suggested placing the light on Long Island, where it would be visible to ships approaching from the east. However, for reasons that are not completely clear, a Lighthouse Service official ordered a last-minute change of plans, and the lighthouse was built on Michigan Island, instead. Made of rough stone, its exterior walls stuccoed and whitewashed, the new lighthouse combined a small, one-and-a-half-story keeper's dwelling with a low, conical light tower.<br /> <br /> The light on Michigan Island entered service in the spring of 1857, but was closed after only one year of operation. Evidence suggests that higher authorities in the Lighthouse Service repudiated the rash decision of their field representative, and ordered the hapless contractors to go back and erect a new lighthouse at the planned Long Island location. For more than a decade, the Michigan Island tower sat vacant, and in the harsh Lake Superior climate, it quickly began to deteriorate. In 1869, however, authorities decided that a lighthouse on Michigan Island might actually be useful, so $6000 was appropriated to repair the building and relight the light. The refurbished light was equipped with a three-and-a-half order Fresnel lens.</p> <p align=\"left\">Fifty years later, an effort began to place the Michigan Island light in a higher tower. When the Lighthouse Service discontinued operation of the Schooner's Ledge light on Pennsylvania's Delaware River near Philadelphia, the cylindrical steel tower was disassembled and brought to Wisconsin. Originally built in 1880, the tower was transported to Michigan Island in 1919, where it sat on the beach, awaiting assembly, for another ten years. The light station experienced a series of improvements in 1928 and 1929. A brick building was constructed to house an electric generator, a radio fog beacon, and a hoist engine for a tramway; a new keeper's dwelling was added; and the relocated tower was finally assembled. At 112 feet in height, the new tower became the tallest lighthouse in Wisconsin.</p> <p> </p> <h4><strong>Lamps and Lightkeeper Ed Lane</strong></h4> <p>As technology changed, each Michigan Island keeper had to learn to adapt. The first lamps burned lard oil, then in 1880 came the switch to kerosene, also known as mineral oil. In about 1914, the incandescent oil vapor lamp added air under pressure to kerosene. The fine vapor burned brighter in a mantle and used less fuel. The Michigan Island Light converted to electricity in 1929 when the new steel tower was put into use.Ed Lane was the light keeper at Michigan Island from 1901 until he retired from the U.S. Lighthouse Service in 1939, when the lighthouse board ceased to exist. This is the longest period of time that any keeper spent at a single Apostle Islands light station. On October 29, 1929 Ed noted in the lighthouse logbook,</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Put window shades and worked in old tower. Started up new tower at sunset. Everything in good shape, but station looked odd, the old tower being dark for the first time in navigation in 60 years.\"</p> </blockquote> <p> The U.S. Coast Guard took charge of all American lighthouses starting in 1940. A young Coast Guardsman, Elseworth Riske, moved into the quarters formerly occupied by the Lake family. Though the uniform changed, much remained the same.The Michigan Island light was automated in 1943. The Fresnel lens was removed from the tower in 1972 and is now on display in the National Lakeshore Visitor Center in Bayfield. </p> <h4><strong>Visiting the Light Station</strong></h4> <p>Visiting Michigan Island can be a challenge. Only the most experienced private <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">boaters</a> and sea <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/kayaking.htm\">kayakers</a> should consider attempting a trip to this lighthouse due to the great distance and exposed location. Even when lake conditions permit approach, the exposed location of the dock often makes landing impossible. Volunteers are usually available for Memorial Day - Labor Day for tours. </p> <p> </p>",

A fee is charged for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">overnight docking</a>. Dock space may be reserved at certain times for excursion boats. Oak Island provides several possible anchorage areas, depending on wind conditions. Boaters are encouraged to monitor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/weather.htm\">marine weather forecasts</a>.</p> <h4>Leave No Trace</h4> <p>Almost all of Oak Island is now included in Apostle Islands National Lakeshore’s 33,500-acre Gaylord Nelson Wilderness. Visitors must do their part to help preserve the island’s wild and primitive character. Please follow the <a href=\"https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/\">seven principles</a> of Leave No Trace outdoor ethics. Beaches are some of the parks most popular attractions. They also support fragile plant communities. Please walk near the water line or on established trails and take care not to trample beach grasses and lichen. Please camp only on durable surfaces like sand, rock, or leaf litter. Where vault toilets are not available for human waste, dig a hole 6-8 inches deep and 200 feet from camp and the nearest body of water. Cover the hole after use. Campfires must be built in fire receptacles where provided. Dead wood on the ground in forested areas or on unvegetated beaches may be collected for firewood. Do not carry firewood into or between islands in the park. Be prepared to pack out whatever you pack in. Do not remove any artifacts from the islands in the park. These leave no trace principles are caring activities designed to decrease the negative effects that users have on the environment.</p> <h4>Bear habitat</h4> <p>Oak Islands proximity to the mainland makes it an easy swim for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/bear-safety.htm\">bears</a> looking for a new territory. Bears and bear signs are frequently seen by island visitors. Improperly stored food continues to lure bears to the island campsites. Visitors must take precautions to help keep this from happening. Never approach or feed a bear. Keep a distance of at least 50 yards, even for photography. Don’t lure or allow bears to feel comfortable around campsites, docks, and picnic areas. Store food and garbage in the bear proof lockers provided at campsites. If you encounter a bear in a visitor use area; make yourself look big, bang pots, yell, make noise until the bear leaves the area, and report the encounter to park staff as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Ojibwe Lumberjacks, and the “King”</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/historyculture/ojibwe-culture.htm\">Native people</a> have camped and harvested food on Oak Island for centuries. Nineteenth century land surveys note the location of a maple “sugar bush” on the island used by the Ojibwe. In the 1850’s, Benjamin Armstrong from Alabama built a cabin on the island and lived there for about six years. He learned the Ojibwe language and served as a translator and advisor to tribal elders, accompanying them to Washington DC to meet with presidents Fillmore and Lincoln. As early as the 1850s, a cordwood business was flourishing here, supplying fuel to passing steamships. The island was subsequently logged for pine in the 1880’s and 1890’s, and for hemlock and hardwoods throughout the 1920’s. As many as six lumber camps including those of the Schroeder and R.D. Pike Lumber Companies, once dotted the shores of Oak Island. Some of the clearings and remnants of these camps are still evident today. During and after the Great Depression, commercial fisherman used parts of the islands as base camps. One of these men, Martin Kane, took up permanent residence in an old lumber camp shack near the sand spit, where he lived for over 25 years as the friendly “king” of Oak Island. Martin made his living fishing with gill nets and set lines. He sold the whitefish and lake trout that he caught to the Booth Company in Bayfield. A 1946 article from the Ashland Daily Press explained that the shack where Martin Kane lived with two dogs and a cat had a bed, a table, one chair, and a stove. Sparks from the stove ignited a fire that burned about 4,000 acres of the island in October 1943.  </p>",

It is the farthest from the mainland and the most remote of the six Apostle Islands light stations. Visiting Outer Island can be a challenge. Only the most experienced private boaters and sea kayakers should consider attempting a trip to this lighthouse, due to the great distance and exposed location. Even when lake conditions permit approach, the exposed location of the dock often makes landing impossible. There is one <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">campsite</a> on the southern sand spit and primitive camping is also available. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">Hiking</a> is available on the island. There is a 7.5 mile Sandspit Trail that connects the campsite near the sand spit on the south end of the island with the light station on the north end, and a 1.5 mile trail leading the historic Lullabye logging camp. </p> <h4><b>Outer Island Light Station</b></h4> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/historyculture/lighthouses.htm\">Outer Island light</a> was lit October of 1874 and is known as a “Poe Tower” for a series of lighthouses built in the Great Lakes region during Orlando Poe’s tenure with the Lighthouse Board. He recommended a lighthouse be built on Outer Island to mark the eastern edge of the Apostle Islands. As a member of the Light House Board, General Poe put his labors into helping save lives by directing ship traffic throughout the Great Lakes with his Italianate style influence looking lighthouses. The “Poe style” is known for its brick structures and graceful embellishments with hooded arched windows, support corbels, and curved brackets. People who worked with Poe marveled at the magnitude and intricacy of his work. The Outer Island tower is 90 feet high and was outfitted with the third order Fresnel lens that could be seen 20 miles offshore. It was also the first island station with a fog signal in the Apostle Islands, marking the eastern edge of the archipelago to oncoming traffic. The light became automated in 1961.</p> <h4><strong>Lullabye Logging</strong></h4> <p>In 1936 the Lullabye Furniture Company of Stevens Point, Wisconsin, purchased the entire island outside of the lighthouse reservation. This included eight thousand acres of standing timber mostly yellow birch, hemlock, and cedar. The company was founded in 1897 by John J. Bukolt and gained national distribution of cradles, other children’s furniture, and toys in the 1920’s. Logging on the island began in 1942 when wartime demand created a more favorable market of products such as plywood for the fuselage on bombers. By the 1950’s Lullabye’s Outer Island logging operation was fully mechanized and run by a thirteen-man crew. A bulldozed airstrip on the southwestern portion of the island allowed small planes to land. The airstrip was located several miles from the camp, but several old cars were brought to the island to transport people and goods. Fuel became essential for this type of logging and diesel was brought in on one thousand-gallon tanks.Camp life for Lullabye workers included amenities unknown to earlier generations of woodworkers such as a portable generator which provided electricity for lights and a television. <br /> <br /> Over 20 million board feet of timber was harvested over the years. By the 1950’s Lullabye had become one of the largest manufacturers of children’s furniture. Lullabye ended its Outer Island logging operation in 1963, not because the timber was gone, but because it was no longer profitable. Logging operations changed the landscape of the Apostle Islands. Eventually the forests regenerated, but the second and third growth forests are dominated by birch and maple. The regenerated forests support different plant and animal species than were found in the virgin forests. These logging camps remain relatively undisturbed and well preserved as a record of the past.</p>",

        "notes": "Raspberry Island\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/raspberry-island.htm\n\n<h4><b>Preserving a Lighthouse and its Stories</b></h4> <p>More than a century of exposure to the harsh Lake Superior environment took its toll on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=39A46A6F-DF79-416C-A1D8-17C71F6F3249\">Miskominikaani-minis</a> (Raspberry Island) Lighthouse. The roof leaked, the foundation was cracked, clapboards were rotting, and plaster was falling down. Other buildings near the lighthouse had similar problems. The light station known as the \"showplace of the Apostles\" needed substantial restoration to ensure sustainability. A major project began in 2002 to stabilize the shoreline and rehabilitate the property to preserve its historical, architectural, and cultural significance. The historic keeper's quarters now looks much like it did (inside and out) in the early 1920s. Maintaining the light station's historic buildings and grounds is a continuous challenge for National Park Service staff. A small dock below the lighthouse is available for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">boaters</a> visiting the island on a first come first serve basis. </p> <h4><strong>Lighthouse History</strong></h4> <p>The Raspberry Island light was first lit in July of 1863 to serve as a beacon to many steamboats traveling through the west channel of the Apostle Islands. The original structure was a single family dwelling surmounted by a square tower. A brick fog signal building was added to the station in 1903, creating a need for additional staff. In 1906 the original lighthouse was rebuilt into a duplex at a cost of $7500 to house the head lighthouse keeper and his two assistants! The duplex structure is the building we see at Raspberry Island today. </p> <h4><b>Keeping the Lighthouse</b></h4> <p>When lighthouse keepers lived at the lighthouse, they regularly maintained the buildings and grounds. Note these entries from the lighthouse logbook in May 1915:</p> <blockquote> <p>5/3 - Washing walls interior and working in signal.<br /> 5/4 - Cleaning in signal & mowing the lawn. <br /> 5/5 - Painting on the dwelling this forenoon.<br /> 5/11 - Painting on dwelling & out houses.<br /> 5/12 - Painting boat house, trimmings on fog signal and other work. <br /> 5/13 - Painting in signal and railing to dock. <br /> 5/18 - Painting outside and inside of lantern, also verandah floors. </p> </blockquote> <p>This attention to regular maintenance ended when the Coast Guard automated the station in 1947. </p> <h4><strong>Lighthouse Rehabilitation</strong></h4> <p>Raspberry Island Light is the national lakeshore's most visited lighthouse, hosting thousands of people each year. In order to preserve the station, a $1.4 million shoreline stabilization project in 2002 and 2003 provided rock walls, better drainage, and a re-vegetated slope to keep the fog signal building and lighthouse from sliding into the lake. A $1.3 million project to rehabilitate the lighthouse and keeper's quarters followed from 2005 to 2007. This work included foundation repairs, a new roof, restored windows and doors, and repairs to interior and exterior walls. The National Park Service fights a never-ending battle with the harsh environment to maintain all these historic buildings. </p> <h4><strong>Recycling the Past</strong></h4> <p>How can we keep alive the stories of the keepers and explain their connections to the broader community they served? Once the lighthouse was rehabilitated, the National Park Service refurnished the lighthouse keeper's quarters as it may have been in the early 1920s. This helps park rangers tell the keepers' stories so visitors can better understand what life was like for the keepers and their families. Ongoing station rehabilitation efforts include grounds and other buildings and associated structures like the flagpole, swing, and birdhouses. Dedicated volunteers and park staff help plant and maintain the flower and vegetable gardens that historically, were such an important part of the light station's landscape. <a href=\"https://friendsoftheapostleislands.org/\">The Friends of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore</a><strong> </strong>assisted restoration efforts and spearheaded the rehabilitation of the Raspberry Island boat house. Please contact them at PO Box 1574, Bayfield, WI. 54814 if you wish to contribute to this effort. <br /> <br /> Saving a lighthouse is recycling the past. It connects us to the past and helps form a bridge to the future. Anthropologists Mary Catherine Bateson wrote: \"The past empowers the present...\"</p> <p>Recycling our past is reviving it to the present...bringing history back to life! Rehabilitation of Raspberry Island Light Station is the ultimate recycling project. </p> <h4><strong>Trails</strong></h4> <p>There are two <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">hiking trails</a> located on the island. The Sand spit Trail is 0.75 miles long and connects the East Bay sand spit up the lighthouse. The West Bay trail is 1.0 miles long and starts at the lighthouse and winds around down to the West Bay. </p> <blockquote> </blockquote>",

Sand Island <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=D229E630-D7FC-4D1A-8E75-BA6147231A07\">Waabaabikaa-minis</a> is an outstanding place to view the return of wild nature to lands that have experienced many complex and changing human uses. Second growth forests, old farm clearings, foundations, and existing structures all tell stories about the people who used and continue to use Sand Island. Today’s visitors experience these stories in several ways. A two-mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm#CP_JUMP_6932928\">trail </a>connects the camp sites at East Bay with the Sand Island Lighthouse. A half mile north of East Bay the trail passes through an overgrown field (part of Hansen farm). Justice Bay and a view of the Swallow Point sea caves are found at the trail’s midpoint. A mile and a half north of the camp sites, the trail passes through an area of virgin white pines. These 250-year-old trees were protected within a lighthouse reservation. An overlook with a panoramic view of Lighthouse Bay is a quarter mile south of the lighthouse. A second trail begins at the East Bay camp sites and leads west for one third of a mile to a farm site once occupied by the Noring family. The site contains historic farm equipment and remnants of buildings. Beware of the old well located among the ruins.<br /> <br /> A steel L-shaped <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">dock</a> is available for public use in East Bay. Docks at the west side and southeastern tip of the islands are for private use. Please avoid using these docks. A rock shelf near the lighthouse is fitted with mooring cleats. Submerged rocks make extreme caution necessary when using this landing. Boats often anchor at East Bay, Justice Bay, and Lighthouse Bay, depending on wind conditions. Visitors exploring the sea caves in sea kayaks or small boats should note <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/weather.htm\">weather conditions</a> and use caution.<br /> <br /> Insects and mud can reduce your enjoyment of Sand Island. Long-sleeved shirts, long pants, hiking or waterproof boots, and insect repellent are recommended. Black bears inhabit the island. Campers, kayakers, and boaters should take precautions to store food properly. Keep campsites and dock areas clean to avoid unwelcome guests. Pack out whatever you pack in. Help us preserve the island’s outstanding natural and historic resources while honoring the privacy of its remaining summer residents.</p> <h4>Sand Island History</h4> <p>In 1881, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/learn/historyculture/sand-light.htm\">Sand Island Lighthouse</a> was built to help guide ships to western Lake Superior ports. Some of these ships carried lumber, brownstone, and fish from the Apostle Islands to large cities on the lower lakes. The ships also carried passengers from around the globe to help settle the region. By 1918, Sand Island supported a population of more than 100 people. The majority of these were Norwegian immigrants who farmed and fished for a living. The stories of long time Sand Island residents offer interesting glimpses of life on the Apostle Islands.<br /> <br /> <strong>Emmanuel Luick </strong><br /> Emmanuel Luick was the Sand Island lighthouse keeper from 1892 to 1921. “Sand Island was just like home,\" according to Luick. “There we felt free with the wind and the sun and plenty of open spaces.” In 1896, Luick married 16-year-old Ella Richardson (he was 29). Despite her youth, Ella inspired confidence in her abilities. She was frequently left in charge of the station for days at a time while her husband went to the mainland for supplies. The marriage did not last, however. On May 19, 1905, the keepers log indicated that “Mrs. Ella Luick left for Bayfield on the steamer Barker at 6PM.” She never returned to the island.<br /> <br /> Another disaster affected keeper Luick on September 2, 1905. “The storm that sunk the Sevona was one of the worst… She was on ore carrier on her way down the lake with a load of granular ore, and ran into the storm 20 miles below Outer Island. After battling the dense fog, wind and rain for hours she was forced to turn back…they tried to make York Island and were grounded on the reef with seven lives lost.”<br /> <br /> “In 1911, I married a girl from Iron River and took her to live at the lighthouse,” said Luick. “She was lonesome at times but when the children came, she was kept busy enough.” He and his wife, Oramill, had four children, but only two survived infancy. Mrs. Luick remembered that, “My only neighbors were the wives of fisherman, but we stuck together. We organized a sewing circle…We met twice a month at each other’s houses, and got up nice little parties, besides…When you live for years with just a handful of neighbors, you remember them all your life… Some of the fishermen’s wives raised garden stuff, and a little fruit. We went three and a half miles for our milk, every other day.” Emmanuel Luick was transferred to the Grand Marais, Minnesota light when Sand Island was automated in 1921. He retired there in 1936.<br /> <br /> <strong>Burt Hill</strong><br /> Burt Hill lived on Sand Island from 1910 to 1941. In 1896, he married Anna Mae Shaw, daughter of Sand Island’s first European settler. When Anna Mae’s father, Francis, retired from farming, the Hills left their home in Ashland to take over Mr. Shaw’s island farm. “Early in 1911 I had made application for a Post Office to be established on the island which was granted and named Shaw, in honor or Mr. Francis W. Shaw,” recalled Hill. “On June 20, 1911, I received my appointment as postmaster and I opened an office. It was no trouble to get the mail carried during the summer months while the boats were running… But it was during the winter months that it was a hardship to get the mail in and out… We endured these hardships for five years, until May 15, 1916 when the Post Office was discontinued.”<br /> <br /> “On June 15, 1918, all of the residents of the island gathered at the schoolhouse for the purpose of organizing a cooperative association and starting a store. The move was unanimously adopted, and a store was opened up July 19, 1918. It was given the name of the Sand Island Co-Operative Association. Fred Hansen was elected President… and I was its manager and secretary, which office I held until the association closed up. My salary was a commission of 5 percent of the sales and added up to between $80 and $100 a year.” Burt and Anna Mae Hill maintained their island home until poor health forced them to move to the mainland in 1941. They were among the last full-time residents on the island. Today, several cabins on the island’s southeast corner are still privately occupied. Please respect the privacy of these summer residents as you explore the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fred Hansen</strong><br /> Fred Hansen was a young boy when his parents emigrated from Norway to Sand Island in the 1890's. In 1913, at the age of 28, he began keeping a diary of his daily activities. His concise entries illustrate a way of life that changed little over a 25 year period. </p> <blockquote> <p>June 1913<br /> 2 Lifted. (Gill nets).<br /> 3 Lifted. Through with plowing and seeding.<br /> 5 Lifted. Had birthday party in evening - everyone had a good time. <br /> 15 Got up at 3 - went over to Brownstone (Devils Island) and trolled; caught 9 fish. A fine day. <br /> 16 Lifted. The price raised to 7 cents (per pound). <br /> 17 Stormy. Built hog pen and planted rutabagas. <br /> <br /> July 1913<br /> 4 Went to Light on a picnic in morning. Dance in eve. <br /> <br /> December 1913<br /> 22 Mended nets. I and Herman Johnson went to Shaws in eve and played cards. <br /> 23 Hunted Christmas tree in AM. Swamped in PM. Hills spend evening here played whist. <br /> 25 Spent a very quiet Christmas at home. <br /> 26 I and Noring cut wood. At schoolhouse in evening-program. <br />  </p> </blockquote> <p><br />  </p>",

What would the Apostle Islands be without sand? No island is blessed with more spectacular and diverse sandy areas than the 10,054 acre island. The bridge of sand connecting Presque Isle Point to the rest of Stockton Island is an outstanding example of a geologic feature called a “tombolo”. The tombolo is home to a variety of plant communities (bogs, dunes, lagoons, savannahs, and pine forests), the park’s largest campgound, and the “singing sands” of Julian Bay. People everywhere feel the call of the beach, but at Julian Bay, the call of the “singing” sand can actually be heard.</p> <h4>Leave No Trace Outdoor Ethics</h4> <p>Visitors can do their part to help protect park resources by following the seven principles of “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/leavenotrace.htm\">Leave No Trace</a>” outdoor ethics.</p> <h4>Boating and Camping</h4> <p>Docks are located at Presque Isle Bay and at Quarry Bay. Docking is available on a first-come first-served basis. Please observe all docking signs and regulations. A fee is charged for overnight docking. Some dock space is reserved for excursion and National Park Service boats. Boats can be anchored or beached in Quarry, Presque Isle, and Julian Bays. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">Boaters</a> should monitor marine weather forecasts, since shifting wind conditions and subsequent rough water can pose a significant threat.<br /> <br /> A half-mile long waterfront <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping-permits-reservations.htm\">campground</a> is located among the pines on Presque Isle Bay. Campsite #1 near the Presque Isle docks is accessible to visitors with mobility impairments. Two accessible group campsites are located at Quarry Bay. One individual campsite is located at Quarry Bay and another at Trout Point. Limited camping is also available outside of designated campsites. Camping permits are required for all camping in the national lakeshore. A camping fee is charged. Permits must be picked up at the Bayfield headquarters visitor center before the start of a trip.</p> <h4>Hiking</h4> <p>There are about 14 miles of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/trails-at-the-apostle-islands.htm\">hiking trails</a> on the island. Portions of the Trout Point and Quarry Bay trails may be hard to follow. Off-trail travel can be strenuous. Rock ledges near the lake are slippery. Use caution when walking on them.</p> <h4>Bears</h4> <p>Stockton Island supports a resident population of black bears. A study of Stockton Island bears revealed that the population grew from two animals in 1984 to a high of 31 non-cub bears in 1994. DNA analysis of bear hair samples collected in 2002 determined that there were at least 26 different bears living on Stockton Island that summer. A similar study in 2010 identified only 13 bears on the island. Stockton’s resources can only support so many bears. When the population exploded, the animals naturally regulated their numbers. Some bears swam to other islands, females had fewer and smaller litters, and several smaller bears were killed and eaten.<br /> <br /> Bears occasionally turn to alternative food sources. In summer 2002, a large boar with a scar on his rear end roamed between the camping areas at Presque Isle and Quarry Bay. “Skar’s” campground visits in search of “easy pickings” slowly became more frequent and menacing. After using every available nonlethal tool to discourage Skar’s aggressive behavior, park rangers were forced to shoot him. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/bear-safety.htm\">Visitors must take precautions</a> to help keep this from happening again. Never approach or feed a bear. Keep a distance of at least 50 yards, even for photography. </p> <h4>Footprints</h4> <blockquote> <p><span style=\"color:#333366;\"><em>The natural and undisturbed areas of of the tombolo, Presque Isle, and Julian Bay never cease to amaze, while human history and its imprint are clearly visible at Quarry Bay. The island is a gem and a perfect stop for anyone looking to understand the overall significance and value of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.</em></span></p> </blockquote> <p><span style=\"color:null;\">Stockton Island has attracted people for centuries. Archeological evidence indicates that native populations may have fished on the island as much as 5,000 years ago. Over the past 1,000 years native people camped on the island seasonally to hunt, fish, gather berries, and harvest maple sap. By the late 1800s, Stockton Island attracted commercial activities such as fishing camps, lumber camps, and a brownstone quarry to its shores. Today, visitors flock to Stockton Island to anchor in its protected bays, explore its varied landscapes, camp in its lakeside campsites, and walk its white sand beaches.<br /> <br /> The shoreline areas that attract the most visitors also tend to be very fragile. Vegetation in sandy areas is susceptible to trampling. When plants that stabilize the sand are killed, erosion becomes a problem. Informal trails mar the landscape around the Presque Isle campground and at Julian Bay. Visitors can help protect our fragile sandscapes by using sand ladders provided at the campsites, walking on designated trails and boardwalks, and on beaches below the line of vegetation. This will help leave no trace of our passing...except tracks on the beach.</span><br />  </p>",

Board of Education of Topeka that segregation in the public schools of the nation was unconstitutional. One of the first big tests of that decision came at Little Rocks Central High School. On September 23, 1957, nine African Americans attempted to enroll in the formerly all-white school. Arkansas Governor Orville Faubus called in the National Guard to “prevent violence” and to keep the students from entering. After a federal judge forced Faubus to remove the troops, the Little Rock police were unable to control the crowd and violence erupted. To enforce federal law, President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101<sup>st</sup> Airborne Division to protect the students, who entered the school and began attending classes. Tensions remained at the high school for some time, but an important first step in school integration had been taken.</span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\">Central High School is an operating public school and is not open for visitors to tour on their own.

        "notes": "Charles Curtis House Museum\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/charles-curtis-house-museum.htm\n\nVice President Charles Curtis, the great grandson of a Kansa Indian Chief, was born in 1860 on a North Topeka farm. Following the death of his mother, he lived on a Kaw Indian reservation where he stayed with his maternal grandmother and attended a mission school. His grandmother convinced a young Curtis to leave the reservation and return to Topeka to get an education. Curtis worked his way through high school, racing horses at county fairs and peddling fruit, newspapers, and peanuts. Curtis was determined to pursue a law career, so he took a job with a Topeka legal firm in order to use its library to study for the bar exam. In 1881, he joined a Topeka law practice and became active in the Republican Party. He soon became Shawnee County’s prosecuting attorney. In 1892, Curtis won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the first member of Congress descended from Native Americans. His most notable act while in the House was the Curtis Act of 1898, which promoted tribal land allotment and led to Oklahoma statehood. Curtis remained in the House until January 1907, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate, serving until 1929. In that year, Curtis became Vice President of the United States under Herbert Hoover.The Charles Curtis home was built in 1879 and served as Curtis’s Kansas residence between 1907 and 1936. Today, the Charles Curtis House contains a museum and is listed on the National and Kansas State Registers of Historic Places and the Topeka Landmarks Register.",

On May 21, 1856, a band of proslavery men under the command of Sheriff Samuel Jones raided the town of Lawrence, burning the Free State Hotel, destroying the printing presses, and ransacking homes and stores. Three days later, Brown and his sons retaliated by leading an attack at Pottawatomie Creek, where they dragged five proslavery men from their homes and hacked them to death with broadswords. The sacking of Lawrence and the Pottawatomie Killings ignited warfare throughout eastern Kansas. In June, Brown engaged in the Battle of Blackjack, and at the end of August, joined in the fighting at Osawatomie, in which one of his sons was killed. Brown left Kansas for the last time in early 1859 while leading 11 slaves taken in raids in Missouri to freedom in Canada. On October 16, Brown led 21 men in an attack on the United States arsenal at Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, hoping to gather weapons to arm slaves for an insurrection. Armed citizens and federal troops under the command of Colonel Robert E. Lee, however, soon arrived. When the fighting ended, ten of Brown’s followers, including two of his sons, lay dead. Brown was tried and convicted of treason. On December 2, 1859, he was taken to a place of execution and hanged. Condemned as a madman or hailed as a martyr, Brown helped plunge Kansas into violence, and forcibly divided a nation over the issue of slavery, bringing it to the brink of civil war.",

Board of Education. Washburn College was established in 1857, when members of Topeka’s First Congregational Church decided the city needed a college, and on February 6, 1865, Lincoln College was incorporated. In 1868, the name of the school was changed to Washburn in honor of Ichabod Washburn, a Massachusetts industrialist who donated $25,000 to help support the college. In 1903, a school of law was established on the 3rd floor of the dry goods building located on west 8th street. Staff of the new law school consisted of just one full-time professor and 23 practicing attorneys serving as part time faculty. Forty students paid $50 a year to attend classes. The building continued to house the law school until 1911, when the school was moved to another downtown building. At a time when just gaining entrance to a law school was a battle for women and minorities, Washburn pioneered the entrance of African Americans and women into the legal field. The first African American graduated in 1910, and the first woman in 1912.",

A grassroots network of willing partners, volunteers, and locations serve as the Freedom’s Frontier Board of Trustees, the coordinating entity for the heritage area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{245}\" paraid=\"8\">Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area has a distinct landscape of rivers, hills, valleys, soils, and vegetation. In the 1800s, before the nation expanded across the continent, the western border of Missouri was the American frontier. To its west, Kansas was known as a permanent Indian Territory for both the Plains Indians and other tribes who were forcibly sent to the region following decades of land disputes. Since river travel ended at the Kansas border, this area became a major jumping-off point for pioneers heading west on extensive networks of trails. Traders, miners, and emigrants secured necessities and purchased provisions, and prepared for long overland treks.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{251}\" paraid=\"9\">In 1854, political tensions between Missouri and Kansas resulted in a violent border war as the Kansas territory sought statehood and debated the legality of slavery. At the time, Missouri was a slave state, and the issue of Kansas entering the Union as a potential “free state” ignited years of turmoil. The violent conflict between slavery proponents and abolitionists in the war known as “Bleeding Kansas” (or “Border War”) focused national attention on Kansas sovereignty and territorial law. This was one of the nation's most widely debated political crises in the years leading up to the Civil War. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed in 1854 left the territory's future status in the hands of settlers. The struggle for freedom was at the forefront of the Border War, and in the Civil War that followed. Although the Fugitive Slave Law made assisting runaway slaves a hanging offense in Kansas Territory, abolitionists continued to help slaves escaping from Missouri by the Underground Railroad.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{16}\" paraid=\"10\">After the Civil War, hundreds of African Americans came to settle in Kansas as part of the \"Exoduster Movement\" in the 1870s. Through the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, African Americans in both states continued the struggle for freedom from inequality and segregation during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights eras. One of the heritage area’s most well-known civil rights stories is found in the landmark Supreme Court case known as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas which ended legal racial segregation in public schools in 1954. Today, Freedom’s Frontier National Heritage Area continues to advocate for equal freedoms for all Americans.  Visit, explore and learn about the nation’s enduring legacy and struggle for freedom through the shared stories of courage, conflict, and hope for reconciliation as told across their broad landscape.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{69}\"

Miles of track connected cities and towns in the state and throughout the nation. Railroads crisscrossed the state, bringing with them a flood of immigrants and goods. Just after the Civil War, African American refugees from the South arrived in Topeka and began settling in the area and other parts of Kansas. These refugees became known as Exodusters. A group of these refugees settled in Nicodemus, Kansas, which became the first African American settlement west of the Mississippi. By World War I, roughly 1,850 train depots dotted the Kansas landscape. Built as a passenger station for the Union Pacific in 1927, the Great Overland Station was described as one of the finest on the line. The last passenger train left the Station on May 2, 1971. The building continued to serve as railroad offices until 1988, when it was abandoned. Adjacent to historic North Topeka, the station today houses a railroad museum that bring the people and stories of an earlier time back to life.",

Here, Curry created an image of John Brown that remains one of the most recognized depictions of the abolitionist in the world.

Board of Education National Historical Park (Brown v. Board or the park), located in Topeka, Kansas, covers two acres and includes the historic Monroe Elementary School, which served African American students during the segregation era. The neighborhood in which the park is located is a few blocks southeast of downtown Topeka. The neighborhood includes residences, light industry, small businesses, and vacant lots. Brown v. Board interprets the people, places, and events that contributed to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed segregation in public education. Furthermore, the park interprets the integral role of the Brown case in the civil rights movement, preserves the former Monroe Elementary School and associated cultural landscape, and assists in the interpretation of related local, national, and international resources that further the understanding of the civil rights movement.<br /> <br /> The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) is one of the most pivotal opinions ever rendered by that body. This landmark decision highlights the court’s role in affecting changes in national and social policy. Often when people think of the case, they remember a little girl whose parents sued so that she could attend an all-white school in her neighborhood. In reality, the story of Brown v. Board of Education is far more complex.<br /> <br /> By 1951, the country had experienced tremendous change that brought the nation closer to ending legal segregation. As the Cold War ideologies of the Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global counterpoints, the practice of racial segregation became an international issue, rather than a domestic issue. As the United States sought new allies to counter Soviet gains in Eastern Europe, it needed to shed the hypocrisy of advocating freedom and equality for all on the international stage while denying basic rights to its African American citizens at home. As a result, President Truman in 1947 used executive authority to order desegregation of the military. The Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the racial restrictive covenants that prevented African Americans and other minority groups from purchasing property in white neighborhoods. Additionally, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) won numerous legal victories to integrate colleges in Oklahoma, Texas, and Missouri that established a new legal precedent to challenge segregation in public schools. After nearly 60 years of “separate but equal,” the NAACP and the nation were on the verge of a major victory against segregation.<br /> <br /> In late summer of 1948, members of the Topeka, Kansas, chapter of the NAACP volunteered to challenge the “separate but equal” doctrine governing public education. Following a strategy mapped out by Thurgood Marshall, head of the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, Topeka Branch President McKinley Burnett continued to petition the Board of Education to voluntarily desegregate the public schools while branch lawyers began putting a case together and signing up plaintiffs, often recruiting friends and neighbors. A group of 13 parents agreed to participate on behalf of their 20 children. In the summer of 1950, the branch notified the NAACP in New York that the school situation in Topeka had grown unbearable and they were prepared to go to court.<br /> <br /> In December 1952, the U.S. Supreme Court had on its docket cases from Kansas, Delaware, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, and Virginia, all of which challenged the constitutionality of racial segregation in public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court had consolidated these five cases under one name, Oliver Brown et al. v. the Board of Education of Topeka. One of the justices later explained that the U.S. Supreme Court felt it was better to have representative cases from different parts of the country. They decided to put Brown first “so that the whole question would not smack of being a purely Southern one.”<br /> <br /> This collection of cases was the culmination of years of legal groundwork laid by the NAACP in its work to end segregation. None of the cases would have been possible without the many individuals who were courageous enough to take a stand against the segregated public school system.<br /> <br /> Each of the five cases that collectively formed Brown v. Board of Education at the Supreme Court level varied in their specifics. Lack of buses to distant schools, poor facilities, and absence of basic equipment and supplies were among the evidence in the cases outside of Kansas. In Topeka, the African American schools were housed in good quality buildings with supplies and teacher pay commensurate with the city’s white schools. However, children of the plaintiffs were denied access to their much closer neighborhood schools. Instead, they had to attend more distant facilities designated for their race. On May 17, 1954, at 12:52 p.m., the U.S. Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision stating that it was unconstitutional—a violation of the 14th Amendment— to separate children in public schools for no other reason than their race.<br /> <br /> At the end of the Civil War, those recently freed from bondage began to migrate out of the South. In 1874, the Kansas state legislature enacted a civil rights law making it illegal for any business serving the public or operating under a municipal license to discriminate on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This protective law, coupled with the availability of land through the Homestead Act, resulted in a flood of African Americans looking for a safe place to settle in Kansas. Thousands of “Exodusters,” as they became known, fled the violence and legal discrimination of the South with the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The question of how to educate the children of the new arrivals remained a subject of debate. Kansas settled on voluntary segregation of public elementary schools in larger cities, with an emphasis in Topeka on providing materially equal facilities for African American children. This policy stood firm from the 1920s until the time of the Brown decision.<br /> <br /> Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site was established in Topeka, Kansas, on October 26, 1992, by Public Law 102-525. The park opened to the public in 2004 on the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling. The Monroe Elementary School had, with the Sumner Elementary School in Topeka, been designated a national historic landmark in 1987.<br /> <br /> By Public Law 117-123, the site was redesignated Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park on May 12, 2022. The park works with many partners to explore through exhibits, education programs, interpretation, and special events the story of Brown v. Board of Education in the context of the ongoing civil rights struggle.<br /> <br /> In October 2019 The Brown v. Board Of Education National Historical Park became part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a>. <br /> <br /> <em>The</em> <em>African American Civil Rights Network (AACRN) recognizes civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the modern U.S. civil rights movement from 1939 -1968 through a collection of public and private elements.</em></p>",

She was born in 1894 in Greenwood, South Carolina. Five years later she moved with her family to Topeka, where she would become an accomplished teacher and principal at some of the segregated schools. Miss Williams was the only African American in her graduating class at Washburn University, and went on to spend 4 summers at Columbia University in New York, where she earned advanced certificates. Miss Williams chose to be a career educator, as she taught at a time when women had to choose between their career as educators, or forfeiting teaching in order to have families. After retiring from teaching, Miss Williams continued to play an active role in her community. In addition, she served as a delegate to the White House Conference on Aging in 1971. In 1976 she was featured in a documentary titled, \"75 Years on Quincy Street,\" where she talked about her career and life in Topeka. Located two blocks from the former Monroe Elementary School is the Williams Science and Fine Arts Magnet School, named in honor of Miss Williams.",

In June 1951, local attorneys John and Charles Scott and Charles Bledsoe, and other lawyers from the NAACP, representing 13 adult plaintiffs and 20 children, rose in the courtroom on the third floor to argue Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. The three judge panel, bound by the “separate but equal” precedent established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), reluctantly sided with the Board of Education, clearing the way for an appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court. In a finding of fact, the district court voiced the opinion later adopted by the Supreme Court that legally sanctioned segregation hindered the mental and educational development of black children and deprived them of the benefits they would receive in racially integrated schools.",

Family tradition states that this small two story stone house served as Ritchie’s Topeka residence from 1856 to 1869. While most of those who had come to Kansas in the mid-1850s came seeking only a better life, others, like John Ritchie and John Brown, came itching for the fight to defeat slavery. John Ritchie rode with the Free State Militia and turned his property into a sanctuary for enslaved men, women, and children fleeing north. Lawrence abolitionist Henry Hyatt recalled two trips to Topeka in a covered wagon in which two fugitive slaves were hiding. He left them at the Ritchie’s at midnight. It is believed that the Ritchies often hid fleeing enslaved people out in the thick underbrush and under rock outcroppings near their spring house, where Mary Ritchie would go to carrying a bucket of food without raising suspicion. In later years Ritchie claimed he had cost slaveholders $100,000 in human beings he helped smuggle to freedom.",

St. Mark’s AME Church was built in 1920. Oliver Brown attended the church during the time of the Brown v. Board of Education case. In 1953, Brown became associate pastor of the church, serving until 1959. It was in this church that Rev. Brown first heard of the victory of the Supreme Court’s decision. Rev. Brown gave his only film television interview in the church’s sanctuary.<br /> <br /> Equality and social activism have been cornerstones of the African American Methodist Episcopal Church since it was formed in 1787 by black congregants forced out of a Philadelphia church because of their race. In the 19th century, church leaders and members were often in the forefront of the antislavery movement. A number of black abolitionists, including Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and Sojourner Truth, were members of the AME Church. Many of the denomination’s clergy and lay people later became activists and participants in the Civil Rights Movement of the 20th century. Rosa Parks, who helped ignite the modern Civil Rights Movement when she refused to relinquish her seat to a white man aboard a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955, remained a devout member of the AME Church throughout her life. Rev. Joseph A. DeLaine endured death threats and saw his home burned to the ground when he and other African Americans sought to secure equal educational opportunities for the black children in Clarendon County, South Carolina, during the Briggs v.

Board of Education. Sumner was one of 18 Topeka grade schools open only to white children. In the fall of 1950, Oliver Brown, under the watchful eyes of the NAACP’s attorneys, attempted to enroll his daughter Linda. Although the school was only 4 blocks from her home, Linda was turned away because of her race. Early the next year, Brown and twelve other parents representing 20 children filed a lawsuit demanding the immediate integration of Topeka’s elementary schools. In 1954 the Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools violated the rights of black children under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.<br /> <br /> In 1987, the National Park Service designated Sumner Elementary a National Historic Landmark, followed 5 years later by Monroe Elementary. When President George H. W. Bush signed legislation creating Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in 1992, Sumner Elementary was still serving Topeka’s black and white children.

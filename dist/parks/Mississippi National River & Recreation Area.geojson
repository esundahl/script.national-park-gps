        "notes": "Coldwater Spring\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/coldwater-spring.htm\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Coldwater Spring was added to the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area in January 2010, with the goal of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/miss/learn/management/ColdwaterRestoration.htm\">restoring the landscape</a> to an oak savanna/prairie complex. An extensive renovation, which included the removal of twelve buildings and the restoration and seeding of twelve acres of prairie and one acre of wetlands, began in early 2011 and was largely completed by August 31, 2012. During the course of the restoration more than 1,000 trees, shrubs, grasses and wildflowers were planted on the property. The restoration work, however, will continue for many years.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>This area served as an important crossroads for Native Americans and traders using both the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers for commerce and travel. During the construction of Fort Snelling U.S. soldiers camped at Coldwater Spring, making it the first American settlement in Minnesota. By 1825, construction of the fort had been completed and soldiers had moved from Coldwater into the fort. The area around the spring, however, continued to attract traders, Native Americans, and a small village developed that serviced the trade at the site.</p> <p>The spring also continued to provide water to the new fort and the later Upper Post. The fort initially relied on horse-drawn water wagons and eventually railcars to deliver water from Coldwater Spring up until the 1870s. By 1879, the fort was expanded under Secretary of War, Alexander Ramsey. The fort's expansion demanded a more efficient water supply system and, in 1880, the Army established a formal waterworks at the spring. Coldwater served as the water source for the Army until the 1920s when the Army turned to the City of Saint Paul to supply water for the fort.<br /> <br /> The property was last home to the Bureau of Mines: Twin Cities Research Center. The buildings were constructed primarily during the late 1950's through the early 1960's.The Research Center developed significant mining safety equipment, mining technologies and mineral extraction processes used worldwide. The labs there also analyzed the composition of some of the moon rocks brought to Earth by the Apollo moonshot missions. Federal funding for the Bureau of Mines was permanently eliminated in 1996; by 1997 the buildings were vacated and gradually fell into disrepair. They remained vacant until their demolition in 2011.</p> <h2>Activities</h2> <p>The park features a crushed limestone trail for walking to Coldwater Spring. Additionally, there are many opportunities for wildlife viewing and photography. Birdwatching is becoming a popular activity at Coldwater Spring as the savanna/prairie restoration matures and attracts a larger number of species. Turkeys, deer, and even coyotes are not uncommon and native wildflowers bloom throughout the growing season. Visitors can find trail maps and information at the kiosk near the main entrance at the end of Minnehaha Park Drive South. </p> <h2>Additional Information</h2> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Dogs are welcome but must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet (2 meters) in length.</li> <li><strong>WARNING:</strong> Water from the spring house and reservoir is not potable.

The park is adjacent to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/minnvall.htm\">Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge</a> and seven major paved bike trails link the park with the surrounding suburbs and cities. Visitors will experience most of the amenities that other state parks have, except for camping. Wildlife is plentiful and hiking trails run throughout the park leading visitors away from the more heavily visited parts of the park.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>Fort Snelling State Park is located at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. The Dakota called this place <em>Ha-Ha Mdo-Te</em> which translates to \"junction of two rivers\" and from which the town of Mendota got its name.</p> <h2>Activities</h2> <p>There are 18 miles of hiking trails, 5 miles of biking trails, snowshoe and canoe rentals, picnicking, fishing, boating, and swimming. Fishing licenses are not required for Minnesota residents fishing on Snelling Lake or from the shores of either the Minnesota or Mississippi Rivers. Non-resident park users need to purchase a license to fish at any site in the park.

The landscape ranges from manicured park to wilder slopes and forest. It's a great place for birding, fishing, picnicking, walking, and bicycling. Hidden Falls itself is a small waterfall off the beaten path. It may be dry in periods when we have little precipitation</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>In 1887, Hidden Falls Regional Park was one of the four original park areas selected for St. Paul by noted landscape architect, Horace Cleveland. Cleveland’s underlying philosophy was to preserve landscape features and the nature that shaped those features while making the parks accessible for all people to enjoy and not just the wealthy. He went on to greatly influence the park systems in both St. Paul and Minneapolis, as well as other Midwestern cities.</p> <p>The park still contains a primitive setting where nature abounds, in addition to more developed areas.</p> <p>Hidden Falls is separated from Crosby Farm Park by the Watergate Marina, but connected by the trail system.</p> <h2>Activities</h2> <p>Bicycling and walking trails, picnicking/shelter, grills, fire rings, boating, birding, and fishing opportunities abound in this park. A short hike through the woods upstream from the picnic shelters will bring one to the creek. Take the informal trail to the right to the falls. Hiking further up the main trail will bring the hiker to a gravel beach area below Lock and Dam 1. This is also a favorite fishing spot for many.</p>",

This is a sacred place of burial that has deep significance to the Upper Sioux Community, Lower Sioux Community, Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, Prairie Island Indian Community, Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, and other descendants of those who are buried here.<br /> <br /> Visit <a href=\"https://www.stpaul.gov/facilities/indian-mounds-regional-park\">Indian Mounds Regional Park | Saint Paul Minnesota (stpaul.gov)</a> to learn about the current Cultural Landscape Study and Messaging Plan by the City of St. Paul. This study is an initial step to update the City’s practice for preservation awareness, and understanding of sites significant to American Indians.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>Indian Mounds Regional Park was established in 1893 and is one of the oldest parks in the region. Situated atop Dayton's Bluff east of downtown St. Paul, it is a burial site for at least two American Indian cultures and is just upriver from where the first historic Kaposia village site was once located.</p> <p>Anthropologists believe that the mounds were built between 1,500-2,000 years ago. In more recent times, the Dakota also used this site for their burials, where they wrapped the bones of their deceased in a bison skin before burying them. Valuable objects like knives, foods, pipes, or even horses or canoes were also placed within the mound. </p> <p>At least thirty-seven mounds once stood along the bluffs of the Mounds Park area; only six remain today.</p> <h2>Activities</h2> <p>The park has paved trails that traverse the bluffs and link into other trails. There is an outstanding view of the Mississippi River and of the St. Paul skyline. Picnic tables and a large pavilion are also available for picnicking.

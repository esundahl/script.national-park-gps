Stand still and follow the sound through the trees to catch a glimpse of white water spilling over boulders.<br /> <br /> There are two picnic tables.

        "notes": "Crater Lake\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/crater-lake.htm\n\n<p> </p> <p>Crater Lake, at 1,943 feet (592 meters) deep, is one of the deepest lakes in the world and the deepest in the United States. The lake averages more than five miles (8 km) in diameter, and is surrounded by steep rock walls that rise up to 2000 feet (600 meters) above the lake's surface.</p> <h3>From a Mountain to a Lake</h3> <p>Crater Lake is located in Southern Oregon on the crest of the Cascade Mountain range, 100 miles (160 km) east of the Pacific Ocean. It lies inside a caldera, or volcanic basin, created when the 12,000 foot (3,660 meter) high Mount Mazama collapsed 7,700 years ago following a large eruption.<br /> <br /> An average 67 inches of precipitation, rain and melted snow (annual average of 42 feet of snowfall (13 meters)) supply the lake with water. There are no inlets or outlets to the lake. The lake level fluctuates slightly from year to year while evaporation and seepage prevent the lake from becoming any deeper.</p> <h3>Deep Blue</h3> <p>Crater Lake's great depth, purity and clarity (avg 103 feet deep), and the way sun light interacts with water determines the lake's color. Water molecules absorb the longer wavelengths of reds, oranges, yellows, and greens while the shorter blue and purple wavelengths are more easily scattered.  The scattered blue light penetrates deeper into the clear water then is redirected back up to the surface where we can see it. Around the edges where the water is less deep, some of the unabsorbed green sunlight is reflected back up. The color of the lake can vary from day to day depending on wind, cloud cover, and the angle of the sun</p> <h3>Wizard Island Plus Three</h3> <p>Following the collapse of Mount Mazama, lava poured into the caldera even as the lake began to rise. Today, a small volcanic island, Wizard Island, appears on the west side of the lake. This cinder cone rises 767 feet (234 meters) above the lake. At its summit is a small crater, 300 feet (90 meters) across and 90 feet (27 meters) deep.<br /> <br /> Out of sight and underwater are three more volcanoes that grew while the lake was filling. The Rhyodacite Dome is the youngest of these and occurred about 5000 years ago. </p> <h3>Life in the Lake</h3> <p>Between 1888 and 1942, five species of fish were introduced into Crater Lake. About 60-thousand rainbow trout and kokanee salmon continue to thrive. Scientist have identified over 165 species of phytoplankton and zooplankton, along with invertebrates that live throughout the lake. Amphibians, including the native Mazama newt, exist in shallow areas but are in danger due to the introduction crayfish, a predator. <br /> <br /> Large colonies of a native moss circle the lake at depths between 100 feet (30 meters) to 400 feet (120 meters). </p>   <p><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  </p>",

Goodbye Picnic Area is perfect for a picnic but also consider it for birding, and an observation point for small mammals with the hope for a bear to stroll through the forest on its way to the creek. It rests beneath a forest composed of a variety of mature tree species including Shasta red fir, lodgepole pine, and mountain hemlock. Mostly inaccessible to the eyes but very audible to the ears is Goodbye Creek which flows in a deep canyon that separates these two picnic areas.<br /> <br /> The road noise from passing vehicles becomes inconsequential especially after snow melt when the creek is roaring. There is no trail into the canyon through which Goodbye Creek cascades downstream. This is one place where the towering trees, calls of the red breasted nuthatch, and the antics of Douglas squirrels begs visitors to put aside the hiking poles and just relax. <h4>Location</h4> Goodbye Picnic Area has two sections which are accessible from the north or the south on the west side of Munson Valley Road between the Annie Spring Entrance Station and park headquarters. <strong>One</strong> is an easy right turnout for southbound traffic from the rim or park headquarters. Parking is pull through next to the curb. There is no accessible ramp from the curb. This sight has two picnic tables. <strong>The second</strong> section is a left turn for lake-bound traffic (or right turn past the bridge for south bounders).

Phantom Ship is actually a resistant remnant of an ancient volcanic cone that was engulfed in the growing Mazama volcano.

This was followed by the ejection of gas-charged matter through vents in fractures around the mountain which weakened and ultimately caused the upper mountain to collapse. Rather than rising upwards, the volcanic matter ejected through vents flowed rapidly downhill, filling surrounding valleys to a depth of 300 ft (100 m). Once the flows stopped, trapped gases escaped through fumeroles, and surrounding material hardened. As the streams reclaimed the valley the erosion-resistant spires were exposed.  <h4>Where can I see them?</h4> The classic view is located in Wheeler Creek Canyon at the end of Pinnacles Road from East Rim Drive. A 0.8 (1.3 km) trail is an easy walk along the rim of the valley where the pinnacles are visible.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">These can only be seen when East Rim Drive and Pinnacles Road are open.</span> When the roads are closed, look for the pinnacles in the Annie Creek watershed and canyon from several view points along South Hwy 62.  ",

Standing within the sheltered memorial, the lake’s captivating beauty is without a doubt the main attraction. But its alliance with the geologic history of Mount Mazama is the compelling reason why the Sinnott Memorial was constructed. The beauty and geology are united via a series of information panels that rest in the structure allowing visitors to simultaneously see the unobstructed beauty and connect it the explosive volcanic history.  <h4>Exhibits</h4> In addition to the overlook, the Sinnott Memorial houses the park's main exhibit area. Inside, protected from the weather, are a brief film about the catastrophic story of Mount Mazama, displays describing influential scientists and their research, an exhibit discussing the indigenous connections to Crater Lake, exhibits illustrating the amount of pumice and ashfall that occurred locally from the eruption that formed Crater Lake, and a collage of pictures and quotations describing the lakes's beauty.<br /> <br /> In late June, after snow is removed for the native stone steps and walkway which lead to the memorial overlook, and exhibits are fine-tuned, visitors are welcome to enjoy the view and peruse the exhibits. It is typically open late-June to mid-October and the hours for access vary throughout the summer.  <h4>History</h4> The Sinnott Memorial is an impressive stone structure built 50 feet below the caldera rim into a steep rock outcrop called Victor Rock. The structure was dedicated in 1931 as a memorial to Congressman “Nick” Sinnott, who representated the Eastern Oregon Congressional District in the US House of Representatives, and served from 1919 to 1928 as Chairman of the Public Lands Committe.",

        "notes": "West Rim Winter\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/west-rim-winter.htm\n\nIn winter, West Rim Drive transitions into the most popular ski route in the park. Every year on November 1, it closes to vehicle traffic. As snow blankets the road, the asphalt surface disappears keeping only the contours of the road as a guide along the ski route. West Rim Route offers spectacular views of Crater Lake, Wizard Island. and the dramatic scenery created by the visible peaks and valleys of the Cascade mountains.<br /> <br /> The route features gently rolling terrain. It is exposed to the elements and is often windy. If snow conditions are good, it is suitable for skiers and snowshoers of all abilities. When icy, the route can be treacherous, especially just west of Rim Village. All trips are out and back via the same route, but can vary in length depending on the weather, and your fitness and experience. <br /> <br /> <strong>Parking </strong>is anywhere in Rim Village as the signs dictate. Do not park on the snow or block the plowed road. On weekends, holidays, and during spring break the parking lot fills early. Parking overnight is prohibited to allow for safe plow access. If an overnight camping trip is planned all winter backcountry rules apply including designated parking at headquarters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>These are some possible trips: </strong><br /> All trips begin from the snow ramp across from the Rim Village restrooms.<br /> <br /> <strong>Discovery Point 1.2 mi. (1.9 km) one way.</strong> Discovery Point is a broad, unmarked viewpoint that overlooks Wizard Island and offers a view across the lake towards Phantom Ship. Gold prospector John Hillman first set eyes on Crater Lake in 1853 from this location. <br /> <br /> <strong>Wizard Island Overlook 2.3 mi. (3.7 km) one way.</strong> This small, unmarked viewpoint provides an expansive view of Wizard Island, a cinder cone that erupted out of Crater Lake around 7,300 years ago. <br /> <br /> <strong>Union Peak Overlook 3.1 mi. (5.0 km) one way. </strong>This segment is a steady climb, gaining 240 feet (73 meters) in elevation to a small, unmarked viewpoint on the left of the Cascade Mountains including, Union Peak 8 miles (13 km) to the south, MT. McLoughlin, 35 miles (56 km) away, and on a clear day Mt. Shasta, 100 miles (161 km) across the distance.<br />  <br /> <strong>Beyond Union Peak Overlook</strong>, the road cuts into a vertical cliff which usually fills with snow. It may be advisable to leave the road and bypass the cliff higher up on the slope. The route traverses the north face of Watchman Peak, an avalanche prone slope that is sometimes dangerously icy. <br /> <br /> <strong>Watchman Overlook: 3.9 mi. (6.3 km) </strong><br /> <strong>Diamond Lake Overlook: 4.6 mi. (7.4 km) <br /> North Junction: 6.0 mi. (9.7 km)</strong><br /> if an overnight stay is planned a backcountry permit is required.  <br />  ",

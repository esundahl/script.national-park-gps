The Red Cross continued to use the house as a warehouse for relief supplies, stationery, and Red Cross publications. </p> <p>Inside, the first floor includes a parlor room, dining room, offices, and a kitchen. The second floor was for bedrooms, including Ms. Barton's room at the rear of the house. Look up to the third floor and note the windows with red crosses in them. Some of the interior walls and ceilings are covered with muslin, the same material used in bandages.</p> <p>During her residence here, Barton developed the landscape into a miniature farm that was primarily self-sustaining, including crops, stables, and a chicken coop. This agricultural use of the landscape is no longer evident; development at the Glen Echo amusement park including roller coasters and the modern parking lot built over most of the farming operation. Many of the trees and plants that grow today are not consistent with the historic function of the grounds. However, the Clara Barton House is the most significant building associated with her time at Glen Echo, and it remains intact.</p> <p>In the years following Ms. Barton's death in 1912, her colleague, Dr. Julian Hubbell, replaced the porch with a columned, one-story porch. His twin nieces inherited the house in 1929 and converted the interior to rent-producing apartments, added baths and kitchens, and a garage with screened porches above at the western rear corner. </p> <p>Congress declared the Clara Barton House a National Historic Landmark on January 12, 1965, and in 1974 passed legislation establishing the house and grounds as the Clara Barton National Historic Site. This property was acquired by NPS in April 1975 through a donation from the Friends of Clara Barton. </p>",

Construction began in 1861. When Fort Marcy was completed, it had a perimeter of 338 feet and mounted 18 guns, a 10-inch mortar and two 24-pounder Coehorn mortars.</p> <p>The hill on which the fort is located was known as Prospect Hill. Originally the fort was called Fort W.F. Smith after Major General William F. Smith, the troops of whose division began construction of the work. His division crossed Chain Bridge on the night of September 24, 1861, and immediately commenced construction of Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen. The 79th New York Highlanders, the 141st Pennsylvania and the Iron Brigade also helped complete the work in the fall of 1862. A force of about 500 contrabands were employed. The 152nd New York worked on the entrenchments, which are still in a very good state of preservation. The site of Fort Marcy is near the location where the famous, but bloodless duel between Henry Clay and John Randolph was fought in 1826.</p> <p>The fort was not entirely completed until the fall of 1862. It is a relatively undisturbed fort and was named in honor of a native of Massachusetts, the Honorable Randolph B. Marcy, a distinguished soldier, father-in-law, and Chief of Staff to Gen. George B. McClellan. Detachments of the 4th New York Heavy Artillery, 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and the 130th Pennsylvania infantry were among the troops that performed garrison duty here during the war. An interesting incident of history is that the body of troops, which afterwards became famous, and the \"Iron Brigade\" was originated at this fort in the summer of 1861. It was composed of the 19th Indiana, the 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin Regiments. The 24th Michigan was added to the brigade soon after the battle of South Mountain.

        "notes": "Fort Washington Overlook\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/fort-washington-overlook.htm\n\nDuring the 19th century, the greatest threat to Washington, DC was by water. This narrow section on the Potomac River was an ideal location for a coastal defense. Fort Warburton was built on the Maryland side in 1808 as tensions escalated between the United States and England. During the War of 1812, as British troops marched overland into Washington, the fort was destroyed by its own garrison to prevent capture. This embarrassing incident led to the court martial of the fort's commander, Captain Samuel Dyson, and the construction of a more substantial fort in 1824, the one you see across the river today, known as Fort Washington.<br /> <br /> In 1861, Fort Washington was the only fortification defending the capital at the outset of the Civil War. To defend the federal city, 68 additional earthen forts were quickly constructed around the city. While no river attack occurred during the Civil War, this area continued to be a place for coastal defense. Just prier to the Spanish-American War (1898), this side of the Virginia shore began to be fortified with cannons to compliment the cannons at Fort Washington. This area was named Fort Hunt and the military accelerated construction and rehabilitation of both forts with modern artillery and a submerged minefield between the forts. By the 1930s, the forts were deemed obsolete, closed and given to the National Park Service. However, during World War II, Fort Hunt was reactivated as a top secret military intelligence camp and POW interrogation center. Today, both forts stand as silent reminders of the nation's military history. ",

Five black students were arrested, and the legality of their arrests was debated in U.S. Supreme Court (Griffin v. Maryland).

After the war, the US helped rebuild European economies. The people of the Netherlands gave Americans this carillon to thank them.<br /> <br /> A carillon is a percussion instrument of bells. Each bell in this town is bronze and inscribed with poetry and emblems. The bells represent various aspects of Dutch society such as art, science, agriculture, the youth of the Netherlands, and more. <br /> <br /> When a musician plays, they use a large keyboard of pegs in the top level of the tower. Wires connect each peg to a clapper that strikes a bell. The keyboard of pegs is laid out like a piano keyboard.<br /> <br /> The bell that makes the lowest musical note is six feet nine inches wide and weighs 12,654 pounds. The highest note comes from a bell that is eight inches wide and weighs 26.5 pounds. <h3>Harmony of Friendship</h3> The Netherlands Carillon has moved around the Washington, D.C. area and grown over time. In 1952, Queen Juliana presented the carillon symbolically to President Truman in Meridian Hill Park. <br /> <br /> In 1954, 49 bells were installed in a temporary structure in West Potomac Park. While the bells rang from there, construction on a permanent carillon began here. <br /> <br /> Dutch architect Joost W.C. Boks designed the 127-foot-tall tower. The geometric design recalls the style of Dutch artist Piet Mondriaan. The tower was the first modernist steel memorial on the National Mall. <br /> <br /> On May 5, 1960, the bells were celebrated in their new permanent home, the Netherlands Carillon. May 5 is Liberation Day in the Netherlands. It marks the end of Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during WWII.<br /> <br /> In 1995, 50 years after WWII, Netherlands Prime Minister Kok presented President Clinton with a 50th bell.<br /> <br /> In 2022, after a two-year rehabilitation project, the carillon was rededicated. Three more bells were added, making this a \"grand carillon\" with 53 bells total. One bell is for General George C. Marshall who helped rebuild Europe after WWII with the Marshall Plan. Another commemorates First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's advocacy for human rights. The final of the three new bells honors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s lifelong work advancing civil rights. <br /> <br /> Two bronze lions guard the carillon. Cast by Dutch sculptor Paul Koning , these lions symbolize the Dutch royal family. In spring, thousands of tulips decorate the grounds. ",

The focal point of the memorial is a 19 foot monolith made of sunset red granite quarried 35 miles from President Johnson's Texas ranch home. The granite monolith weighs about 43 tons and is estimated to be one billion years old. The stone was chiseled to embody Johnson's rugged, dynamic personality. Surrounding the memorial is a broad grassy meadow that provides visitors a place for physical and mental rejuvenation. <br /> <br /> The living memorial reflects the Johnson administration's commitment to preserving the nation's natural heritage. President Johnson designated 3.6 million acres of land as park land and signed into law the Wilderness Act and Clean Air Act. Around the base of the memorial are four quotes chosen by Lady Bird Johnson that reflect important elements of Johnson's Great Society program. One of the main goals of the Great Society was to promote the upward mobility of society and increase the quality of life for average Americans. Johnson's programs included over 60 educational bills and his signature \"war on poverty\" that created programs such as medicare, Johnson's first legislative accomplishment was the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, the first civil rights policy for almost 100 years that outlawed segregation in America. Over 1000 pieces of legislation became law during his 5-year administration.  <h3>\"Where flowers bloom, so does hope.\"- Claudia Alta Taylor \"Lady Bird\" Johnson</h3> <br /> First Lady Claudia Alta Taylor Johnson, known as Lady Bird, is famous for her nationwide beautification initiatives. When she served as first lady from 1963 to 1969, she championed legislation concerning pollution, conservation, urban renewal, and numerous environmental rehabilitation concerns. She is credited with raising the president's awareness of women's rights equality, furthering environmental stewardship, and promoting the war on poverty. After Lyndon Johnson's presidential term, Lady Bird continued to serve her country by holding advisory positions in later administrations. <br /> <br /> Across the footbridge is an island named Lady Bird Johnson Park. The island was originally named Columbia Island because it is actually part of the District of Columbia and the waterway between the island and Virginia was dubbed the Boundary Channel. The man-made island was built in the early 1900s to facilitate the construction of Arlington Memorial Bridge. In the 1960s, Lady Bird Johnson took action through her beautification committee to coordinate the planting of over a million daffodils, a few thousand dogwood trees, and other native vegetation on the island. <br /> <br /> The island is only one example of places Lady Bird worked to beautify in the District of Columbia. In 1968. Johnson's Secretary of Interior, Stewart Udall renamed this island Lady Bird Johnson Park to honor Lady Bird for her extensive work in revitalizing public parks and green spaces across the country.",

During the Civil War (1861-1865), Battery Rodgers was built overlooking the cove to guard the river approach to Washington. The battery also commanded the southern approaches to Alexandria by covering the Accotink Road (modern Fort Hunt Road). Though no visible remains of Battery Rodgers exist today, the complex once included the fortification, barracks, hospital and a slaughterhouse built especially to feed troops in Alexandria. <br /> <br /> Battery Rodgers was powerfully equipped with five 200-pound Parrott rifles and one 15-inch Rodman gun, but no shots- or men- were ever fired on enemy ships by its guns. This view of the battery shows the 15-inch Rodman gun and the powder magazines overlooking Battery Cove. In 1911, the cove was filled in by the Army Corps of Engineers, creating 46.5 acres of new land, including the spot on which you're standing. The battery is thought to have been just up the hill to the right. ",

President George Washington favored a 10-mile square territory along the Potomac River that encompassed the economically important ports of Georgetown and Alexandria. In 1791, the first boundary stone for the federal district- the south cornerstone- was laid with great fanfare right here on Jones Point. The District of Columbia was incorporated ten years later. Alexandria remained within the capital boundaries until an 1846 Act of Congress returned the land west of the Potomac River to Virginia the following year. </p> <h3>The Survey</h3> <p>Major Andrew Ellicott, owner of one of the finest sets of surveying instruments in the country, was put in charge of the D.C. boundary survey and established the first base camp on Jones Point. On-site measurements and round-the-clock astronomical calculations were conducted by Benjamin Banneker, a free black, self-taught in math and astronomy. <br /> <br /> After laying the first cornerstone here at Jones Point, Ellicott's team embarked on a 40-mile journey that took nearly two years. They created the boundary lines of the capital by clearing 20 feet of land on each side, then setting upright stones at each mile interval. Today, 37 of the original 40 stones remain. Look for them in woods, parking lots and even private yards. </p> <h3>L'Enfant's Folly</h3> <p>Although federal buildings were never intended to be constructed in Alexandria, Pierre L'Enfant, designer of the plan of Washington, hoped to extend the axial arrangement of the federal city across the river. His proposal was to erect a picturesque marker on Jones Point to complete the long vista from the White House.</p>",

Travel by land was long and difficult as the only road that connected the two was further inland on a path that is now approximated by modern day Route One. In 1892 an electric railway opened that connected Mount Vernon to Alexandria and Washington, DC. Finally, in 1932 (the 200th Anniversary of Washington's birth) the George Washington Memorial Parkway opened up connecting the cities to Mount Vernon. The Parkway, a unit of the National Park Service, provided a proper and suitable scenic path to allow patriotic pilgrims to travel to the home of George Washington. <br /> <br /> In 1972, the Mount Vernon Trail was originally created as a small fitness path but has grown to be a major trail for hikers and bikers interested in traveling the length of the Parkway. Today, as many as 1 million people make the pilgrimage to visit Mount Vernon every year. While they many not know it, they are following a path that has been traveled millions of times before by people interested in learning more about and honoring George Washington. ",

In 1917, the U.S. Emergency Fleet Corporation was created and eventually oversaw construction of 218 shipyards, including the one here on Jones Point. The first piling for the Virginia Shipbuilding Corporation's shipyard was driven in February 1918. The massive facility was up and running just 85 days later- a reported world record.<br /> <br /> The arrival of thousands of shipyard workers in Alexandria shattered the domestic tranquility of Jones Point. Responding to the acute worker housing shortage, the Virginia Shipbuilding Corporation began construction of 100 houses in the nearby suburb of Rosemont during the summer of 1918. Posters such as this one encouraged the new hires to \"pull together.\"",

Archeological evidence indicates that indigenous people set up seasonal fishing camps on the Point to take advantage of herring, shad, eel, striped bass and sturgeon runs. Large scale harvesting of fish continued into the 19th century, but began to decline in the 20th century as pollution increased.<br /> <br /> In the 1870s, commercial fishing on the Potomac became Alexandria's leading industry. A seasonal shantytown along the waterfront, called Fishtown, was devoted to processing the catch. According to an 1883 account, that there \"were seventeen shores fished, which employed over five hundred men and sixty horses.\"</p> <h3>Anadromous Life Cycle</h3> <p>Shad and sturgeon were the most prized catch for both natives and Europeans. These species are anadromous- they hatch upriver, swim out to sea, and, once full- grown, ascend the river to their birthplace to spawn.</p>",

The placement of the stone monolith marks the place where LBJ and the First Lady came to relax and enjoy their favorite view of Washington. This park offered an escape and place of peace (both physically and mentally) for the President and his family during his tumultuous years in office. Because LBJ loved this spot, his friends and family chose this place for his memorial after he passed away in 1973.<br /> <br /> Living memorials became more and more popular in the 20th century. Just over a mile north of here, along the George Washington Memorial Parkway, is another presidential living memorial, Theodore Roosevelt Island. This island was turned into a living memorial to President Roosevelt in honor of his conservation activities and love of the outdoors. President Lyndon Johnson was also an active conservationist, so it is fitting that this memorial celebrates his legacy. By providing a place visitors can actively recreate or relax, visitors can enjoy the view as Johnson did during his time in Washington. ",

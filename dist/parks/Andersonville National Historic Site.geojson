These prisoners of war were buried shoulder to shoulder in trenches. In 1865, after the end of the Civil War, the Union Army came and established the site as a national cemetery. Today over 20,000 of our nation's military men and women, representing nearly every American conflict, rest in honor on these hallowed grounds. Andersonville is the only national cemetery managed by the National Park Service that is still open and continues to provide burial services to American military service members, veterans, and their families.",

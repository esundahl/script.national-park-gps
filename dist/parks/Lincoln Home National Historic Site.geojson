        "notes": "Abraham Lincoln Home\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/abraham-lincoln-home.htm\n\n<p>Abraham Lincoln came of age while living and working as a private citizen in Springfield, Illinois. It was here that he chose to settle down, build a life for himself and his family, and worked hard to achieve success. At the same time, many of Lincoln's social and political beliefs were formed while he lived in this house at Eighth and Jackson Streets.<br /> <br /> The house that would become the future Lincoln Home was built in 1839 for the Reverend Charles Dresser. Dresser actually married Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd in 1842. When the house was completed, the house stood one-and-a-half stories tall with five rooms, including a sleeping loft.<br /> <br /> In May 1844, the Lincolns purchased the Dresser home and lot for $1500. Abraham, Mary, and Robert, born August 1, 1843, moved into the comfortable home. During the 17 years the Lincolns lived in this home, three of the Lincoln children were born--Edward \"Eddie\" Lincoln in 1846, William \"Willie\" Lincoln in 1850, and Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln in 1853. Eddie sadly died in the Lincoln Home of \"consumption\" when he was nearly 4 years old.<br /> <br /> The Lincolns continued to live in the house until departing for the White House in February 1861. Although they had planned to return, the Lincolns never came back to live in their house on the corner of Eighth and Jackson Streets. Today, the restored house reflects the Lincoln Home of 1860.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>The inside of the Lincoln Home is only accessible to the public by taking a guided tour of the Lincoln Home. Tickets for the guided tour are free of charge and can be obtained at the Visitor Center located one block west of the Lincoln Home, at 426 South 7th Street. </strong></em></p>",

There, he raised his family and pursued his passion for law and politics. The heritage area also highlights the people and the stories that shaped him to lead our nation through issues of unity, equality and race relations, and democratic ideals. It is home to Lincoln’s infamous 1858 Illinois State Senate debates with incumbent Senator Stephen A. Douglas, where they squared off in seven communities. Known as the “Land of Lincoln,” each community in the heritage area region has its own Lincoln story to tell in the form of artifacts, folklore, screenscapes, buildings, and living landscapes. Together, they bring an immediacy and tangible quality to the powerful Lincoln legacy. <br /> <br /> Looking for Lincoln? You’ll find him here! His stories come to life through the heritage areas’ living history programs. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{241b52fe-ba93-49b7-91be-0ce88c0edad3}{54}\" paraid=\"16\">Historic Sites and Points of Interest: </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li

It was not an easy journey for the man who grew up in a humble log cabin to end up in the White House, but it is a journey that has come to represent the American Dream--that any American should have the opportunity to improve their lot in life as long as they put in the effort. <br /> <br /> On this wayside, trace Lincoln's life's journey from Kentucky to Illinois, and his inaugural journey from Illinois to Washington D.C. on the wayside map--both important routes on his \"Long Road to Washington.\"<br /> . <br /> Audio description of wayside (including text and images) is available through this application with a screenreader.",

        "notes": "Lincoln Home National Historic Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/lincoln-home-national-historic-site.htm\n\n<p>Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois, was established in 1971 by Public Law 92-128 (85 Stat. 347). Lincoln Home National Historic Site protects and interprets the home where Abraham Lincoln lived with his family from 1844 to 1861.<br /> <br /> Lincoln Home National Historic Site preserves 14 houses that date from the Lincoln era, including the Lincoln Home. The Lincoln Home neighborhood was diverse, representing many occupations and social and economic levels. Through neighborhood preservation and interpretive activities, the National Park Service seeks to recreate a vivid sense of the relationship of the Lincoln family to their neighbors and the broader Springfield community, enriching the experience of visitors at Lincoln Home National Historic Site.<br /> <br /> From 1834 to 1842, Lincoln represented Sangamon County in the Illinois General Assembly and helped move the capital from Vandalia to Springfield. Lincoln and Mary Todd married in 1842 and in their first year together, the Lincolns lived in a hotel boarding house, the Globe Tavern. In 1844, Lincoln bought the home on the corner of Eighth and Jackson Streets for $1,200 cash and a small lot worth $300. The young family, which now included Robert, born in 1843, lived on a tight budget. Lincoln himself chopped the wood, carried the water, and milked the cow.<br /> <br /> When the family moved to Washington, DC, for Lincoln's presidency, the home was rented rather than sold and their best furniture placed in storage for their eventual return. But on April 15, 1865, an assassin’s bullet took the life of President Lincoln. His home became the focus for mourners and the photographers who recorded these early visitors. Mary Lincoln faced a lonely future and wrote that she “could not bear to return to the scenes of the happiest times in my life without my family.”<br /> <br /> By the late 19th century, Lincoln’s home became a popular scene for rallies, ceremonies, and celebrations. The Lincoln Home remained rental property until Lincoln’s son, Robert, donated the home to the State of Illinois in 1887 to be protected and preserved for future generations. Robert Lincoln did so with the condition that the home remain well maintained and available to the public free of charge.<br /> <br /> The home was designated a national historic landmark in 1960, and it remained the property of the State of Illinois until 1972, when it was transferred to the National Park Service. Property within the national historic site boundary was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a district in 1976. The national register district boundaries encompass a smaller area contained completely within the boundary of Lincoln Home National Historic Site.<br /> <br /> As Lincoln’s reputation grew, his home became a powerful political symbol. Even today, presidents and presidential hopefuls make well-publicized pilgrimages to the home. There are a variety of visitor activities available at Lincoln Home National Historic Site, including exhibits, a park film, and guided tours of the Lincoln Home.</p>",

Their son Julius was born one year later. The family quickly became involved in their community, and by 1867 Samuel Rosenwald served as president of their congregation B’rith Sholom.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1c1b7e96-0403-410c-8f18-cc4f965d5779}{254}\" paraid=\"1040108337\">As an adult, Julius Rosenwald would go on to invest in Sears and Roebuck company, and quickly rose through the organization becoming president in 1908. With what he said was more money than he could ever spend, Rosenwald focused on philanthropy donating more than 60 million dollars in his lifetime.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{05493851-0f8b-456f-b7fd-397f802aa271}{23}\" paraid=\"1901161082\">Much of this philanthropy was to support the African American community through a variety of initiatives including YMCAs for African Americans, fellowships, and schools. One of his most impactful initiatives were <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-rosenwald-schools-progressive-era-philanthropy-in-the-segregated-south-teaching-with-historic-places.htm\">\"Rosenwald Schools\".</a> These schools were funded partly through Rosenwald but also required local community support. From 1917 to 1932 more than 5,000 Rosenwald schools were built across 15 states. By the time the last school was built more than 600,000 African American students had attended a Rosenwald school. <br /> <br /> Today the house is owned and operated by the National Park Service. </p>",

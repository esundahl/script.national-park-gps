Basin and Range topography results from crustal extension. As the crust is stretched (pulled apart), high angle faults develop. Along these faults, mountains uplift and valleys drop, creating the distinctive mountain ranges and wide valleys of theBasin and Range province.  <br /> <br /> As rocky ranges rise, the newly exposed rock is immediately subjected to <u>weathering</u> and erosion. This rock is attacked by water, ice, wind, and other erosive agents, that have produced many of the geologic features visible today.  <br /> <br /> The majority of outcrops at City of Rocks, and all of the pinnacles, consist of <u>intrusive igneous rock</u> with a granitic composition. Geologists have mapped the two different types of granitic rock within the Reserve as the Green Creek Complex and the Almo pluton.  </p>",

Radiometric analysis indicates that the Green Creek granite may be as old as 2.5 billion years (<u>Archean</u>) and is considered to be some of the oldest rock exposed on the continent west of the Mississippi River. This granite has a porphyritic texture, meaning it is composed of crystals of two distinct sizes.The larger crystals are potassium feldspar. They are embedded in a matrix of smaller crystals consisting of quartz, biotite, and plagioclase feldspar. <br /> <br /> Feldspars are the most common family of silicate minerals. They are broadly divided into two groups: sodium and calcium bearing feldspars, called plagioclase, and potassium bearing feldspars, called orthoclase, microcline or sanidine, depending on their crystallographic structure. </p>",

The pluton started out as an intrusive body of magma and has a convoluted contact with the Green Creek Complex. It is the youngest rock at City of Rocks and formed about 28 million years ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike the granite of the Green Creek Complex, the Almo pluton has an equigranular texture. Notice in the photograph the small uniform size of the crystals in the Almo pluton in contrast to the variety of sizes in the Green Creek Complex. <br /> <br /> Both types of granite are cut in many places by dikes of pegmatite, a very coarse-grained granitic rock that usually forms during the last stages of crystallization of a large granitic pluton. The pegmatites at City of Rocks contain large quartz and feldspar crystals about the size of a fist. </p>",

They might be symbols, or a sign marking the way, reminders of a vision and not meaningful to any other individual.<br /> <br /> These pictographs were identified in 2003 by a park ranger and have been professionally documented.

Weathering occurs on the surface of outcrops by granular disintegration (one layer of crystals after another are removed from the surface). This weathering leaves the newly exposed surface in a smooth rounded condition with no sharp or ragged edges. The <u>detrital</u> material is carried by wind and water to low areas among the prominent outcrops. The detrital material (granitic sand) that is found at the base of most outcrops is called grus. Weathering-related features seen here include case hardening, <u>exfoliation</u>, and <u>grus</u> (located at the base of the outcrop). </p>",

Granite contracts as it cools, and the joints are produced as these stresses pull theminerals apart. <br /> <br /> Scientific explanations aside, the artistic patterns of these joints within the Almo pluton make it worthy of second look.

Do you believe the story of buried treasure? A roadside attraction, Treasure Rock sees many curious visitors each year.  <br /> <br /> This legend is plausible. Although versions of the robbery differ, most agree that the Kelton stage was robbed circa 1878 in gold bullion bound for a U.S. military camp in Boise. One bandit (in some accounts, two) was killed in the confrontation. The second was captured days later after reportedly burying the treasure at the base of what soon become know as Treasure Rock. <br /> <br /> Stop and check out the wayside exhibit at Treasure Rock and explore the area.</p>",

Coastal prairies once covered over 8 million acres of the U.S. Today less than one percent of it remains. Palo Alto Battlefield of one of those precious pockets.This important habitat is home to the endangered Aplomado falcon. Down on the ground you might come across a Texas horned lizard soaking up the sun, or a Fiddler crab burrowing to reach the ground water.Compared to the chaparral, the coastal prairie vegetation is sparser. The types of plants that grow here are limited by the salinity of the soil. Some of the plants that flourish here are gulf-cord grass, sea-ox eye, and shore grass. Although it might look as just a flat open area, the coastal prairie at Palo Alto is a valuable habitat and home to a variety species.</p>",

The site served as their main base on the Rio Grande. When war erupted between the U.S. and Mexico, the fort became a primary target for Mexican forces.<br /> <br /> This earthwork withstood a six-day siege by the Mexican Army, sustaining only two casualties. One of them was Major Jacob Brown. On May 17, 1846, General Zachary Taylor honored Brown by issuing an order officially naming the site Fort Brown. The town that eventually grew up in turn took its name from the fort—Brownsville.<br /> <br /> While visiting this site you can see historical markers and even what is left of one of the fort’s bastions. The nearby campus of UTRGV is home to several post-Mexican War buildings.",

He chose this site, the Mexican settlement known as El Frontón de Santa Isabel or Point Isabel. The garrison would be known as Fort Polk.<br /> <br /> Point Isabel and Fort Polk played a significant role in the start of war between the United States and Mexico. After U.S. troops occupied Matamoros on May 18, Point Isabel and Fort Polk declined in military importance. The post had never been anything more than a series of trenches, mounds of earth and piles of brush, fence posts, and overturned wagons.<br /> <br /> In 1852 a lighthouse was constructed on the grounds of the old fortification. Today, visitors can walk the grounds of the lighthouse and climb the stairs to the observation deck 50 feet above the ground.

The Mexican battle line was almost a mile long and ran east to west on the south end of Palo Alto Battlefield. Arista's rested his left flank right on the road. The object was to stop Taylor’s force from relieving the siege of the U.S. Army’s fort on the banks of the Rio Grande.<br /> <br /> The general’s plan was to let Taylor’s army advance down the road or across the field and then envelop him by closing in with his dreaded Lancers.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately for General Arista, things did not go as planned. Taylor never did charge down the road. Instead he pulled his artillery forward and the battle of Palo Alto turned into an artillery duel. It was a duel that put the Mexican Army at a disadvantage.<br /> <br /> On the afternoon of May 8, 1846, this end of the field took heavy fire from Taylor’s artillery. The U.S. guns bombarded the Mexican battle line with explosive shells from 18-pounder siege cannon and solid shot from 6-pounder field guns, tearing open holes all along the line. Arista army suffered 102 killed, 129 wounded, and 26 missing.</p>",

On the afternoon of May 8, 1846, artillery rounds would’ve filled the air around this spot.<br /> <br /> The Overlook provides an excellent vantage point to view the battlefield. Directly in front of the overlook lay the remnants of the historic Matamoros to Point Isabel Road, a critical strategic element of the battle. Off to the south, is the Mexican battle line and to the north is the U.S. battle line.<br /> <br /> The prairie in front of the Overlook was ideal for 19th century warfare. It was an open field with good visibility. This area has changed somewhat in the time since the battle. The open prairie and sea of chest-high cord grass, that U.S. and Mexican soldiers wallowed through, is now gone.<br /> <br /> The cord grass is much shorter now and the prairie is broken up by stands of mesquite trees and prickly pear cactus.  These battlefield invaders were aided in their assault by activities such as cattle ranching and development of the surrounding area.<br /> <br /> From here one can appreciate the size of the battlefield. Both battle lines are clearly visible from here as they are only about 700 yards apart. The range limits the artillery forced the lines to be this close. Despite its size, the small field this Overlook watches over would kick off a conflict that led to Mexico losing half of its national territory and the U.S. doubling in size.</p>",

News of the skirmish reached Fort Texas later that day. General Taylor forwarded word to President Polk that hostilities had commenced.In the time since the skirmish at Carricitos, the exact location of the ranch has been forgotten. Soldiers had measured the distance to the site along the winding path of the Rio Grande. The shifting course of the river has made these measurements unreliable.Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park has continued to conduct research that may, in time, pinpoint the exact location of the Rancho de Carricitos skirmish.",

They do not have a natural connection to the Rio Grande. It is through the pumping of water from the Rio Grande that they have any water flow.

Taylor halted his advance at this spot and contemplated his next move.<br /> <br /> Taylor had told his men before they left Point Isabel it would be the bayonet that would settle any encounter with the Mexican army. However, carrying out a frontal attack against a numerically superior enemy already in battle formation would be foolish. It would also put his long supply wagon train in jeopardy.<br /> Instead of continuing down the road, and possibly taking heavy casualties, General Taylor deployed his troops into battle formation.<br /> <br /> Taylor set his right flank on the Matamoros to Point Isabel Road, near this spot. It consisted of the US 5th Infantry, Major Ringgold’s field artillery, Lt. Churchill’s 18-pounder siege cannons, and the 3rd and 4th Infantry. He kept Captain May’s dragoons in reserve.<br /> <br /> The left flank, to the east of this spot, consisted of Lt. Col. Child’s “Foot Artillery”, Captain Duncan’s field artillery, and the 8th Infantry. Captain Ker’s dragoons pulled double duty guarding the wagon train and supporting the left flank.<br /> <br /> The ensuing battle became a showcase for one of the U.S. Army’s latest weapons...the flying artillery. The light, mobile field guns made up for Taylor’s numerical disadvantage as his guns wreaked havoc on the soldados across the field. The infantries of both armies had very little involvement in the fight.</p>",

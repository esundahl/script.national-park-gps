The skill of the blacksmith in making and repairing iron objects made him a necessary worker at Hopewell Furnace and nearly every other community in America during the 18th and 19th centuries. He shaped shoes for the horses and mules that were essential for the furnace operations. He made nails, hinges, hooks, wagon parts, tools, and repaired all the iron fixtures of the furnace's machinery. Little wonder why his work kept him busy 6 days a week and on call 24 hours to maintain the furnace's operation.<br /> <br /> The importance of the Blacksmith and other iron workers illustrate the influence of iron in early America. Iron and its derivative, steel, were the most commonly used metals for making man made objects. As the industrial revolution expanded, iron would play an ever-increasing roll in the nation's economic and industrial development.<br />  </p>",

All of Hopewell's products were produced in this building. To the left of the furnace, moulders worked at their benches producing sand molds for stove plates and other cast products. Guttermen dug trenches and runners for iron and slag in the clay floor in front of the furnace. The furnace founder monitored the furnace and water wheel, shouting instructions up to the fillers. All of this work was done over two twelve hour shifts, seven days a week, for an average of ten months at a time. Temperatures in this building would reach over 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Imagine what it would be like to stand here in the middle of a busy work shift. The current Cast House is a reconstruction built by Amish contractors for the National Park Service in 1965.</p>",

        "notes": "Au Sable Light Station\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/au-sable-light-station.htm\n\n<p>Located within Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, this picturesque lighthouse stands on Au Sable Point on the south shore of Lake Superior, approximately 12 miles west of Grand Marais, Michigan. <br /> <br /> Built in 1873-1874, the light tower's base diameter is 16 feet with a height of 86 feet. The tower extends 23 feet underground and is anchored in bedrock. A brick oil building and fog signal building were built in the 1890s. All of the buildings on site, along with the tower and keepers' quarters, make up the <em>light station</em>. <br /> <br /> The original keepers' dwelling was attached to the light tower in the back. In 1909, a new residence was built for the head keeper and the existing building expanded so it could accommodate two assistant keepers and their families. One family lived upstairs and one downstairs, with separate entrances. In 1945 the U.S. Coast Guard took over, replacing the civilian keepers. In total, the light station was continually staffed for 84 years, until the Coast Guard left in 1958.<br /> <br /> A third-order Fresnel lens reflected the first light, which was fueled initially by lard oil and then by kerosene. The fixed white beam could be seen 17 miles out on the lake. The lighthouse became fully automated in 1958 and transferred from the Coast Guard to the National Park Service in 1968. The lighthouse still operates - a smaller, solar-powered light now sits on the catwalk railing and shines over Lake Superior every evening.</p>   <p><strong>Visiting the Au Sable Light Station</strong><br /> To visit the Au Sable Light Station, drive to the lower Hurricane River Campground located 12 miles west of Grand Marais on Alger County Road H-58. Park in the day-use area. <br /> <br /> It is a 1.5 mile walk (one way) to the lighthouse. From the day-use parking lot, walk east through the campground from the picnic area near the Hurricane River mouth. The trail continues past the campground on the historic U.S. Coast Guard access road to the light station. Be alert for occasional staff vehicle traffic.<br /> <br /> On the beach below the trail, exposed shipwreck remains dot the shoreline. Watch for the signs and steps to the beach along the access road. Drinking water and a toilet are available seasonally at the light station. <strong>Leashed pets are permitted on the access road to the light station and on the station grounds, but not in the buildings. Bicycles are <u>not</u> permitted on this road.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><u>NOTE</u>:</span> On hot, humid days in summer with a south wind, biting flies in this area can be fierce and can ruin your visit to the light station. Consider wearing loose-fitting long pants and socks before starting down the trail. <br /> <br /> Summer Lighthouse Tours</strong><br /> Au Sable Lighthouse tours are scheduled Wednesday through Sunday from mid-June through the end of September or through early October (as staffing permits). No tours on Monday and Tuesday. Tours begin at 11 am and run through 3:30 pm (11:00, 12:00, 1:30, 2:30, and 3:30). Meet at the lighthouse. <br /> <br /> The 30-40 minute park ranger-guided tours begin at the lighthouse east porch. Tour <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">fee</a> is $5 for those 6 and older. <em><strong>Exact amount </strong></em>is required (no change provided)<em>.</em> Fees are payable at the start of the tour. <br /> <br /> <em>Light station visitors are reminded that the area includes very sandy soils, narrow sidewalks, and steps to access the buildings. </em><br /> <br /> In addition to tours, visitors are encouraged to enjoy the small lighthouse museum located in the head keeper's building. The museum is open during summer months as staffing permits. Get maps and park information, as well as Junior Ranger activity books, at the museum when open.</p>",

        "notes": "Ice Climbing at Pictured Rocks\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/ice-climbing-piro.htm\n\n<p>Ice climbing is an exciting winter sport at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore that becomes more popular each year. The combination of cold temperatures, plentiful lake-effect snow, numerous waterfalls, porous sandstone cliffs, and water seeping out of the rock layers creates spectacular ice curtains and tall ice columns. <br /> <br /> Snow and ice are generally present by the second or third week in December and remain until early April. While ice frequently forms along the Pictured Rocks cliffs above Lake Superior, these areas are not recommended for climbing due to hazardous exposure to the lake.<br /> <br /> <strong>The most easily-accessed ice formations are found along the inland cliff escarpment between Munising Falls and Sand Point Beach, most of which parallels Sand Point Road.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Sand Point</strong> columns and blue ice curtains are 20-50 feet high. Shortest access is from the Sand Point Beach parking<strong> </strong>lot. Park at the lot and walk the road 1/4 to 1/2 mile back to access the nearest climbing areas. Sand Point Road is plowed all winter; however it is narrow with no shoulder. <strong>Therefore, parking is prohibited along the road itself.</strong> <br /> <br /> Walkers should watch for traffic and slippery conditions on the road. Drivers need to watch for ice climbers walking to and from the parking lot. The vault toilet at Sand Point Beach is open year-round.<br /> <br /> Miners Falls is another popular climbing area. The falls produce a 40-foot ice column during the coldest weather. Access requires a 3 mile ski or snowshoe trek in from the end of the plowed road at the junction of Carmody and Miners Castle Roads.<br /> <br /> Other popular areas for climbing are within <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hiawatha/recarea/?recid=13270\">Grand Island National Recreation Area</a>, which is administered by the Hiawatha National Forest. Grand Island ice curtains are accessed from the Grand Island Ferry Landing off M-28 just west of Munising. <br /> <br /> <em><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>NOTE</strong>:</span> Travel between Sand Point and the thumb portion of Grand Island is not recommended due to frequent hazardous ice conditions caused by lake currents.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Ice Climbing Regulations</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Munising Falls is <u>closed</u> to ice climbing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Camping is not allowed at climbing sites. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pets are not allowed on or off trails to Sand Point ice climbing locations.</strong></p> </li> </ul>",

A short walk from the parking lot past historic logging equipment leads to the Log Slide area on top of the dunes. <strong>Pets are not allowed on the trail to Log Slide or in the nearby dunes.</strong><br /> <br /> What is the Log Slide? In Michigan's past, loggers built a long wooden chute on the dune slope to slide logs down into Lake Superior where they could be easily floated to saw mills in Grand Marais. Legend has it that logs sent down the tall dunes on a dry log chute would generate enough friction to cause the chute to catch fire. Today the chute is gone, but the lumberjack stories still linger as you read the interpretive exhibits along the trail.<br /> <br /> The North County Trail intersects the Log Slide Trail at the base of a large dune. At this point you can climb up the dune ahead for great views. Or if you don't want to climb in sand, you can walk a level path to the site of the former overlook platform for panoramic views.<br /> <br /> To find this path, turn left on the North Country Trail. Go about 25 yards to the end of the wooden fence and you'll see a path going off to your right. Follow that short path to the viewing location at the end.<br /> <br /> From this spot, look left to see the Au Sable Lighthouse in the distance.

It is one of the most famous landmarks along the Pictured Rocks shoreline, and is the only cliff area in the park accessible by vehicle. <strong>Leashed pets permitted. </strong><br /> <br /> From the parking lot, a short paved wheelchair-accessible trail leads past interpretive exhibits to two breathtaking overlooks of Lake Superior and Grand Island. Stairs and a steeper trail lead to the lower overlook adjacent to Miners Castle. Erosion over long periods of time has created the interesting rock formation that gives this place its name. A <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/parknews/minerscastlecollapse.htm\">rockfall in 2006</a> dramatically changed the look of Miners Castle as one of its two turrets unexpectedly fell into the lake.<br /> <br /> The loop from the information deck to all three overlooks and back is about 1/2 mile. Access to the lower overlook includes stairs and a steep walking incline. The North Country Scenic Trail passes through the Miners Castle area. There is a 1.0 mile section of the trail that leads from top of the cliff down to Miners Beach. <br /> <br /> The Pictured Rocks cliffs hold great spiritual significance to the Anishinaabe or Ojibwe people who have lived in this area for thousands of years. Miners Castle was named by Englishman Alexander Henry’s employees when they were exploring the area for minerals in 1771. Though no minerals were ever found, the name “Miners” has endured. <br /> <br /> To the geologist, Miners Castle is an open textbook, revealing the history of the Earth at the northern edge of the Michigan Basin. The Pictured Rocks escarpment is one of the primary landscape features along the entire south shore of Lake Superior. Commercial tours have been providing boat tours past the castle since the 1940s. This rocky cliff is one of several highlights of the 2 to 2.5 hour cruise that continues east to Chapel Beach.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why is this rock here?</strong><br /> The Pictured Rocks cliffs are made of three formations of Precambrian and Paleozoic age sandstone, the Jacobsville (bottom), Munising (middle), and Au Train (top). These layers represent different periods of time, sources of sediment, and physical characteristics. Weathering, ancient and current great lakes levels and several glacial events have carved the rocks into the forms we see them today.",

These trails wind through a magical landscape of various habitats and topography, including beech, maple, hemlock, and conifer forests; old gently rolling farm fields, and rugged hills created in the park's glacial past. Since this region receives about 140+ inches of snow each year, skiing is one of the park's most popular winter sports.<br /> <br /> There are eight groomed loops within the Munising ski area, ranging from 0.8 miles to 2.4 miles. Combine loops for a longer ski. Trails vary in difficulty, from Easiest to Most Difficult. Loop G (1.9 miles) is not tracked, and is shared by both skiers and snowshoers.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:null;\">Trails are designed for diagonal stride only - skating is not permitted</span><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">. <strong>To avoid ruining groomed tracks, pets, snowshoeing, bicycling, and walking are not permitted on park ski trails</strong></span><strong>. <br /> <br /> Location and Directions: </strong>From Munising, take Alger County Road H-58 east for about 1.5 miles. Watch for the \"Munising Ski Trails\" sign. Turn left into the main ski area parking. There is a kiosk at the trailhead with a map and other information.<br /> <br /> There is also another parking area and trailhead near the end of E. City Limits Road. Follow H-58 another 1/2 mile east past the turn into the main ski area to E. City Limits Road. Turn left. The ski parking area will be on the left before the end of the road. This is also the parking area for the park's official snowshoe trail. <strong>(There are no bathroom facilities at either parking lot or anywhere along the trails). </strong><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/upload/PIRO-Ski-and-Snowshoe-Trails-508.pdf\">View and download the Munising Ski Trail map.</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Safety:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Maps are located at trailheads and at trail intersections.</p> </li> <li> <p>Follow the direction of travel.

These sandstone cliffs stretch for about 15 miles along the lake from Sand Point on the west to just after Spray Falls on the east. The most colorful portion of the cliffs begins east of Miners Beach.<br /> <br /> The name \"Pictured Rocks\" comes from streaks of mineral stain that decorate the face of the weather-sculpted sandstone. Stunning colors occur when groundwater oozes out of cracks and trickles down the rock face. Iron (red and orange), copper (blue and green), manganese (brown and black), and limonite (white) are among the most common color-producing minerals.<br /> <br /> <strong>The best view of the cliffs is from the water. </strong>A National Park Service authorized concessionaire operates a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/pictured-rocks-boat-cruises.htm\">non-stop boat tour </a>of the Pictured Rocks cliffs from mid-May through mid-October.<br /> <br /> The 10-mile loop <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/dayhikes.htm\">hiking trail</a> in the Chapel Basin provides the best views from land.

Be aware that just driving from one end of the park to the other already takes more than an hour. If you have a boat tour scheduled in Munising, give yourself extra time to get there.</p> <h4><strong>COMING FROM MUNISING: (west side of the park)</strong></h4> <p><u><strong>Munising Falls / Sand Point</strong></u><br /> Both Munising Falls and the beaches of Sand Point can be enjoyed in an hour. Head east out of Munising on Alger County Road H-58 about 1 mile and turn left on Washington Street. (Watch for road signs to Munising Falls and Sand Point.)<br /> <br /> The Munising Falls parking lot is across from the hospital at the junction of Washington Street and Sand Point Road. Walk the paved 800-ft. trail to Munising Falls. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> Afterwards, drive 2 more miles down Sand Point Road to the beaches at the end. Enjoy stunning views of Grand Island across the bay. Both Munising Falls and Sand Point have plowed roads and parking lots that can be accessed by regular vehicles in winter. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <u><strong>Sand Point / Sand Point Marsh Trail</strong></u><br /> You can easily spend an hour at Sand Point walking the beach and also exploring the 1/2 mile boardwalk Marsh Trail through some of the park's most beautiful wetlands. See directions to Sand Point above.<br /> <br /> The wheelchair-accessible marsh trail loop begins at the main Sand Point parking lot. This is a great place for kids, bird watchers, and all nature lovers.<strong> Pets not allowed on the Sand Point Marsh Trail.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong><u>Miners Falls</u> </strong><br /> The parking lot for the Miners Falls trail is approximately 9 miles from Munising. Follow Alger County Road H-58 about 5 miles east to Miners Castle Road (H-11). Turn left and go 4 miles north to the turn-off for Miners Falls. Turn right and drive 1/2 mile on the unpaved road to the parking lot. From there, the trail is 0.6 miles one way to the waterfall. The gently rolling trail goes through a beautiful northwoods forest, ending at two viewing platforms for Miners Falls. <strong>Leashed pets allowed. <br /> <br /> NOTE: Be aware that vehicles longer than 32 feet in length are prohibited from driving into the Miners Falls parking lot as the lot is quite small and not suitable for larger vehicles.<br /> <br /> <u>Miners Castle / Miners Beach</u>  </strong><br /> You can spend as little or as much time as you like at these two locations - however, they are both doable in an hour. Miners Castle is approximately 11 miles from Munising. Follow Alger County Road H-58 about 5 miles east to Miners Castle Road (H-11). Turn left and go 6 miles north to Miners Castle.<br /> <br /> This is the only place where you can drive on the cliffs. The main viewing platform is just a short walk from the parking lot and is wheelchair-accessible. Allow at least a half hour at Miners Castle if you want to walk to all three viewing platforms. <strong>Leashed pets allowed. </strong><br /> <br /> Once you leave the Miners Castle parking lot, take the first left and drive the road about 1 mile to the Miners Beach parking lot. You can take a quick walk out to the beach just to see the view or spend more time there. Allow at least a half hour if you want to walk west down the beach to Miners River and back. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong></p> <h4><strong>COMING FROM GRAND MARAIS</strong>: <strong>(east side of the park)</strong></h4> <p><u><strong>Sable Falls / Sable Beach</strong></u><br /> Drive approximately 1 mile west of the town of Grand Marais on Alger County Road H-58 to the Sable Falls parking lot. A short walk from the parking lot leads to a long staircase of 168 steps down to the main falls viewing platform.<br /> <br /> After viewing the falls, continue on the trail along Sable Creek for another 0.2 miles out to Sable Beach. Enjoy the views of the Grand Sable Dunes towering to the left and the expanse of Lake Superior ahead. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <u><strong>Grand Sable Dunes Trail</strong></u><br /> The 0.6 roundtrip trail to the Grand Sable Dunes also begins in the Sable Falls area. Park at the Sable Falls parking lot and walk towards the falls. The intersection of the Grand Sable Dunes Trail begins near the top of the falls. The trail goes through an old homestead field, across Sable Creek, through a forested dune ecosystem, and ends on top of the dunes.<br /> <br /> Once at the top, walk a short distance to the right for a spectacular view of Lake Superior. The trail is fairly level, but there are some uphill sections of walking in sand. Return to the parking lot the way you came. <strong>Pets are not allowed on the Grand Sable Dunes Trail.</strong><br /> <br /> <u><strong>Log Slide</strong></u><br /> The Log Slide area highlights the logging history of this area and provides a stunning view of the Grand Sable Dunes and Lake Superior.<strong> </strong>Drive approximately 7 miles west of Grand Marais on Alger County Road H-58, and then 1.0 mile north on Log Slide Road to the parking lot. Walk the short path towards the dunes and read the interpretive signs along the way.<br /> <br /> At the intersection of the North Country Trail you can climb the large dune ahead to get various views. Those who don't want to climb in sand can turn left on the North Country Trail and walk just a few yards to the level spur trail heading to the right (at the end of the wooden fence).<br /> <br /> Walk out to the edge of the dune for great views of the sand dunes to the right, and the Au Sable Lighthouse to the left. Take care not to get too close to the dune edge. Watch for poison ivy along the trail. <strong>Pets are not allowed in the Log Slide area.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Places with drinking water available (seasonal only)</strong><br /> Munising Falls<br /> Miners Castle<br /> Sable Falls<br /> Grand Sable Dunes Trail <br /> Log Slide<br /> <br /> <strong>Places with toilet facilities</strong><br /> Munising Falls (flush toilet year-round)<br /> Sand Point Beach and Marsh Trail (vault toilet year-round)<br /> Miners Falls (vault toilet, seasonal)<br /> Miners Castle (flush and vault toilet, seasonal)<br /> Miners Beach (vault toilet, seasonal)<br /> Sable Falls (flush toilet, seasonal)<br /> Grand Sable Dunes Trail (flush toilet, seasonal)<br /> Grand Sable Visitor Center parking lot (vault toilet, year-round)<br /> Log Slide (vault toilet, seasonal)<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  </p> <br />  ",

        "notes": "Snowshoe Trail at Pictured Rocks\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/snowshoe-trail-piro.htm\n\n<p>The park has one marked snowshoe trail. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/upload/PIRO-Ski-and-Snowshoe-Trails-508.pdf\">View and download the snowshoe trail map </a>(1.98 MB pdf). This 2.65 mile forested \"lollipop\"- shaped trail loops back on itself and starts at the end of E. City Limits Road off Alger County Road H-58 on the east side of Munising. Park in the ski trail parking lot near the end of the road and walk a few hundred yards down the road to the end. The trail begins just past the wooden fence, and is marked with blue posts.<br /> <br /> The snowshoe trail also connects users to the G-Loop ungroomed ski trail. Including the G-Loop in your snowshoe excursion will add 1.6 miles to the trek. The G-Loop isn’t tracked, so snowshoers and cross-country skiers share the trail. It also offers snowshoers and skiers great views of Lake Superior. To protect the groomed tracks, the other ski trails are off-limits to snowshoeing and hiking.<br /> <br /> There is no bathroom at the parking area or anywhere along the snowshoe trail. <strong>Leashed pets are allowed on the snowshoe trail, winter only. PLEASE do not take pets on the adjacent groomed ski trails. </strong><br /> <br /> Besides the official trail, the entire park is open to snowshoeing. The only places you <strong><u>cannot</u></strong> snowshoe are on the park's <strong>20 miles of groomed cross-country ski trails</strong>. The remainder of the park is available for you to enjoy via snowshoeing or off-trail skiing. Once you have gone as far as you wish, turn around and follow your tracks back to the car! Barring a blizzard, your record of tracks will be easy to follow. <strong>Watch for snowmobile traffic on trails and roads. </strong><br /> <br /> Areas easy to snowshoe include the short walking path to Munising Falls and the 1/2 mile Sand Point Marsh Trail. Both trails can be accessed by regular vehicles since these parking lots are plowed all winter. You can also access the North Country National Scenic Trail from the Sand Point Beach parking lot, Munising Falls Visitor Center parking lot, or the Grand Sable Visitor Center parking lot.<br /> <br /> Though wildlife is pretty scarce in winter, tracks of red squirrel, deer, snowshoe hare, grouse, raven, American marten, and fisher may be seen.<br /> <br /> <strong>Your Safety Comes First!</strong></p> <p>Plan ahead and be prepared is the best advice for snowshoeing or any outdoor activity. An unexpected slip into a creek or a broken snowshoe can quickly spell disaster. We encourage you to carefully plan your snowshoe excursion into the park. Here are helpful suggestions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Before you leave home, let someone know where you are going, how long you plan to be out, a description of your vehicle, where it will be parked, and when you plan to return. <strong>Write It Down!</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Take plenty of liquids and snacks or food along with you...maybe a little to spare in case something should happen.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dress in layers and be prepared for changes in weather. Consider bringing along hand and feet warmers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Watch the weather. Storms pop up quickly. They can lead to white-out conditions and heavy snowfall. Snow and wind may quickly obliterate trails.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don’t expect your cell phone to work in many areas of the park due to a lack of towers, cloudy conditions, hilly topography and heavy forest cover. The marked snowshoe trail in Munising has pretty reliable service.</p> </li> <li> <p>Take a compass and map and know how to use them. It is easy to get turned around when the days are short and the clouds block the sun.</p> </li> <li> <p>Realize that the park ranger staff is reduced in winter and response times are extended due to winter conditions. For emergencies, dial 911.</p> </li> </ul> <p><br /> Winter is one of the most incredible seasons here. You will likely see very few people, a lot of animal tracks, and will be able to enjoy a type of solitude unknown at other times of the year. Happy trekking!</p>",

Water seeping out of the porous sandstone cliffs freezes into spectacular curtains and columns of white ice 20-50 feet high tinged with blue, green, or yellow hues. The ice generally begins to form by mid-December and remains until early April.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/upload/Ice-Viewing-Map-at-PIRO-508.pdf\">View and download the ice viewing map </a>(2.57 MB pdf).<br /> <br /> <strong>The most easily-accessed ice formations are found along the inland cliff escarpment between Munising Falls and Sand Point Beach, most of which parallels Sand Point Road.</strong><br /> <br /> Sand Point Road is plowed all winter. Park at the Sand Point Beach parking lot and walk back on the road 1/4 to 1/2 mile. (Parking is prohibited on Sand Point Road itself.) Watch for signs just off the road to your left designating various ice climbing and viewing locations.<br /> <br /> Walk/hike uphill to the base of the escarpment to find and view the ice. There are no designated trails, but cliffs and ice can be seen through the forest as you walk along the road. People walking up to the formations create visible snow-packed trails over time.<br /> <br /> Visitors can also hike/snowshoe from the Munising Falls parking lot along the North Country Scenic Trail towards Sand Point to view some of the ice formations from the top rather than the base. (Please do not walk or snowshoe on groomed ski trails in the area!)<br /> <br /> Ice curtains on Grand Island can be seen across Munising Bay from the beaches at the end of Sand Point Road. Binoculars are recommended for viewing Grand Island ice formations.<br /> <br /> The park’s waterfalls also freeze into stunning formations in winter. Munising Falls is the easiest to reach via an 800-foot trail from the Munising Falls parking lot. <strong>Climbing on Munising Falls is prohibited.

Watch for cars and expect slippery conditions. <br /> <br /> Ice cleats of some sort are critical to avoid slipping or falling while walking/hiking to the formations and exploring among the ice curtains. Ice cleats are slipped onto shoes and boots, and can usually be found for sale at local businesses. Snowshoes may also be necessary after heavy snow until a path gets packed down.<br /> <br /> While ice frequently forms along the Pictured Rocks cliffs above Lake Superior, these areas are difficult to view. Walking on Lake Superior or across Munising Bay is not recommended - <strong>EVER</strong> - due to unknown ice thickness, thin and shifting ice, hidden underwater currents, and open water. No one can tell you if the ice is safe to walk on. Also:</p> </figure> <ul> <li> <p><strong>No pets allowed on or off trails to the Sand Point ice formations</strong>.

Andrew, brother of Principal Chief John Ross, was a Cherokee businessman and judge on the Cherokee Supreme Court. Susannah (Susan) was the daughter of Assistant Principal Chief George Lowery. An 1834 valuation of the property describes the large 2-story dwelling as constructed of hewn logs with a shingled roof, plank floors, a brick chimney with two fireplaces, and a 2-story banistered piazza extending across the front. Other structures included a 24-foot by 12-foot framed addition, a separate 16-foot by 16-foot log kitchen, a large double stable, two smaller stables, a smoke house, hen house, milk house, corn cribs, spring house, and several smaller cabins. The several hundred acre property also contained numerous fields, orchards, pasture, and woodland.

It is now just a reminder of the Cherokee Removal known as the Trail of Tears. Founded in 1798 by James and Sarah Lusk, the ferry rights on the Kentucky side were purchased some years later by John Berry who owned a thousand acres of land along the Ohio River above and below the ferry site.<br /> <br /> His large home was built of slave-made bricks and served travelers with accommodations when needed. In 1831, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky enacted a law that established a voting precinct “which shall be held at the house of John Berry, at the Ferry,” to serve the citizens of Livingston County. Berry died in December of 1839 and the ferry operations continued under various owners until 1942.<br /> <br /> Historical Significance: At Berry's Ferry, thousands of Cherokee boarded flatboats to cross the Ohio River during the 1838-39 migrations. This is also the site where, in late December 1838, moving ice forced the ferry to shut down. As a result, hundreds if not thousands of Cherokee were forced to wait - sometimes for weeks - in scattered encampments southeast of the ferry crossing. Adjacent to the ferry site (of which no tangible evidence remains) are scattered remnants that mark the homesite of John Berry, the ferry operator during the late 1830s.\"</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Upper River Rd, Livingston, KY 42081 (end of road))</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.cherokee.org/about-the-nation/remember-the-removal/sites-on-the-trail/berry-s-ferry-and-berry-homesite/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

More than 10,000 men, women, and children endured the long trek and difficult conditions traveling on foot or in horse drawn carts. Each detachment would stretch for miles along the route. Big Springs, a natural spring that emerges from the limestone, served as a water source and stopping point for the weary travelers. <br /> <br /> Today, people visit Big Springs for the day trips or weekend getaways. The serene and peaceful environment, combined with the natural setting, provides an enjoyable escape from the city. It is a picturesque destination where visitors can connect with nature, learn about local history, and recreate. The site around Big Springs features picnic spots, walking paths, and seating areas where people can relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Please note that the cave is not accessible, and visitors are caution not to drink from the spring. <br /> <br /> Adjacent to the Big Springs site is a Trail of Tears Commemorative Park, featuring a large, engraved granite stone monument that reads \"A Mother's Burden\" both in English and in Cherokee. The stones for the monument were sourced from a quarry location along the original trail route, and dedicated to the park. In between the stones sets a garden shaped like a tear drop to depict removal.<br /> <br /> The nearby city of Princeton offers various amenities such as restaurants, accommodations, and shops.

The mission was the principal mission among other, smaller ones within the Cherokee Nation, and served as a training ground for American Board staff. At the height of its operation, the developed mission complex consisted of 50 acres, and contained some 40 buildings including boarding houses, boys' and girls' schools and churches, houses, a mill, barns, warehouses, carpenters' and blacksmiths' shops, as well as extensive fields, gardens, and orchards. During removal, the missionaries sympathized with the Cherokee-most missionaries accompanied those that voluntarily removed before the 1838-1839 forced removal on the Trail of Tears, seeing removal as the way to save Indian culture. On August 18, 1838, the last church service was held at the Brainerd Mission near the cemetery. The mission subsequently closed.<br /> <br /> Today, the site of the Brainerd Mission is mostly covered by the Brainerd Village shopping center.

This site represents the first removal phase - where the military actively rounded up Cherokee and sent them to forts and camps to be organized for the journey west to Indian Territory (today's Oklahoma). These holding camps had deplorable conditions and for the Cherokee, who were already demoralized, the conditions caused some deaths before the final journey even began.<br /> <br /> At first, Cherokee actively, physically resisted removal by staying in their home. They were removed by force. In the camps, they suffered from exposure, disease epidemics, inadequate sanitation, and heartbreak, remaining prisoners in the camps until their final deportation to the West.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(24 Broad St, Cave Spring, GA 30124)</p> <p>Cave Spring is located in Floyd County, Georgia, within a few miles state of Alabama, 75 miles from Atlanta, and 16 miles from Rome. It is a small town and has a flowing spring that comes out of a cave, as it has for millennia. The area is lush and the stable water source made the land verdant and valuable for growing crops. Ironically, water sources were important during Indian Removal when large groups of people being forcibly moved to camps. In the center of town there is a park that gives access to the spring which now flows into a pond and swimming pool filled by the spring.<br /> <br /> The historic building allows visitors to imagine the scene as Cherokee passed during removal. Built by Avery Vann, Jr., (1770-1845), a Scottish trader who married a Cherokee woman. He was the brother of <a href=\"https://vanishingnorthgeorgia.com/2019/02/19/chief-james-vann-house-1804-spring-place/\">Cherokee Chief James Vann</a> and his prominence in the area led to its designation as Vann’s Valley. For many years, the structure was hidden within the walls of the old Webster-Green Hotel in downtown Cave Spring. <br /> <br /> The cabin, spring, and park offer a place to reflect on the Trail of Tears.</p> <p><br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.cavespringhistoricalsociety.com/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2 paraeid=\"{8177a853-4631-4df2-a677-434643a34cfb}{195}\" paraid=\"322852933\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/cave-springs-exhibits-audio-description.htm\">Exhibit Audio Description available</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Six years later, in 1825, New Town was renamed New Echota, and became the capital of the Cherokee Nation. The Nation had, by this time, developed a police force and a judicial system.<br /> <br /> In 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a constitution establishing executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government as well as a system of checks and balances. After gold was discovered on Cherokee land claimed by the state of Georgia, the Treaty of New Echota was passed by the US Senate in May of 1836 (despite arguments that the Cherokee who negotiated it did not have the authority of the Nation). From 1838 to 1839, over 16,000 Cherokee were removed from their lands by Federal troops and state militia, and forcibly marched over 800 miles west to Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma. This is called the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Trail of Tears</a> (Nvna Daula Tsvyi: The Trail Where They Cried; and Tlo-va-sa: The Removal in Cherokee).<br /> <br /> Talequah in what is now Oklahoma was established as the nineteenth century capital of the Cherokee Nation in 1839.<br /> <br /> In alignment with the Cherokee constitution that declared the necessity of schools and education, Principal Chief John Ross proposed in 1846 that the Nation establish two seminaries (or schools): one for boys, and one for girls. The National Council agreed, and both schools opened simultaneously on May 7, 1851.<br /> <br /> The Cherokee Female Seminary was originally built three miles south of Tahlequah. It burned down in 1887, and was replaced by the current Female Seminary building that was dedicated in 1889. The Seminary was the largest building ever erected by an Indian tribe. Despite this, when it opened for classes in August of 1890, the school had to turn away many prospective students for lack of space. Now Seminary Hall, the massive, three-story brick affair is roughly L-shaped. Over all it has 127 usable rooms with some 50,500 gross square feet. Two turreted towers flank the main entrance.<br /> <br /> In 1907, Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory became the State of Oklahoma. Two years later, the Cherokee Female Seminary was purchased by the state and opened as Northeastern State Normal School with an enrollment of 511 students. In 1919, the school became Northeastern State Teachers College, a four year institution. In 1939, with an expanded curriculum, it became Northeastern State College. In 1974, graduate-degree programs were added, and the school became Northeastern Oklahoma State University. The name changed again in 1985 to Northeastern State University.<br /> <br /> By tracing its lineage to 1846, when the Cherokee National Council authorized the Cherokee Female Seminary, Northeastern State University is:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The second oldest public institution of higher learning west of the Mississippi River</p> </li> <li> <p>One of the oldest American institutions to provide a liberal arts education for women</p> </li> <li> <p>The first institution in America to pay equal salaries to men and women professors</p> </li> <li> <p>The first institution of higher education to provide tuition, books, room, board, and supplies free of charge to its students</p> </li> </ul> <p><br /> Cherokee Female Seminary / Seminary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 5, 1973.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Read the full nomination</a>.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Find out more about the National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The Fitzgerald’s took advantage of their location by establishing an inn and tavern on their farm. By the late 1830s it was a well-known stop for travelers. It became a supply source for many of the Trail of Tears Cherokee removal detachments in the late 1830s.<br /> <br /> All of the detachments that did not turn west in Benton County north of here would have passed by the Fitzgerald Farmstead. One of the detachments was mentioned by William Isaac Irvins Morrow, a physician traveling with the Taylor detachment, who noted the Fitzgerald farm in his journal:</p> <blockquote> <p>March 20, 1839. Wednesday 20th Cloudy & cool – traveled 15 miles to the X Hollows, eat dinner at Homeslys & came on 5 miles to Fitzgeralds in company with Cox Fields Hemger & George D. Morrow. A mean house.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Some Cherokee moved west before the forced removal in 1838-1839 that became known of the Trail of Tears. B.B Cannon, a disbursing agent who accompanied an earlier group kept a journal recording that they used much of the same route, passing by Fitzgerald Station, and receipts show numerous purchases from John Fitzgerald in December of 1837.<br /> <br /> Most Cherokee detachments next took a road to the southwest from Fitzgerald’s and travelled through the small settlement of Shiloh on their way to their destination in Indian Territory. Some of the detachment leaders travelled south into Fayetteville as well.<br /> <br /> John and Mary Fitzgerald played an important role as they were witness to Cherokee removal and sold needed provisions to the weary and often sick Cherokee. John and Mary are buried in the Fitzgerald Cemetery near the route of the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail just to the south of their farmstead on Old Wire Road through the intersection of Hwy 265 where it becomes E Randall Wobbe Lane.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2>   <p><strong>Location</strong> (The old Fitzgerald Farmstead is located on the Old Wire Road in north Springdale.

It was one of about 25 stockades in the Cherokee Indian Nation used by Federal and State troops during the Cherokee Removal in 1838. In May and June, 1838, 7,000 soldiers forced over 15,000 Cherokee Indians from their homes and held them in the stockades until removal west could take place. Many Indians from the local area were held at Fort Buffington. As many as 4,000 Cherokees may have died while in the stockades and on the 800 mile journey west.

Active from 1824 through 1890, it was at first the westernmost US military fort and was a key to US military strategy, inasmuch as the fort held more soldiers than any other fort located west of the Mississippi River.</p> <p>In 1832 Congress created a commission to relocate the Indians from the East to Indian Territory. The commission made its headquarters at Fort Gibson, and for the remainder of the decade it negotiated treaties with the local native tribes in order to prepare them for the impending changes in their surroundings. The fort was a dispersal site for the Seminole and Creek Indians after their long journey from their homes in the southeastern United States.</p> <p>Fort Gibson Historic Site is a national historic landmark managed by the Oklahoma Historical Society.

The cabin site is part of local property seized by the military for Fort Payne, one of over 20 removal forts (stockades) established in Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. Research indicates the cabin belonged to Cherokee John Huss (Spirit the Preacher) and was built circa 1825. Historical documents show that Cantonment Payne existed as early as fall 1837, became Fort Payne by December 1837, and was a major emigrating depot by the fall of 1838. The majority of Cherokee who were forced by the military to leave their homes in Alabama left from Fort Payne. A detachment led by Cherokee John Benge departed for Indian Territory in October of 1838, and the fort was closed soon after.

The 60-mile trek across southern Illinois, normally a nine-day hike, took several months.  <br /> <br /> Arriving at Hamburg Hill, they followed a steep-sided, thickly wooded hollow four miles to the Mississippi River. At the river’s edge, tremendous blocks and walls of ice reared and crashed, preventing eight of the Cherokee detachments from any attempt to cross.  <br /> <br /> Trapped in freezing temperatures, they made makeshift tent structures with board floors to escape the cold, muddy ground. Some waited over a month before they could span the river into Missouri---one more nightmare endured during the brutal removal of the Cherokee people. <br /> <br /> Today, visitors can retrace a one-mile segment of the same roadbed traveled by the detachments, on an out-and-back trail.

The road was cut in 1835 and originally named the Missouri Road. It became a postal route and was a prime route connecting Northwest Arkansas and Indian territory (Oklahoma). In 1837 to 1839 it was called the Springfield to Fayetteville Road and witnessed a peak in Indian Removal with tribes moving west. In 1860 when the telegraph lines were strung along the road it became Telegraph Road and eventually was named Old Wire Road. The alignment has changed very little from 1838-1839 when it carried 12 Trail of Tears detachments on the final leg of their journey to Indian Territory. You may notice different road names throughout the stops on this itinerary, but they all connect to what is still today referred to as the Old Wire Road. <br /> <br /> Take a walk along the historic road from the Little Sugar Creek parking lot. View this area detached from by main body of Pea Ridge National Military Park on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/peri/planyourvisit/maps.htm\">park map</a> and note the separate green area to the south of the park’s main boundary. <br /> <br /> Five of the 12 detachments are thought to have left the road near this area and went west across Benton County to their disbandment area near Beaties Prairie. If you look at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/upload/TRTEmap1.pdf\">Trail of Tears map</a>, you can see where the northernmost orange Disbandment Route line goes west from here.<br /> <br /> The area is a beautiful natural place with a hiking trail. It is steep in places but take the opportunity to walk a portion of the Trail of Tears. By the time the Cherokee reached this far they had very mixed feelings. They must have been very anxious about going to a new country and what the future may bring. They were also glad to have gotten this far and being near the end of daily traveling and packing, the nightly job of cooking and setting up camp. The site is quiet and reflective. A place to also think about what has happened to put the Cherokee in this situation and to think about those that have not made it and passed away along the journey. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2>   <p><strong>Location</strong> (Located at a detached portion of Pea Ridge National Military Park and at the intersection of Old Wire Road and Little Sugar Creek, south of the main body of the park off Hwy 44.)<br /> <br /> <strong>Amenities</strong><br /> There are limited services at this site.

        "notes": "Manitou Cave of Alabama\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/manitou-cave-of-alabama.htm\n\n<p>Nestled in ten acres of wooded land at the foot of Lookout Mountain in present-day Ft. Payne, Alabama sits a cave so special in its history and diverse in its geological formations and biology that it has attracted human interaction for centuries. In the early 1800's, this area was a Cherokee settlement called Willstown. Willstown was chosen by Sequoyah as a place to settle and work on creating the Cherokee syllabary. As a result, Sequoyah's son, Richard Gist (Guess), ventured into Manitou Cave and wrote inscriptions on the wall capturing ceremonial events leading up to an important stickball game. <br /> <br /> Within a few years after the stickball game, the U.S. military rounded up Cherokee people from this area and re-named Willstown as Ft. Payne. Ft. Payne was a military stockade holding Cherokee people until they were removed to present day Oklahoma along the Trail of Tears. In the 1860's, Manitou Cave was mined for salt peter in support of the confederate army during the Civil War. Also during the Cold War, Manitou Cave was designated as a fallout shelter. Provisions for the shelter can still be seen in the cave to this day. <br /> <br /> During the late 1800's, a large chamber in the cave was used as a ballroom. People came from all around to dance and listen to a band deep inside the cave. Due to interesting formations inside the cave including a large formation rising over 40 feet in height, the cave became an interest to tourists passing through the city. It opened formally as a tourist attraction in the early 1900's, and in 1961, a midcentury modern visitors center was built. This historic visitors center has been restored and functions as an interpretive center and classroom. Groups may book a tour by appointment only and attend an educational session in the interpretive center where attendees will learn about the history of Manitou, the unique geological features and also the fragile biodiversity inside the cave. Along with other wildlife like bats and salamanders, there is a rare snail inside the cave that exists nowhere else in the world. The Manitou Cave snail, called the Antrorbis brewerii, relies on the pure cave spring water for existence. On the tour, visitors are sure to see a few of these special species. Since this location is a certified Trail of Tears Interpretive Center, visitors will learn about the history of the Trail of Tears and how this cave site fits into the Cherokee story in Willstown.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Located blocks from downtown Ft. Payne, Alabama; Contact Manitou Cave of Alabama for details)</p> <ul> <li>Annette F. Reynolds, <a href=\"mailto:manitoucaveofal@gmail.com\">manitoucaveofal@gmail.com</a></li> </ul> <h3>Physical Description</h3> <p>Guests drive up to the interpretive center along a residential street. Pulling into the designated parking area, visitors will immediately view the midcentury modern interpretive center and notice the pink limestone block and unique historic architecture of the building. From the parking lot, to the left of the restored building, the wooded line of trees slightly opens up to view the gravel pathway leading up a winding path with series of stairs reaching higher elevations to the mouth of the cave. Visitors taking this path will view rock walls towering above the path. A metal bridge leads to steps rising up to the cave entrance. On the right of the cave trail is the spring flowing from the inside of the cave. The cave temperature is a constant 56 degrees all year round. Once inside the cave, visitors might view species including salamanders and bats. Touching or leaning on the limestone walls is prohibited to protect the historic record and fragile ecosystem. Concrete steps and steel and wood bridges run throughout the course of the interior pathway. This pathway hugs tightly to the spring that runs almost the entire length of the cave. Water features flowing around rock formations run the entirety of the tour. Remnants of Cold War fall-out shelter provisions litter some cave chambers and can be seen from the path. Signatures of human visitors dating back to the Cherokee in the early 1800’s to men who mined here during the Civil War in the 1860's and 1870's that have lasted centuries along the cave walls are throughout the tour. Cherokee syllabary can be seen along the walls and on the ceiling in some areas. After about thirty minutes of walking, the cave pathway opens up to a 90’ x 60’ chamber. This chamber was used by people in the late 1800's was to dance to live music. The chamber is the turn-around point for guests on group tours. The walk back to the cave opening is also approximately 30 minutes.<br /> <br /> Once guests return to the interpretive center, there is a grassy lawn that gradually slopes downward to the picnic tables overlooking the spring run and native plants. Picnic tables line the lower elevation for wildlife viewing along the creek. Guests are accommodated in the interpretive center with a pre-tour educational session which provides an informational backdrop to enhance the experience of the cave tour. The interpretive center is designed as an open floor-plan classroom and kitchenette. A handicap accessible restroom is located on the right side of the visitors center across the breezeway that separates the restroom from classroom space. Different groups experience different needs, so accommodations should be communicated when the tour appointment is made. The grounds and cave are natural spaces and are therefore not ADA accessible.

One of those groups, the Peter Hildebrand Detachment, was forced to spend two bitterly cold weeks in the Mantle Rock area, encamped for miles along the road. <br /> <br /> They were waiting for the frozen Ohio River to thaw enough for the ferry to carry people from Berry’s Ferry, Kentucky, to Golconda, Illinois. Once across the river, many became trapped again between the frozen Ohio and Mississippi rivers until they could continue traveling west to Indian Territory. These 11 detachments left Tennessee in 1838 with over 10,000 Cherokee, but due to exhaustion, illness and death, they numbered hundreds less when they arrived in Oklahoma.<br /> <br /> The Cherokee walked the road that is now a hiking trail at Mantle Rock Preserve, halfway through an 800 mile journey, feeling the loss of homeland and unsure of what lay ahead. Over 10,000 men, women, and children traveled this road during the winter of 1838-1839.

Detachments of Choctaw, Muscogee, and Chickasaw, traveled the Memphis to Little Rock Road, and the Cherokee used the same road, referred to as the Bell Route of the Trail of Tears. Choctaw and Chickasaw were ferried across the river on their removal routes. Some removal groups traveled overland northwest from here to Fort Gibson in Indian Territory, parallelling the river for hundreds of miles. All five of the southeastern removed tribes (Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee, and Seminole) on water removal routes traveled this stretch of the Arkansas River.<br /> <br /> In 1838, 720 Cherokee on the Steamboat Smelter camped near here on the north bank of the river.

A separate cost to consider is lives - the Trail of Tears costs the Cherokee 4,000 lives. <br /> <br /> Pendleton Bend Park is 289 miles by water from Indian Territory, the end of the Trail of Tears Water Route.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2>   <p><strong>Location</strong> (426 Hwy 212 East, Dumas AR )<br /> <br /> <strong>Amenities</strong><br /> 31 Class A Campsites, Restrooms/Showers, Picnic Sites/Group Shelters, Playground, Boat Launch, Sightseeing, ADA accessible<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232667\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/trail-of-tears-arkansas-river-water-route-itinerary.htm\">Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary</a></h2> <p>You can visit multiple Water Route sites on the Arkansas River by following the <strong>Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary.</strong> Each site features one aspect or story about the Cherokee and Creek experience traveling the Trail of Tears by water, highlighting the challenges and complexities that arose daily on the Arkansas River.</p>",

John Ross, a Cherokee businessman and later Principal Chief (1828 - 1866), established a ferry crossing and warehouse here between 1813 and 1816. In 1827, Ross moved to Georgia to serve his people as President of the Cherokee National Council. Ross opposed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the Treaty of New Echota, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.<br /> Ross's Landing became a designated departure point for Indian deportation. In May 1837, approximately 350 Muscogee (Creek) Indians who had taken refuge in the Cherokee Nation were rounded up at gunpoint and brought to Ross's Landing where they were put on boats and forced west. In 1837, two detachments of Cherokees left from Ross's Landing by boat under their own accord. In 1838, the landing was a holding camp and launching point for the first three detachments of Cherokees forced from their homelands on the Trail of Tears. In the first two of these detachments, over 1,300 Cherokees were crowded onto flatboats pulled by steamboats. In the third detachment, 1,072 people crossed the Tennessee River on Ross's swing ferry and traveled overland to Waterloo, Alabama, where they boarded boats for Indian Territory. 216 deaths were recorded in these first 3 detachments.<br /> <br /> Ross's Landing also played an important role in the Civil War,, opening up a critical supply route known as the Cracker Line. Supplies from as far away as Bridgeport, Alabama flowed to forces in the Chattanooga area across a pontoon bridge at Ross's Landing. Thanks to the Cracker Line, US Army forces ended the siege of Chattanooga and began an offensive to take Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain from the Confederates in November 1863.<br /> <br /> Today, Ross's Landing is downtown Chattanooga’s signature park along the south shore of the Tennessee River. This popular recreational area features a natural amphitheater, marina, and handicapped accessible playground, as well as Chattanooga Green, the river pier, and numerous walkways along the river. The park lies at one end of the 13-mile Tennessee Riverwalk, which extends from the riverfront at Ross's Landing to the Tennessee Riverpark and Chickamauga Dam. The path is used for bicycling, in-line skating, walking, jogging and includes several canoe/kayak launch points.

Unlike the later detachments whose removal was involuntary, the Cannon party requested and received a military escort to move earlier.  <br /> <br /> The 1839 Taylor detachment of Cherokees was one of the detachments organized and removed under the supervision of the Cherokee Nation and there are records of their time in this area.

Logbooks for the vessels transporting the Cherokee highlight the difficulties of water travel, and the Trail of Tears exhibit at Toad Suck Park looks at two weeks on the Arkansas River. There is a Trail of Tears exhibit at signage on site.<br /> <br /> The name Toad Suck actually spans back to the early 1800s when the water in the river would get very low and create a \"suck.\" A suck was a great place for toads and frogs to live in the shallow water. It was in these shallow water areas that the steamboats would get stuck. Getting stuck extended the time on the river, and the longer the Cherokee and other tribes were trapped on the river during removal increased the likehood of other problems such as disease.<br /> <br /> Toad Suck Park is 51 miles by water from Indian Territory, the end of the Trail of Tears Water Route.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2>   <p><strong>Location</strong> (93 Park Road Bigelow, AR 72016 at Toad Suck Lock & Dam)<br /> <br /> <strong>Amenities</strong><br /> 48 Class A Campsites, Restrooms/Showers, Picnic Sites/Group Shelters, Playground, Boat Launch, Sightseeing, ADA accessible<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232721\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/trail-of-tears-arkansas-river-water-route-itinerary.htm\">Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary</a></h2> <p>You can visit multiple Water Route sites on the Arkansas River by following the <strong>Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary.</strong> Each site features one aspect or story about the Cherokee and Creek experience traveling the Trail of Tears by water, highlighting the challenges and complexities that arose daily on the Arkansas River.</p>",

In 1830, the United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. This law required native tribes to vacate their ancestral lands and relocate to reservations in Oklahoma, then simply called Indian Territory. Then, in 1835, a small group of the Cherokee Nation signed the Treaty of New Echota, which divided the Cherokee People into two factions—those that supported the treaty and those that opposed it.<br /> <br /> In May 1838, the U.S. Army, bolstered by various state militia groups, forcibly removed over 16,000 Cherokee from their homelands so that white settlers could move in. This journey, now referred to as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears</a>, saw more than a thousand Cherokee, mainly the old, young, and infirm, perish on this brutal forced march. Thousands more died shortly thereafter from the exposure, disease, and starvation they had suffered while en route to the reservations.<br /> <br /> The park’s visitor center offers exhibits focused on both the forced removal of the Cherokee People and the area’s natural history. A 23-minute documentary titled “Trail of Tears” is also available on demand. Interpretive programs are scheduled throughout the summer from Memorial Day through Labor Day.  <br /> <br /> Those looking to spend time outdoors will enjoy boating, fishing, hiking, and swimming. There are also two playgrounds within the park.Picnic sites are scattered throughout the park, some of which are accessible to those with disabilities. The park’s two covered pavilions are available for rent or, if not reserved, can be used on a first-come-first served basis for free. The campground offers basic, electric, and sewer/water/electric/water campsites, along with a special use camping area reservable for groups only.<br /> <br /> To reserve a pavilion, call (573) 290-5268.

This is from the large open area that surrounds you and the wide expanse across the water to the other bank which is over 1700 feet.

Now you hear the songbirds as they call to each other and then suddenly the loud squawk of a great blue heron as it takes flight from the shallow water in front of you.  As you settle back to your experience you feel the sun on your back and smell the freshness of the air and wonder if this what it was like when the Cherokee and other tribesmen were brought from their homelands up the river on flat boats to an unknown territory.

Situated on the main road from Ross's Landing to Willstown, the property was adjacent to a council ground frequently used by the Cherokee during the 1820s and 1830s. Several structures were constructed that year, including a 2-story log house for the missionaries, separate classrooms for the girls and boys, cabins for the students who boarded, and numerous outbuildings. Teachers included Reverend and Mrs. Ard Hoyt, Reverend and Mrs. William Chamberlain, and Reverend Daniel Butrick. In February of 1828, Reverend Ard Hoyt died after a brief illness and was buried on the property in a marked grave. Nothing remains of the mission/school, which closed before the removal in 1838. The cemetery contains 50 or more graves, but the only identified graves are those of Hoyt and of eight white settlers buried between 1841 and 1898. Some of the unidentified graves could be those of the 41 Cherokee who, according to military records, died in camp at Fort Payne before the Benge Detachment's departure.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(38th Street NE (near the corner of Godfrey Avenue NE), Fort Payne, Alabama)<br /> <b>Access</b><br /> Daylight hours only</p> <p><strong>Exhibits</strong><br /> Two historical markers, one erected by the Alabama Historical Association</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.landmarksdekalbal.org/preserving-dekalb-county-alabama-landmarks/the-historic-willstown-cemetery/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

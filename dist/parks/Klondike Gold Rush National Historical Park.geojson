Smiths Parlor Museum certainly inspires laughter, curiosity, and even confusion. That’s probably because it’s changed so quickly! Once the saloon of famous outlaw Jefferson Randolph “Soapy” Smith, the building also served as the First Bank of Skagway, the Skagway Fire Department garage, a photo shop, and a series of restaurants. In 1935, the building was turned into a museum by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/klgo-martin-itjen.htm\">Martin Itjen</a>, a former stampeder and lover of all things eccentric. Itjen tacked on two additional rooms and patched up the building’s false front. Taxidermy, random eyeballs, and three <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/martin-itjen-manikins.htm\">animatronic manikins</a> of Itjen’s own creation—Soapy Smith, Dangerous Dan, and Lady Lou, in reference the Robert Service poem “The Shooting of Dan McGrew”—pepper the space.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{98f5cef0-2260-4dd3-8945-238d9fe42e70}{72}\" paraid=\"1316129005\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/klgo-george-rapuzzi.htm\">George Rapuzzi</a>, another longtime Skagway resident, purchased the building in 1963 and once again opened a museum, moving the building from its former location to where it stands now on 2nd Ave. He and his wife, Edna, in addition to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/jeff-smiths-parlor-collection.htm\">adding an assortment of Gold Rush artifacts</a> to the space, operated the museum until 1986. In 2016, the National Park Service reopened the museum as a testament to the evolution of a town, and more so, how collective understanding of a story is shaped by those who tell it – and what a story to tell! </p> <p paraeid=\"{98f5cef0-2260-4dd3-8945-238d9fe42e70}{116}\" paraid=\"316321378\">When Skagway began, it was a town full of people with a shared goal: to strike it rich. When the rush ended two years later, the vast majority of these people failed in that goal. The gold was gone, and as the stampede ended, the town was left with a question: what do you become when your original purpose – quite literally – disappears? How do we adapt in order to survive? The town had to engineer other ways to persist. Skagway developed its tourism industry, which still serves as its primary economic venture today. The Klondike Gold Rush story is a story of duality, of nuance. Each component comes together to create a complex narrative that we can learn from; by examining the past, we can work to create futures in which we all prosper, focused on values that drive us, much like the Golden Staircase, in an upwards trajectory. Let’s examine our surroundings, and in doing so, better learn to appreciate the “Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold!” that we mine in the everyday. <br /> <br /> Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/jeffsmithsparlor.htm\">the history of the Jeff.

The Buffalo Soldiers were segregated regiments of Black soldiers established after the Civil War. These regiments served in the western United States and abroad. Company L’s mission here in Skagway was to “show the flag” at the border with Canada and protect people and property in this frontier town. They served here in Skagway from 1899 until 1902.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2447f8ae-d35e-4ef4-b721-3aacbe1f4e79}{127}\" paraid=\"172047650\">After the troops left, the barracks stood vacant for a few years. In 1908, the building was moved from its location on 6th Ave to where it stands on Broadway today. It was remodeled with a new false front to make up the Pack Train Inn, the Trail Saloon, and the Lynch and Kennedy building. A walk to the rear of these buildings will reveal that the original barracks can still be seen behind the false fronts, despite the massive remodeling effort. Haberdashers Henry J. Lynch and James F. Kennedy rented the former barracks building and opened their Haberdashery and Dry Goods store in September 1908. This building is preserved in its 1908 aesthetic.   </p>",

The Mascot Saloon was one of the most popular, serving up favorites like locally brewed beer and free lunches that included menu items like clam chowder, spareribs, sauerkraut, and enchiladas. The saloon also offered gambling, cigars, a pool table, nightly music, and telegraph wires that brought in sports scores.

Women were unable to drink in public spaces, and only some saloons allowed People of Color to drink inside.

A cabin-house? All could be used to describe the Moore family’s place of residence. Born in Germany, Captain William Moore arrived in Skagway already set on what we call “mining the miners.” In 1887, Captain Moore and his son, J. Bernard “Ben” Moore, started building a small cabin on their 160-acre homestead claim. They sustained their wealth using various ventures, including a sawmill and a wharf, and eventually started building up a larger home in 1897. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0586671e-ff3b-4265-8c5f-d72e34ce5a0e}{235}\" paraid=\"40487128\">But more can be told about the Moore House by looking at those who lived inside it. Looking at Ben’s relationship with his wife provides a way to examine the relationship between the native Tlingit people, indigenous to Southeastern Alaska, and the stampeders that arrived rapidly and hungrily in Skagway and Dyea. After spending the winter of 1890 working at a cannery near Haines, Ben attended a potlatch held by a prominent Tlingit named George Shotridge. In Tlingit he was always called Yeilgooxú. His daughter, Klinget-sai-yet, caught Ben’s eye, and they were married 6 months later. But what were the motivations behind this marriage? It is best to take a look at the context surrounding it. The Chilkoot Trail, a historic trading route that the Tlingit people used to procure materials available in the interior, was suddenly overrun by outsiders. As more and more pressure mounted on the landscape from sheer influx of people, the difference between Tlingit understanding and European American understanding of land ownership loomed: for the former, place was a part of being, but for the latter, “ownership” was a concept with strict boundaries and delineations. For the Tlingit people, it may have been thought advantageous to breach that gap through interpersonal relations. For Ben, knowledge was power; connections with a powerful Tlingit family would certainly increase economic possibility for the already prosperous Moores. At the same time, the intercultural marriage between Ben and Klinget-sai-yet caused a major rift between Ben and his father. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0586671e-ff3b-4265-8c5f-d72e34ce5a0e}{245}\" paraid=\"270306057\">The marriage had a complex beginning, but also a complex end. In 1909, Klinget-sai-yet filed for divorce, citing cruelty, abuse, and Ben’s lack of financial prowess. In 1917, Klinget-sai-yet committed suicide. Frances remembers this of her mother: “Mother was never very happy. I have heard her threaten to do away with herself quite a while ago but she has been alright lately.” It is impossible to assume exactly how Klinget-sai-yet felt in her marriage, her time in Skagway, and the years that followed it. This is partially because there aren’t many resources written in her voice.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0586671e-ff3b-4265-8c5f-d72e34ce5a0e}{251}\" paraid=\"904307424\">What we can do is look to the past and infer; how might you have felt in Klinget-sai-yet's situation? How might the Tlingits have felt watching their homeland be scourged by stampeders? </p>",

This requires an important decision: do you take the 33 mile-long Chilkoot Trail, or the 44 mile-long White Pass Trail? No matter which you chose, the Canadian government determined each person going to the gold fields needs three pounds of food per day for a whole year. Food alone weighed 1,095 pounds, or just over half a ton. Adding necessary clothes and equipment could easily double the total load, and thus came to be known as a \"ton of goods.\" These crates around you represent all of that food and gear that each stampeder had to carry over the trail. </p> <p paraeid=\"{03ad9d22-d241-46fd-a867-4fdf946ff368}{13}\" paraid=\"2039427152\">Stampeders had the choice of carrying more weight or walking more miles. A light pack of 50 pounds meant more trips. A heavy pack of 80 pounds meant fewer trips, but a slower pace. Every mile walked with a load meant another mile back empty. Stampeder Everett Barton wrote, \"We have been working terribly hard packing 50 and 75 pounds over mountains that we would not think of walking over at home.\" Stampeders walked nearly 1,000 miles to carry their supplies back and forth over the pass.  </p>",

Skagway’s YMCA was established in 1900; it was the first YMCA in Alaska. Many think of YMCAs as centers for physical recreation, but they also focused on the mental: in addition to a gym and handball court, Skagway’s facility also offered baths, a photo darkroom, and a reading room (complete with a vast collection of books donated by the city of Detroit). </p> <p paraeid=\"{96eccb81-a90f-4f92-936f-caeef9492ec0}{19}\" paraid=\"1749216649\">Skagway’s YMCA served as a microscopic stage for a macroscopic, country-wide issue: racism. Thirty Black soldiers that were stationed in Skagway joined the local YMCA... but weren’t necessarily welcomed by all. Membership plummeted from 1899 to 1901. YMCA secretary W.A. Reid upheld the YMCA’s commitment to egalitarianism. Thus, even when discriminatory members withdrew due to the desegregation of the club, Reid maintained that the Y.M.C.A. “knows no color line. It stands for young men regardless of nationality the world over.” In addition, he stated that “nothing remains to be done but to permit those who entertain this feeling to withdraw.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{96eccb81-a90f-4f92-936f-caeef9492ec0}{25}\" paraid=\"646950490\">Articles on the dispute peppered the pages of the Daily Alaskan. Less than 18 months later, the Y.M.C.A. closed its doors, but whether because of the dispute or the decline in Skagway’s population after the gold rush, we will never know; both were likely contributing factors. Nevertheless, the Y.M.C.A. stands as a testament to the evolution of a community. What happens when a community refuses to change? Where does it end up? Let’s examine these questions together at our next stop. </p>",

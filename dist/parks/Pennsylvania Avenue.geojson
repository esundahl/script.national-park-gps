The first request for a separate FBI building occurred in 1939. Although the Public Buildings Agency initiated plans for an FBI building in 1941, America’s entry into World War II required postponing all government building projects. The next serious request to Congress for a separate building was not made until 1961...</p>   <p>On October 7, 1964, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the major design concept with its security modifications. The approved plan consisted of 2,800,876 square feet of space for 7,090 employees. Height limits of 107 feet (seven stories) along Pennsylvania Avenue and 160 feet (eleven stories) along E Street conformed to the Pennsylvania Avenue Advisory Council and District of Columbia requirements.</p> <p>For reasons of economy, the approving agencies insisted upon poured concrete as the major outside building material. The concrete used for the FBI building contained an aggregate of crushed dolomite limestone, a unique composition. While contrasting with the traditional marble, granite, or limestone government buildings, it echoed a major architectural style of the 1960s. The concrete was poured into reusable steel forms separated by metal ties. The ties remained in the concrete when the molds were removed. This technique produced an architectural feature of evenly spaced holes throughout the exterior....</p> <p>The first FBI employees moved into the new building June 28, 1974. At that time, FBI Headquarters offices were housed in nine separate locations. By May 30, 1975, the Director, the associate director, and several divisions had moved in. Thirty-eight years after the first proposal for a separate FBI building and 15 years after Congress approved construction on the Pennsylvania Avenue site, the last employees moved into the building in June 1977.</p> <p>The building received its official name, the J. Edgar Hoover F.B.I. Building, through Public Law, 92-520, which President Richard Nixon signed May 4, 1972, two days after Director Hoover’s death. President Gerald Ford dedicated the building on September 30, 1975.\"<br /> For information on visiting the FBI Headquarters, visit \"<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/fbi-headquarters/the-fbi-experience\">The FBI Experience</a>\"</p>",

The stone pavers of Freedom Plaza depict a map of Washington, DC, according to planner Pierre Charles L'Enfant's plan for the city.<br /> <br /> Inscriptions<br /> WESTERN PLAZA PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE<br /> Western plaza consists of a large raised terrace in which part of L'Enfant's original 1791 plan for Washington, DC is rendered in black and white stone. At one end of the raised terrace is a pool. At the other is a shaded sitting area around a statue of General Pulaski.<br /> Inscribed on the upper terrace are historic quotations about Washington. Low walls separate the plaza from the surrounding traffic. Eleven large urns rest on top of these walls and contain seasonal plantings. The upper map terrace has a grass lawn where the Mall occurs and inlaid bronze plans of the White House and the Capitol located at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The inlays illustrate L'Enfant's intention to have these two buildings balance each other and symbolize two main branches of government. The siting of the Treasury in the 19th century blocked the view of the White House and obscured this relationship.<br /> L'Enfant's plan of Washington combines two orders of scale. The giant order is the diagonal avenues that sometimes terminate in a building or a monument. This order is the rectangular grid pattern of the local structure of the city.<br /> Western Plaza acknowledges both orders since it is shaped by the rectangular grid of the local scale and is an element within the giant order of Pennsylvania Avenue.<br /> 1 Pool 3 Mall 5 Capitol<br /> 2 White House 4 L'Enfant's Plan 6 Pulaski Statue<br /> Plaque, north side<br /> THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES<br /> 1782 1782 1885<br /> OBVERSE REVERSE OBVERSE<br /> IN 1776 THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS ADOPTED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE CREATION OF A SEAL FOR THE NEW NATION.

Grief holds her covered face against the shoulder of History and weeps in mourning. History holds a stylus and a tablet that was inscribed \"They died that their country might live.\" Below Grief and History, another life-size classical female figure represents Victory, holding high a laurel wreath and carrying an oak branch, signifying strength. Below her are the infant Mars, the god of war, and the infant Neptune, god of the sea. The shaft of the monument is decorated with wreaths, ribbons and scallop shells.</p> <p>Facing the U.S. Capitol is Peace, a classical figure draped from the waist down and holding an olive sprig. Below her are symbols of peace and industry. A dove, now missing and not documented in any known photographs, once nested upon a sheaf of wheat in a grouping of a cornucopia, turned earth, and a sickle resting across a sword. Opposite, the symbols of science, literature and art (including an angle, a gear, a book, and a pair of dividers) signify the progress of civilization that peace makes possible.</p> <p>At the corners of the monument, four marble globes are visually supported by massive brackets. The fountain below, with a jet on each side, empties into a quatrefoil-shaped basin. Inscribed \"In memory of the officers, seamen and marines of the United States Navy who fell in defense of the Union and liberty of their country, 1861-1865,\" this sculptural group has also been called the Naval Monument.</p> <p>The sculptor of the monument was Franklin Simmons (1839-1913), who was born in Maine, where he became known for his portrait busts. He worked in Rome after 1867, when he received the commission for a statue of <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/roger-williams\">Roger Williams</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/about-national-statuary-hall-collection\">National Statuary Hall collection</a>. In all, he created four statues and three busts for the United States Capitol. The Peace Monument is an example of his idealized <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/architecture-styles/neoclassical-architecture-capitol-hill\">neoclassical</a> sculpture.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>Peace Monument, first intended for Annapolis, was conceived by Admiral David D. Porter, who had commanded fleets of gunboats and troop transports during the war. Porter first sketched a simple design depicting Grief and History; beginning in 1865, he raised funds from private contributors, and the monument was commissioned from Simmons in 1871. The sculptor carved the Carrara marble in Rome and worked directly with Admiral Porter on many changes in the designs, including the addition of other figures. The architectural part of the monument was made by the Bonanni Brothers of Carrara, Italy, under Simmons's direction. The marble pieces were shipped to Washington in 1876; in 1877 the monument was erected on the base of Maine blue granite (designed by Architect of the Capitol <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/architect-of-the-capitol/edward-clark\">Edward Clark</a>); and the final figure, Peace, was set into place in January 1878.\"</p>",

        "notes": "Willard Hotel, Washington DC\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/willard-hotel-washington-dc.htm\n\n<p>American author <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sama/learn/historyculture/hawthorne.htm\">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a> observed in the 1860s that \"the Willard Hotel more justly could be called the center of Washington than either the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/us-capitol.htm\">Capitol</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whho/index.htm\">White House</a> or the State Department.\" From 1847 when the enterprising Willard brothers, Henry and Edwin, first set up as innkeepers on the corner of 14th Street and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/paav/index.htm\">Pennsylvania Avenue</a>, the Willard has occupied a unique niche in the history of Washington and the nation.<br /> <br /> The site upon which the Willard stands was originally part of the farm of David Burnes. In 1816 John Tayloe built a row of six two-story-and-attic houses as an investment. By 1818 the corner was being used as a hotel. In 1847 Benjamin Ogle Tayloe leased the establishment to Henry A. Willard and his brother, Edwin. Edwin withdrew from the management, to be replaced by his brother Joseph C.Willard in 1849. In 1853 the brothers purchased the entire row of houses from Tayloe's heirs, uniting the buildings architecturally in a major remodeling. In 1858 the Willards expanded again, purchasing the property of Col. James Kearney on the southwest corner of 14th and F Streets. They demolished the Kearney Mansion and built a six-story addition to the hotel. Next an adjoining Presbyterian Church on F Street was acquired and converted to an auditorium known as Willard Hall. In succeeding years, as business increased, the roofs of the conglomerate hotel were raised to allow for vertical expansion. Finally, at the turn of the century, the Willard underwent a massive transformation.<br /> <br /> The new Willard, designed by New York architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh and erected by the George A. Fuller Company, was hailed at its opening as Washington's first skyscraper. Completed in 1904, the new building saw an addition of 100 rooms in 1925, broadening the F Street facade by about 49 feet. The property remained in the Willard family until 1946, closed in 1968, and underwent extensive renovation, again opening its doors in 1986.<br /> <br /> Presidents <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/zachary-taylor.htm\">Taylor</a>, Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Lincoln</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ulysses-s-grant.htm\">Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wiho/index.htm\">Taft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woodrow-wilson-prophet-of-peace-teaching-with-historic-places.htm\">Wilson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/moru/learn/historyculture/calvin-coolidge.htm\">Coolidge</a>, and Harding stayed at the Willard. Other notable guests have included Charles Dickens, Buffalo Bill, David Lloyd George, P.T. Barnum, Lord and Lady Napper and countless others. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/walt-whitman.htm\">Walt Whitman</a> included the Willard in his verses and Mark Twain wrote two books there in the early 1900s. It was Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, irritated at the Willard's high prices, who coined the phrase \"What this country needs is a good 5-cent cigar.\"<br /> <br /> The Willard Hotel is located at 1401-09 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 15, 1974 and is part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/paav/index.htm\">Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site</a>.</p>",

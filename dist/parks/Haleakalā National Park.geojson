It has many limbs surrounding its fluted trunk and falling from its top to the ground. It almost looks like a giant octopus or an alien fell to earth and is forever frozen there. This is a banyan tree. This is one of several in the park, but only a couple are as photogenic and accessible as this one.  It is unknown exactly how this particular banyan tree made it to this spot, but it probably spread from other banyan trees brought to the area by migrant workers from Asia who worked on the sugar plantation here in the late 1800s. <br /> <br /> People from many parts of Asia now call Maui home and have become an integral part of Maui culture. Bringing these plants with them was like carrying a piece of their home. The roots put down here have spread over the island. The plantation workers came to Maui in search of a better life, and just like early Hawaiians, they chose items important to their culture to carry with them.<br /> <br /> Many of the other trees along this path are also recent introductions from sugar plantation workers from Asian countries such as mango, java plum, guava, and avocado trees.  As we continue to the next stop and leave this recently introduced tree, we’ll see a grove of trees brought by Polynesian voyagers because of its many uses that helped people thrive in this area.  ",

Their beaks and bodyparts adapted to their food source, some grew long curved beaks to get into bell shaped flowers, while others adapted with sharp beaks for prying into bark and cracking seeds. Watch what each bird is doing to learn about how its beak helps it to eat food.<br /> <br /> Today these native forest birds have been pushed up higher to this elevation on the mountain due to habitat loss, climate change, and mosquitos that spread the disease avian malaria. A single bite by an infected mosquito can be fatal. Only 17 species remain, some with fewer than 500 individuals left. Without swift action, several species of honeycreepers will become extinct in the next ten years. One technique to saving our forest birds is of a naturally occuring bacteria called Wolbachia that acts as “mosquito birth control.” Male mosquitoes infected with the bacteria can mate but don’t produce offspring, causing populations to crash. To learn more about the “Birds not Mosquitos” effort visit, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hale/learn/nature/saving-our-forest-birds.htm\">Saving our Forest Birds - Haleakalā National Park (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a><br /> <br /> The remaining forest bird species on Maui and most common are ʻamakihi, ‘apapane, ʻiʻiwi (scarlet honeycreeper), and ʻalauahio (Maui creeper). Very uncommon, restricted just to east Maui and rare are the ʻAkohekohe (crested honeycreeper), and critically endagered Kiwikiu (Maui parrotbill). They represent a colorful thread that runs through the evolutionary history of the Hawaiian Islands, with the strongest and most adaptable species persisting through time. Learn more about these species on our forest bird website <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hale/learn/nature/birds-of-the-summit-district.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/hale/learn/nature/birds-of-the-summit-district.htm</a>  <br /> <br /> For 20 seconds, close your eyes and count the different bird calls/sounds that you hear, how many did you count? Taking the time to stop, observe and listen affords you an experience you can find no where else in the world. Take a look through the binoculars and read the information wayside panel to learn about these elusive native Hawaiian honeycreeper birds. Continuing along the trail you'll discover the pilina (interconnections) also found within the native shrubland habitat.  </p>",

Today the park uses this forest as a living laboratory to help answer the questions of how we can protect the native forest and animals into the future.<br /> <br /> Hosmer's curisosity has allowed us to observe both postive and negative consequences. Some introduced species have become invasive and when left unchecked can choke out native vegetation. This in turn reduces the amount of biodiversity found in Hawaiʻi. Each member of an ecosystem comes together to form the pilina within a community. Without every species intact and playing its role, we start to see the web of life lose its strength.<br /> <br /> On the rest of your hike back to the parking lot, think about ways you could help the native plant and animal life in Haleakalā, and within your own community. It will take all of us working together to find ways to live more in tune with the natural world and ensure its preservation for future generations. The hope for all visitors to Haleakalā National Park is to hear the song of the ‘iʻiwi, be graced by the scarlet blossom of the ‘ōhi’a lehua, and gain a new understanding of the importance of place.  </p>",

        "notes": "Crater View at Kalahaku\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/crater-view-at-kalahaku.htm\n\nIt took two million years for this landscape to take shape, molded by the countless layers of lava beneath, the relentless heat of the mantle plume below Hawai‘i, and the slow erosion of rain against the mountainside. Through the windows of the shelter, you can reflect on a storied landscape carved by creation and destruction – eruption and erosion.<br /> <br /> How many eruption features can you see “crater” valley floor? What about erosion features? On a clear day, there are 13 puʻu visible on the valley floor. They may look small, but some are nearly 1,000 feet tall! These cone-shaped eruption features formed during the eruption of “fire fountains.” When very runny and extremely hot basaltic material gets pushed out of a fissure in the volcano by gas pressure, jets of that molten lava can shoot thousands of feet up in the air. That projectile lava cools as it falls to the ground, piling up around the base of the fire fountain and welding together into the cinder or scoria cones you see today. Fire fountains look very dramatic but are only mildly explosive.<br /> <br /> These eruption events are part of the process of creating new land. The longer a Hawaiian volcano remains near a heat source, the more rock it spills out, and the larger the island becomes. This volcano is moving away from its heat source – not a convergent tectonic plate boundary like what fuels the volcanoes along the “Ring of Fire”, or a divergent plate boundary like what fuels volcanism in the East African Rift. Instead, this volcano’s activity is driven by a hotspot or mantle plume, a current of heat rising from a deeper layer of the planet which melts the crust above in just one area at a time. There are dozens of mantle plumes on the planet, but some are more famous than others – Yellowstone, Galapagos, and Iceland (also on a divergent plate boundary) are a few examples.<br /> <br /> As the moving Pacific Plate slowly drags Maui westward, away from the mantle plume that’s now centered underneath Hawai‘i Island, the eruptions from this volcano have become less productive, and the forces of weathering and erosion now dominate the landscape. The deep valleys leading to the ocean, tall pali (cliffs) towering on each side of the crater, and the roaring waterfalls of the Kīpahulu District are the signifiers of this erosion.",

In your opinion, which letter of the alphabet best matches the shape of the depression before you?<br /> <br /> If the weather is clear, you can see straight across the Haleakalā Crater. The name Haleakalā Crater is historic, but it’s not a true crater or caldera. This “crater” shape is actually an erosional valley carved by water, not by a big explosion - that’s why its shape is more like an “S” or a “W” than a perfect “O”.<br /> <br /> Look for two large river-carved valleys on each side of the volcano- they intersect the crater at Ko'olau Gap to the north and Kaupō Gap to the east. Over hundreds of thousands of years, flowing water in these valleys cut upstream until they coalesced to form the summit depression. Over the last several thousand years, mildly explosive volcanic eruptions have filled and flattened the bottom of the originally V-shaped valley, shaping the present-day flat crater floor and marking it with the red and black scoria cone puʻu (hills) that you see.<br /> <br /> The inside of the crater is filled a riot of colors. Black, red, orange, yellow, grey, and green swirl across lava flows and over cinder cones. The orange and green are mostly signs of vegetation growing among the rocks, and the variation from red to black is largely due to different amounts of oxidation, or rust, of the iron contained in the basaltic lava and cinder. Oxidation can vary within a single eruption, caused by different amounts of water vapor in the melt coming up to the surface, or change over time due to weathering–exposure to air, precipitation, and harsh ultraviolet radiation from the sun.<br /> <br /> Just like the red rocks, your red (oxygenated) blood also contains oxidized iron, mostly in your red blood cells and muscle tissues. It’s necessary to transport oxygen to your lungs, a function that is put to the test at this elevation. Before this mountain’s summit eroded into the crater you see below, the extra several thousand feet of elevation would have made the air feel even thinner! ",

The ground is mostly devoid of understory plants. The leaves and roots of eucalyptus trees inhibit other plants to grow under them due to naturally occuring chemicals. Having no middle or lower canopies causes soil to easily wash downslope through streams and rivers into the ocean, which can eventually harm coastal reefs by over-sedimentation.<br /> <br /> Eucalyptus trees can be seen in old groves, roadsides, and windbreaks in Hawaiʻi and have been introduced on each of the islands- some species have become invasive. Eucalyptus may have negative impacts, but they also provide food and foraging habitat for many native forest birds.<br /> <br /> As you walk to the next stop put on your detective hat and find a fresh green eucalyptus leaf on the ground, crush it in your hands to smell the pungent oils of the many different eucalyptus species planted here.   </p>",

Originally hala was the dominant tree in the lowlands here, but is less common today due to invasive species brought to the islands. People often ask the question, “Is that a pineapple tree?”  <br /> <br /> The large fruits do indeed closely resemble pineapples. Trees carrying these fruits are considered female and trees that do not bear fruit, are male. In old Hawaiʻi, hala grew everywhere along coastlines because it does very well in poor soil and rough salty environments.  <br /> <br /> Hala played a very important role in the lives of early Hawaiians. The leaves were used for thatching and weaving. Masters of lau hala created hats, mats, baskets, and canoe sails. Sails made from these lau hala propelled Polynesians thousands of miles across the ocean! Hala fruit could also be eaten in times of famine. The pods of the fruit can be used as a paintbrush and to make lei. By choosing plants like hala to carry to new islands, Polynesians ensure that they would not only survive, but thrive. <br /> <br /> What is something that makes you more comfortable in your home?  <br /> <br /> Continue on the path and think about where you would build a house along the way.",

Walking along Kūloa Point Trail provides an opportunity to witness formations built by diligent and skilled hands hundreds, perhaps even a thousand years ago. They voyaged from distant Polynesian islands to the Hawaiian islands, eventually creating what we know as a distinct Hawaiian culture and settling in Kīpahulu (likely around the 12th century). <br /> <br /> Two archeological sites welcome you as you approach the view shed of the Alenuihāhā Channel along the coast of Kīpahulu. First, you will come across a small ahu called a koʻa or fish shrine. Kīpahulu is said to be home of Laka, the god of the canoe makers. Chief ʻUmi from Hawaiʻi Island employed Lulana, a canoe maker from Kīpahulu. It was said that “no canoes equaled the canoes of Lulana in the days of ʻUmi or of the ancient chiefs before him.” ʻUmi thus named Lulana \"chief over all canoe experts or <i>poʻe kahuna kalaʻi</i> on Hawaiʻi Island.\" Before launching their waʻa (canoes) into the sea, fishers leave offerings at koʻa to ensure a good catch and safe journey.   The next site you will see is a hale noa (sleeping house.) We discussed these types of houses earlier when we stopped at the hale hālāwai.  <br /> <br /> Continue to the next stop to learn how Hawaiian children are taught to respect the power of water in their home. ",

Please do not sit on the fragile rock walls or stack rocks around the hale hālāwai. Stacking rocks has no cultural significance and is akin to graffiti.  <br /> <br /> Welcome to the hale hālāwai, which was built in 2010 to showcase how a typical Hawaiian gathering house would look.  Think about your hometown and how different building shapes may indicate the purpose of the building. The same is true for Hawaiian village sites.  <br /> <br /> These types of structures were used for various purposes. Hawaiians built specific hale (houses) for many uses: gathering houses, cooking houses, kāne (men’s) eating houses, wāhine (women’s) eating houses, waʻa (canoe) houses, and of course hale noa (sleeping houses.) Each was built to the specifications of its purpose. A hale noa was small and cozy with one puka (hole/doorway) and thatched all the way to the ground. Thatching would have been either palm leaves or pili grass, depending on that village’s specific resources.  We will learn more about the hale noa further down the trail.<br /> <br /> There are numerous stone foundations of these types of buildings. In fact, Hawaiian archeologists claim that more of these foundations are found in this part of Maui than in all of Hawaiʻi combined! Why would this be the case? Location, location, location! Situated conveniently by the shore and a fresh water stream, this location provided all the resources needed to survive. Behind the hale hālāwai, you see rock walls disappearing into the dense forest. If we were to remove the trees and ground vegetation here, you would see dozens of these walls and many more building foundations in the distance. This was once a thriving village.  <br /> <br /> While the people that built these structures were using ancient knowledge from Polynesian traditions, Maui’s changed in the past two centuries. How has your hometown changed in your lifetime?

Maybe you have calluses on your hands, or freckles from time in the sun. Volcanoes also change as they age and based on their surroundings. Sometimes they change gradually and other times violently. The “body” of a volcano is shaped by eruptions and erosion. By looking at the dark, porous rocks in the roadcut beside this pull-out, you can see evidence of how this volcano has grown.<br /> <br /> Like most Hawaiian volcanoes, the shield shape underlying Haleakalā is the result of effusive and mildly explosive volcanic activty. Effusive eruptions are the quiet kind that produce steadily flowing pāhoehoe and ‘a‘ā lava. These effusive basaltic eruptions are so abundant throughout Hawai‘i that geologists use those Hawaiian words to describe similar eruptions around the world. Mildly explosive eruptions are the kind that shoot gas and molten rock material into the air. At Haleakalā, most eruptions had both a mildly explosive (fire-fountaining) and effusive (lava) phase. Any eruption here would have been very mild compared to Mt. St. Helens, Vesuvius, or Krakatoa.<br /> <br /> Standing on the shoulder of the pull-off, you are facing a road-cut through several rock layers. These rock layers are mafic–cooled from a melt (igneous), heavy with iron and magnesium, and dark in color. The mafic rocks you see are basaltic lava flows that cooled and hardened on the volcano’s surface (extrusive), rather than inside of the volcano (intrusive). The lava flows on this volcano can take two forms–pāhoehoe and ‘a‘ā. At this stop, the layers are ‘a‘ā. ‘A‘ā lava moves downhill in open channels, a dense central core sandwiched between rubbly layers called “clinker”. Can you find the dense core of this lava flow and layers of rubbly clinker above and below?",

        "notes": "Hosmer Grove Picnic Shelter\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/hosmer-grove-picnic-shelter.htm\n\nHosmer Grove lies in the cloud belt of Haleakalā, at nearly 7,000-feet (2134m) in elevation in the summit area. This picnic pavilion is located 0.5 mile (0.8 km) past the Haleakalā entrance station, next to the campground and Hosmer Grove Trail. It is an ideal place to have a picnic or let the kids run around, with a grassy lawn, numerous trees to provide shade, and a covered picnic area to rest under or take a seat. It is one of the few places in the park where you can get out of the sun, or rain, with a tall canopy of trees overhead for protection.<br /> <br /> The picnic shelter was built during Mission 66 (1956-1966), as part of the program to modernize and improve park infrastructure across the country. The grove behind is one of three experimental forestry plots planted by Ralph S. Hosmer, who was elected Superintendent of Forestry of the Territory of Hawai‘i in 1904. He saw the need for a timber resource in Hawaiʻi and also wanted to test out tree species to help control erosion. Hosmer planted 13 different species of trees in this forest plot, from pines to eucalyptus, to see which were best suited for the higher elevations and climate in Hawaiʻi. Some species did not fare well and died, while others flourished, and have created a tall canopy in this forest today. The smell of eucalyptus and pine trees will engulf your senses while walking the short trail located behind the picnic shelter. The native alpine shrubland plants along this trail are a good example of the predominant species that grow at this elevation. The sounds of native forest bird calls like iʻiwi, amakihi, and ʻapapane will remind you that you are in the Wao Akua, or realm of the gods.<br /> <br /> Read more about the history of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hale/hosmer-grove.htm\">Hosmer Grove</a> or take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hale/learn/nature/birds-of-the-summit-district.htm\">Birds of the Summit District </a>guide.<br />  ",

Begin here at the trail sign to explore Hosmer Grove along this .6 mile loop trail through an \"alien\" forest and native shrubland. <br /> <br /> Before you begin, take a minute to observe your surroundings. Through human curiosity and time, this landscape has been shaped and altered to what you see around you today. Around the mid-1800s, tree harvesting, ranching and the introduction of feral animals such as goats and pigs had wrecked havoc on native Hawaiian forests everywhere. In an attempt to salvage the water storing capacity of native forests (which were viewed at the time as in unavoidable decline) people began planting fast growing introduced or “alien” species. One of these researchers was Ralph Hosmer, who planted several of the species you'll be walking alongside today, in Hosmer Grove. The interconnection of plants and animals, native and non-native, give insight into how best to manage this forest into the future.  <br /> <br /> Our views and attitudes towards ecosystem management have changed over time, and this forest is a great example of the early days of trial and error in a research forest. Hosmer Grove has given park scientists a chance to view the interactions of introduced tree species such as conifers and eucalyptus, with a native habitat of trees, shrubs, forest birds, and native insects. In early experiments by land managers in Hawai’i, plants and animals were introduced, but without proper research some species took a strong foothold and became invasive, spreading rapidly.<br /> <br /> While his intentions were good, Hosmer didn't fully realize the effect these actions might have on the surrounding ecosystem. As you journey on to the next stop, can you think of a time something didn't go as you had planned? </p>",

Parking your vehicle at the Headquarters Visitor Center, hop out and take a look around. Everything under your feet is the East Maui Volcano, whose summit region is known as Haleakalā (House of the Sun). This massive shield volcano has a summit that soars 10,023 feet into the atmosphere, and it is rooted to the ocean floor 19,680 feet below sea level. East Maui Volcano is the younger of two volcanoes that make up the island of Maui, and it’s the only active volcano in the state that is NOT on the island of Hawai‘i. Even though geologists classify this volcano as active, you won’t see any hot lava, ash clouds, gas vents, or hot springs during your visit. <br /> <br /> Volcanoes operate on a much longer timeline than human lives, so their activity can be measured over hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years. There is no universal timeline for when active volcanoes become dormant, or when a dormant volcano becomes extinct. When geologists say that a volcano is “active,” it doesn’t necessarily mean that it is currently erupting. Rather, that volcano has erupted recently and most likely will erupt again. This volcano has experienced about 13 eruptions in last 1,500 years, the most recent eruption being 400-600 years ago near the town of Makena on the south coast. ",

        "notes": "Kalahaku Overlook\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/kalahaku-overlook.htm\n\nSituated on the edge of the pali (cliff), the Kalahaku Overlook features a simple structure that overlooks the expansive Haleakalā crater including the 14 puʻu (hills), the famous ʻāhinahina (silversword), and maybe even an ʻuaʻu (Hawaiian petrel) if you are lucky. Reached by a 0.1 mile (0.16 km) walk, this perspective differs from that of the visitor center near the summit, providing a unique experience.<br /> <br /> Long before modern tourism began, people have been visiting the mountain of Haleakalā for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. In ancient Hawaiʻi and today, the mountain is a sacred place. It is part of wao akua, or realm of the gods. The kānaka maoli (native Hawaiians) made the voyage for many purposes including practicing ceremonies, making offerings, chanting oli, and harvesting resources such as a special kind of rock used for making tools like the koʻi, or adze. These practices are still alive and well today.<br /> <br /> The Kalahaku Overlook structure that is currently on the pali (cliff) is not the only building to have ever existed in this location. The original structure was a rest house built in 1894 by architect Charles W. Dickey that they called Craigielea. A new shelter was constructed by the Maui Chamber of Commerce in 1914 to accommodate more visitors and remedy vandalism that had happened over the years. The only way to access the mountain at this time was by foot or horseback, so the rest house allowed for tired travelers to get much needed rest and protection from the elements. In 1957, the building was yet again rebuilt due to wear and tear from the high volume of use. The overlook shelter that you see today was designed in the “Mission 66” style. The Mission 66 program created the Park Service Modern style, which is what you see in many national park visitor centers and structures throughout the country today. The glass and steel materials allowed the park service to create low-cost structures that they could use for shelter and educational programs to help the increasing number of visitors make meaningful connections with the cultural and natural resources of our national parks.<br /> <br /> This area is also nesting ground for a native seabird of Haleakalā, the ʻuaʻu (Hawaiian dark-rumped petrel). They only lay one egg per year, so they are especially vulnerable to disturbances. While this alpine desert landscape may look like just rocks, it provides habitat and a home for native animals, plants, and insects. Please stay only in the designated walking areas to avoid stepping on someone’s home. On the makai (towards the ocean) side of the parking lot, there is an area marked as “Silversword Area”. Historically there used to be numerous ʻāhinahina (silversword), but in recent years many have died due to an overall decrease in rainfall which could be attributed to changing climatic conditions.",

On a clear day, the Wayside offers broad views of the expansive Haleakalā crater.</p> <p>Here, you can learn about the formation of this shield volcano as well as factors contributing to its erosion. The current dimentsions of the crater are roughly 7.5 miles(12 km) by 2.5 miles (4 km), and if you continue on the trail, you can expect to descend about 3,000 ft (914 m) in elevation to the crater floor. Once twice as deep, subsequent eruptions of Haleakalā have partially filled in the valley with flows and the 14 multicolored cinder cones (puʻu) you can see from this vantage point. The two breaks in ridgeline visible from this overlook are the Koʻolau Gap (left) and Kaupo Gap (right) where lava once flowed out. The last eruption in the crater area was roughly 1,000 years ago, while the most volcano's most recent eruption on Maui was actually on the island's southern coast, between 400 and 600 years ago. Geologists still consider Haleakalā an active volcano, with the potential for future eruptions. </p> <p>Native Hawaiians have been traversing the crater for hundreds of years as a way to get from one side of the island to the other. Cattle ranchers have also driven cattle through the crater to get to greener pastures or summer watering holes. While this is no longer allowed, cattle can still be seen grazing outside of park boundaries on the drive up the mountain. The current Keoneheʻehe’e trail was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1937. The CCC created 20 miles (32 km) of trail throughout the crater which are still very popular today.</p>",

Volcanic eruptions are just like your delightful bubbly beverage of choice. Check out the rocks at this stop to see the comparision in action. Keep in mind that these rocks are part of the park and should remain where you find them. It is culturally disrespectful and illegal to disturb or remove any rocks from Haleakalā.<br /> <br /> When molten rock is deep underground, it’s called magma. The weight of the overlying rock keeps magma under immense pressure, dissolving gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide into the molten mixture. If the hot, pressurized magma reaches a weak spot in the crust above, it shoots up toward the surface. Pressure on the magma decreases as it rises, and the dissolved gases will reach a point where they change from liquid to gas form, expanding into bubbles inside the magma and forcing it to rise even faster. If it reaches the surface, it becomes lava!<br /> <br /> Consider a glass bottle of champagne. An airtight container holds a fluid mixed with dissolved gas (carbon dioxide) under intense pressure without exploding. If you look through the glass, it only appears to be liquid. However, as you dramatically remove the cork, the contents that were under pressure now experience rapid decompression, and all of the dissolved gas suddenly explodes out of the top of the bottle as a spray of frothy bubbles. Compare the bottled liquid to magma underneath the volcano, and the explosion of foam and bubbles to the cooled lava on the ground at this stop.<br /> <br /> If you take a close look at the lava rocks around this parking area, the many holes you see are bubbles frozen in time–they show where the gas was at the time of the eruption. As this lava flowed and cooled, the bubbles changed shape by joining together or stretching out. By observing the gas content of lava through features like these bubbles, scientists can estimate a lava flow’s likely movement, patterns, and speeds. ",

It is a home to the generations of Native Hawaiians who live in the area today. It is a home to plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. And it is a home to incredible forces that can shape this place in dramatic ways. For that reason, please be respectful and:  <ul> <li>Stay on trail at all times </li> <li>Do not disturb natural or archeological sites </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Do not stack or take rocks</li> </ul> The Kīpahulu Visitor Center welcomes hundreds of visitors a day to Haleakalā National Park. Located in East Maui overlooking the Alenuihāhā Channel that divides Maui from Hawaiʻi Island. The visitor center deck provides views of the ocean, and, on a clear day, of Hawaiʻi Island thirty miles in the distance.  <br /> <br /> Kīpahulu is one of the few preserved moku districts of Maui. A moku district is a system used by pre-Contact Hawaiians for dividing land and establishing the rule of law. The objects in the visitor center showcase that this is a homeland for people for over too many generations to count.   As you continue along this loop trail around the Kūloa point, you can begin to see the importance of Kīpahulu as a home. You can discover plants brought by Polynesian voyagers, observe hale built by early people, and feel the natural beauty of ʻOheʻo Gulch and the vast shoreline of east Maui. <br /> <br /> This land has provided for generations of ʻohana (families), and here a sacred bond has formed between people and place. Enter with aloha (respect,) for this is a homeland and you are walking into their cherished house. In this area you will also feel the power of water, which makes up the geographic boundaries of the moku. Fresh water was key to survival, and every moku village had enough water for everyone. It was the ocean from which the early people came to Maui. Waʻa (canoes) were the vessels carrying people and all they needed to establish a home.   <br /> <br /> Making your way to the next stop think about your homes and what is it that ties you to your ‘āina (land)? What are some ways that one can show aloha (respect) to a place?",

Leleiwi translates to “bone altar,” and although the name of this area was recorded on early maps of the crater, the history of the name itself has been lost.</p> <p>The overlook was developed in 1966 to offer visiors a new perspective from which to view the crater. It was part of many projects undertaken during Mission 66, a National Park Service program designed to improve park visitor experiences by improving or creating new visitor centers, campgrounds, and trails.</p> <p>It’s a 0.30 mile (0.48 km) roundtrip to Leleiwi Overlook from the parking lot, the trail rising in steps 100 ft (30 m) to the edge of the crater. Near the trailhead are the remains of a stone wall built by ranchers in the late 1800s to guide cattle through the rough landscape. Native plants found along the trail include mamane, pukiawe, ʻohelo, and naʻenaʻe (also called kūpaoa).</p> <p>From the overlook on a clear day one can see down to Maui’s north shore through the Koʻolau Gap to the left. To the left of the Ko'olau Gap, the switchbacks of the new Halemauʻu trail built by the CCC are visible winding along the cliffside. The original Halemauʻu trail used by Hawaiians to traverse the crater and later by ranchers to run cattle has since eroded away. To the right of the gap is Hanakauhi peak, with the Kaupō Gap visible in the distance farther to the right. The Koʻolau and Kaupō Gaps were formed by erosion over many thousands of years. Subsequent eruptions have filled the original valleys, creating their distinctive flat bottoms. Two of the most recent eruptions are still visible, one from Puʻu o Māui and one from Ka Luʻu o ka ʻŌʻō, both occuring within the last thousand years.</p> <p>The tradewind inversion sometimes fills the crater with clouds, but Leleiwi may still be worth a visit on cloudy days during sunrise or sunset.

This native shrubland is a remnant of the plants and trees that once blanketed every side of Haleakalā. Long before humans ever set foot upon the Hawaiian archipelago millions of years ago, native plants, insects, and birds arrived on these slopes through wind, water, and wings.<br /> They built a pilina (interconnection) into a tight diversity of life that’s dependent on each other. Along this stretch of trail look for plant identification signs pointing out different shrubs.<br /> <br /> Many of these plants serve in critical roles to provide food and homes for other endemic and endangered species, including the nēnē (Hawaiian goose). Berries from the shrubs of ʻōhelo, kukaenene, and pukiawe provide key food sources. Shrubland foliage is also critical to the geese for nesting season. Yellow flowers of the māmane tree provide nectar for native ʻiʻiwi honeycreepers. Notice how an ‘iʻiwi’s beak fits perfectly into the curve of a māmane bloom. Please give all wildlife space, never approach or feed them, and drive cautiously along park roadways.<br /> <br /> Hosmer Grove is a stark contrast to a native shrubland around you, what are some of the differences you observe? Curiosity continues through ongoing studies on Hosmer's forested plots, giving researchers a chance to see how the introduced tree species cohabitate with native birds, insects, and their affect on native vegatation. </p>",

It is the most common native endemic tree found in the state of Hawaiʻi, meaning it is found here and nowhere else in the world. The ʻōhiʻa is a pioneer species on new lava flows and has adapted to grow directly in lava rock. Its seeds blow in the wind and settle in cracks in the ground. Hawaiians utilize the hardy tree for building houses, canoes, spears, while the flowers are used in lei and sung about in chant and hula. Flowers are considered sacred to the goddess of lava and volcanic eruptions, Pele.<br /> <br /> There are many versions of mo’olelo (story) about the ʻōhiʻa lehua tree. One version is of a couple who were madly in love- a man named ʻŌhiʻa, and a woman named Lehua. One day the volcano goddess Pele, taking the form of a beautiful woman, saw ʻŌhiʻa and was attracted to him. However ʻŌhiʻa refused Pele because he was in love with Lehua. Pele in her fit and fury, then turned ‘Ōhiʻa into a tree. Lehua, hearing of her lover being gone, asked the gods to turn her into a flower so she could be with him, which they did. To this day, if you pick the lehua blossom from the tree, it is said to rain because the two lovers have been separated.<br /> <br /> The endemic ʻōhiʻa lehua creates the baseline for the Hawaiian word pilina (association, relationship) which highlights the vital interconnection of this landscape. Can you think of a native plant that grows in your neighborhood? What role does it play?<br /> <br /> These trees are home to many native insects and even rare native tree snails! The ʻōhiʻa lehua flowers are an important food source for birds, they sip the nectar from the red blossoms and glean insects in bark and leaves. <br /> <br /> Be still, wait, and look quietly at the crimson red flowers- you may get a chance to see a native Hawaiian honeycreeper. This tree reminds us there used to be a thriving native Hawaiian forest, and we need to protect this fragile ecosystem to ensure the survival of our equally rare and unique species of forest birds. </p>",

Weather permitting, you can enjoy sweeping 360 degree views of the crater, telescopes, west Maui mountains, surrounding islands, and the vast Pacific ocean. The summit building provides protection from the wind, while still allowing viewing opportunities through wrap around windows. Paved and unpaved paths allow guests to explore the area. <br /> <br /> A highlight for many folks making the journey to the summit is viewing the rare ʻāhinahina, or silversword. This particular subspecies is only found here at Haleakalā. The ʻāhinahina is an example of incredible diversifaction and adaptation--its silvery hairs protect it from the intense sunlight and help collect moisture from the moutain mist. These fascinating plants can live for 30 years or more, but they only bloom once in their lives. After unfurling a towering stalk of purple flowers, the plant dies. Do your part to protect this unique feature of Haleakalā--stay on the established trails, and do not approach the silverswords, as our footsteps can damage their fragile root system. Mahalo for helping preserve and protect our ʻāhinahina for future generations to enjoy!<br /> <br /> Pleaes note: the observatories and telescopes on the adjacent hill are not part of the park and are not open to the public. <br />  ",

        "notes": "Puʻuʻulaʻula Overlook\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/puuulaula-overlook.htm\n\nTake a moment to catch your breath as you walk around this summit parking lot. The air is thinner up here – that means there’s far less oxygen in the atmosphere at this elevation! Some of the air you’re breathing is present because of the gas bubbles you saw in the lava flows below. A rich atmosphere is just one of the contributions that volcanoes make to our planet. Eruptions like the one you’re standing on produce materials that are necessary for the bodies we have, the life the planet sustains, and the technology that humans have created.<br /> <br /> Active volcanoes enrich the atmosphere with water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and many other gases. They create new land and bring essential elements to the surface. On a clear day, looking for the large mountainous silhouette in the distance, you can see the impact of that shield-building process still in action on Hawai‘i Island.<br /> <br /> The two tallest peaks of the Big Island are some of the most massive mountains on the planet, underwater volume included - Mauna Kea (13,800’) and Mauna Loa (13,700’). It’s important to learn and use those Hawaiian names! They hold cultural significance and are often descriptive. Here we see Mauna (mountain) Kea (white) and Mauna (mountain) Loa (long). The taller and steeper peak of Mauna Kea is often capped with snow in winter, visibly a “white mountain” even from this distance. Mauna Loa is indeed a “long mountain” with a more gradual profile. The difference in their distinct shapes is tied to the fact that Mauna Kea is older – its eruptions have become increasingly explosive over time as the magma in its reservoir slowly crystallizes, degasses, and becomes more viscous.<br /> <br /> Even though volcanoes like Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, and Haleakalā are incredibly massive and have been active for a very long time, they can’t hold a candle to humanity’s greenhouse gas output. Industrial systems and global burning of fossil fuels emit a Mount St. Helens-sized eruption of CO2 every 2.5 hours! Climate change driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions poses a greater threat to the life, culture, and history here than any future eruption.  ",

This small hike allows you to see a different view of the crater and some cultural resources of the park.<br /> <br /> Pā Kaʻoao, or “the fences of Kaʻoao,” is the name of this small pu‘u (hill), which has over 100 archeological features known as pā (fences, walls or enclosures) on its leeward side. The pā were likely built by the Hawaiians between the mid-15th and mid-17th centuries. The story goes that Pā Kaʻoao got its name from Ka‘oao, a former Hawaiian aliʻi (chief) of Kaupō. Ka‘oao and his army were escaping a rival ali‘i in Kaupō, and built these enclosures in this area in order to have shelter for the night. Later it was reported that these shelters were used by travelers to the summit of Haleakalā. It is important that we stay on trail to protect these archeological resources.</p> <p>The trail that leads up the hill was created in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC was established in 1933 by President Roosevelt to help boost the economy during the Great Depression by employing young men to work on public works projects. Within the parks and especially here at Haleakalā, the CCC conducted projects such as trail construction, fire prevention, cleanup, and maintenance.</p>",

Prior to this time, the small waterfall was located directly where the small valve house building now stands (looking at the waterfall from the end of the paved trail, the building is just to your right). The diversion tunnel runs 10 miles and dumps water into Whiskeytown Lake via the Judge Francis Carr Powerhouse. When it is necessary to dewater the tunnel for maintenance, the valve is turned off and the excess water from the tunnel spills into Crystal Creek.</p>",

Carr Trail to Whiskeytown Falls\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/james-k-carr-trail-to-whiskeytown-falls.htm\n\n<p><span style=\"color:null;\">The age of discovery continues into the present at Whiskeytown National Recreation Area...<br /> <br /> While studying aerial photographs of the park in 2004, long-time park natural resource manager Russ Weatherbee discovered a waterfall. Russ then visited the site and may have even pinched himself to make sure he wasn't dreaming the vision of this 220-foot-tall, three-part waterfall. Russ had discovered, or perhaps rediscovered, the tallest waterfall in the park.<br /> <br /> After the story of the waterfall's discovery got out, it came to light that for over 40 years the falls was known about by a few local residents. For a variety of reasons, these specific individuals decided not to share the falls' existence with others.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\">Two summers of trail construction work ensued and park staff opened the trail to Whiskeytown Falls for others to see and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The trail to the falls is named in honor of James K. Carr, one of Redding's native sons and an instrumental figure in the establishment of what is officially known as Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area. A state and national reclamation official, Carr served as President John F. Kennedy's Undersecretary of the Interior, the number two position in the department behind Interior Secretary Stewart Udall.<br /> <br /> The James K. Carr Trail to Whiskeytown Falls is 3.4 miles roundtrip and is strenuous. There is over 600 feet of elevation gain and some steep sections of trail on the way to the waterfall. At minimum, wear sturdy shoes and carry plenty of water to drink.<br /> <br /> While evidence of the Carr Fire can be found along the trail, ample shade remains. Because of the steep topography, colder climate, and unique vegetation of this drainage, the area was much less affected by the unprecedented fire than other areas of the park.<br /> <br /> At the base of the waterfall, be sure and head up the cement stairs to see the upper sections of this three-tiered waterfall.</span></p>",

A year later, a small but formal memorial was dedicated to honor and remember the slain leader at the location he had spoken at. At the Kennedy Memorial today, <a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/JFKWHA/1963/JFKWHA-223-002/JFKWHA-223-002\">listen to President Kennedy’s Whiskeytown Dam dedication speech</a> and gaze out at the view the U.S. commander-in-chief enjoyed on September 28th, 1963. Since his speech was about conservation, think about what this word means to you.</p> <h4>Of Kennedy and Carr: Two Speeches and a Memorial</h4> <p>With thousands of Shasta and Trinity county residents in attendance, on September 28th, 1963, President Kennedy dedicated Whiskeytown Dam. In front of several dignitaries as well as the large crowd, Kennedy spoke to the importance of natural resource conservation. With conservation broadly defined as providing for the greatest good for the greatest number for the greatest time, President Kennedy noted that, “The fact of the matter is, as a general rule, every time we bet on the future of this country, we win…Every time we develop the water resources, [or] we set aside recreation areas, we can be sure they will be used.”<br /> <br /> Less than two months after Kennedy’s visit to Whiskeytown, the president was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The nation was stunned, and many within Shasta County mourned. To remember and honor the slain leader, locals banded together and donated funds to create a small but formal memorial at the site where President Kennedy had recently spoken. Shasta County designated the roadway leading to Whiskeytown Dam as John F. Kennedy Memorial Drive, and on October 11, 1964, the President John F. Kennedy Memorial was dedicated on the side of Whiskeytown Dam. James K. Carr, a Redding local and an official within the Kennedy administration, keynoted the dedication. “Other Septembers and Novembers will come and go,” noted Carr in his speech. “On this nearby mountain 6,000 feet high [Shasta Bally] that looks down on this lake he helped create, each fall the forested slopes will turn color and people will be reminded of his visit here, his last to California.”</p>",

The footbride is located on the original site of a toll bridge built by Charles Camden who also built the Camden House in 1852 at the beginning of the California Gold Rush. Wintu heritage merges with California Gold Rush history here, and big names associated with the historic district include Levi Tower, Charles and Philena Camden, and American Indian servant Kate Camden.

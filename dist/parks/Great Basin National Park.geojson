The Great Basin stretches from the Sierra Nevada of California to the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, and from southern Oregon to southern California. The term \"basin\" refers to the fact that there is no surface water that flows to the sea here. All the snow and rain that falls either evaporates or collects and absorbs into the ground. <br /> <br /> On your way here, did you notice how many mountain ranges you passed through? This landscape of parallel mountains rangers and the valleys between them extends from the Great Basin all the way to Texas and Mexico. When this area was uplifted around 60 million years ago, the crust began to stretch up and out, fracturing into huge blocks.

The non-profit Great Basin Heritage Area Partnership is the coordinating entity.<br /> <br /> Straddling the Nevada-Utah state line, the Great Basin NHA lies in the vast, open, quiet expanse of the continent’s basin and range physiographic province characterized by long, high-elevation desert valleys separated by steep, narrow mountain ranges. This is a place of distant horizons, starry night skies, and a surprising diversity of flora and fauna including the ancient bristlecone pine. The NHA’s 16,000 square-mile area is equal in size to the nation’s five smallest states combined; home to only 23,000 people, it is one of the least densely populated regions in the country. Great Basin National Park lies in the middle. Many visitors arrive on Highway 50, “America’s loneliest road.”<br /> <br /> Humans have inhabited the Great Basin for more than 13,000 years. The first people migrated throughout their homeland in search of food, with the seasons, and in response to long-term environmental change. Today, their descendants live on four small reservations - the Duckwater Shoshone, Ely Shoshone, Confederated Tribes of the Goshute, and the Kanosh Band of the Utah Paiute – continuing to adapt to a changing world while enriching the heritage of this region through their traditions of dance, music, and art.<br /> <br /> White settlement began in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. Pony Express riders came through briefly, followed by gold and silver miners whose luck had run out in California. Mining towns sprang up when copper was found near Ely, Nevada in 1900, and the Nevada Northern Railway was laid down to carry the ore to the smelters. Farmers, cattle ranchers, and sheepherders took up residence in the wide-open spaces. Some ranches have remained in the same family for seven or more generations, and the old sheepherders still gather to tell their stories. Ghost towns dot the landscape to recall the dozens of communities that boomed, busted, and disappeared.<br /> <br /> In 1943, in an especially bleak stretch of desert outside Delta, Utah, citizens, and residents of Japanese descent were forcibly relocated from the California coast to the internment camp known as “Topaz,” named after a nearby mountain, for the duration of World War II. A museum on the main street in Delta now tells the stories of the 11,000 internees and this dark chapter in our nation’s history.  <br /> <br /> The Great Basin NHA offers visitors and residents crowd-free opportunities for recreational adventure – hiking, hunting, fishing, four-wheeling. This isolated expanse also invites contemplation of the landscape, and its occupants, through the ages. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{23}\" paraid=\"13\">Historic Sites and Points of Interest:</h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{39}\" paraid=\"16\"><a href=\"https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/territorial-statehouse/\">Territorial Statehouse State Park</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{47}\" paraid=\"17\"><a href=\"http://www.covefort.com/\">Cove Fort</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"3\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-font=\"Calibri\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{55}\" paraid=\"18\"><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/pahvant-valley-heritage-trail\">Pahvant Valley Heritage Trail</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"4\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{63}\" paraid=\"19\"><a href=\"http://www.topazmuseum.org/\">Topaz Museum </a><a href=\"http://www.topazmuseum.org/\">and Central Utah Relocation Center National Historic Landmark</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"5\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"5\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{74}\" paraid=\"20\"><a href=\"https://greatbasinmuseum.com/\">Great Basin Museum</a></p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"6\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"6\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{82}\" paraid=\"21\"><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grba/planyourvisit/lehman-caves-tours.htm\">Lehman Caves (in Great Basin National Park)</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"7\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"7\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{90}\" paraid=\"22\"><a href=\"http://parks.nv.gov/parks/ward-charcoal-ovens\">Ward Charcoal Ovens State Historic Park</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"8\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"8\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{98}\" paraid=\"23\"><a href=\"http://wpmuseum.org/\">White Pine Public Museum & McGill Drugstore</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"9\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"9\" data-font=\"Calibri\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{106}\" paraid=\"24\"><a href=\"http://www.nnry.com/\">Nevada Northern Railway National Historic Landmark </a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"10\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"10\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{114}\" paraid=\"25\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/gbnha-storymap/gbnhastorymap/index.html\">Big Warm Spring (Duckwater, NV)</a></p> </li> </ol>",

Many of the cracks in the limestone on this hillside are miniscule passages into the cave below. As rain falls and seeps into the ground , it picks up a little carbon dioxide from the dead matter in the soil, becoming a weak acidic compound we call carbonic acid. (this same compound can be found in soda you drink!) As this acid makes its way into tiny cracks and crevices in the rock, it dissolves a bit as it goes, picking up some of the native calcite.<br /> <br /> Once it reaches the cave, however, the carbon dioxide gets released into the air, just like opening a soda can, and the water can no longer hold onto that mineral it has gathered. The calcite then gets deposited wherever the water seeps out. The resulting diverse speleothems, or cave formations, create an underground world like something from fantasy.",

Lexington Arch is unusual in one important respect: it is carved from limestone. Most of the natural arches of the western United States are composed of sandstone. The fact that Lexington Arch is made of limestone leads to speculation that it was once a passage in a cave system. Flowstone, a smooth glossy deposit that forms in caves, has been found at the base of the opening lending support to this theory.<br /> <br /> The hike to the base of the Arch is over 2.7 miles (total round trip mileage is 5.4 miles).

A great place to bird watch, spot snakes and other wildlife. At dusk and dawn, it is common to see herds of Elk over the rugged terrain, grazing on grass, and sometimes crossing the dirt road in large groups. Strawberry Creek is closed to camping as there are a lot of hazardous trees. Heavy winds often fell these trees into the road, causing temporary closures. Generally closed in the winter due to heavy snow, Strawberry Creek road is unpaved with varying conditions. Expect washboard for the first quarter of mile of the road.

For many years, this entrance was covered with a shed and then a concrete cap. In 1997 the current structure was installed in order to provide better airflow to the cave as well as allow access to the animals that naturally seek out the cave's protection. In recent years, we have started to see bats returning to sleep and hibernate. If you go through a tour in the summer, particuarly in the morning, you may just spy a few getting comfortable. Come back right after sundown and you might spot some as they spiral out of this entrance to look for food.",

Watch your footing. Stacked and worn rocks will show you the way. The majority of the elevation gain will be towards the end of the trail. At times, you will get a view of Stella Lake glistening below. There is no protection along the way, so exposure level to wind and weather is high. Reserve 6-8 roundtrip to complete this hike.

This is the domain of bighorn sheep, rosy-finches, and the American pipit, but even these are rare sights at such altitudes.

On this ridge are the buried houses of the main characters of this story—the Pecos people. The name Pecos is derived from the Native Towa word P’ǽækilâ, which means “the Place above the water.” <br /> <br /> In its heyday, Pecos was a thriving village of perhaps 2,000 people. Plains Apache and Navajo traded and pitched their tipis in the fields and forests in front of you. It was also home to a military power proud of its ability to subdue other pueblos at will. <br /> <br /> In the fall of 1540, the pueblo welcomed a Spanish expedition with the music of drums and bird bone flutes. Francisco Vázquez de Coronado’s expedition arrived at Pecos Pueblo in search of Quivira, a rumored settlement on the plains with precious metals. The Spaniards also said their king wished for the Pecos people to be his subjects and know the Christian god. The Pecos’ lives changed forever. </p>",

This date range is based on its construction using distinctive black adobe bricks and dating of the last use of the firepit inside. There are only two other examples of kivas within mission conventos, making this a rare and fascinating Pecos mystery. </p>",

Because of the threat of Comanche raids and encroachment of livestock on fields, they found farming to be increasingly difficult. By the 1800s, new Hispanic settlements in the valley had taken over what remained of the fertile agricultural fields that supported the pueblo. This, coupled with a drought, caused famine. Hundreds died from epidemics, and others simply moved away to live at other pueblos.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8b1c49ec-d96c-4c8e-b365-a0e911f2ed9a}{173}\" paraid=\"284170617\">In 1838 the last of the Pecos people left this home and walked to the Pueblo of Jemez, where their descendants live today. They took with them the religious knowledge and customs they had learned and practiced at Pecos. Before leaving, the last inhabitants entrusted a special painting to St. Anthony’s Parish in the Village of Pecos. A symbol of the pueblo’s adoption of Christianity as another form of religion, this portrait depicts the patron saint bestowed upon the Mission of Pecos in the 1620s. Every August, the Village of Pecos fulfills its promise to perpetually honor the saint by celebrating a feast day mass in the remains of her final church. After the mass, the Pueblo of Jemez often honors the place through traditional dances, prayers, and blessings. In this sense, Pecos has not been abandoned at all—the pueblo and its people have simply parted company.   </p>",

The wide expanse of the Pecos Valley provided plenty of farmland. Two year-round sources of water were nearby: Glorieta Creek, below you, and the Pecos River, one mile east. Spanish observers also reported springs and reservoirs near the pueblo. Additionally, the commanding view of the entire valley alerted the Pecos to anyone approaching from the Rio Grande Valley or the Great Plains.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1f24668e-ffa8-4d5e-bd37-8dfe46c0c3c6}{177}\" paraid=\"1158850187\">Here, at 6,900 feet, frost comes early. The growing season could be short for corn, beans, and squash. A successful harvest depended on generations of experience. Farmers planted crops throughout the spring to prevent an unexpected late frost from killing an entire crop of young plants. Dozens of one-room “field houses” throughout the valley show that watchful eyes were always on the crops. The Pecos conducted ceremonies to ensure the earth’s fertility and, during summer, to bring rain.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1f24668e-ffa8-4d5e-bd37-8dfe46c0c3c6}{185}\" paraid=\"398134501\">The Pecos’ livelihood did not depend on farming alone. They hunted elk, deer, antelope, and small animals nearby. They raised turkeys and harvested plants, seeds, and roots growing in the valley and mountains. They also took advantage of wild plants, animals, and trade. The pueblo’s location near the pass connecting the Great Plains and the Rio Grande Valley provided many opportunities to trade. Pecos Pueblo hosted large trade fairs attended by Plains people and other pueblos. Corn, beans, squash, and pottery were traded to Plains groups for hides, buffalo meat, and stone tool materials.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1f24668e-ffa8-4d5e-bd37-8dfe46c0c3c6}{197}\" paraid=\"72385808\">Whether through trade or careful plantings, the Pecos had an impressive food store by the time the Spanish arrived.

Some of these open areas may have also been workshops and storage areas. The Spanish introduced a variety of livestock to the pueblo, including cattle, sheep, and pigs. Sheep were more common initially, but by the 1700s more cattle were being bred and used for meat, hides, and milk. Some prized animals, such as dairy cows, may have been kept in the room with a cobblestone floor to your right. This floor may have been easier to clean.

Some kivas also have a small hole in the floor called a sipapu (E), which symbolizes the Pueblo people’s emergence from the underworld.

Finished in 1625, it was an impressive monument to the missionary effort. Its buttressed stone foundations are the only visible remains. They stretch 150 feet from altar to entrance and are 22 feet thick in places. The foundations of the altar area are to your right and of those of the entrance are to your left—a reverse of the present standing church’s layout. Archaeologists estimate that builders used three hundred thousand 40-pound adobe bricks to complete the structure. The building’s architecture—with exterior buttresses, white-washed walls, and six bell towers—contrasted sharply with the pueblo it served.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{5ba3f2ea-0f9e-4f7a-80b2-3776e29ba89d}{175}\" paraid=\"115850428\">Fray Juárez taught the Pecos people to build with adobe bricks made using wooden forms. They were used to working with mud, as some of the early pueblos were constructed by building up walls using layers of mud. The use of forms to create bricks made possible the construction of a huge religious structure, one of the largest in the southwest at the time. The new religion itself was foreign, too. To the Pueblo people, the Christian concept of a single church representing one god contrasted with their many kivas centered on the rhythms and harmonies of nature. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5ba3f2ea-0f9e-4f7a-80b2-3776e29ba89d}{179}\" paraid=\"510984106\">This church functioned for 55 years. During the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Pueblo people revolted against the Spanish, resulting in the only successful expulsion of a European colonizer in the New World. Po’pay, a Tewa leader from Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo (formerly San Juan Pueblo), organized this attack on missions and Hispanic settlements. The church roof was burned and its adobe walls torn down. Many Pueblo people resented Spanish attempts to suppress the Native religion and the use of Native people for labor and goods. The people longed for the days before the Spanish colonizers. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5ba3f2ea-0f9e-4f7a-80b2-3776e29ba89d}{197}\" paraid=\"1165316024\">The Spanish returned in 1692 under Don Diego de Vargas and reestablished Santa Fe as the provincial capital. At Pecos some people supported the Spanish presence, while others resented it. According to historical Spanish documents, the Pecos people claimed Tewas from other pueblos destroyed the church during the revolt and some Pecos warriors assisted Don Diego de Vargas during the Spanish reoccupation of Santa Fe.  </p>",

These trash deposits attracted archaeologist A. V. Kidder to Pecos, and his excavation of the pueblo began here. He found trash deposits over 20 feet high in this location. The deep trash deposits were useful for establishing a regional cultural chronology based on changes in pottery style, which Kidder called the Pecos Classification. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9fabbc92-3064-4725-a4c8-11fcd7d018cb}{171}\" paraid=\"1545095325\"> “It was obvious that we were digging in the greatest rubbish heap and cemetery that had ever been found in the Pueblo region . . . the same sort of slope stretched away to the south on the east side alone for nearly a quarter of a mile . . .

The National Park Service protects the original adobe walls of the church and convento by encasing the walls in new adobe brick veneers. This ensures the remaining original adobe brick walls from the 1600s and 1700s are preserved and the form and outline of the mission remains intact. Condition assessments show that many walls in the church and convento still have original adobe brick over 150 years after the Pecos people departed.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2e60fd33-de24-4e58-8876-05d195210082}{181}\" paraid=\"384604260\">The use of adobe brick veneers to encapsulate fragile original adobe brick walls began in 1915. The bricks for the veneers are made by park staff in the flat area west of the convento. If you look at the convento walls you will notice that some of the bricks are black or gray and some are reddish-brown. During the life of the mission there were several construction phases in the convento, including the addition of a second story and more rooms and corrals to the south. Based on archaeological investigations, the black or gray bricks date to between 1620 and 1640, while the red bricks date to after 1640. Park staff construct the brick veneers in a color similar to the original wall to show the history of construction. </p>",

In 1598, the Spanish returned to settle. With the settlers came the Franciscan priests who established a mission, the remnants of which are now above you. <br /> <br /> Padre Ortiz built the first church around 1617 or 1618 in the rocky wooded hills outside the pueblo. This may reflect the initial reluctance of the Pecos people to embrace Christianity. By 1625 a new, much larger second church was built south of Pecos Pueblo. This church was destroyed in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. A temporary, one-room third church was constructed just south of the present church using a wall of the convento. This church was used until the present church was completed around 1717. This fourth church was built on the remains of the 1625 church and was the last church built at Pecos. </p>",

Once you park in the gravel lot you will notice there are three stone monuments. These monuments stand as testaments to the cost of the Civil War here in New Mexico and remember the fallen soldiers who fought in the Battle of Glorieta Pass. They all are in remembrance to the volunteer regiments who fought and died here, one for each state that was represented, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico (at the time in 1862, New Mexico was a U.S. Territory). The Battle of Glorieta Pass was fought here because of the geographic importance of the area. The pass, which had been used for centuries, was and still is the easiest way to pass through the southern tip of the Rockies. Because of the strategic location and the close proximity to Santa Fe and Fort Union, the Union and Confederate forces met here. Whichever side had won the battle would then take control of the crucial land of New Mexico.</p> <p>The monuments are located just outside of a fenced in gravel parking lot.

By now, the American Revolution had occurred, establishing a new nation. This new nation sought out opportunities to explore the countryside from sea to shining sea. The ideal of Manifest Destiny had been born and with it the idea of searching for new opportunities for commerce and trade.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{a4520a09-1f0e-4d7c-af1f-0cce20810a57}{66}\" paraid=\"2145019571\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">After the Santa Fe Trail opened, some trail users sought out new opportunities. One of those people, Martin Kozlowski, was doing just that when he bought the stagecoach stop and trading post in 1858. It was here that Martin worked to help weary travelers along the way by providing them with a warm place to stay as well as a hot meal cooked by his wife Ellena.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{a4520a09-1f0e-4d7c-af1f-0cce20810a57}{90}\" paraid=\"1819624425\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Kozlowski's Trading Post is a stop along Highway 63 just south of the main park entrance. Look for the exhibits in the parking lot. They focus on how the geography of the area affected trade and commerce pathways through time. The exhibits also show where more Santa Fe Trail sites are to the east and west of Pecos.

The Spanish governors sought wealth, but the Franciscan missionaries sought converts. Between 1617 and 1621, the Franciscan missionary Padre Ortiz oversaw the construction of the first church, located too far from the pueblo to make it successful. By 1625, the Franciscans were allowed to build a new Mission Church just six-hundred feet south of the pueblo. The attached Convento acted as storage, work rooms, and living areas for the missionaries and any Pueblo converts. Construction of the Mission Church and the Convento were supervised by the Franciscans, but Pecos people provided the labor; the Pecos received no pay for their work, raising questions today about the nature of slavery in the Southwest.<br /> <br /> An illegal slave trade promoted by officials of the Spanish Crown, exploitation of Pueblo laborers, poor treatment of Pecos religious leaders and interference in the traditional religion, along with the forced tributes of food and goods led the Pecos people to join nearly thirty other pueblos in a successful revolt against the Spanish Empire in 1680. During the revolt, the Church and the Convento were burned, and the adobe walls were reduced to mounds. The Spanish left New Mexico until DeVargas returned to re-establish the colony in 1693.<br /> <br /> The church that stands today was completed in 1717. This church was built on the rubble of the 1625 church destroyed in the Pueblo of Revolt, and is noticeably smaller. Though the Franciscans did convert many to Christianity, they did not stop traditional religious practices. The religious customs and traditions live on today at Jemez Pueblo and at other extant Pueblos throughout the Rio Grande Valley. At certain times of the year these Pueblos host Feast Days that demonstrate the cultural blending unique to the region.

Settlers and travelers riding the trail between Santa Fe, NM and Independence, MO passed right by the remnants of Pecos Pueblo. Long before Europeans entered this country, the pueblo village of P`ǽkilâ (Pecos) was the juncture of trade between people of the Rio Grande Valley and hunting tribes of the buffalo plains. After Spanish colonization, a successful Pueblo revolt, and recolonization, the population of Pecos Pueblo was decimated. In the 1830s, the last remaining Pecos people migrated permanently to the Pueblo of Jemez where the Pecos traditions live on.<br /> <br /> In 1862, the area surrounding the ruins of Pecos Pueblos was the setting of what some call the Gettysburg of the West – the Battle of Glorieta Pass. During the battle, Union and Confederate troops utilized the Santa Fe Trail, the heart of the conflict occurring within a two-mile stretch of the Trail. The Confederates campaigned to take control of the West, which would have greatly improved their chances of success. However, in just three days of tough fighting, the Union Army ruined the Confederate plans and sent them retreating back southwards. The Union retained control the American Southwest for the rest of the Civil War. Today, you can visit the Glorieta Pass Battlefield at Pecos National Historical Park. Additionally, you can visit one of the famous stops along the Santa Fe Trail – Kozlowski’s Stage Stop and Trading Post. Here, weary travelers rested, a day’s ride from Santa Fe, and explored the ruins of the mission church and pueblo.<br /> <br /> After you finish visiting the park, there are many other Santa Fe Trail sites you can visit nearby. Head west to Santa Fe and you can see the Palace of the Governors, the Santa Fe Plaza, and sites at the end of the Trail. Head east and you can explore the charms of the historical trail town of Las Vegas and the adobe remnants of the largest 19th century military fort in the region at Fort Union National Monument.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (1 Peach Drive, Pecos, NM 87552)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/peco/index.htm\">Pecos National Historical Park</a></h2>",

Along the Santa Fe Trail, two sides fought for their own gains and their own causes. The American Civil War played out here along the Santa Fe Trail over three days in what is called the Battle of Glorieta Pass.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{277e8cf8-f858-41c0-aabc-38ebbe1ad82a}{163}\" paraid=\"305113791\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In 1861, Confederate President Jefferson Davis approved Brigadier General Henry Hopkins Sibley’s plan to raise a force of Texans to invade New Mexico Territory. His objectives were to capture military supplies from Union forts in New Mexico and to recruit New Mexicans, Utah Mormons, and Colorado miners to the Confederate cause. The mineral wealth of the West would enrich the Confederacy and, if the ports of California could be taken, the South would have blockade-free international trade. Jefferson Davis's decision instead set forth a chain of events that would make the Battle of Glorieta Pass the \"Gettysburg of the West.\"  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{277e8cf8-f858-41c0-aabc-38ebbe1ad82a}{187}\" paraid=\"573423675\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">If you would like to learn about the Civil War in New Mexico, hike the Battlefield Trail or attend a ranger-led tour.

However, the Santa Fe Trail had already existed for hundreds of years, just in a much undefined way. The pathways were first used by the Native Americans to facilitate the same purposes: commerce and trade. Trade had been happening in the Pecos area for centuries as tribes came from all over the region, from the plains to the pueblos, to trade precious jewels, food, and tools. While these early pathways had been used for centuries, it became the route that the Spaniards used in 1540. <br /> <br /> In 1540, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, along with 300 Spanish soldiers, set out on a route from northwestern Mexico to discover the Seven Cities of Cibola. Cibola was rumored to be a city of gold and the Spanish knew that gold would also lead to glory. <br /> <br /> As they rode along, they stopped at various places including that of Pecos Pueblo, at the time called Cicuye by the Spaniards. But they were pushed farther and farther, spurred only by the rumors of golden cities. Finally, in a region called Quivira, they stopped and headed back towards Mexico, exhausted and disappointed. <br /> <br /> The search for Cibola had ended, but it was just the beginning for the Santa Fe Trail. </p>",

Archaeologists believe the pueblo site, comprising a north and a south pueblo unit, had around 1000 rooms and at its height was home to about 2000 individuals. Spanish records describe Pecos as a bustling community that hosted trade fairs drawing people and goods from the Plains Nations and the Rio Grande Pueblos. Archaeological finds of shells from the Pacific Coast and Gulf of Mexico and flint arrowheads from sources now in Texas give us an idea as to how far these trade routes ran.<br /> <br /> In 1540 C.E., the Coronado expedition encountered Pecos Pueblo and described the community as having 500 warriors who could subdue other people at will. In the 1620s, Franciscans oversaw the Pueblo construction of a Mission Church close to the south pueblo. In 1680 C.E., Pecos was one of the nearly thirty pueblos that revolted and pushed the Spanish influence from the area. The Spanish returned to, and reconquered New Mexico in 1692.<br /> <br /> Over a number of years, due to disease, decreasing trade, increasing attacks from the neighboring Comanche, and the theft of land, the population of Pecos Pueblo decreased. In 1838 C.E., the last inhabitants left Pecos to join the Pueblo of Jemez. We ask that you visit respectfully and that you leave things as you see them.",

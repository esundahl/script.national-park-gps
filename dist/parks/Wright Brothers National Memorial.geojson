When the Wright Brothers were here, Big Kill Devil Hill – the hill in front of you- was a massive sand dune. Thousands of times, the brothers trekked up this and three nearby dunes to conduct glider experiments.Climbing the hill was strenuous. Deep, soft sand caused every step up the slope to slip part-way back down. The Wrights were also burdened with carrying their heavy gliders up the hill for each flight. Their tireless efforts paid off as they mastered their flying skills and refined their flight controls.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph showing a glider with a pilot flying from the dune.

After more than four years of hard work and experimentation, it only took the Wright Brothers 12 seconds to change the world. On December 17, 1903, at 10:35 a.m., Orville wright made the world’s first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flight.The photograph that documented the Wrights’ success was taken by John T. Daniels, a Kill Devil Hills Life Saving Station surfman, who had never used a camera before. It was not until the Wright Brothers returned to Dayton, Ohio, that they developed the photograph and saw their first flight captured on film. The Daniels’ photo, however, only gives one perspective of that historic event – from the back of the airplane.Stephen Smith’s “First Flight” sculpture, unveiled during the 2003 Centennial, and Frank Wootton’s painting help us see the first flight from different angles. Just as the Wright Brothers’ success depended on viewing the problems of flight in novel and creative ways, perhaps these new perspectives will inspire us to change the world and explore new horizons.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph of the first flight. The 1903 flyer is centered flying away from the viewer, just getting liftoff from the rail below it. A man, Orville Wright, is seen lying on his stomach in the center of the flyer.

Farther behind them is another man and a small boy, and finally a lone man stands farther to the right.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Wilbur and Orville Wright accepted Tate’s invitation and found that the Outer Banks of North Carolina not only provided hospitable people but also the conditions that they needed to fly – wind, sand, and solitude. While solitude was important to get the work done, the Wrights did not work alone. From 1900 to 1903, families from the local communities and the crews from the local life saving stations provided much-needed assistance to the Wrights. On the morning of December 17, 1903, the Wrights signaled for help and “John T. Daniels, W.S. Dough, A.D. Etheridge, W.C. Brinkley of Manteo, and Johnny Moore of Nags Head arrive,” wrote Orville. With their help the Flyer was moved to the launch rail. The men then cheered as the Flyer lifted off the ground.The “First Flight” sculpture captures the Wrights’ historic achievement and the hospitable people who supported them. Local families and descendants of the first flight witnesses continue to welcome visitors to the Memorial and the Outer Banks.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: A black and white photograph of a family posing for a picture on a porch.

They consistently made improvements to it each season they returned. In 1902, they added 10 feet of space to the workshop to use as living quarters, as the past visits to Kitty Hawk had proven tent living as unsustainable.<br /> <br /> The workshop and living quarters were abandoned by the brothers after 1911, allowing nature to destroy the structures.</p> <h3>Living on the Outer Banks</h3> <p>When the Wright brothers arrived here in September 1900, the Outer Banks were very different from today. There were no bridges connecting the Outer Banks to the mainland and Kitty Hawk was a remote, self-sustaining fishing village with few residents and even fewer structures.<br /> <br /> The Kitty Hawk Life-Saving Station and the US Weather Bureau station were four miles apart, with nothing but desolate sand dunes between them. Despite this isolation, the few friends that the brothers did make here proved invaluable, as the members of the life-saving service often assisted the Wrights in their flying experiments.<br /> <br /> As Wibur wrote in November, 1900:</p> <blockquote> <p>In October my brother and myself spent a vacation of several weeks at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, experimenting with a soaring machine. We located on the bar which separates Albemarle Sound from the ocean. South of Kitty Hawk the bar is absolutely bare of vegetation and flat as a floor, from sound to ocean, for a distance of nearly five miles, except a sand hill one hundred and five ft. high which rises almost in its center. The main slope of the hill is to the northeast, which is facing the prevailing winds...To the north, northeast, east, and southeast there is nothing but flat plain and ocean for a thousand miles nearly. It is an ideal place for gliding experiments except for its inaccessibility. The person who goes there must take everything he will possibly need, for he cannot depend on getting any needed article from the outside world in less than three weeks.</p> </blockquote> <h3>Camp Life</h3> <blockquote> <p>Trying to camp down here reminds me of those poor arctic explorers. We are living nearly the whole time on reduced rations. Once in a while we get a mess of fish, and if our stuff comes about the same time from Elizabeth City - which stuff consists of canned tomatoes, peaches, condensed milk, flour, bacon & butter- we have a big blowout...But it only lasts a day...</p> <p>   - Orville Wright, October 18, 1900</p> </blockquote> <p>When the brothers first arrived at Kitty Hawk in 1900, they lived in rudimentary tents that often blew over in the nearly constant winds. In addition, they were plagued by mosquitos and a lack of supplies. Nonetheless, creature comforts were outweighed by their desire to perfect flight.<br /> <br /> In 1901, the brothers improved their camp conditions. They constructed a more permanent wood-frame workshop and storage facility. In 1902, with the help of local residents, they upgraded their camp buildings further by adding more space to the workshop for use as living quarters. When they returned to the Outer Banks yet again in 1903, they repaired the storage facility/workshop, which had been blown off its foundation by storms, and they also constructed a hangar to assemble their powered aircraft.</p> <h3>Reconstruction</h3> <p>The camp buildings were first reconstructed in 1953 in commmoration of the 50th anniversary of the first flight. Due to storm and termite damage, these structures were removed in 1963 and rebuilt between 1963 and 1965.<br /> <br /> In 1976, the hangar was replaced due to deteriorating conditions and the living quarters recieved much needed repairs the same year.<br /> <br /> In 1984, the hangar was rebuilt for a third time, to more exact specifications, after being damaged by a storm.<br /> <br /> In 1993, the parks preservation team rebuilt both the living quarters and the hangar building. Although they subsequently require occasional replacement materials and repairs, these are the current structures that stand today. </p>",

To test actual flight, however, they needed a special location to experiment. Using US Weather Bureau statistics, they looked for a place that was windy, sandy, and out of the public eye. They found Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on the Outer Banks to be the right area to test their gliders.<br /> <br /> COLUMN OF IMAGES:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: A black and white photograph that shows two men standing, in dark clothing, holding their hats to their head, another man sitting on the ground wears much lighter colored clothing and is to the right. In the background, is the shadowy figure of another person in the distance. The men are looking towards the sky as a large glider flies past them overhead. The area close to the men is hazy, indicating that the sand is being blown by a strong wind.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Wind helped with lift.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: A black and white photograph of a pilot lying prone on a glider as it sits on a sandy surface.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Sand provided a soft landing.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #3: Black and white photograph of the sandy dune.

The commemorative granite boulder and replica monorail mark the lift-off point of those four flights, the numbered markers the terminating point.Since soft sand prohibited launching with conventional wheels, the Wright Flyer was place on a 60-foot monorail with its landing skits resting on a wheeled truck. Once the engine started, the Flyer was released and slid down the rail until it gained enough speed to lift into the air.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: A black and white photograph showing the 1903 Flyer in preparation for flight on the launching rail. In this image, the full flyer can be seen, and a man dressed in a suit and wearing a hat is standing at the front of the flyer.<br /> <br /> GRAPHIC IMAGE: This graphic shows each flight and its path with different types of lines with small rises and falls in elevation. The path for the first flight is small dots and shows the flight lasting 12 seconds and traveling 120 feet.

The view looks down the length of the launching monorail at the rudder and rear of the flyer. The propellers are blurred, indicating movement. Orville can be seen lying down, piloting the flyer in the center, while Wilbur is running along the right wing, holding on as it takes off. There are callouts pointing to the dolly, located below the flyer, and the Launch rail, which is below the dolly.<br /> <br /> TEXT #1: The Launch Rail & Dolly. The soft sand was not a good “runway.” The brothers build a 60-foot wooden rail with metal stripping to provide a hard and smooth surface for takeoff. A dolly of wood and bicycle hubs was placed on the rail to hold the flyer above the sand as it accelerated forward to liftoff.<br /> <br /> TEXT #2: Getting off the Ground. After four years of scientific research and rigorous experimentation, and with their 1903 Flyer on the rail, the Wrights are set to fly. In unison, they each pull down on a propeller. The engine roars to life and the propellers whip through the air; only a restraining wire keeps the flyer in place. Orville climbs onto the machine and positions himself into the hip-cradle. He releases the restraining wire and the machine slowly moves forward. Wilbur runs alongside to steady the machine. After traveling 40 feet down the rail, the flyer lifts into the air, ushering in the Age of Flight.",

With Orville at the controls and Wilbur running alongside, the brothers had achieved the seemingly impossible.<br /> <br /> The boulder and accompanying plaque were dedicated on December 17, 1928 by the National Aeronautic Association, marking the 25th anniversary of the brothers' first flight. Orville Wright and Amelia Earhart were among the 3,000 people in attendance.</p> <h3>Determining the Location</h3> <p>Identifying the exact location of the takeoff was problematic because the topography of the site had shifted in the years following the Wrights' experiments. On November 4, 1928, Captain William Tate organized a meeting of three of the four surviving witnesses to determine the point of takeoff.<br /> <br /> Using Orville Wright's account of the flight, Will Dough, Adam Etheridge, and Johnny Moore identified the approximate location of takeoff. Tate described their methods at the marker's dedication ceremony:<br /> <br /> > Dough, Etheridge, Moore and I assembled here and I explained to them the importance of arriving at a definite conclusion with respect to the spot where the Wright brothers' airplane, in making its first successful flight, first began to move along the ground. We located the four corners of the building in which the machine was housed...We took into consideration what Mr. Orville Wright said about it in his article How We Made Our First Flight. We had a compass with us and we were sure of our compass course. After considering all these things and talking it over these three men proceeded by themselves to come out here on this point and select the spot on which this magnificent boulder stands and said that this was the spot where the Wright airplane started its first successful flight...After agreeing upon this exact spot we signed a paper to that effect...</p> <h3>The 25th Anniversary</h3> <p>An important first step in the realization of the Wright Brothers National Memorial occurred on December 17, 1928, when 200 delegates from the International Civil Aeronautics Conference and more than 3,000 visitors dedicated a granite marker placed at the approximate location of the 1903 liftoff, and laid the cornerstone of the monument to be placed on Big Kill Devil Hill. Among those in attendance were Orville Wright and Amelia Earhart.</p> <h3>Launch Rail (Reproduction)</h3> <p>The launching rail is a reproduction of the rail the brothers used to launch their flyer on December 17, 1903.<br /> <br /> The original rail the brothers installed consisted of four 15-foot 2x4s standing on the long edge. The reproduction is the same, with the addition of metal on top to preserve the wooden structure.</p>",

After Big Kill Devil Hill-which shifted continuously due to wind and weather-was stabilized by the Quartermaster's Corps in 1929, the construction began in earnest.<br /> <br /> The monument was officially dedicated in 1932, with approximately 1,000 people in attendance-Orville Wright among them.</p> <h3>Laying the Cornerstone</h3> <p>The cornerstone for the monument was laid atop Kill Devil Hill on December 17, 1928-the 25th anniversary of the first flight and the same day of the First Flight Boulder dedication.</p> <h3>Stabilizing the Dune</h3> <p>In order to build a large monument atop Big Kill Devil Hill, the sand dune needed to be stabilized. In 1929, the dune was stabilized using a mixture of Bermuda grass, bitter panic grass, yaupon, myrtle, pine, live oak, and sumac-all found locally and transplanted. Rye and crotalaria grasses were also used.<br /> <br /> Description of the planting method use:<br /> > Shallow furrows plowed about thirty inches apart. Fertilizer applied, wire [Bermuda] grass roots placed in furrow, and different grass seeds sowed with the wire [Bermuda] grass roots. All planting then covered with a thin layer of sand and the entire area covered with two to three inches of wood's mold. Wood mold helped to fertilize sand and prevented the movement of sand while the seeds were germinating.</p> <h3>Design</h3> <p>In June, 1928, the Office of the Quartermaster General announced a design competition for the development of the monument. In October, 1928, the Office suggested that Big Kill Devil Hill would be a suitable location for the monument. By January, 1929, 36 entries had been received.<br /> <br /> The selection of the winning design was made in accordance with principles established by the American Institute of Architects. The jury chose the submission by the New York architectural firm of Rodgers and Poor, and the Commission of Fine Arts concurred. The winning Art Deco-inspired design was a masonry shaft and base of approximately 60 feet set on a star-shaped foundation. The design implied ancient Egyptian motifs, an important source for Art Deco designs.</p> <h3>Construction</h3> <p>The Wills and Mafera Corporation of New York won the bid for general contractor of the monument. The North Carolina Granite Corporation of Mount Airy, North Carolina, received the contract to supply the granite.<br /> <br /> Construction began in December 1931 and was completed by November 1932.</p> <h3>Dedication</h3> <p>The monument was dedicated in December 1932-one month after completion.</p>",

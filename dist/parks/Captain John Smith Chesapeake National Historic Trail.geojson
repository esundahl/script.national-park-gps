These unusual conifers shed their feathery leaves in the fall. In winter, their gray, shreddy bark distinguishes bald cypress from other deciduous trees. A small, wooden boardwalk snakes around these relics of the past. Distinctive, knobby cypress \"knees\" emerge from the water near the boardwalk.</p> <p>On spring mornings, visitors are serenaded by birds such as the golden-colored Prothonotary warbler and the ground-foraging Louisiana waterthrush. In late summer, visitors can enjoy splashes of color provided by cardinal-flower and the threatened red turtlehead (Chelone obliqua). In the evening, one may also hear the quick trill of the arboreal gray treefrog. Visitors can enjoy several hiking trails that lead through the property.</p> <p>Battle Creek Cypress Swamp encompasses about 100 acres of cypress swamp and surrounding upland woods. It was purchased in 1977 by The Nature Conservancy and is currently leased and operated by Calvert County Parks and Recreation. The special habitat at Battle Creek was recognized as a National Natural Landmark in 1965.</p>",

An economic hub of its own, Sotterley's wharf on the Patuxent River saw the export of tobacco, corn, and lumber produced by the enslaved population of the plantation. Ships arrived into the port carrying captive Africans alongside luxury goods from Europe. Managed by a succession of powerful owners, the plantation's income eventually collapsed with the outlawing of slavery in 1864. The buildings and garden have since been restored, and today the site operates as an educational organization with National Historic Landmark status. Sotterley seeks to engage visitors with the challenging realities of our history, cultivating a respect for the past and the natural environment. </p> <h3>Visit Historic Sotterley </h3> Find detailed information about Historic Sotterley on their website: <a href=\"https://sotterley.org/\">Historic Sotterley Home - Sotterley</a><br /> <br /> <u><strong>Address:</strong></u> 44300 Sotterley Ln.

The museum stands on land once owned by Captain Elijah Reed. In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, Reed sailed to the Chesapeake Bay from Maine and set up residence and a small menhaden fishery along the creek. There he introduced a method of extracting large quantities of oil from the fish to be used as a lubricant and in lighting, and the leftover bones and carcasses were used as meal and valuable fertilizer. The menhaden fishing industry brought tremendous wealth to Northumberland County and the town of Reedville, which was once known as the wealthiest town in the United States, due to its large income produced by the menhaden industry.<br /> <br /> Today, the property is home to the William Walker House, which represents a waterman’s home during the 1800s. This location was the first home of the museum but has now expanded to include a standalone museum and gift shop, a boat shop, model shop, pilot house and several vessel exhibits, two of which are on the National Registry of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> The museum hosts a collection of artifacts, items and historical materials that document and explore the history of fishing in the region, dating from early American Indian practices to modern-day oystermen.

The town of Seaford is located along the Nanticoke River, just beyond the point that John Smith and his crew reached during their 1608 voyage. The local Kuskarawaok people, known today as the Nanticoke, approached the English cautiously but eventually traded with them and exchanged information. This history and more is on display at the Seaford Museum. <br /> <br /> The museum's exhibits follow a timeline, beginning with the region's natural resources. The Indigenous peoples of the area are introduced. Following the development of the city, exhibits explore the agricultural, shipbuilding, and textile industries. From an antique ketchup bottle to a female mob boss more nefarious than Bonnie & Clyde, the Seaford Museum is full of intrigue and surprises. </p> <p> </p> <h3>Information for visitors:</h3> <h4>Hours</h4> <p>Regular Hours:</p> <p> Every Friday: 1:00 - 4:00 p.m.</p> <p> 1st & 2nd Saturday & Sunday of each month: 1:00 – 4:00 p.m.</p> <p> Check the <a href=\"https://www.seafordhistoricalsociety.com/events/\">calendar</a> for additional details.</p> <h4>Tickets & Tours</h4> <p>Tickets: $7 per adult, children 12 and under and Members free.<br /> Combo Tickets for Museum and Ross Mansion are $12.<br /> <a href=\"https://www.seafordhistoricalsociety.com/visit/gov-ross-mansion/\">Learn more about the Governor Ross Mansion.</a><br /> Self-guided tour time: 1 - 2 hours. <br /> To schedule a tour outside of regular hours, call (302) 628-9828 or email admin@seafordhistoricalsociety.com at least 48 hours in advance of desired appointment time.</p> <h4>Parking:</h4> <p>Free parking in lot on east side of museum.<br /> We recommend RV’s and busses park on Conwell St.<br /> The Museum is handicapped accessible.</p>",

        "notes": "Tangier Island\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/tangier-island.htm\n\n<h2>A Small Island With a Storied Past</h2> <p>Tangier is a low-lying island, barely visible above the expansive waters of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chba/index.htm\">Chesapeake Bay</a>. However, this small island is home to a community of watermen and women whose ancestors have lived here since colonial times. Surprising stories emerge from the island's history, from the Native Americans who came here to hunt and fish to the enslaved African Americans who escaped to the island to find their freedom. </p> <h2>Visiting Tangier</h2> <p>Tangier Island is only accesible by private boat or ferry. Catch a ferry from one of these locations:<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/onancock-marina.htm\">Onancock</a>, Virginia (Eastern Shore)<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/reedville-fisherman-s-museum.htm\">Reedville</a>, Virginia (Western Shore)<br /> Chrisfield, Maryland (Eastern Shore)<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.tangierisland-va.com/transportation/\">Find detailed information about ferry rides here.</a><br /> <br /> Visit the <a href=\"https://www.tangierisland-va.com/\">Tangier Island website</a> for a comprehensive guide to travel, lodging, ammenities, and activities available on the island. <br /> <br /> Learn about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tangier-island-history-museum.htm\">TANGIER ISLAND HISTORY MUSEUM</a> here. </p> <h2>Tangier's History</h2> <h3>Native Americans on Tangier</h3> <p>Shell middens, or waste piles of oyster shells, and many stone points discovered on the island reveal that Indigenous peoples visited Tangier Island. They likely came here to take advantage of the summer's rich bounty of fish and shellfish.The Pocomoke people of the Bay's Eastern Shore were among the groups that could have traveled here. They would have reached the offshore island in dugout canoes, the largest of which could reach 70 feet long. </p> <h3>Colonial Settlement</h3> <p>Among the first Europeans to observe the island, John Smith and his crew spotted Tangier and its neighboring islands during their voyage throughout the Bay in the summer of 1608. With a penchant for naming the places he visited, Smith called the islands the Russell Isles, after a member of his crew, Doctor Russell. As early as the 1670s, colonists held patents to the island, which they primarily used to graze livestock. A century later, the first permanent residents arrived on the island. At first they made their living by farming, but fishing, crabbing, and oystering soon took over as their primary occupation. </p> <h3>War of 1812</h3> <p>For nearly 1,000 slaves during the War of 1812, Tangier Island was a fortress of salvation, and the place where they took their first free steps. Fort Albion, named after the ancient name for England and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/george-cockburn.htm\">Commodore George Cockburn</a>’s flagship, was constructed on the island in 1814 to serve two major functions: as a central base to sustain continued British attacks along the Chesapeake, and as a depot for receiving runaway American slaves into citizenship and service to His Majesty, King George III of England.</p> <p>Using America’s slaves against itself was not a novel idea – the British successfully employed this war tactic during the Revolutionary War. However, in the War of 1812, American slaves were considered free British citizens as soon as they set foot on British soil (which included forts and vessels), as slavery was illegal in all British territories. The new recruits remained neither American nor enslaved in the eyes of the British. Some slaves stole boats or canoes and met British troops directly; others started fires to get the attention of British soldiers for rescue. In some cases, these slaves took up arms as part of an active offense, while in others they simply took the opportunity presented by the British to escape bondage.</p> <p>As early as 1813, British army and navy officers were instructed to “provide shelter, protection, and evacuation to refugees.” <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alexander-cochrane.htm\">Admiral Alexander Cochrane</a> formalized the policy in April 1814, with a <a href=\"http://www.novascotia.ca/nsarm/virtual/africanns/archives.asp?ID=70\">proclamation</a> offering the “choice of either entering into His Majesty’s Sea or Land Forces, or of being sent as FREE Settlers to the British Possessions in North America or the West Indies.”</p> <p>With an anticipated influx of new recruits, the Royal Navy needed a new base. Tangier Island provided an easy access point in the Chesapeake to the Upper and Lower Bays, as well as the Potomac, Washington and Baltimore, while being surrounded by slaves in the plantation country of Virginia and Maryland. Fort Albion included a barracks, a hospital, a church, family dwellings and gardens, meant to accommodate not just prospective soldiers, but the families they brought with them as well. From its earliest inception, Fort Albion was conceived not just as a place for military training, but a place which would be a temporary home for newly freed Britons.</p> <p>Tangier Island was not employed long; the War of 1812 ended less than a year after Fort Albion was built, on February 17, 1815. As the British withdrew, Cockburn ordered that “on no account [is] a Single Negro [to] be left, except by his own request,” fully embracing the status of the former slaves – whether in service or not – as free subjects of the British Empire. On March 21, 1815, the evacuation of the British from the island was completed, and Fort Albion and its barracks were burned. Former slaves were sent as soldiers and citizens to settle British colonies in the Caribbean and Canada.</p> <p>Between the fort’s intentional destruction and subsequent unintentional destruction by storms and floods common in the Chesapeake, nothing remains of Fort Albion today. Much of Tangier Island where it stood has eroded, leaving a sandy beach reminiscent of those that slaves saw as they set foot on the island, in search of freedom.</p>",

Like Smith Island in Maryland, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tangier-island.htm\">Tangier Island</a> has been a fishing community for hundreds of years.Today, the island remains a vibrant watermen community and receives hundreds of tourists every year seeking stunning views of the Chesapeake Bay and a taste of the island's unique culture and history.</p> <h2>Small island, big history</h2> <p>Native Americans utilized the Chesapeake's islands, including Tangier, as evidenced by plentiful stone points visible along their shores. John Smith and his crew were among the first Europeans to visit the island, catching sight of it during their 1608 explorations of the region. Smith named Tangier and its neighboring islands the \"Russell Isles,\" after Doctor Russell, a member of his crew. The island's first settlers in the 1700s relied on farming for their occupation, but over the next century, harvesting seafood became the more lucrative profession. During the War of 1812, the British built Fort Albion on Tangier Island and used it as a staging area for battles further inland. Several enslaved African Americans escaped to Tangier Island and were given their freedom by the British. Some joined the Corps of Colonial Marines, an all-black unit who fought against the Americans. </p> <h2>Visiting the museum</h2> <h4>Getting there</h4> <p>Tangier Island is only accesible by private boat or ferry.

        "name": "The Thomas Stone House",
        "notes": "The Thomas Stone House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-mansion-at-haberdeventure.htm\n\n<p>One of the more unique features at Thomas Stone’s plantation of Haberdeventure is the curved five-part house. While parts of the house are original to Thomas Stone’s lifetime, fire damage, renovation, and modernization have changed the structure.</p> <p>Thomas Stone purchased the 442-acre property from his uncle, Daniel Jenifer, on December 13, 1770. Construction of the house's brick Central Block began in the spring of 1771. The following year, Thomas and his family likely took up residence even though the work was incomplete.</p> <p>The Central Block’s first floor comprises the Center Passage along with the East and West Rooms. The second floor had two large rooms that would have served as bed chambers.</p> <h4>Center Passage</h4> <p>Upon entering the Center Passage, guests could see a large and attractive stairway, expensive portraits, and decorative rooms to the left and right, which provided clues to the wealth and status of the Stones. With doors at each end, this breezeway may have been one of the house's most comfortable rooms during the spring, summer, and fall.</p> <h4>West Room</h4> <p>The West Room is believed to be the Master Bedchamber. Ornate first floor bedchambers in colonial era homes often served the dual purposes of being daytime or informal parlors. In the case of Margaret Stone, who developed a debilitating case of arthritis that often turned her into an invalid, she likely did not receive many guests but could converse with her family on her better days.</p> <p>While there is no supporting evidence, the lifestyles of slave owning gentry of the time suggests that an enslaved African American may have slept either on the floor of the West Room or in the adjacent Center Passage, to be readily available to care for the family's needs both night and day.</p> <h4>East Room</h4> <p>It is evident this room was used for entertaining. Contrary to modern and romanticized visions of colonial era homes, most were not elegant and pristine. Few colonial homes had rooms as beautiful as Thomas Stone's East Room. The expensive furnishing and window coverings and the well crafted woodwork were designed to impress guests, and even though this woodwork is a reconstruction of the original it still shows the detail that was put into the work.</p> <p>Aside from its beauty, the East Room may have served a more important function. With only one doorway, the room could provide privacy for Thomas Stone as he performed his legal and political duties along with directing county defense activities during the American Revolution. In Maryland’s heavily class-based society, the elegance of the East Room emphasized the importance, power, and success of Thomas Stone and justified his role as a leading figure in the community.</p> <h4>Second Floor</h4> <p>The purpose of the second floor was to serve as bed chambers, not just for Thomas and Margaret Stone’s three children. Upon Thomas's father's and eldest brother's deaths in 1773, Thomas permitted some of his younger brothers and sisters to live in the home. Also, as a host to law clients, political allies, several siblings and their families, distant relations, and countless friends, Stone was expected to provide places for everyone to sleep. </p> <p>Crowded homes were quite common in the colonial era. Rooms were hot and stuffy in the summer and drafty and cold in the winter. Privacy by modern standards barely existed. Even George Washington referred to his mansion of Mount Vernon as a “well-restored tavern.”</p> <h4>West Hyphen</h4> <p>The adjoining West Hyphen was built during Thomas Stone’s ownership to connect to the West Wing, which served as a kitchen for the Stones. This Hyphen may have served as a multi-use space with easily moved furnishings to allow dining, indoor chores and crafts, entertaining, and possibly to serve as a guest chamber.</p> <h4>West Wing</h4> <p>The original West Wing kitchen space is believed to have been a small and relatively unadorned structure designed for the function of cooking, cleaning, and other household chores by enslaved workers. The current West Wing, which partially rests upon the original foundations, dates from the mid-1840s. There are two rooms on the first floor and a steep stairway that leads to two more rooms above. In 1846, William Briscoe Stone remarked in a letter to his daughter Mary that the West Wing was, “…much enlarged improved & amended. I am certain you will be surprised and pleased with the change.\"<br /> <br /> During the 20th-century, the residents redesigned the West Hyphen to create a connective hallway between the second floor of the Central Block and the West Wing. This modernization was removed by the National Park Service to help return the mansion to a more historical design.</p> <h4>East Hyphen</h4> <p>The East Hyphen was a unique space. Its primary function was to serve as a protective cover for the full cellar that existed beneath the Central Block. It is not connected in the same way as the West Hyphen is connected. In order to gain access to the space, one would have to go outside the house and enter from the outside. </p> <h4>East Wing</h4> <p>Architectural historians believe that the East Wing is the oldest part of the house. It was likely a wholly separate and independent structure moved from some other location on the plantation to serve as the East Wing. Like the East Hyphen, there was no internal connection from the Central Block to the East Wing. One had to exit the mansion, walk across the lawn, and then enter the East Wing. </p>",

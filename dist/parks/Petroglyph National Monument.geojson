You've hiked 2 tenths of a mile or .32 kilometers.<br /> <br /> The landscape of this canyon formed about 200,000 years ago with a series of volcanic fissure eruptions. The first two eruptions yielded extensive amounts of lava which flowed naturally downslope, east towards what is now the Rio Grande Valley. The following eruptions produced thicker lava flows, eventually blocking the volcanic vents and allowing lava to accumulate, creating the volcanic cinder cones. Today, this 17-mile volcanic escarpment is known as Albuquerque's West Mesa.<br /> <br /> The volcanic rock produced by the eruptions is a metal-rich, igneous rock known as basalt. Sometimes, basalt has many little holes in it called vesicles. Vesicular basalt is made from gasses escaping the lava before it cools and hardens. Over time, the exposed surface of basalt darkens in color due to precipitation, extreme temperatures, airborne particles, and microorganisms which collectively cause the metals and minerals to oxidize or rust. This thin layer of oxidation is called desert varnish.<br /> <br /> Petroglyphs were made by removing this thin layer of desert varnish from basalt -- to learn more about the process of making petroglyphs and of the people who created them, continue hiking .14 miles or .22 kilometers to stop 2.",

You have hiked .34 miles, or .55 kilometers.<br /> <br /> Most of these petroglyphs were made by the ancestors of today’s Pueblo peoples. The Ancestral Puebloans used hand-held stone tools to remove the desert varnish, exposing the lighter color of the basalt’s interior. After centuries of weathering, older petroglyphs began oxidizing and this darkening confirms their authenticity and great age.<br /> <br /> Archeologists refer to these images as being made in the Rio Grande style. This style developed rather suddenly around the year 1300, coinciding with a dramatic increase in the local population and the construction of many pueblo villages along the Rio Grande River. Elements frequently seen in Rio Grande style images include human figures, animals, and geometric designs.<br /> <br /> Why were these petroglyphs made? Continue 500 yards to Stop 3 to hear more.",

Some possible reasons are based on cultural and spiritual beliefs, like that volcanic landscapes are sacred spaces. Other reasons may include marking trade routes, recording a specific event, or simply communicating through imagery. The Ancestral Puebloans did not use a written language, so it is likely that some of these petroglyphs were used as symbols for communication.<br /> <br /> Many who visit this landscape wonder what these petroglyphs mean or are supposed to represent.

You have now hiked half a mile, or .85 kilometers.<br /> <br /> Identification of some petroglyphs is based on interpretations by today’s Pueblo people, or the descendants of the Ancestral Puebloans. We cannot say for certain what the images represent, nor is it appropriate for Pueblo people to reveal the meaning of an image to others. Pueblo nations have differed meanings and any single image may have complex ore multiple meanings based on its context.<br /> <br /> Most petroglyph images in the park are dated by relative dating techniques. For example, the design elements on petroglyphs can be compared to previously dated pottery, or Ancestral Puebloan murals. These murals had colorful painted images on the plaster walls of subterranean ceremonial rooms known as kivas. Most of the mural images were created after the year 1300, suggesting that new ideas were beginning to emerge in Pueblo culture. This can be contributed to an influx of new groups traveling through or settling in the Rio Grande Valley. The results of relative dating reveal many of these petroglyphs were created approximately 400-700 years ago.<br /> <br /> To learn more about these cultural transitions and other ancestral groups in the Rio Grande Valley, continue to Stop 5 located 100 yards from here.",

From the parking lot a sandy path follows the northern escarpment, carrying you over sand dunes. As you walk into the canyon, the sounds and sights of the city fade away and may be replaced with the coo of a mourning dove or a collared lizard sunning itself on a basalt boulder. Here you see prehistoric and historic petroglyphs, rock wall alignments and shelters, and wildlife living in the vegetation growing throughout the canyon.<br /> <br /> The geology of the area shows the remnants of volcanic eruptions of 200,000 years ago. The basalt from these flows capped the sandstone of the Santa Fe Formation. As the softer sandstone eroded away, the basalt broke off and tumbled down the hillside. This naturally occurring geologic action of weathering and erosion formed the volcanic escarpment as we see it today and is also where the Ancestral Pueblo People carved petroglyphs.<br /> <br /> The Rinconada Canyon trail follows the northern escarpment, allowing the hiker views of a variety of petroglyphs. The trail is 1.1 miles long to the back of the canyon (2.2 miles roundtrip) and is moderately strenuous.<br /> <br /> As with any hiking in the park, or the desert Southwest, carry plenty of water and drink often.

The answer is to protect visitors like you, the archaeological resources, and the animals that call this canyon home. In 2013, the westside of Albuquerque, including Rinconada Canyon, experienced a storm unlike anything else in over 100 years. This microburst dislodged boulders and washed away a large portion of the original trail. The National Park Service took this opportunity to re-align a trail that increased visitor safety and resource protection. It was also an opportunity to better protect the native plant and wildlife habitats of the canyon.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ee04c88a-95f9-4e42-b291-316172369405}{199}\" paraid=\"1501491488\">Post and cable, signs, and messaging informs visitors stay on the official trail. Although Petroglyph does not have any backcountry or wilderness, it’s still easy to get lost, which can lead to injury, dehydration, and/or heatstroke or hypothermia. Going off-trail damages the natural resources and will lead to a citation.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ee04c88a-95f9-4e42-b291-316172369405}{223}\" paraid=\"1429921153\">Thank you for staying on the trail.

This means we have a specific range of plants and animals that can survive here. What are some animals you have noticed so far? Common species at Rinconada include New Mexico whiptail lizards, leopard lizards, desert millipedes, Pinacate “stink” beetles, roadrunners, turkey vultures, cottontail rabbits, and coyotes. Each of these animals have unique adaptations to survive in the desert. Each is beneficial to the ecosystem and contributes to the landscape you see today.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{fa8d15a4-8dcf-4b54-890c-b3dbd9a06133}{56}\" paraid=\"1006355841\">Let’s start small: the desert millipedes you might see after a summer monsoon rain are the desert’s best decomposers. In the typical hot, dry conditions of the desert, organic matter takes much longer to decompose. Millipedes are detritivores, earth’s natural recyclers. They feed on plants and animals that have died, which recycles nutrients back into the soil much faster than waiting for the plant or animal to decompose in this arid environment. This is very important for the survival of living plants and animals because the sandy soils in Petroglyph tend to have very few nutrients.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{fa8d15a4-8dcf-4b54-890c-b3dbd9a06133}{80}\" paraid=\"1033694287\">Another common species throughout the Monument is the New Mexico whiptail lizard. They are easily identifiable because of their bright turquoise-blue tail. They have black and yellow vertical stripes down the length of its back that fades into the tail. They can grow up to 6 to 9 inches or 15 to 22 centimeters in length and they have the longest tail to body ratio of any lizard in the desert southwest. New Mexico whiptails are the official state reptile of the Land of Enchantment. An interesting fact about New Mexico whiptails is that all of them are females. This species reproduces through a process called parthenogenesis. This means there are no males in the population and all individuals are genetically identical.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{fa8d15a4-8dcf-4b54-890c-b3dbd9a06133}{176}\" paraid=\"1042843977\">Finally, you might see one or more coyotes on the mesa top, depending on the time of day. Coyotes are an important species that help maintain balance in the ecosystem by keeping small mammal populations under control, which can spread disease if unchecked. They maintain hydration from the prey they eat but will occasionally eat prickly pear cactus fruit for extra hydration and nourishment. Coyotes are natives of the southwest desert but have expanded throughout the North American continent. They can easily adapt to harsh environments and take advantage and thrive in urban areas. </p>",

At the last stop, we learned about some of the animals that call Petroglyph home. As you walk, you will see many of the unique plants that thrive in this environment. One of the most common sightings here is the prickly pear cactus, identified by its’ flat pads and dark-purple pear-like fruit. The pads and fruits of these cacti supplemented the diet of the Ancestral Puebloans. Today, the sweet fruits – called “tunas” - are boiled and used in jams, candies, and syrups.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9773dfb2-964a-4588-8ca0-12c2314ae013}{61}\" paraid=\"1475200036\">Other common native vegetation throughout Rinconada Canyon includes sumac, sand sage, four-wing saltbush, rabbitbrush, purple aster, broom dalea, globemallow, soapweed yucca, snakeweed, and juniper. Each of these species have developed adaptations in order to survive and reproduce in this dry climate. For example, the sumac is commonly found growing in arroyos where its deep tap roots have access to moist soil.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9773dfb2-964a-4588-8ca0-12c2314ae013}{111}\" paraid=\"1319923484\">Arroyos can be found throughout the southwest and can be mistaken as trails. They resemble riverbeds that are dry most of the year. Only during heavy rainstorms do arroyos flood with water and channel it along a certain route, usually bringing much needed moisture to plants along the way. The arroyos at Rinconada Canyon channel stormwater runoff from the escarpment east towards the Rio Grande River. Continue to the next stop to learn more about the Rio Grande Valley.  </p>",

The Rio Grande River and the Sandia Mountains may appear far away from where you are standing, but they are connected to Rinconada Canyon by a huge regional feature: the Rio Grande Rift.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9773dfb2-964a-4588-8ca0-12c2314ae013}{193}\" paraid=\"1289203485\">The Rio Grande Rift is one of the few examples of rift zones on Earth today. Rifts are areas of stretching, where the Earth’s crust is pulling apart and getting thinner. Here, the crust is being stretched East to West. This stretching caused a rift that starts in Southern Colorado and runs South through the middle of New Mexico. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9773dfb2-964a-4588-8ca0-12c2314ae013}{225}\" paraid=\"2022408526\">The formation of the Rio Grande Rift began around 30 million years ago and has dramatically changed the landscape in that time. When rifts occur, the sides of the rift go up to form mountains, while the middle drops down to form valleys. The Sandia mountains you see to the east are the eastern edge of the Rio Grande Rift, where granite over 1 billion years old and limestone from 300-million-year-old seas have been pushed up into the sky by the force of the rift. Meanwhile, the valley where Albuquerque sits dropped down away from the rising mountains. Petroglyph National Monument sits near the middle of the Rio Grande Rift. Another impact of this large-scale stretching was the formation of cracks in the Earth that follow the North-South pattern of the Rift. These cracks allowed magma to bubble up to the surface and create the line of volcanoes that formed the West Mesa. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4e71f778-f78a-4b72-b920-8d5462337ca5}{26}\" paraid=\"1402981316\">Without the Rio Grande Rift, there would be no volcanoes here. And with no volcanoes, there would be no basalt boulders. Without the basalt boulders, there would be no petroglyphs. The story of Petroglyph National Monument is and always has been one of humans, animals, plants, and geologic forces interacting in an ever-evolving landscape. </p>",

Between 250,000 and 100,000 years ago these volcanoes had six distinct eruptions and cumulatively the lava flows they produced formed the West Mesa. The lava has long since cooled into a rock called basalt, which forms the cliffside to your right. Looking at some of the larger boulders that are visible along the trail you might notice distinct layers within the rock, showcasing the different layers of the lava flows. You might also notice the holes on the surfaces of the rocks, called vesicles, which were left behind by trapped gases as the lava cooled. The basalt has a dark surface color now, but the original surface was actually a light grey color. As the rock ages, it forms a layer of patina, or desert varnish, which forms due to microorganisms living on the surface in combination with the oxidation of the manganese and iron rich minerals, giving it the boulders the distinctive dark color we see today.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{2b90a635-8719-473e-aa97-9532788b6dd6}{109}\" paraid=\"211432972\">At the next stop, you will learn more about the forces of nature that formed the landscape you are hiking in today. </p>",

While volcanoes had a major impact on the creation of this canyon, they are only one of the geologic forces that created the environment you see today. Erosion, or the process of breaking down rocks into smaller particles, is just as much part of this land’s story as the volcanoes.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2b90a635-8719-473e-aa97-9532788b6dd6}{207}\" paraid=\"659793635\">As you walk, you may notice that the sand beneath your feet is tan, a different color than the gray to black basalt of the escarpment. This is because the sand is not from the basalt, but from sediments of much softer rocks that traveled far from the West in the Rio Puerco watershed before settling at Rinconada Canyon. Most of the transport of this fine material occurs due to strong winds carrying the particles across the desert. </p> <p paraeid=\"{2b90a635-8719-473e-aa97-9532788b6dd6}{251}\" paraid=\"753185143\">However, wind is not the only force of erosion in this arid environment. Occasional floods, typically from mid-summer monsoon rains, can transport large amounts of sediment and rock in a matter of minutes. The record of these floods can be seen in gullies and washes along the Rinconada Canyon Trail. Looking across the canyon, you may see another indicator of sediments carried by water. Near the top of the mesa to the South, there are fan-shaped piles of sediment widening as they go towards the base of the mesa. These aptly named “alluvial fans” show how sediments spread out as they are deposited by flowing water. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f4fbc708-4b4b-434a-a6ff-c1a612932df8}{30}\" paraid=\"1510349822\">Despite the evidence of water-driven sediment transport in Rinconada Canyon, the canyon itself was not primarily carved by flowing water. The size and shape of the canyon was made by the flow of lava from volcanoes. So why did the lava not fill in all of the canyon? This is due to a phenomenon known as “Inverse Topography”. Inverse Topography refers to places where geologists can determine the presence and shape of now-eroded landforms based on what is left behind. Since lava did not fill in the whole canyon, we can conclude that there was a hill blocking the lava’s path at the time the volcanoes erupted, forcing the lava to go around it and create the outline of the canyon we have today. That hill was made of softer rock and has eroded away since the time of the eruptions, leaving only empty space and a scenic canyon behind. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f4fbc708-4b4b-434a-a6ff-c1a612932df8}{100}\" paraid=\"834957114\">Now that you’ve learned about the geologic history of Rinconada Canyon, next you will learn about and see evidence of the human interaction in this sacred place.  </p>",

If you look to your right, you will see some well-defined petroglyphs. What do they look like to you? Identification of some petroglyphs is based on interpretation by today’s Pueblo people. We cannot say for certain what all the images represent, nor is it appropriate for modern Pueblos to reveal the meaning of many petroglyphs to others. Pueblo nations have differing opinions on meanings and any single image may have complex or multiple meanings based on its context.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8c9e17ce-b2ad-475d-ba02-094d531dccf0}{91}\" paraid=\"1083507361\">For example, the one on the left has been interpreted as a type of bird, possibly a hummingbird with its accentuated long beak compared to its small body. Several species of hummingbirds can be found in the Monument and are common symbols in southwest pottery and jewelry. Another interpretation is a bird taking or letting go of a breath. Some Indigenous cultures believe that every living, breathing creature has a life breath or breath line, which takes something from the earth as they breathe in and gives it back as they breathe out. This could be the bird’s breath line.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8c9e17ce-b2ad-475d-ba02-094d531dccf0}{111}\" paraid=\"679173768\">Next to it, there is another petroglyph, most likely a stone tool. Hand-held stone tools were used by the Ancestral Puebloans to carefully remove the thin layer of desert varnish from the basalt boulders, exposing the lighter color underneath. This method provides the contrast between the base rock and the underlying surface, allowing petroglyphs to be visible for centuries.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8c9e17ce-b2ad-475d-ba02-094d531dccf0}{131}\" paraid=\"683914112\">Continue a short distance to the next stop, where you will learn about some of the threats facing these valuable cultural treasures. </p>",

Before the Monument was established and the area protected, the West Mesa was seen by many residents of the growing city as little more than a place to shoot guns, using the large boulders, and even the sacred petroglyphs, as targets. As you walk through Rinconada and other areas in the Monument, you will see the circular bullet scars left by these vandals. They are reminders of the permanent damage done to these finite treasures.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6f003966-3f3e-4c65-bfd8-91127396a7be}{46}\" paraid=\"2048656777\">Today, the most significant threat to petroglyphs is graffiti. Along with bullet scars, you will see names, lines, and modern symbols hastily scratched into the rocks, left by people eager to “leave their mark,” without fully understanding the damage they are causing to this sacred site. Unfortunately, authentic images are forever damaged as there are no long-term reliable ways to cover up or remove modern vandalism. Attempts to remove graffiti usually end up causing more damage. The Monument does, however, keep detailed records of each incident of vandalism and will prosecute violators under federal laws such as the Archaeological Resource Protection Act. To report resource violations, such as graffiti, please call the Information Center at (505) 899-0205 or the Archaeological Resources Protection Hotline at 800-227-7286.  </p>",

This stop includes information about historic petroglyphs and inscriptions. Feel free to continue hiking along the trail as you listen to this in-depth history. </p> <p paraeid=\"{36c89d8a-843a-4675-8a63-dfefe1665e24}{162}\" paraid=\"1216060605\">In contrast to the modern graffiti you saw at the previous stop, these inscriptions are examples of what the National Park Service refers to as “historic graffiti.” Historic graffiti must be at least 50 years old and must contribute to the history of the national park unit. These inscriptions meet both requirements. We are charged with interpreting the stories from the past, which includes this one of the railroad workers that visited Rinconada Canyon. </p> <p paraeid=\"{36c89d8a-843a-4675-8a63-dfefe1665e24}{220}\" paraid=\"1843676805\">In 1994, a park ranger interviewed Bud Buday, Victor’s brother. Bud revealed the story of his older brother’s and Mr. Thorpe’s inscriptions… It was a Friday afternoon when two friends, Millard Thorpe and Victor Buday who worked for the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad company, decided to trudge across the Rio Grande to hunt for rabbits and snakes. After exploring the area and looking at several petroglyphs, time escaped them as the sun began to set. They decided it was too dark and too dangerous to head back to town, so they spent the night in the canyon. On Saturday morning, the railroad workers decided that they too would leave their marks on the boulders. This task proved painstakingly daunting as carving their names and dates in the volcanic rock with stone tools took all day long. Again, they ran out of daylight to make it back to town safely. They concluded that they had to spend a second night in the canyon. At daylight on Sunday morning, they began making the trek back to town, trudging across the waist-deep Rio Grande and arrived home safely.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{36c89d8a-843a-4675-8a63-dfefe1665e24}{234}\" paraid=\"1610045963\">This interview validated the fact that petroglyphs take hours to make by someone with an extensive amount of patience and devotion. This is contrary to those who opposed the creation of this monument and claimed that all the petroglyphs were made by boys in the 1950s, implying that the petroglyphs lacked authentic cultural integrity thus the monument should not exist.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{84bbe198-0040-4c46-a694-6e5303fa1647}{95}\" paraid=\"798015402\">Millard Thorpe’s and Victor Buday’s inscriptions of Feb. 22, 1919 coincides with the railroad history in Albuquerque, NM. Their story is further validated by the numbers in the date ‘1919’ which reveal a writing technique that is indicative of a turn-of-the-century writing style. Due to the historical context of these findings, these inscriptions meet the National Park Service criteria for historic graffiti and are protected as historic resources.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{84bbe198-0040-4c46-a694-6e5303fa1647}{195}\" paraid=\"1441091610\">Rinconada Canyon also features petroglyphs from the Spaniards. The Spaniards arrived in 1598 and drastically disrupted the Pueblo people’s traditional way of life. Their conquest of what is now New Mexico sought to claim territory for the Spanish crown and to spread Christianity. This newly introduced religion was imposed upon the Pueblo people living along the Rio Grande valley and sparked centuries of conflict between the two cultures. The presence of Spanish crosses next to traditional Puebloan petroglyphs convey the differences between these two cultures. </p> <p paraeid=\"{87829a74-bee1-41ea-8b5f-e0032aac1a0d}{22}\" paraid=\"1034546238\">Elements of Spanish colonial settlement throughout the 1700s are evident in petroglyphs. Sheep and livestock brand images reflect how the Spanish used and settled in this land. Rinconada Canyon borders the northern boundary of the historic Atrisco Land Grant. The Spanish land grant system introduced a new concept of land ownership versus land stewardship to the region. Spanish landowners used the grasslands of these canyons and mesa tops for grazing their sheep and other livestock. They left behind evidence of low stone walls that served as corrals to protect their livestock from wildlife predators. Livestock introduced by the Spanish became a staple in Indigenous cultures. Sheep provided wool for woven textiles and meat as a food source. The blending of Hispanic and Indigenous cultural practices persists in New Mexico and contributes to the cultural diversity of our State.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{87829a74-bee1-41ea-8b5f-e0032aac1a0d}{172}\" paraid=\"1214021512\">As you walk to the next stop, imagine how difficult it was for early people to traverse this landscape and how these symbols capture the culture of these early residents.  </p>",

The concentration of petroglyphs becomes denser as you move towards the back of the canyon. Archaeologists refer to these images as being made in the Rio Grande style. This style developed rather suddenly around the year 1300, coinciding with a dramatic increase in the local population and the construction of many pueblo villages in the Rio Grande valley. Elements frequently seen in the Rio Grande style include human figures, animals, and geometric designs. In addition, Rio Grande style petroglyphs often incorporate the three-dimensional attributes of the rocks that the image is carved into. The mask petroglyph on the corner of the boulder in front of you is an excellent example of incorporating the 3D attributes of the rock. Another example of using the natural features of the rock is how the air bubbles can be used as facial features such as eyes, nose, or a mouth.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4255cf6b-5f03-41c0-91f7-a38dca31b751}{124}\" paraid=\"216606303\">While there are over 20,000 petroglyphs carved along the 17-mile or 27.3 kilometers volcanic escarpment, the Ancestral Puebloans did not live here. They lived in multi-storied adobe villages along the Rio Grande River, approximately 2 miles or 3.2 kilometers east of Rinconada Canyon. Between the years 1300 and 1540, approximately 15 pueblos were built on both the east and west banks of the Rio Grande River between Bernalillo and Belen, a distance of about 40 miles or 64.3 kilometers. Archaeologists estimate that populations ranged from 100 – 600 people in each of these pueblos. </p>",

They compare the style, content, and execution of petroglyphs to those of surrounding areas. They also compare designs with other, similar imagery on pottery or painted murals with known ages. The superimposition of one petroglyph over another provides another means of relative dating. Archaeologists used relative dating methods along the escarpment and arrived at the conclusion that the oldest petroglyphs were created as far back as 3,000 years ago. The practice of creating petroglyphs was adopted by the Spanish colonists and continued throughout the 1700s.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ee04c88a-95f9-4e42-b291-316172369405}{57}\" paraid=\"1103539209\">For example, grazing sheep are portrayed in the petroglyph on the western end of the canyon. We know for certain that sheep, a non-native species, were brought by the Spanish settlers in the 1600s. With this information we can safely say that this petroglyph was made after the year 1600. What we cannot confirm is whether it was carved by an Ancestral Puebloan or a Spaniard, as by this time both cultures were creating petroglyphs.  </p>",

On April 10, the Confederate cavalry that remained with the army surrendered their weapons along the Richmond-Lynchburg Stage Road northeast of the village. The following day, Federal troops took possession of the Confederate artillery east of the Appomattox River. April 12 witnessed the stacking of arms of the Confederate infantry along the Stage Road. Given temporary command of the First Division of the Fifth Corps, Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain presided over the ceremony from this position. The 5,000 men under Chamberlain’s command stretched through the village along both sides of the Stage Road as nearly 22,000 Confederate infantry marched up the road one division at a time and stacked their arms. Chamberlain recalled, “we received them with the honors due to troops, at the shoulder and in silence.” John Gordon led the first Confederate troops into the village, and Chamberlain recorded that the soldiers on both sides demonstrated mutual respect during the ceremony.",

To ensure that Lee’s men were not mistaken for deserters or active combatants by other Confederate and Federal forces, Grant agreed to print parole passes that would allow each man to navigate safely through areas where the armies remained active. These passes allowed the paroled Confederates to secure free passage on board Federal trains and steamships, and they also permitted Lee’s men to draw rations from any Federal forces they encountered on the way home. On April 10, Federal soldiers set up printing presses in the Clover Hill Tavern and General George Sharpe oversaw the printing of approximately 30,000 passes in the span of about 30 hours. Once printed, the passes were distributed to Confederate officers who filled them out for the men they commanded.",

Bettie Love Stewart and her four children worked alongside Mary Ann and her three children as caretakers of the McLean home. In addition to cooking the family’s meals, they took care of the McLean children, maintained the house, and looked after the family’s animals. Emancipation brought a mixture of hope and uncertainty for formerly enslaved people in the wake of Lee’s surrender. Following the war, Bettie moved to Lynchburg with her husband, Henry, who worked as a brakeman on the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio Railroad. Her children went on to live in Lynchburg, New York, and Boston.<br /> <br /> For the enslaved people of Appomattox County, April 9, 1865 was Freedom Day. This was the first appearance of Federal troops in this part of Virginia, and following Lee’s surrender, Federal soldiers enforced the Emancipation Proclamation in Southside Virginia. As other U.S. forces restored Federal authority throughout the South, their arrival signaled freedom for those still held in bondage. When Major General Gordon Granger announced that all enslaved people in the state of Texas were to be freed on June 19, 1865, it signaled the end of slavery in formerly Confederate-held territory. That December, the 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment was ratified, putting a formal end to slavery in the United States.",

Lee and his generals determined to launch an attack the following morning to brush aside the Federal cavalry blocking the road to allow the army to continue its march. Lee hoped he could eventually outmarch Grant’s forces to the west so that he could take his army to the south into North Carolina, where another Confederate army under Gen. Joseph Johnston awaited. While Federal cavalry waited along the ridge west of the village, roughly 9,000 Confederate soldiers assembled along this farm lane which cut across the Stage Road. At dawn, Confederate cavalry surged forward from the right and captured a battery of artillery posted atop the ridge. Dismounted Federal cavalry contested the Confederate advance in a fighting withdrawal, slowly yielding ground to buy time for reinforcements to arrive. For a moment, the road appeared open, and Maj. Gen. Bryan Grimes notified Maj. Gen. Gordon that the army’s artillery and supply wagons could resume the westward march. After the withdrawal of the Federal cavalry, Gordon deployed most of his infantry in a line facing south to defend the road from Federal reinforcements approaching from that direction. The Confederates did not anticipate the arrival of Federal infantry to the west, but by mid-morning, a line of about 13,000 Federal infantry of the Army of the James launched an attack on Gordon’s right flank after assembling about a mile west of this position. Sheridan’s cavalry bought just enough time for Ord’s men to cut off Lee’s escape. As the Army of the James attacked from the west, the Fifth Corps under Maj. Gen. Charles Griffin approached the village from the south, further constricting Lee’s options.Upon the arrival of the Federal infantry, Gordon sent another message back to Lee, saying “I have fought my corps to a frazzle, and I fear I can do nothing unless I am heavily supported by Longstreet’s corps.” Longstreet could spare no help, however, as he braced for an impending attack from the Second and Sixth Corps of the Army of the Potomac three miles to the northeast. With Federal forces closing in on three sides and the James River to the north, Lee recognized that his army was trapped, stating, “there is nothing left for me to do but to go and see General Grant, and I would rather die a thousand deaths.” At approximately 10:00 A.M., Lee sent out flags of truce, requesting a ceasefire until he could meet with Grant.",

At the outbreak of the conflict, widow Elizabeth Kelley lived in this home with Lorenzo Kelley, one of her five sons. By the fall of 1862, all five of Kelley’s sons had enlisted in the Confederate Army. Leonard and Lorenzo Kelley died of disease in May and December of 1862, respectively, but the others survived the war. Although Lawrence Kelley deserted in December of 1862, Lawson Kelley remained with the Army of Northern Virginia in April of 1865 and was present at the surrender. Charles Kelley departed the Confederate hospital in Farmville five days before the surrender and may have witnessed the Confederate infantry stack their arms in the village on April 12. For many White, Southern families like the Kelleys, Lee’s surrender and the collapse of the Confederacy marked a bitter conclusion to a disastrous war.<br /> <br /> Though the war’s end brought grief and uncertainty to many White Southerners, it also brought the promise of hope to those who were formerly enslaved. In 1871, John Robinson purchased this home for his family. As an enslaved man, Robinson had been trained as a cobbler, and in the postwar years he applied his skills by operating his own shoemaking business out of this house. In addition to making shoes, Robinson became a founding member of Galilee Baptist Church, and he likely voted in an election that sent James Bland, an African American delegate, to the 1868 Virginia Constitutional Convention. Robinson’s trade skills likely provided him with greater societal opportunities than those available to formerly enslaved people who did not have a trade skill. In many cases, those who had worked in the fields while in bondage continued to work those same fields as free people through the systems of tenant farming and sharecropping. Emancipation signaled a landmark moment in the lives of freedpeople, but equality remained an unrecognized hope.",

In 1861, Appomattox County raised four companies of soldiers to swell the ranks of the Confederate army. 18-year-old Lafayette Meeks, whose family owned the Meeks Store, enlisted in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Virginia Cavalry in May of 1861, just days after Virginia declared its secession from the Union. Less than six months later, Meeks contracted typhoid fever and passed away. When Lafayette’s body was brought back to Appomattox Court House, his father Francis and mother Mariah buried him in this field near the family’s store, which also served as their home.

Lee refused this request, stating that the fates of the remaining Confederate armies would be up to Jefferson Davis and the other Confederate generals to decide.

Grant and General Robert E. Lee. Grant's Federal forces had surrounded Lee's Confederates, and after one last attempted breakthrough, Lee asked for terms of surrender. <br /> <br /> The commanders met in the parlor of the McLean home for about an hour and a half. Grant accepted Lee's surrender with generous terms designed to pacify the white southern population. Nearby, nine enslaved people realized that they were now free to live independently of the McLean family, with all of freedom's challenges and opportunities.<br /> <br /> In 1890, a Federal veteran from New York named Myron Dunlap purchased the McLean House for $10,000. When plans to move the house to Chicago for the World’s Columbian Exposition fell through, Dunlap made detailed plans of the house and dismantled it in 1893 with the intent of rebuilding it in Washington, D.C. The financial panic of 1893 bankrupted the primary stakeholder in Dunlap’s company, depriving the company of the capital needed to move the dismantled materials to Washington. For the next 47 years, the materials remained on site, left exposed to the elements and souvenir hunters, and when the National Park Service acquired the property in 1940, only the foundation and about 5,500 bricks remained. Surviving bricks were incorporated into the front wall on either side of the door. Although the building has been reconstructed, it provides an excellent representation of the structure that witnessed the surrender meeting between Lee and Grant in the spring of 1865.<br /> <br /> The reconstructed McLean House is open daily for visitors.",

After a grueling 90-mile retreat from Richmond and Petersburg, the Army of Northern Virginia marched into Appomattox County with Federal forces in close pursuit to the east and south. On the afternoon of April 8, Brig. Gen. Reuben Lindsay Walker led the Confederate reserve artillery, totaling approximately 100 guns, through the village along this road. Their next destination lay three miles to the southwest at a railroad depot known as Appomattox Station. Four trains filled with rations and supplies awaited Lee’s army at Appomattox Station, but a Federal cavalry division under Maj. Gen. George Custer dashed into the station and captured three of the trains before the Confederates could secure them. Shortly after being alerted of the Federal cavalry’s presence, Walker’s guns swung into action, and a battle ensued half a mile to the north of the train station. The Battle of Appomattox Station took place in the dark, between 8:00 and 10:00 P.M. amid dense terrain which was unsuited for both cavalry and artillery combat. After a series of charges, Custer’s cavalry prevailed, capturing around 1,000 Confederate prisoners and 25 pieces of artillery. Immediately following this engagement, a patrol of the 15<sup>th</sup> New York Cavalry led by Lt. Col. Augustus Root probed ahead along the Stage Road in search of the main body of the Army of Northern Virginia. As they made their way past the courthouse in the dark, Root’s men received a volley from the 5<sup>th</sup> Alabama Battalion, advancing from the east side of the village. Root was killed near the courthouse in the exchange of fire and the rest of the Federal patrol fell back up the road to report their findings.Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan dispersed portions of the Federal Cavalry Corps along the ridges to the west and south of Appomattox Court House and prepared to delay the Confederate retreat until reinforcements arrived. While Sheridan deployed his troopers, a column of 25,000 Federal infantry of the Army of the James and the Fifth Corps of the Army of the Potomac raced toward Appomattox Court House from the southwest. Maj. Gen. Edward O. C. Ord commanded the Army of the James, which included about 5,000 United States Colored Troops, and he urged his men onward, telling them that their “legs would win the day.” His men marched 30 miles on April 8 before stopping for a brief rest at midnight, just five miles from Appomattox Court House. After three hours of sleep, the army resumed its march, eager to cut off Lee’s final avenue of escape along the Stage Road.",

The park seeks to confirm, however, if this house was built before the Civil War, or afterwards. The building was Greek Revival in style, which gained popularity before the Civil War. builders in the Shenandoah Valley were conservative in nature, and continued building styles after they became somewhat outdated. Therefore, a suitable construction date for the extant ruins, according to this evidence, could be circa 1872-1875.</p> <p>Whatever the exact construction date for the John H. Allstadt House, it is clear that Mr. Allstadt and his wife lived out the remainder of their days there. After passing through the family, the house then was used for housing the tenants of the Standard Farm until it was abandoned at an unknown date. In 1986, a fire destroyed the building’s interior and part of its exterior.</p>",

        "notes": "Armory Grounds\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/armory-grounds.htm\n\n<p>The United States Armory at Harpers Ferry produced more than 600,000 military rifles and muskets in a 60 year period, spanning from Thomas Jefferson's presidency to the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln.<br /> <br /> The United States Armory was the main reason Meriwether Lewis came to Harpers Ferry. Lewis needed dependable weapons and supplies from the armory to succeed on his mission. The quality of the armorers' handiwork would also mean the difference between life and death for Lewis and his men. In 1803, the armory consisted of ten buildings just upstream and underneath the existing railroad embankment.<br /> <br /> Weapons produced at the armory were the target of John Brown's Raid in October, 1859. Brown intended to use firearms seized at Harpers Ferry to commence a war to end slavery. Brown failed in his attempt because he never escaped from Harpers Ferry. After 36 hours of holding the armory, Brown was captured by U.S. Marines commanded by Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, assisted by Lt. J.E.B. Stuart, in the armory Fire Engine House. Sixteen months following Brown's raid, Civil War erupted.<br /> <br /> At the beginning of the Civil War, the Virginia militia advanced upon Harpers Ferry to seize the musket and rifle factories. The United States troops, who were guarding the armory, discovered themselves outnumbered by the encroaching Virginia militia and Lt. Roger Jones ordered the Musket Factory to be set on fire at 10 p.m. on April 18, 1861. Local citizens and the Virginia militia rapidly doused the flames before much damage could be done in order to save the armory.<br /> <br /> The armory machinery was then dismantled by the militia and moved south during the first weeks of May 1861 with Col. Thomas Jonathan Jackson supervising. Machinery from the factories ended up in Richmond, Virginia and Fayetteville, North Carolina to aid the Confederacy. Many of the Harpers Ferry armory employees relocated further south to manufacture weapons for the new Confederacy. The armory was the economic life of the town and when the armory jobs moved south, Harpers Ferry lost businesses. Many civilians in Harpers Ferry left the area, and the town became \"a ghost of its former self.\"<br /> <br /> The Confederates abandoned Harpers Ferry on June 14, 1861 when garrison commander Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston ordered the armory buildings destroyed. All that was left of the Musket Factory was the brick walls, which were entangled with twisted and melted metal. Just two short weeks later, the Rifle Factory also was destroyed and the mighty industry of Harpers Ferry now was a silent ghostly ruin.<br /> <br /> Nine months later, in March 1862, the armory ruins were restored by the Union Army who occupied Harpers Ferry. The Union army was launching its first full-scale invasion of the Shenandoah Valley and the former Musket Factory buildings were re-roofed to be transformed into a quartermaster and commissary depot. Supplies were brought in through the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and were then shipped further south to the army operating in the Shenandoah Valley. The Union continued to utilize the armory for this purpose until the end of the war.<br /> <br /> The Armory was threatened by several Confederate advances, which resulted in repeated destructions of the Union armory supply depot. The first attack on the Union controlled Armory was in September 1862, when the Confederates captured Harpers Ferry and removed as much supplies that they possibly could. The Confederates took it one step further and set the Armory on fire on September 18. The Union returned quickly to the destroyed armory to rebuild it but ten months later the armory depot was destroyed again in July, 1863. The Union returned to the ruins, once more, and rebuilt but the Confederates would strike again in July 1864.<br /> <br /> Jubal Early's attack in July 1864 would be the last Confederates disturbance at the depot and the Union would rebuild to use the Armory again. The armory served as the base of operations for Philip Sheridan's 1864 Valley Campaign, which that resulted in the defeat of the Confederate army in the Shenandoah Valley.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/600295.htm#7/28.613/-95.828\">United States Armory Grounds and Potomac Riverfront Cultural Landscape</a></p>",

In 1850, the Harpers Ferry Armory purchased its first Boyden turbine for the new Tilt Hammer Shop. Three years later, in 1853, a second Boyden turbine was installed in the large masonry wheel pit seen here. The installation, constructed underneath the new Machine Shop, included a new stone and cast-iron forebay, a new culvert that drained the tailwater from the wheel pit, and a \"large force pump, for throwing water in case of fire.\" An iron bearing box 14 inches square was located in the floor of this pit and held the lower bearing of the turbine's vertical shaft. ",

        "notes": "Baltimore & Ohio Bridge Ruins\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/harpers-ferry-baltimore-ohio-bridge-ruins.htm\n\n<p>The Baltimore & Ohio (B & O) railroad bridge was once a majestic wood covered bridge that spanned the Potomac River and carried train traffic on the B & O Railroad for 23 years prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. In 1859, John Brown, a staunch abolitionist, launched a raid across this bridge to capture the United States Armory and start a war to end slavery. Brown failed at his attempt but made a major impact on the Harpers Ferry area. With the secession of Virginia in April, 1861, the bridge became a tenuous connector between the Confederacy and the Union. The bridge was over an important border, the Potomac River, and constantly had to worry about attacks from both sides of the war. During four years of Civil War, the bridge would be built and destroyed nine times - four times by war, five times by floods.<br /> <br /> On June 14, 1861, as the Confederates were leaving Harpers Ferry, Brig. Gen. Joseph Johnston ordered the burning of all bridges on the Potomac under Southern control. The bridges that were destroyed were Point of Rocks, Shepherdstown, and Berlin. The Berlin Bridge is called Brunswick today. The Harpers Ferry region was a dangerous border area for the next eight months, disallowing rebuilding of the bridge. When the Union army occupied Harpers Ferry in February of 1862 and B & O bridge builders accompanied them. A new iron trestle was completed atop the original piers in less than three weeks, which allowed for supplies to be sent to the Union forces in Harpers Ferry and further south.<br /> <br /> The Confederates regained Harpers Ferry on September 15, 1862 but just a few days later they would abandon that post. On September 18, 1862, the bridge was destroyed for a second time by Confederates when they left Harpers Ferry due to the outcome of the Battle of Antietam in Shepherdstown. B & O bridge builders returned with the Union army a few weeks later and had the bridge operational once again by early October.<br /> <br /> The third time the bridge was destroyed was during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863. This time, the retreating Union forces had destroyed the bridge to ensure the Confederates could not use it to support their invasion into the North. Union forces would reoccupy Harpers Ferry during the third week of July of 1863, following the Confederate retreat from Gettysburg. Once the Confederates had retreated, the B & O bridge builders arrived to rebuild the bridge.<br /> <br /> The fourth and final time the bridge was destroyed occurred during the final invasion of the North in July of 1864. Once Confederate Jubal Early's forces withdrew from Maryland by mid-July, the B & O railroad rebuilt the bridge once more. In the fall of 1864, the Union used the bridge to transport an immense amount of supplies across the Potomac and into the armory depot for use by Philip Sheridan's army during its Valley Campaign. The Valley Campaign conquered the Confederate army in the Shenandoah Valley and the B & O Railroad was the artery of life for Sheridan's army.</p>",

        "notes": "Bolivar Heights\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/bolivar-heights.htm\n\n<p>Bolivar Heights is one of the most important Civil War battlefields in West Virginia -- it was the site of the largest surrender of United States troops during the Civil War. Today, from this location, you can walk beside trenches, take a hike in the woods, or enjoy an incredible vista where you can see most of the park areas from one vantage point. You can drive to this location on your own.<br /> <br /> Bolivar Heights witnessed more battle action than any other location at Harpers Ferry. The first battle of the Civil War at Harpers Ferry occurred at Bolivar Heights on October 16, 1861, exactly two years after the commencement of the John Brown Raid. Alarmed by Union forces in the new Confederacy, especially along the Potomac River, a Confederate force under Col. Turner Ashby struck Union Col. John Geary's men at Bolivar Heights. Many Confederates were angry over the Union seizure of a local flour mill, which provoke some of the fighting but soon after the Confederate attack, Geary held the location and forced a Confederate retreat.<br /> <br /> Confederate Commander Stonewall Jackson's arrival produced the second battle at Bolivar Heights on May 30, 1862 during Jackson's famous Valley Campaign. Jackson had routed all Union soldiers in the Shenandoah Valley, except those at Harpers Ferry. Alarmed at Jackson's successes, Washington reinforced the Union forces at Harpers Ferry by sending Brig. Gen. Rufus B. Saxton to Bolivar Heights to defend the Union position. Jackson attacked Bolivar Heights during a ferocious thunderstorm, but Saxton's position on Camp Hill was held and Jackson retired under the cover of darkness. Siege cannon from the Naval Battery on Maryland Heights plummeted Jackson's men as they advanced across the heights through the town of Bolivar, damaging numerous homes.<br /> <br /> The third time Bolivar Heights witnessed action also involved Stonewall Jackson's men. During the Battle of Harpers Ferry, September 12-15, 1862, Jackson forced a final stand atop Bolivar Heights with the Union forces. Jackson's artillery pummeled the heights from three directions, Maryland Heights, Loudoun Heights, and School House Ridge. On the night of the 14th, he sent Commander A.P. Hill around the southern flank of the heights, which forced the Union garrison to surrender. The formal surrender of nearly 12,700 Union soldiers, the largest capitulation of Union forces during the Civil War, occurred on Bolivar Heights.<br /> <br /> The fourth time Bolivar Heights experienced combat occurred during Confederate General Robert E. Lee's advance toward Gettysburg. Lee sent a column of men to maneuver the Union out of Harpers Ferry, but the Union forcers offered minimal resistance and the Union retreated behind the big guns on Maryland Heights. Bolivar Heights would be blasted from Maryland Heights during the last week of June 1863 and the indiscriminate shelling created havoc in the community, which wrecked civilian homes.<br /> <br /> The fifth and final time Bolivar Heights was a battlefield occurred during Confederate Commander Jubal Early's invasion of the North during the end of June into the first week of July 1864. Early's main column contended with Maryland Heights, north of the Potomac, and sent a detachment of forces to seize Bolivar Heights along with Harpers Ferry from the west. The Union repeated their tactic of the previous year, offering limited resistance on Bolivar Heights, and instead turned toward the siege cannon on Maryland Heights to pulverize the Confederate invaders. Once again, Bolivar Heights and the town suffered extensive damage from bombardment.<br /> <br /> When Bolivar Heights was not a battlefield, it was a campground. Bolivar Heights' gentle, sweeping slopes first were used by Jackson during the spring of 1861. Here Jackson encamped and drilled the 1st Virginia Brigade, which became the famous \"Stonewall\" Brigade. Jackson gained his familiarity with the topography and terrain of Bolivar Heights during this formative period, which enabled him to use this knowledge to his advantage during the Battle of Harpers Ferry in 1862.<br /> <br /> The largest encampment on Bolivar Heights occurred following the Battle of Antietam. The entire 2nd Corps of the Army of the Potomac, numbering nearly 15,000 men, lived on Bolivar Heights for nearly six weeks before departing for the Fredericksburg Campaign during the first week of November 1862. During this time, Professor Thaddeus Lowe raised his gas-filled balloon to observe Confederate movements in the Shenandoah Valley. In addition, the Union troops built extensive earthworks along the length of the ridge, trying to make Bolivar Heights more defensible. Bolivar Heights has a lower elevation than Maryland and Loudoun Heights, which makes it easier to approach through the Shenandoah Valley.<br /> <br /> Bolivar Heights also was the site of the largest corral and wagon yard in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War. During Union Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864, Sheridan converted Bolivar Heights into a temporary corral for thousands of mules and hundreds of quartermaster wagons, waiting to transport supplies and munitions south. Bolivar Heights also became a temporary graveyard. Hundreds of Union soldiers died at Harpers Ferry from disease and most were buried on Bolivar Heights. These remains were removed after the war and reinterred at the Antietam National Cemetery.</p>",

        "notes": "Camp Hill\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/camp-hill.htm\n\n<p>Camp Hill is an area of the park that encompasses armory, Civil War, and civil rights stories. Visitors can drive there directly or hike to the area from Lower Town along the Appalachian Trail. If taking the hike, stop by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hafe/learn/historyculture/jefferson-rock.htm\">Jefferson Rock</a> to take in the scenery before exploring the former <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hafe/learn/historyculture/storer-college.htm\">Storer College</a> campus or visiting the <a href=\"http://www.appalachiantrail.org/\">Appalachian Trail Conservancy</a>.<br /> <br /> Camp Hill is a rounded knoll with steep edges that juts upward from the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers. It hovers over the oldest section of Harpers Ferry, the Lower Town. Camp Hill's oldest feature is the Harper Cemetery, and its most famous landmark is Jefferson Rock. The land was purchased by the federal government as part of the original armory contract. Camp Hill earned its name when soldiers from the U.S. Army encamped atop the knoll during the last years of the 18th century, where they helped with the construction of the armory canal and river dam. Since the government owned the property, the streets were laid out by the government, and many of the original buildings were built, owned, and leased by the government. The most spacious lots on the crest of the hill were reserved for armory officials, which included mansions for the superintendent, the paymaster, and their assistants.<br /> <br /> When the Civil War erupted, these mansions were abandoned, but they soon became buildings for headquarters, bivouacs, and a hospital. The Paymaster's quarters, known today as the Lockwood House, became a hospital and a prison as well. Following the Civil War, the government sold the properties to the trustees of Storer College, and these building served as the original campus. At the end of the war, Freewill Baptist missionaries from Maine utilized the Lockwood House as a school for former slaves, which became Storer College. Three of the mansions still remain the Lockwood House, the Brackett House, and the Morrell House, which still resemble their Civil War appearance.<br /> <br /> Camp Hill served as an encampment for both Union and Confederate troops. In the spring of 1861, the Confederate army occupied the site, but abandoned the position under orders of garrison commander Joseph E. Johnston. Soon afterward, the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry arrived, which were the first Union troops of the Civil War to occupy Camp Hill. Perhaps the most famous regiment to live on Camp Hill was the 22nd New York State Militia. The 22nd New York were from New York City resided here during the summer of 1862. These men were not famous for their fighting, but for their photographs. During their stay, several hundred photos of the men and camp sites were taken upon Camp Hill, providing a glance into life in Harpers Ferry during the Civil War.<br /> <br /> A line of earthwork fortifications ran across the western edge of Camp Hill. These works, constructed in May 1862, ran parallel to Bolivar Heights and helped defend Harpers Ferry against Stonewall Jackson's advance on May 29-30, 1862. The earthworks were improved during the summer of 1862, largely with the assistance of contraband labor, and were engaged during the Battle of Harpers Ferry in September. Once the Confederates hoisted cannons onto nearby Loudoun Heights, the Camp Hill position no longer was tenable. This convinced Union commanders to withdraw from this position during Confederate incursions in the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863 and during Jubal Early's invasion of 1864.</p>",

The UDC misrepresented the facts of Shepherd’s life to support the \"faithful slave” narrative in Shepherd’s death. After a decade of effort, they succeeded and set the dedication date of October 10, 1931.<br /> <br /> Storer College’s white president, Henry McDonald, enlisted the college’s African American choir, led by Pearl Tatten, to sing at the dedication. Tatten listened to speakers criticize John Brown, justify the system of slavery, and praise the loyalty and faithfulness of past enslaved people in the South. When the time came for the Storer College Singers to perform, she stood, faced the crowd, and protested: “I am the daughter of a [Union] Connecticut volunteer, who wore the blue, who fought for the freedom of my people, for whom John Brown struck the first blow…We are pushing forward to a larger freedom…in the spirit of the new freedom and rising youth.”</p>",

If the Confederates wanted to attack this location, this was a good time to do it.<br /> <br /> Quotation: \"On Sunday evening, the second day of our fight, I was ordered out in front of our camp to skirmish as the Rebs were getting rather thick. Now just keep in mind that I had been up for three nights before. You can imagine how pleasantly I must have felt. It was a dangerous position, but I felt as if I did not care whether the Rebs had me or not. One hundred men were detailed and put under Lt. Munson & myself. You ought to have seen us hunting our way down Bolivar Heights for the front of our camp. At last we reached our position.\" Lieutenant George Yost, Company I, 126th New York Regiment, from a letter to his father.<br /> <br /> Photo caption: The flag of the 126th Regiment New York State Volunteers.</p>",

The Union army used it as a supply base for operations into Southern territory. The Railroad Brigade, headquartered here with a force of over 14,000 men, protected over 400 miles of Northern rail lines, stretching from Baltimore into western Virginia.

His 42 years of military service were tarnished by one day - the Union's first defeat at First Bull Run - where he was unjustly accused of drunkenness. The Battle of Harpers Ferry 14 months later cost him his life, and the defeat further tarnished his military record.<br /> <br /> At the top right of the panel, a historic B&W photo shows a young African American boy standing in beside a tent pole.

But in the last month of the war, two Union deserters suffered this fate on Bolivar Heights.<br /> <br /> William Loge convicted of \"being a deserter... bushwhacker, murder and assassin,\" was hanged from a gallows exactly five years after abolitionists John Brown's hanging in nearby Charles Town. Three month later on March 3, 1865, deserter Thomas Murphy of the 6th U.S. Cavalry died here at the hand of a firing squad.<br /> <br /> A temporary burial ground with primitive wooden markers expanded as sickness spread throughout the camps. Most of the soldiers who died on Bolivar Heights succumbed to dysentery, typhoid, or yellow fever.<br /> <br /> In April 1865 the war ended and the nation began its long healing process. Bolivar Heights also healed as soldiers returned home and Union remains were moved to the National Cemetery in Winchester, Virginia.

        "notes": "Information Panel: Charcoal Making on Maryland Heights\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/information-panel-charcoal-making-on-maryland-heights.htm\n\n<p>The charcoal industry required wood; Maryland Heights offered plenty. From 1810 to 1848 the Antietam Iron Works, 7 miles to the north, cut trees on the mountain to make charcoal to fuel its furnace and forges. The burning charcoal helped produce refined iron, from which the Antietam Iron Works made nails and other tools.<br /> <br /> Just above you are the remains of a typical charcoal hearth, one of 57 recorded on the 763 acres of Maryland Heights. Colliers, the skilled men who made the charcoal, formed a hearth by clearing a level oblong platform on the mountain slope. Over a ten-day burning period, a hearth transformed 50 cords of wood into 1750 bushels of charcoal.<br /> <br /> Crude sled and wagon roads formed the arteries of the charcoal industry. After cutting a woodlot, laborers dragged timber downhill along a sled road to a hearth, where the colliers made the charcoal. Then via wagon roads, teamsters hauled the charcoal off the mountain to the ironworks. Over time, about 23 miles of road covered these Heights. Many were later improved by Civil War soldiers. Some you hike today.<br /> <br /> Acres to Burn<br /> An ironworks factory owned vast acres of hardwood forest for harvesting charcoal to fuel their furnaces. One cord of wood is 128 cubic feet. Thirty cords equals one acre. A charcoal hearth burned two acres. A furnace burned up to 276 acres annually.<br /> <br /> Art Caption: Building a Charcoal Pit. The collier first built a triangular chimney in the center of the hearth and filled it with wood chips and other flammable material. Next, he stacked 30 to 50 cords of wood tightly around the chimney. Leaves and a layer of dirt and charcoal dust completed the pit. The chimney was lit from the top and covered.<br /> <br /> Art Caption: Tending the Charring. A burning hearth produced tremendous smoke. It needed constant care to prevent fire from burning through the outer layer. If too much air entered the stack, an open flame reduced the wood to useless ash. The demands of charring required a collier to live in a makeshift hut near the hearth during the burning period.</p>",

They built numerous campgrounds on this inhospitable mountain that lacked water, level ground, or adequate sanitation conditions.<br /> <br /> The stone walls, visible across this plateau, perhaps marked a camp boundary; they may simply be rock mounds piled by soldiers while clearing a camp site. As soon as you continue along the trail, look for clues of encampments such as stone foundations and ground depressions.<br /> <br /> A soldier's quarters could vary greatly, from primitive canopies and tents to elaborate log cabins. Whatever the style, all quarters on the Heights were built to protect the soldier from the weather - a nearly impossible task.<br /> <br /> \"After a varied experience of wind, snow, sleet, hail, rain, and mud, the men came to the conclusion that it was nowhere else than up here among these mountains that the weather was made and tried on.\" Joseph Kirkley, 7th Maryland Infantry<br /> <br /> Photo Caption: Sibley tents, often adjusted to suit the soldiers' needs, served as the basic shelter for infantry regiments. \"The boys have raised the tent about 2 feet with logs and put the tent on top.

This 1864 charcoal drawing of a Signal Corps campground reflects the elaborate quarters built on Maryland Heights.<br /> <br /> \"Our little group of five built our cabin on the bow of a hill, we dug down about three feet and leveled a space about eight by ten feet, the sides were built with logs and the chinks filled with clay; the roof was laid with saplings covered with the earth which we dug while leveling the space.

After the war, the new partnership of Child & McCreight converted the factory into a flour mill. Business at the flour mill lagged. Production was first disrupted by the 1870 flood. The mill finally was abandoned after a flood in 1889 ending all hope for economic recovery. Over the course of its existence, this building housed two generations of water powered turbines -each in their day a leading example of American hydraulic technology. As a cotton mill, it was powered by two Fourneyron turbines, one of the first iron turbines built in the United States. Following the war, Child & McCreight installed four double Leffel turbines in the new flour mill. Only the iron drive shafts, which connect to the turbines below, are visible today.<br /> <br /> As a Civil War Hospital<br /> By August 1862, the Union Army had converted this mill into a hospital.

There were about two hundred cots in a ward... separating the most helpless from those in less serious condition. Nearly every morning from five to ten who had died that night were carried out.

With telegraph messaging impossible and courier service difficult, signal flags became the principal form of communication. Confederate signal men occupied positions on the heights, waving flags in patterns to transmit coded messages. This laborious system took time and Jackson complained that \"the day was much advanced\" before his orders were transmitted. Nonetheless, Jackson received important intelligence from his commanders, like \"not much could be expected from their artillery so long as the enemy retained his advanced position on Bolivar Heights.\" Such intelligence enabled Jackson to envision the enemy, this helping him to devise his plan of attack.<br /> <br /> Quotation: I do not desire . . . to open [fire] until all are ready on both sides of the river.

Optimistic about the community's potential for growth, however, Harper had set aside this 4-acre cemetery.

Because of its position on the Potomac River - an international boundary for four years from 1861 to 1865 - the town's industries were destroyed, its buildings were abandoned, its mountains were raped, and the population dwindled more than 3,000 to fewer than 100 residents.<br /> Both union and Confederate forces coveted Harpers Ferry's strategic location at the gateway to the Shenandoah Valley. The Federals used the town and its connection to Baltimore and the Ohio Railroad as a supply base, launching repeated invasions from here into the heart of Virginia. The Confederates targeted this area as an avenue of invasion into the United States, occupying Harpers Ferry during the 1862 Maryland (Antietam), the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, and the raid on Washington in 1864.<br /> Throughout the war, the mountains surrounding Harpers Ferry played a key role. Forests were denuded for artillery fire and firewood; the earth was carved into earthworks and forts; and the ridge tops were converted into campgrounds and battlegrounds<br /> No one and nothing, escaped the fury of the Civil War at Harpers Ferry.<br /> Photo Caption: Gen.

Early settlers crossed these mountains and operated ferries across the rivers. George Washington, impressed with the area's natural resources, convinced Congress to establish a U.S. armory and arsenal here. The Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, which cut the gap through the Blue Ridge, provided the water power for industry at Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> But Harpers Ferry's location had disadvantages, too. The rivers that powered the factories brought frequent floods. The armory and defensible mountains attracted John Brown and his plan to end slavery. The mountain gap, armory, railroad, and canal made the area a military target during the Civil War. After the war had stripped the mountains of their trees and destroyed the town's industry, only Storer College and its education of former slaves provided hope for Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> During your visit, look for the intermingling of geography and history - it is the story of Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> Quotation: \"I will pledge myself that there is not a spot in the United States which combines more or greater requisites . . . \" George Washington May 6, 1798<br /> <br /> Illustration Caption: Industry powered by two rivers rushing through these mountains made Harpers Ferry a weapons manufacturing center from 1800 to 1861<br /> <br /> Illustration caption: John Brown planned to use the Blue Ridge as a fortress for his army of freed slaves, but U.S. Marines stopped his raid here in 1859.<br /> <br /> Illustration caption: Civil war swept across these hills and valleys from 1861 to 1865 as armies struggled to capture or defend Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> Illustration caption: Black Americans progressed from slavery to earning degrees at Storer College on Camp Hill from 1867 to 1955.</p>",

The five embrasures which cut through this wall served as artillery positions for howitzer guns, and later, 30-pounder Parrott rifles.<br /> <br /> A Union recommendation that \"all plateaus or gentle slopes between the crest and Harpers Ferry be held\" suggests the purpose and origin of the Interior Fort/ As a rectangular earthwork, its defensive position included part of the mountain's crest and a narrow plateau just below. Built during the winter of 1862-1863 it borders the Exterior Fort on the west and encompasses the Stone Fort within its southeast corner.<br /> <br /> Archaeological surveys recorded thirteen powder magazines on Maryland Heights, three within this fort. Used to store gun powder and shells, these 30' x 20' rectangular excavations were dug to a depth of eight feet, supported by a heavy timber superstructure and covered with earth and sod.<br /> <br /> Working around a powder magazine could be hazardous, especially to the untrained but enthusiastic soldier, as revealed in this passage by Joseph Barry, a local citizen: \"A company of them [\"the Hundred-Day Men from Ohio\"] were preparing dinner and, not having anything convenient on which to build their fire, they procured from an ammunition wagon several large shells on while they piled their wood which was soon ablaze. â€˜Round the fire they all squatted... Soon a terrific explosion shook the surrounding hills, sending all the culinary utensils flying over the tree tops and, unfortunately, killing or wounding nearly every man of the group.<br /> <br /> Map Caption: Stone Fort Area Plan, by George Kaiser, January 1863. This map includes the Interior Fort's north wall. The five small squares with symbols represent artillery pieces and gun platforms abutting the wall.

Each fall, the railroad brought wheat here from the Potomac and Shenandoah valleys to be ground into flour, packed into barrels, and shipped east to Baltimore.<br /> <br /> Fire destroyed the original mill in 1839. Construction of a larger three-and-one-half story stone building followed the next year on the same site. Over the next 5 years ownership changed several times until Abraham Herr acquired the mill in 1844. Then known as Herr's Mill, it dwarfed the surrounding factories in Virginia and could produce $233,400 in flour annually, thirteen times the amount produced by the average flour mill in the United States in 1860.<br /> <br /> By the outbreak of the Civil War, Herr owned all of Virginius Island. As a Northern supporter, he donated a large quantity of grain to Union soldiers stationed in the area in October 1861. A few days later, Confederates seized Harpers Ferry and torched Herr's flour mill. The flames completely gutted the building, but Herr escaped to the North.<br /> <br /> Photo caption: Island Mills in 1857<br /> Photo caption: A Federal troop train on Virginius Island in December 1864.

Mrs. Child gave this chilling description of the ordeal in a letter to her mother:<br /> \"Last Friday toward evening, the water commenced rising rapidly. Before two hours every way of escape was cut off from us. So we were compelled to stay within the crumbling walls which sheltered us from the terrible water which seethed and dashed about us. There were two bridges connecting the Island with the mainland, one wooden near our house and the railroad bridge. So violent was the water that these were torn to fragments and carried away...\"<br /> The Childs survived that flood, but 42 others perished.

You are experiencing the hardship of a Union soldier climbing to reach his work place (a fort) or his home (a tent or log cabin). Try ascending this road hauling a 9,700-pound gun tube or a week's supply of water. From 1862 through 1863, the Federals built seven fortifications and staked out numerous encampments on this rugged and remote mountain. Maj. Frank Rolfe of the First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery Regiment described the effort:<br /> <br /> \"...the batteries were situated from 250 to 2,065 feet about the river and the roads leading to them very rocky, steep and crooked and barely wide enough for a wagon. Over these roads the guns, ammunition and supplies of all kind were hauled.\"<br /> <br /> Timber cutting was another tedious job for the Federals. Soldiers clear-cut the upper third of the mountain to provide adequate lines of fire and supplies of wood for shelter and campfires. Lt. Charles F. Morse of the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry recorded this entry on October 20, 1862, while commanding a detachment of 100 tree-choppers:<br /> <br /> \"We began our labor at the bottom of a ravine and worked up a steep hill. Sometimes there would be as many as twenty or thirty fine trees falling at once: they reminded me of men falling in battle, that same dead, helpless fall.\"<br /> <br /> Photo Caption: President Abraham Lincoln at Antietam, on October 4, 1862, two days after he reviewed the troops here on Maryland Heights.<br /> <br /> Label: Your perseverance to reach the summit was almost - but not quite - shared by President Abraham Lincoln when he visited Maryland Heights on October 2, 1862. After a formal review of the army, Lt. Charles Morse guided the presidential party toward the summit:<br /> <br /> \"I showed the way until we got to a path where it was right straight up, when Lincoln backed out. I think it must have reminded him of a little story about a very steep place; at any rate around they turned and went down the mountain.\"</p>",

As the highest ridge surrounding Harpers Ferry, Maryland Heights played a prominent role in the strategic operations of both the Union and Confederacy.<br /> <br /> Southern forces under Col. Thomas J. Jackson first occupied this ground in early May 1861, violating Maryland's neutrality. Confederates remained here until they abandoned Harpers Ferry on June 15, 1861.<br /> <br /> \"I have finished reconnoitering the Maryland Heights, and have determined to fortify them at once, and hold them... be the cost what it may.\" - Col. Thomas J. Jackson, May 7, 1861.<br /> <br /> Jackson returned fifteen months later, during the Confederacy's first major invasion of the North. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, as he was now called, directed a three-pronged siege of the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry, seizing Maryland Heights from the north on September 13, 1862. Two days later Federal commander Dixon Miles surrendered, allowing Jackson to rush his forces to Sharpsburg to join Gen. Robert E. Lee.<br /> <br /> On September 22, 1862, five days after the Battle of Antietam and Confederate withdrawal from Maryland, Union troops once again occupied the Heights. Federal commander George B. McClellan ordered fortifications built to deter future invasion, protect the B&O Railroad, and guard the U.S. supply depot at Harpers Ferry. By the end of 1863, Union troops had built eight fortifications, at times defended by 10,000 soldiers.<br /> <br /> \"I have determined to fortify [MarylandHeights] in order to avoid a similar catastrophe to the one which happened to Colonel Miles.\" - Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, September 26, 1862.<br /> <br /> Despite this mountain fortress, Confederate invasion continued. During the Gettysburg Campaign, General Lee sidestepped the Heights position, crossing the Potomac 12 miles northwest near Shepherdstown. In July 1864, Jubal Early's 14,000 Rebels demonstrated against these defenses, but left them behind en route to Washington, D.C.<br /> <br /> Federal soldiers and their cannon finally departed MarylandHeights in July 1865, three months after Lee's surrender. Behind them they left their forts and campgrounds - reminders of America's bloodiest war.<br /> <br /> Attacks on Maryland Heights<br /> Because of its strategic location, Maryland Heights remained a target for control throughout the Civil War.<br /> <br /> Photo Caption: The enemy \"had taken refuge in his strongly fortified works... and an attempt to carry them by assault would have resulted in greater loss than the advantage to be gained...\" - Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early, commander of the Second Corps, in his postwar memoirs.</p>",

His lower vantage on Schoolhouse Ridge, 1,000 yards upriver, blocked sight of this strategic position. Yet Jackson remembered this farm from his time as the Confederate commander at Harpers Ferry during the first days of the war. He knew if he seized this ground he would threaten the rear of the Union army atop Bolivar Heights. Despite overwhelming odds, Jackson's men secured the Chambers (Murphy) Farm and the plateau on Loudoun Heights, overcoming rivers, cliffs, ravines, poor roads, and narrow shorelines. They forced the timely surrender of Harpers Ferry. With cannon now in close firing range from these surprise positions, Jackson was ready to launch his final attack on the Union forces.</p>",

Hastily built in May 1862, its naval guns were rushed here from the Washington D.C. Navy Yard. Along with a detachment of 300 sailors and marines, the battery was equipped to protect Harpers Ferry from Confederate attack during Stonewall Jackson's famous Valley Campaign in the spring of 1862.<br /> <br /> Thwarted that spring Jackson returned to Harpers Ferry in mid September 1862, during the Confederacy's first invasion of the North. Jackson's three-day siege included an infantry battle on the crest of Maryland Heights on September 13, in which the Confederates advanced south along the ridge top. The Naval Battery guns were turned uphill to pound the crest, but orders to retreat forced the Federals to abandon the mountains and this battery.<br /> <br /> On September 22, one week after the Union surrender at Harpers Ferry, U.S. forces returned to Maryland Heights to build fortifications at better locations on the crest and slope of the Heights.

By September, 1863, the Union garrison had transformed the Stone Fort into a commissary and storage area.<br /> <br /> During an inspection by Brig. Gen.

The gunfire he heard was exactly what General \"Stonewall\" Jackson wanted. Jackson intended to outflank the enemy stronghold on Bolivar Heights by moving artillery and infantry to the far left of the union position. To cover this maneuver and distract the Union troops, Jackson ordered some of his forces on School House Ridge to feint attack against the Union skirmish line near the road below. Confederate victory was inevitable now.<br /> <br /> Even though the attack here lasted only a short time, it was a critical part of the Confederate strategy, and was a life and death situation for the soldiers who were involved.<br /> <br /> \"General J.R.

On April 18, 1861, the day after Virginia seceded from the Union, Virginia militia awaited reinforcements on this ridge while preparing to seize Harpers Ferry. At 10:00 p.m., the out-numbered Federal garrison blew up the arsenal and attempted to burn the armory before retreating into Maryland. Col. Thomas J. Jackson arrived 10 days after the arsenal's destruction to assume his first command of the Civil War. He drilled thousands of Virginia volunteers encamped here on Bolivar Heights into a disciplined military unit that soon became famous as the \"Stonewall Brigade.\" In mid-June 1861, Maj. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston ordered the Confederate forces to abandon Harpers Ferry, pronouncing the area \"untenable.\" On October 16, 1861, exactly two years after John Brown raided Harpers Ferry, 500 Confederates led by Col. Turner Ashby attacked 600 Union soldiers commanded by Col. John White Geary on this ridge. Ashby ordered repeated assaults on the Union position. After six hours of fighting, Geary's troops ultimately repulsed the Confederates. The \"Battle of Bolivar Heights\" ended as Ashby's troops fell back towards Charles Town and Union flags were planted on the ridge. War correspondent Porte Crayon, wrote: \"There was a sudden flash that illuminated for miles around the romantic gorge where the rivers meet . . . . The flashes and detonations were several times repeated; then a steadier flame was seen rising from two distinct points, silently and rapidly increasing in volume until each rock and tree on the Loudoun and Maryland Heights were distantly visible, and the now overclouded sky was ruddy with the sinister glare.<br /> <br /> Illustration Caption: Later, Crayon drew this illustration for Harpers Monthly Magazine.<br /> <br /> Illustration Caption: This eyewitness illustration shows the Confederates using naval cannon on Bolivar Heights during the early months of the war.<br /> <br /> Quotation: \"The people for the most part were tongue-tied with terror . . . overwhelmed with ruin . . . .\" Porte Crayon, war correspondent April 18, 1861.</p>",

Prominent Armory officials lived along this street. During the Civil War, Union soldiers camped and drilled here. Inside the house they scrawled their names on the plaster walls.<br /> <br /> After the war, the house became the new home of the Odd Fellows (IOOF), a fraternal and charitable organization. The old industrial town of Harpers Ferry was well suited for Odd Fellowship. Life was hard here, and the lodge supported members and families facing illness, injury, or death. <br /> <br /> Why are they \"Odd\"? The origin of the name is uncertain. Some believe it was considered \"odd\" for working class men to join together to help those in need.<br /> <br /> Who can join? Members must be over the age of sixteen, believe in a Supreme Being, and be faithful to their country. <br /> <br /> What happens at meetings? Meetings follow a prescribed ritual and order of business. Members advance in the Order through a series of ceremonies emphasizing high moral character. <br /> <br /> How do they serve? Odd Fellows provide food to poor families, donate medical equipment, assist in disaster relief, and work in many ways to improve life in their communities.

Lee, commanding the army of Northern Virginia, then at Frederick, MD. Set three colums in motion to capture Harper's Ferry. Maj Gen L. McLaws with his own division and that of Maj Gen R.H. Anderson, marched through Middletown and Brownsville Pass into Pleasant Valley. On the 12th the brigades of Kershaw and Barksdale ascended Maryland Heights by Solomon's Gap, moved along the crest and, at nightfall, were checked by the Union forces under command of Col. T.H. Ford, about two miles north of this. Eight Confederate brigades held Weverton, Sandy Hook, and approaches from the east. On the 13th Kershaw and Barksdale drove the Union troops from the Heights. Ford, abandoning seven guns, retreated across the pontoon bridge, a few yards above the railroad bridge, to Harper's Ferry. The Union loss was 38 killed, 134 wounded; Confederate loss, 35 killed, 178 wounded.Brig. Gen. John G. Walker's division crossed the Potomac at Point of Rocks, 10 miles below this, during the night of September 10 and, on the 13th occupied Loudoun Heights and the roads south of the river leading east and south.<br /> <br /> No. 2: Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson, with his own division and those of Maj. Gens. A.P. Hill and R.S. Ewell, left Frederick on the morning of September 10 and passing through Middletown and Boonsboro, crossed the Potomac at Williamsport, 21 miles north of this, on the afternoon of the 11th. Hill's division took the direct road to Martinsburg and bivouacked near it. Jackson's and Ewell's divisions marched to North Mountain Depot on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, seven miles northwest of Martinsburg, and bivouacked. During the night Brig. Gen. Julius White, commanding the Union troops at Martinsburg, about 2,500 in number, abandoned the place and retreated to Harper's Ferry. Jackson occupied Martinsburg on the morning of the 12th, passed through it and about noon of the 13th, A.P. Hill's division, in the advance, reached Halltown, 3¼ miles west of this, and went into camp. Jackson's and Ewell's division, following Hill's, encamped near it.<br /> <br /> No. 3: Col. Dixon S. Miles, second U.S. Infantry, commanded the Union forces at Harper's Ferry. After General White joined from Martinsburg, September 12, and Colonel Ford from Maryland Heights on the 13th, Miles had about 14,200 men. On the morning of the 14th the greater part of this force was in position on Bolivar Heights, 1 5/8 miles west, its right resting on the Potomac, its left near the Shenandoah; artillery distributed on the line. Artillery and a small force of infantry occupied Camp Hill, nearly midway between this and Bolivar Heights. The cavalry was under partial cover of the irregularities of the ground.On the morning of the 14th Walker placed five long range guns near the northern point of Loudoun Heights, and, at 1pm, opened on the Union batteries on Bolivar Heights and Camp Hill, which was replied to. An hour later Jackson's artillery opened on Bolivar Heights from Schoolhouse Hill and, still an hour later, McLaws opened from two Parrott guns that he had succeeded in placing near the southern extremity of Maryland Heights. The fire from these three directions was continued until dark, silencing and dismounting some of the Union guns.<br /> <br /> No. 4: In the afternoon of the 14th Jackson's division advanced its left, seized commanding ground near the Potomac and established artillery upon it. Hill's division moved from Halltown obliquely to the right until it struck the Shenandoah, then pushed along the river; the advance, after some sharp skirmishing late in the night gained high ground upon which were placed five batteries, commanding the left rear of the Union line. Ewell's division advanced through Halltown to Schoolhouse Hill, and deployed about one mile in front of Bolivar Heights, bivouacking on either side of the Charlestown Road. During the night the Confederates advanced on the right and left gaining some ground, and 10 guns of Ewell's division crossed the Shenandoah at Key's Ford and were placed on the plateau at the foot of Loudoun Heights to enfilade the entire position on Bolivar Heights.About 9pm the entire Union cavalry force, about 1,500 men crossed the pontoon bridge, passed up the canal bank about a mile, followed the mountain road near the river, crossed the Antietam near its mouth, passed through Sharpsburg about midnight and escaped into Pennsylvania.<br /> <br /> No. 5: At daylight, September 15, three batteries of Jackson's division delivered a severe fire against the right of the Bolivar Heights defense. Ewell's batteries opened from School House Hill in front. Hill's five batteries on ground commanding the left of the line and the 10 guns across the Shenandoah poured an accurate enfilade fire upon the left and rear of Miles' defenses. The artillery on Loudoun Heights and Maryland Heights joined in the attack. This concentrated fire or 56 guns was responded to by the Union guns, but, in an hour, beginning to run short of ammunition Miles raised the white flag in a token of surrender. Soon after he was mortally wounded and the command devolved on General White who completed the terms of capitulation by the surrender of about 12,500 officers and men and all public property. Hill’s Division was left to parole the prisoners, while Jackson with five divisions marched to the field of Antietam. Exclusive of the loss on MarylandHeights, the Union loss was 9 killed, 39 wounded; Confederate loss, 6 killed, 69 wounded.",

The building was described in a June 30, 1848, Armory report: \"An engine and guard-house, 35½ x 24 feet, one story brick, covered with slate, and having copper gutters and down spouts, has been constructed, and is now occupied.\" It was in this building that John Brown and several of his followers barricaded themselves during the final hours of their ill-fated raid of October 16, 17, and 18, 1859.<br /> <br /> John Brown's Fort, as the structure became known, was the only Armory building to escape destruction during the Civil War. In 1891, the fort was sold, dismantled and transported to Chicago where it was displayed a short distance from The World's Columbian Exposition. The building, attracting only 11 visitors in ten days, was closed, dismantled again and left on a vacant lot.<br /> <br /> In 1894, Washington, D.C. journalist Kate Field, who had a keen interest in preserving memorabilia of John Brown, spearheaded a campaign to return the fort to Harpers Ferry. Local resident Alexander Murphy made five acres available to Miss Field, and the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad offered to ship the disassembled fort to Harpers Ferry free of charge. In 1895, John Brown's Fort was rebuilt on the Murphy Farm about three miles outside of town on a bluff overlooking the Shenandoah River.<br /> <br /> In 1903, Storer College began their own fundraising drive to acquire the structure. In 1909, on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of John Brown's Raid, the building was purchased and moved to the Storer College campus on Camp Hill in Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> Acquired by the National Park Service in 1960, the building was moved back to the Lower Town in 1968. Because the fort's original site was covered with a railroad embankment in 1894, the building now sits about 150 feet east of its original location.</p> <h2>Timeline</h2> <p>1848 Built as fire-engine house for U.S. Armory.<br /> 1859 Serves as stronghold for John Brown and his raiders.<br /> 1861-1865 Escapes destruction during Civil War (only armory building to do so), but is vandalized by souvenir-hunting Union and Confederate soldiers and later travelers.<br /> 1891 Dismantled and transported to Chicago Exposition.<br /> 1895 Rescued from conversion to stable and brought back to Harpers Ferry area to be exhibited on a farm.<br /> 1909 Purchased by Storer College and moved to campus<br /> 1968 Moved by National Park Service to within 150 feet of its original location<br /> Photo caption: On October 16, 1859, the abolitionist John Brown and his men attacked Harpers Ferry.

Originally constructed as the home of the Armory Paymaster in 1848, the massive stone and brick structure has an elaborate two-story porch, which became an ideal site for a base hospital during the summer of 1862. Labeled the \"Clayton Hospital,\" the large rooms, high ceilings, and airy porch offered a healthy environment for soldiers suffering from camp diseases such as dysentery, diarrhea, and various fevers. The Lockwood House also became the location where wounded Union soldiers were treated during the Battle of Harpers Ferry in September 1862.<br /> <br /> Following the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, the Union army reoccupied Harpers Ferry and the garrison commander, Brig. Gen. Henry Lockwood, selected this building for his headquarters. The current name of the building is named after Henry Lockwood. Lockwood was not the only general to use the building; the building was also headquarters for Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan. Sheridan occupied the Lockwood House during the second week of August 1864, as he prepared to launch his Shenandoah Valley Campaign that would remove Confederates from the area.<br /> <br /> When not used as a headquarters or a hospital, this building served as a bivouac, a prison, and a ballroom. A grand Thanksgiving ball was held here in November 1863, featuring the brass band of the 34th Massachusetts Infantry and under the candlelight of a chandelier made of rifle barrels and bayonets.<br /> At the end of the war, Freewill Baptist missionaries from Maine utilized the Lockwood House as a school for formerly enslaved men and women. Under the direction of Reverend Nathan Brackett, the Lockwood House became the nucleus of Storer College.<br /> <br /> In recent history, architects and conservationists have found Civil War era graffiti scribbled on the building's plaster walls. Today, preserving the graffiti has been an ongoing conservation project and makes the house unique that it has lasted so long.</p>",

        "notes": "Loudoun Heights\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/loudoun-heights.htm\n\n<p>Almost equal to Maryland Heights in elevation and always less crowded, Loudoun Heights offers a bit more solitude and an overlook that is as good as or better than its northern cousin. Loudoun Heights also rewards its visitors with glimpses of the remnants of Civil War campsites and fortifications. The Appalachian Trail south is the only way to the top of the ridge. Then the park's blue-blazed trail leads to the Split Rock overlook and an awesome payoff for all of your effort. <br /> <br /> Loudoun Heights is the second highest mountain overlooking Harpers Ferry, hugging the Shenandoah River along its base. The mountain's northern face has a 900-foot vertical drop, which is the steepest bluff surrounding Harpers Ferry. The name Loudoun Heights comes from Loudoun County, Virginia, which is situated near Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> Confederate forces, under Col. Thomas Jonathan Jackson, were the first to occupy Loudoun Heights. In the spring of 1861, Jackson ordered the construction of three infantry blockhouses on the mountain summit. The stone foundation remains of the blockhouses still remain today and are hidden in wilderness, which has helped preserve them.<br /> <br /> During the Battle of Harpers Ferry, September 12-15, 1862, Maj. Gen. John G. Walker's Confederate division seized Loudoun Heights in accordance with General Lee's Special Orders 191. Walker's division of 4,000 men encountered no resistance by the Union troops in the area because they thought that Loudoun Heights would not affect them but their assumption was false. Confederate General Jackson ordered cannon to be placed on the mountain, which seemed impossible to do, along with four guns on the mountain's crest. When bombardment commenced on September 13, the Loudoun Heights cannon caused more damage and harm to the Union forces holding Bolivar Heights and Camp Hill than any other Confederate position, due to the elevation and near proximity of Loudoun Heights.<br /> <br /> Following the Battle of Antietam, the Union reoccupied Harpers Ferry in late September 1862. Loudoun Heights became an extensive temporary campground for a portion of the Army of the Potomac. The grounds of Loudoun Heights were miserable for camping, with limited water, steep slopes, boulder-strewn crests, and primitive roads. Remnants of these campgrounds still exist, but are inaccessible due to the rugged terrain. By early November, the Union troops had abandoned the mountain, and did not again play a significant role, as it fell under the big Union guns on Maryland Heights.</p>",

        "notes": "Maryland Heights\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/maryland-heights.htm\n\n<p>The majority of hikers ascend Maryland Heights in search of a good view or a healthy workout. This mountain offers both hikes and scenic overlooks which will not disappoint. If history is your thing, Maryland Heights has remnants of extensive Civil War campsites and fortifications and its elevation made it hugely important during the war. To access this area, walk from Lower Town across the footbridge over the Potomac River to the C&O Canal towpath then take a left and walk along the path until there is signage for the Maryland Heights trail.<br /> <br /> Maryland Heights is the highest mountain overlooking Harpers Ferry. Its southern face is a 300-foot vertical cliff that towers over the Potomac River, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The mountain is steep, rugged, and primitive, with a thick veneer of Civil War history.<br /> <br /> Maryland Heights hosted the first battle between Union and Confederate troops in Maryland. The first combat on Northern soil between the two armies occurred on Maryland Heights. Maryland Heights was the most important strategic target of the Confederate army in the Battle of Harpers Ferry, which took place from September 12-15, 1862. Without the seizure of Maryland Heights, Robert E. Lee's Confederates could not entrap the Union garrison and complete Lee's assignment outlined in Special Orders 191.<br /> <br /> Lee selected Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws to lead the advance upon Maryland Heights, expecting McLaws to snare the Union garrison from the north. McLaws arrived at the eastern base of the mountain on September 12 with 8,000 men. Discovering nearly 4,000 Union soldiers stationed atop the mountain, McLaws directed William Barksdale's Mississippi brigade and Joseph Kershaw's South Carolina brigade to ascend Elk Ridge north of Maryland Heights and to take the Union position. Battling at Maryland Heights lasted from 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on September 13, and eventually, the Union troops under Colonel Thomas H. Ford's command abandoned their position. The loss of Maryland Heights cut off the Union forces escape routes and helped lead to the surrender of the Union garrison on September 15.<br /> <br /> The significance of Maryland Heights is further attested by the Union occupation of the mountain two days following the Battle of Antietam. By securing the heights on September 19, the Union, once again, occupied Harpers Ferry and to ensure the protection of the position, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan ordered that extensive fortifications be constructed on Maryland Heights. Union engineers quickly surveyed the terrain, and during the fall of 1862, work commenced on the Stone Fort and the 30-pounder Battery, along with improvements at the Naval Battery. Ten months later, as General Lee threatened Harpers Ferry with his second invasion during the Gettysburg Campaign; construction hastened which resulted in the Interior Fort, the Exterior Fort, and the 100-pounder Battery. This latter battery boasted a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle that could hurl a 100-pound shell more than two miles and the tube of this cannon weighed nearly 10 tons.<br /> <br /> The fortifications of Maryland Heights played a major role in the Confederacy's third and final invasion of the North. Confederate Maj. Gen. Jubal Early spent four days attempting to maneuver the Union out of the forts, but he failed. During the time Early spent worrying about Maryland Heights, the Union was able to send reinforcements to Washington, ultimately helping to save the United States capital. The Union army would occupy the forts of Maryland Heights until June 30, 1865. The final time the big cannon boomed was in memory of President Lincoln following his assassination.<br /> <br /> Though Maryland Heights was occupied by Union forces the most, Maryland Heights occupation was by Confederates. Col. Thomas Jonathan Jackson seized the mountain in May 1861. Recognizing the strategic value of the high ground, Jackson was sure he could not defend Harpers Ferry without holding Maryland Heights. Jackson's aggressiveness created major turmoil when he positioned his troops in neutral Maryland, a state that the Confederacy was trying to get to join their cause. Despite the political firestorm set off by Jackson, he refused to abandon the position. The Confederates left on their own volition on June 14, 1861, when the Confederates abandoned Harpers Ferry five weeks before the First Battle of Manassas (Bull Run).</p>",

The Master Armorer's House is at the junction of Shenandoah and High Streets only one block from the Baltimore & Ohio (B&O) Railroad Bridge and the Potomac River pontoon crossing. The Master Armorer's House was easy to find and a nerve center for communications during the Civil War.<br /> <br /> Completed just before the John Brown Raid in 1859, the Master Armorer's House was one of the newest buildings in Harpers Ferry at the outbreak of the Civil War.<br /> <br /> The most famous general who stayed in the Master Armorer's House was Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Grant only spent one night in the house, on September 16, 1864, when returning from a strategy meeting in Charles Town with his Shenandoah Valley commander, Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan. During Grant's stay, the building was the headquarters of Union Brig. Gen. John D. Stevenson. Stevenson commanded the Military District of Harpers Ferry along with managing Sheridan's logistics operations during the 1864 Valley Campaign. Stevenson was known to control Harpers Ferry, and the surrounding region, with a \"hard-hand\" of martial law. Stevenson also combated Confederate guerillas; he even entrapped John Mobberly, his nemesis, and killed him just before the end of the war. Stevenson also displayed Mobberly's corpse at the Master Armorer's House, as a reminder of the war's ruthlessness.<br /> <br /> Union commander Col. Dixon S. Miles, who opposed Stonewall Jackson during the Battle of Harpers Ferry on September 12-15, 1862, also used the Master Armorer's House as his headquarters. Miles was mortally wounded during the battle, and died here on September 16.</p>",

It read <strong>Mennen’s Borated Talcum Toilet Powder</strong>.</p> <h4>Origins of the Sign</h4> <p>From the establishment of the town in the 1700s through today, this landscape has been exploited for business. From her house on High Street in 1906, Clara Riley watched as sign painters created a huge advertisement, out of a milk and whitewash mixture, on the side of the mountain. Mrs. Riley remembered the year because she was in labor with her first child while the sign was being painted.<br /> <br /> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, painting advertisements on brick buildings and stone cliffs was very popular. Although the Mennen’s powder sign may have been the largest in the area, it was not alone (The wall around the famous John Brown Fort advertised liver pills). As transportation shifted to roads and automobiles, advertisements moved to billboards and highways.</p> <h4>Maintaining the Sign</h4> <p>In May of 1963, the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC) attempted to hide the sign at the request of Park Superintendent Joseph Prentice. Prentice said that looking at the sign was “like looking across the Grand Canyon and seeing a Coca-Cola sign.”<br /> <br /> The PATC and the superintendent were not the only ones who disliked the sign. Many local residents believed it to be a “desecration of nature.”<br /> <br /> Eager to eradicate the sign, PATC volunteers scaled the cliff and attacked the old sign with paint remover and carbon black. However, only four years later the sign was visible once again and has since been left alone.</p>",

Lewis, with William Clark, had been appointed to lead a Corps of Discovery across the continent, exploring the vast western lands recently acquired through the Louisiana Purchase. We now call this journey the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1803-1806).<br /> <br /> Lewis worked with Armory engineers to develop a collapsible iron-framed boat that could be transported over land when necessary. He dubbed it “The Experiment”. This strange craft was comprised of an iron frame that came apart in sections, over which was stretched a covering of animal hide. Lewis planned to use the craft following the portage around the Great Falls of the Missouri River, when the river got too shallow for heavy wooden boats to navigate.</p>",

This exhibit space focuses on Meriwether Lewis' time in Harpers Ferry. <br /> <br /> In mid-March of 1803, about two weeks after Congress authorized the expedition, the twenty-eight-year-old Lewis departed Washington for the recently opened United States Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry to acquire supplies. Lewis relied on the armory and its skilled craftsmen to supply “arms and accoutrements” that would meet the unique requirements of the transcontinental expedition. The armory provided 15 rifles, 15 powder horns, 30 bullet molds, 30 ball screws, extra rifle and musket locks, gunsmith's repair tools, several dozen tomahawks, and 24 large knives.<br /> <br /> Lewis also worked with armory engineers to develop a collapsible iron-framed boat that could be transported over land when necessary. He dubbed it “The Experiment”. This strange craft was comprised of an iron frame that came apart in sections, over which was stretched a covering of animal hide. Lewis planned to use the craft following the portage around the Great Falls of the Missouri River, when the river got too shallow for heavy wooden boats to navigate.</p>",

Treasury agents enforced tax regulations. People attempting to cross the Potomac from enemy territory of Loudoun County were supposed to go to Berlin, Maryland, ordered to take the oath, and remarkably, deal with U.S. Customs to carry on business.

Aimed at children and their parents, a December 1864 newspaper story called “Santa Claus Visits the New York Herald Newspaper Office ” allowed Santa to speak to the editor and comment on what the war had done to Americans and assert the joy that toys could bring to children: “No prima donna sings so deliciously as a little girl putting her doll to sleep…you ask… if I am as busy as ever this year. Busier, sir, busier! There are so many soldier’s children to look after, and alas! so many orphans. To these I am unusually tender, and it is the duty of every man to assist me. Ah, the brave old Christmas times in the South are over until the war is over. The hearthstones are desolate. Children who ought to be playing with popguns are shouldering real muskets in the rebel armies. Oh, sir, it would make you heart bleed if I could tell you of the scenes I have witnessed in Southern homes during the past four years. They were dreadful, dreadful. Merry old man as I am it saddens me to think of them. I went South as long as I could. I kept green the memory of Santa Claus in their hearts for three martial years. But now I find myself shut out by the blockades at every point, and this Christmas they must do without me. Let us hope...that before another Christmas comes round there will be a reunited Union, a permanent peace, and a Santa Claus for all the children.” </p>",

Commercially available yeast could have been purchased by the time of the Civil War. To make it from “scratch”, would have been time consuming. The dough proceeded through different stages of mixing until it was elastic enough to trap air, released by the yeast inside the dough, which allowed the dough to rise. The men on the left, are busy pushing or pulling baked bread or raw dough in and out of the ovens. In their hands are very long iron or wooden bread peels. The long length of the peels indicates how deep the oven was. Compare the length of the peel pole to the man holding it. The sketch indicates the oven could have been 6 to 8 feet deep. Over the men’s head on the left, are extra peels up out of the way, but still close by when needed. These ovens were kept hot and ready to bake around the clock, or 5,000 loaves a day would not be possible!</p>",

Yesterday a prisoner of war, one of Mosby's guerrillas caught in Loudoun county, was reported at this office, his name is William Loge, also known as French bill, and he is notoriously known as a guerrilla bushwacker murder and assassin. And that is not all. The same person deserted from the six New York volunteers and joined the rebel forces. He was sentenced…to be hung today at 2:00 PM. A general order having been issued to that effect; Captain Pratt was ordered to see that it was carried into effect. Accordingly this afternoon an immense crowd assembled on the ground in Bolivar and the procession arrived around 3:00 PM headed by the post band it being the first execution that has occurred in this vicinity since the John Brown affair, a large crowd had congregated on the spot . The criminal bore his fate with singular courage and expressed as his only wish that he would like to see his mother, he being scarcely 20 years old but his circumstance never changed when he was notified of his sentence. He said he was willing to die. On the scaffold he made a short speech, running up his crimes, saying that he was a deserter from the U S army and owing up that he had shot in cold blood and robbed many a Yankee soldier etc the worst part of the affair was the rope broke and the poor criminal in his last struggles of agony, while being brought to the scaffolding a second time, cried that they should only shoot him and put him out of his misery. I never want to witness another execution of this kind.”",

The country is thinking about the recent contentious presidential election. Abraham Lincoln’s second election hinged on the success of Union General Philip Sheridan’s Valley Campaign, which brought the inevitable end to the conflict ever closer. The prospect of peace is around the corner; the Civil War will determine the Union of the States and eventual freedom of four million enslaved people. </p> <p paraeid=\"{33f2b9e4-d4ff-4772-9f20-5b57fabfc05b}{187}\" paraid=\"215949600\">Here in Harpers Ferry, the Provost Marshal and his Provost Guard policed military and civilian activities. Harpers Ferry changed hands eight or more times during the Civil War. Most of the time it was occupied by the Union Army. Harpers Ferry was perceived as enemy territory, and the Union Army assigned an officer as Provost Marshal with a Provost Guard to act as a military police force. The Provost Marshal dealt with prisoners of war, spies, and guerilla fighters, as well as drunk, disorderly, or deserting soldiers, and even unhappy or disloyal civilians. Enslaved people fleeing slavery who made their way to Union lines also fell under the Provost Marshal’s jurisdiction. The Provost Marshal had the authority to regulate military and civilian life under martial law with great authority. He could jail, punish, or even execute offenders of military law.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{346b3564-689b-4227-ba0c-b547ca5342b3}{14}\" paraid=\"1506107733\">This November 1864 report from Philip Sheridan to Major General Halleck demonstrates Sheridan’s scorched-earth policy: “I will soon commence on Loudoun County, and let them know there is a God in Israel. By loss of property and comforts they will cry for peace.” Young Charles Moulton of the 34th Massachusetts Regiment, a Provost clerk, noted Sheridan’s success against disloyal Loudoun County. “During the past few days, a large force of Sheridan’s Cavalry has been operating in Loudoun County and are destroying all the barns with contents, burning all the grain, hay, and cleaning the county all around of everything that possibly can afford shelter or aid to the prowling guerrilla bands that have infested the region for so long a time. I can see from the window now the reflection of the fire glowing on the horizon, showing how completely the work of devastation is being carried out.”</p>",

The Union Army alone blamed 50,000 deaths on diarrhea-dysentery, a sum larger than \"killed in action\". In his 1862 “Culinary Hints for the Soldier,” Captain James Sanderson stated, \"Cleanliness is next to godliness, both in persons and kettles. Be ever industrious, then in scouring your pots...Beans killed more than bullets; and fat is more fatal than powder.\" </p> <p paraeid=\"{9d99f199-22b6-418b-82e4-15b1ca0691a5}{52}\" paraid=\"1218893495\">Diet kitchens operating under US Army surgeons’ control were supplied mainly through hospital commissaries and supplemented with delicacies and other necessities by the U.S. Christian Commission. All patients who did not receive meals from the general kitchen, received special diet kitchen meals by surgeons’ orders. Experienced and competent women attached to the USCC managed these kitchens. Before war’s end, more than one hundred diet kitchens were in service. Diet kitchens issued over 2 million rations during the last 18 months of the war. These diet kitchen services likely saved thousands of soldiers' lives. Coffee-wagons and “special diet-kitchens” were organized for the convalescent. The USCC estimated that their work during the war cost more than 6.25 million dollars.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9d99f199-22b6-418b-82e4-15b1ca0691a5}{106}\" paraid=\"1366479238\">The USCC played a role in Harpers Ferry during the Civil War. One of the citizens of Harpers Ferry, Mary Roeder, left her home after the death of her father, Frederick, and married a man named Kerns. As she and her family returned to their home throughout the Civil War, they often found it occupied by federal soldiers. The Roeder/Kerns family continued their support of the Union by offering food and medical supply storage to the USCC in their buildings here on Potomac Street in the lower town of Harpers Ferry.</p>",

Both Roeder and his wife had died, leaving their children orphans. In fact, Roeder was the town’s first casualty of war, shot by a sniper. The oldest daughter, 17-year-old Mary, became head of household. She and her brothers and sisters became refugees of war, vacating and then returning to this family home repeatedly when hostile forces left the town. During the war, this building served as a military post office for the Union Army and as the headquarters for Colonel DeWitt Clinton Baxter and his 72nd Pennsylvania Fire Zouaves, a volunteer unit largely made up of former Philadelphia firemen.   <br />  <br /> Today, Mr. Roeder’s story is found only in an obscure local history book and in some musty claims records in the National Archives. His story is the story of thousands of civilians, communities and families innocently caught in the crossfire of war. They have no battle honors, and their names embellish no army rolls, but they also paid a price for our country’s unity and freedom. Most of them have no monument or place to tell their story except, perhaps, an unvisited tombstone. We offer you this Christmas setting at his restored home as a way to preserve his memory and his family’s sacrifice to their country.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{80b08b6c-14bb-48d5-8584-f7c507489886}{126}\" paraid=\"246292380\">We hope that these images of Christmas past and present may, in true Dickensian fashion, create a brighter Christmas future yet to come, so that all of humanity may truly enjoy peace on earth and goodwill toward all.</p>",

By the last war time Yuletide of 1864, it was clear that the war would determine the freedom of four million enslaved Americans, alongside the union of the states. The same United States that captured Brown and his supporters in 1859 assumed the role of Brown’s envisioned liberating army that never materialized at Harpers Ferry. With Lincoln’s election in 1860 and the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Brown’s dream of an army marching for freedom became a reality.",

And yet we know from history and from our present-day experience that the two exist side by side. Everyone is ready for peace and the journey home during December 1864, but the soldiers must complete their tasks, load the quartermaster wagons, send them to the front, end a protracted war, and free four million enslaved people. </p> <p paraeid=\"{32d4c56d-2bf0-4182-bfb5-f10a734e387e}{51}\" paraid=\"916069040\">Flagg’s Quartermaster operation had been active at Harpers Ferry throughout the Civil War, but during 1864, Harpers Ferry became a major supply center for a military campaign involving tens of thousands of troops. Burned out armory buildings were re-roofed and turned into packed warehouses. Thousands of horses were stabled in the area, and a cavalry remount camp set up in the vicinity. Supply trains of as many as 1000 wagons a day left or arrived at Harpers Ferry. The wagons, loaded and maneuvered by 300 employees (both white and Black), contained everything to feed, arm, and clothe the army. The Quartermaster General's Department was the supply section of the U.S. Army. It procured, transported, and distributed practically all military items, including clothing, blankets, tentage, horses, wagons, lumber, tools, cooking and eating utensils, nails, paint, pens, candles, and even stationery. Anything a soldier carried was either sent from home, bought, stolen, or issued from the Quartermaster. </p> <p paraeid=\"{92313c8c-9178-42e3-b845-83a8136d557e}{52}\" paraid=\"1978525617\">Both the towns of Bolivar Heights and Harpers Ferry were consumed by the Quartermaster operation. Bolivar Heights had become a congested wagon park, filled with mules and swearing teamsters. Fields were white as snow with army tents and the canvas covers of hundreds of wagons and ambulances. Railroads were used to capacity. Eventually, General Sheridan ordered that all troops destined for his army should be armed at Harpers Ferry. All this happened in an environment where Confederate raiders attacked supply wagons, trains, and railroads. </p>",

In 1747, a group of Quakers secured his services to erect a meeting house in the Shenandoah Valley near present-day Winchester, Virginia. Traveling through Maryland on his way to the Shenandoah Valley, Harper visited \"The Hole\" where the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers meet. He noticed the ample waterpower and strategic location for travel and transport, and he obtained 125 acres in 1751.<br /> <br /> Twelve years later, in 1763, the Virginia General Assembly established the town of \"Shenandoah Falls at Mr. Harper's Ferry.\" In 1775, Harper commenced construction of a new home in the Lower Town. The structure was completed in 1782, but Harper, who died that same year, never lived in the house.<br /> Today, the Harper House is the oldest surviving structure in the Lower Town.</p>",

        "notes": "Storer College\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/storer-college.htm\n\n<p>Following the Civil War there were over 30,000 newly freed slaves in the Shenandoah Valley. Recognizing the need for education, the Freedmen’s Bureau, the Freewill Baptists of New England and John Storer came together and Storer College was born. The school survived for 88 years, enriching the lives of hundreds of students.<br /> <br /> Of the four million people freed by the 13th Amendment at the end of the Civil War, most wanted two things—find family members and get an education. A small school in Harpers Ferry soon became a shining example of educational outreach and accomplishment. What began as a one-room missionary school for former slaves grew into a college open to both sexes and all races. <br /> <br /> The driving force behind the mission school was Nathan Brackett. With his wife and four teachers, all possessed with boundless energy and missionary zeal, and Lockwood House as a base of operations, Brackett set up primary schools throughout the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. By 1867 Brackett supervised 16 teachers and schools for 2,500 students in the Shenandoah Valley.</p> <p>The mission grew despite some stiff local resistance. White people tried everything from mob violence to vandalism and slanderous newspaper articles to pulling political strings to shut down the schools. One teacher wrote, “It is unusual for me to go to the post office without being hooted at and twice I have been stoned on the streets at noonday.” Nothing seemed to stop the teachers and their students from going forward. Fifty years later Nathan Brackett’s daughter, also a teacher, said, “Though storms of misunderstanding might rage outside the gate, within the campus all was calm and quiet. It was a little heaven.”</p>   <h4>A New Beginning</h4> <p>The Freewill Baptist mission school in Harpers Ferry came to the attention of John Storer, a wealthy businessman in Maine. Storer offered a $10,000 matching grant to the Freewill Baptists. An intense effort to raise donations, mortgage assets and seek government funds added up to $10,000 the day before Storer’s offer expired. <br /> <br /> Storer College created a safe place for education in a world where none had existed before. It was a place to learn to read and write, to teach others, and to develop marketable skills. By 1869 the college expanded across Camp Hill in Harpers Ferry and added three more government buildings. Fundraising slowly resulted in more campus buildings as enrollment grew and African American teachers and ministers joined the faculty. <br /> <br /> Of all the benefits that Storer provided to its students, perhaps the most valuable was a sense of community. The college owned land in and around the town and profited from a summer boarding house business. By leveraging funds and selling surplus property to graduates and their families, Storer College enabled 75% of Harpers Ferry’s black citizens to own real estate. In 1892 the school newspaper declared, “When the time comes that the colored people of the South live in their own houses, cultivate their own farms, and read their own ballots, there will no longer be a race problem.” Another valuable sense of community extended far beyond physical property. As one former student put it, “Here you will gain new understanding of community living and of friendships.”<br /> <br /> Students’ children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren found a haven of hope in the dark days of segregation. Graduates left Storer with the education, training, and perhaps most importantly, a sense of self-worth to make their way in an unsympathetic society.</p> <h4>The End</h4> <p>In 1954, the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board decision ended segregation in public schools. The next year West Virginia’s Board of Education recommended ending the $20,000 annual stipend for Storer. The board preferred to support state sponsored schools that were centrally located with modern buildings and more students, and without debt and religious overtones. Finally, Storer College closed its doors in 1955. The school had provided an education to more than 7,000 students.<br /> <br /> It’s hard to convey the immense effort it took to open, grow and sustain Storer College for nearly 90 years. Storer is a heroic story of overcoming seemingly insurmountable problems, and it is a testament to the courage, faith, vision and hard work of its founders, administrators, students, alumni and supporters.</p> <h4>The Legacy of Storer College</h4> <p>A very small school started in 1865 with a straightforward mission: to provide an education to former slaves. For 25 years Storer College was the only school in West Virginia where any person of color could get an education beyond the primary level. In a quiet though important way, Storer symbolized something seldom seen today; the epitome of selflessness and a willingness to sacrifice for the benefit of mankind. The students and staff embodied the Storer College motto:<br /> <i></i></p> <p><i>Labor Omnia Vincit</i><br /> (Work Conquers All)</p>",

Baldwin, a Baltimore resident, built 136 train stations and more than 500 other buildings during a 50-year career. <br /> <br /> Throughout the years, the depot has been altered many times and moved from its original location overlooking the scenic confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers in 1931, as a part of a series of railroad improvements, and now sits on part of the old Armory foundations.<br /> <br /> *Parking is extremely limited at this site.

In 1859 there were 100,000 weapons stored in the arsenal buildings, which played a role in the John Brown raids. Brown intended to use firearms seized at Harpers Ferry to commence a war to end slavery, but failed to do so. Sixteen months later, at the outbreak of the Civil War, only 15,000 weapons were stored at Harpers Ferry. The years between John Brown's raid and the Civil War, the majority of the arms at the United State Arsenal were distributed to Southern states under the instruction of Secretary of War John B. Floyd, a politician who was loyal to Southern interests.<br /> <br /> When Virginia seceded from the Union, in 1861, Governor John Letcher ordered the Virginia militia to seize the armory and arsenal at Harpers Ferry. Captain Turner Ashby led the militia towards Harpers Ferry and once they were close they could hear an explosion. The two arsenal buildings were set ablaze by the retreating Union forces, under Lt. Roger Jones command, and 15,000 weapons were destroyed.<br /> <br /> Close to 100 years after the Civil War, the National Park Service's archeologists discovered the original foundations of the two arsenal buildings, which buried for generations. They also found thousands of pieces of burned weapons, which included melted and twisted barrels, bayonets, ramrods, and lock plates. Today the arsenal ruins are outlined to attain a better understanding of their role in Harpers Ferry's history.</p>",

The tavern's close proximity easily tempted armory workers to raise a glass, or two...or three, before and during work. As a result, Armory officials took a stand that public houses, such as the White Hall Tavern, ruined morals, work ethics, and even threatened armory production. Crowded building conditions posed another threat -- fire. In 1856 the U.S. Government purchased and removed the front section of the building. They subsequently widened the street, creating the needed safety buffer around the Armory.</p>",

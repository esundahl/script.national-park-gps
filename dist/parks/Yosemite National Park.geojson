The Army was well-suited for the work. Troops patrolled the park’s backcountry to ensure the land was protected from illegal grazing, poaching, and logging. Each summer, over 200 soldiers, usually cavalry, rode from the Presidio of San Francisco to protect both Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. In 1899, 1903, and 1904, African-American buffalo soldiers also served in the Sierra Nevada.</p> <p>Yosemite encompasses vast areas of rugged, roadless terrain. To access such remote places for patrolling, Army officers trained in engineering at West Point supervised the construction of vital infrastructure such as roads, trails, and buildings. These challenging construction efforts gave birth to Yosemite’s backcountry trail system, used by hikers today.</p> <p>The Acting Superintendent’s Office was the headquarters for the Army officer in charge of Yosemite National Park. This building was originally constructed at Camp A.E. Wood, the present-day site of the Wawona Campground. Named after Captain Abram Epperson Wood, the first Army officer to serve as Acting Superintendent of Yosemite National Park, Camp A.E. Wood was the summer home for U.S. Army troops from 1891 through 1905. In 1906, the State of California returned Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to the federal government to be managed as part of Yosemite National Park, and the headquarters moved to Yosemite Valley. Later this building was moved to the Yosemite History Center.</p>",

During the winter, Anderson lived in this modest cabin, which was originally located in Big Meadow (now Foresta).</p> <p>Anderson applied his skills as a blacksmith and trail builder to open new pathways for sharing the beauties of Yosemite. His most daunting challenge was to find a way to the “perfectly inaccessible” summit of Half Dome, and through persistence, innovation, and guts, Anderson became the first known person known to have accomplished that feat. On that final steep slab of Half Dome, Anderson drilled holes and hammered in iron bolts of his own making, precariously standing on each bolt while painstakingly driving in the next. Shortly after his first ascent of Half Dome, Anderson began guiding others to the top.</p> <p>Besides creating this adventurous and popular hiking route up Half Dome, Anderson also built several other famous trails in Yosemite, including sections of the Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Fall.</p>",

After visiting Yosemite for the first time in 1898, Jorgensen was granted permission to build a home and a studio on the banks of the Merced River in Yosemite Valley (near today's Sentinel Bridge). From this summer home, Jorgensen produced paintings of his famous surroundings. For twenty years, he lived among the towering cliffs and waterfalls with his wife and fellow artist Angela.</p> <p>Chris Jorgensen often worked with watercolors, allowing for quick, spontaneous paintings to be completed in the field, rather than in the studio. He loved plein air painting, or painting outdoors. Beyond providing shade, the umbrella he holds in the image below helped with color perception in the harsh sunlight.</p> <p>The bungalow in the Yosemite History Center, part of Jorgensen's Yosemite property, represents an era when artists were some of the best advocates for the preservation of wild places. Yosemite’s landscapes inspired artists to create, and as they shared their art with those unable to experience nature’s beauty first-hand, their creations inspired others to preserve Yosemite as a public park.</p> <p>Even today, Yosemite stirs visitors to connect creatively with the landscape. Photos, paintings, and written accounts of Yosemite are now more popular, and more shareable, than ever.</p>",

Roads were rough on horses and riders. It took eight hours to travel approximately 25 miles from Wawona to Yosemite Valley. A four-up stage (a stage being drawn by four horses) changed horses four times during the trip. Consequently, 16 horses were used to make the journey. Blacksmiths shops were located throughout the park, and \"smithys\" offered valuable assistance with shoeing and stage repair. Early Yosemite tourists may never have completed the journey without the help of blacksmiths along the way.</p> <p>With a piece of red-hot iron, a hammer and an anvil, a blacksmith could design and create nearly anything made of iron, crafting the tools and parts that kept communities moving.</p> <p>Blacksmiths, once the lynchpin of Yosemite travel, still occasionally work in Yosemite to show their skills at the Blacksmith Shop in the Yosemite History Center (summer only).</p> <p> </p>",

At the end of the last glacial period, as with each post-glacial warming trend, huge volumes of water from melting glaciers flowed into Yosemite Valley, bringing tons of rock, gravel, sand, and silt. This debris slowly filled the shallow lake. A succession of bogs and marshes thrived before the meadows eventually appeared. In this warm interglacial phase, meadows were comprised of sedges, grasses, and many other small plants that depend upon a seasonally high water table and periodic flooding. Oaks, pines, and cedars grew around the drier edges.</p> <p>Look across the Valley for a view of Cook's Meadow. A myriad of meadow vegetation supports a large population of gophers, ground squirrels, mice, birds, and bats. Some larger animals living here are coyote, deer, bear, bobcat, and gray fox. Reptiles, amphibians, and numerous insects thrive above ground and in the deep organic remains of these meadow plants.</p> <p>People have appreciated this area for thousands of years. As you walk to the next stop, see if you can imagine this place without vehicles, buildings, and roads.</p>",

The rock's story begins about 100 million years ago with granitic magma deep within the earth. This molten material was formed from older continental rock, as it was over-ridden by the westward-moving North American Plate. About 35 million years ago, dramatic uplift began that eventually raised the Sierra Nevada to its current height. Within the last several million years, fluctuations in temperature produced periods of glaciation over much of the Northern Hemisphere.</p> <p>In mountain areas, rivers of ice, sometimes thousands of feet thick, flowed down canyons and stream courses. In Yosemite Valley, where the granites contained vertical cracks and joints, the moving ice masses tore away the fractured rock and moved it down the Merced River canyon. The ice in this Valley was once over 5,000 feet deep and covered everything you can see except the top 800 feet of Half Dome and the top of Eagle Peak just west of Yosemite Falls. Approximately 14,000 years ago, a warming trend began. The receding ice left behind a dam of rock and gravel across the western end of the Valley. As the glacier continued to melt away, a shallow lake formed. Imagine swimming to the next stop where you will discover what happened to that ancient lake.</p>",

Here, the 3,000-foot-high cliffs trap warm air in the summer and funnel cold air down Merced and Tenaya canyons in the winter. The cliffs also shade half of the Valley because of the low-angled winter sun.</p> <p>The Sierra Nevada enjoys a \"Mediterranean\" climate, which means relatively dry summers and wet winters. As snow melts in late spring, the flow rate of Yosemite Falls (and noise level) may be 20 times greater than it is in autumn. In winter, spray from Upper Yosemite Fall freezes and forms great sheets of ice against the cliff wall. During warm days, large panes of ice come loose and crash to the base. Over several weeks, water continues to freeze and builds a spectacular ice cone much higher than the tallest trees surrounding you.</p> <p>Yosemite Valley's weather generates seasonal change in its meadows. During winter, meadow grasses and sedges mat down beneath several feet of snow. In spring, new shoots emerge quickly and within a month the fresh, green meadow plants are already hiding the brown remnants of the previous year. Many people expect to see abundant spring wildflowers, but the densely growing sedges in these wet meadows inhibit showy displays. Throughout spring and summer, stripes and ripples of many shades of green indicate wetter and dryer regions, delineating floodways and former Merced River channels.</p> <p>As you walk to the next stop, can you identify the former river channel along this portion of the meadow?</p>",

Within three years, the first hotel was established, and within ten years, there were four more. Look toward Lower Yosemite Fall and notice the swath in the trees. Early hotel owners cleared this section of forest so guests could easily see Lower Yosemite Fall. Most of the meadows were fenced, plowed, grazed, and sown to grass for hay. Over 1,000 apple trees were planted and still exist in some areas of the Valley.</p> <p>Prior to 1916, anyone with a little capital could set up a business in Yosemite Valley. From 1858 to the present, eighteen hotels and inns have been built in many parts of the Valley. Other conveniences such as saloons, boathouses, photographic studios, laundries, and livery stables once dotted the landscape. In the early 1900s, less than 10,000 people per year visited this Valley. Most of them complained of dust from wagon wheels and hoofed animals, smells made by the livestock, and landscapes spoiled by farming and grazing. There were telegraph and telephone wires, power poles, and poor sewer systems. At that time, an awareness was growing that special places should be spared from these types of intrusions.</p> <p>The Organic Act of 1916 established the National Park Service and set its purpose \"...to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"</p> <p>Past generations had the foresight to protect this land and now our generation must improve upon and continue that legacy.</p> <p>As you walk to the next stop, try to imagine what sorts of threats--both natural and human-caused--people feared could harm the Valley.</p>",

For example, early visitors to Yosemite misunderstood the essential role of fire, viewing it as merely destructive and dangerous and responding to it with alarm and fear. We now understand that suppressing natural lightning-caused fires can ultimately harm the plants and animals that have adapted to it. The place in which you now stand exemplifies the ill effects of past fire suppression policies.</p> <p>Look at the surrounding old oak trees that are shadowed by taller, neighboring pines and cedars. Weakened from competition for sunlight, the oaks are vulnerable to heart rot, root rot, and predatory insects. Prior to years of fire suppression, natural fires once cycled through portions of the Valley every 15 to 20 years. These fires created conditions in which the oaks would thrive.</p> <p>Modern scientific research continues to determine how best to simulate natural fire conditions. At present, fire management teams oversee a prescribed fire program that returns fire to each meadow every 5 to 8 years. Fire contributes valuable nutrients to the soil for meadow grasses and sedges and also kills young pine saplings. In the last 150 years, the total meadow area in this Valley has dwindled from over 800 acres to fewer than 400 because of the gradual invasions by surrounding pines and cedars.</p> <p>Besides periodic fires, meadow and wetland plants need periodic flooding and the formation of high water tables. As you walk to the next stop, see if you can locate sources of water for this environment.</p>",

Archeological evidence suggests that about 4,000 years ago American Indian people established permanent settlements here. The oak grove you are in now may have been a principal winter village area. Acorns from the black oaks were a main food source for the area's first people, known as the Ahwahneechee. A typical family would consume as many as 500 pounds of acorns per year.</p> <p>Look up at \"Cholok,\" Yosemite Falls, and imagine you are a part of a band gathering seeds, roots, bulbs, and fruits for food, or woody materials for baskets, cordage, and tools. Some of your group are hunting deer, or trapping rodents and birds, or taking trout from the river. Your people are trading with others to the west (in the winter) and to the east (in the summer).</p> <p>For generations, native people lived and died on this land that they loved and cared for, but on March 27, 1851 their way of life was disrupted forever. An organized group of miners calling themselves the Mariposa Battalion tried to remove the Ahwahneechees from Yosemite. Many natives fled to the high country through Indian Canyon. You can see Indian Canyon (also called Lehemite) from this location. It is the first deep canyon to the right of Yosemite Falls. Despite this initial displacement, their culture survived. Later, some gradually returned, found employment, and lived together in small groups here in the Valley. Today, Indian people living in nearby counties demonstrate cultural traditions to park visitors and meet regularly in Yosemite Valley for ceremonies and other social activities.</p>",

The cliffs and waterfalls will remain well into the future no matter what humans do. Changes caused by 150 years of tourism were rapid and damaging to the natural environment. Now with more deliberation, research, and care, it is clear that some resource damage can be corrected while enhancing the visitor experience. This may mean a change in the way we visit and experience this place. Changes in the future will help protect and restore the natural environment. The health of meadows, woodlands, and the river will improve. People of the world continue to increase their understanding, respect, and love of natural places, so the support needed to carry this work into the future seems assured.</p> <p>Can we learn from our experience here what it means to live harmoniously within landscapes and their natural and essential processes?

Perhaps the future success of preservation in Yosemite will depend upon sensitivity to the wonders of nature wherever we live.

In the meadow to the left of the trail is an old river channel where yellow water lilies grow in the summer months. Every spring during high water, the Merced River reclaims this channel and water flows across this trail. Early hotel owners sought to drain areas like this to reduce mosquito ponds and dry the meadows enough to plow for hay production.</p> <p>The main Merced River channel is south of the trail. Its flow changes dramatically with the seasons. Runoff from melting snow is most volumninous in May. By August or September, Yosemite Falls is usually dry and the river flow is less than one percent of its spring maximum. Major floods occurred five times in the 20th century. Although flooding may be inconvenient for us, these waters are vitally important to meadows, wetlands, riparian zones, and river systems.</p> <p>The Merced River Plan provides direction for the protection and enhancement of this Wild and Scenic River and all of its \"Outstandingly Remarkable Values.\" Facilities will be removed from the floodplains where possible, and valuable natural habitat along the river will be restored. These include the immediate riparian areas - trees and shrubs along the riverbank - and meadow wetlands where the diversity of plants and animals is greatest.

Although it may not seem obvious today, Cook's Meadow was once one of the Valley's most developed areas. This spot also exemplifies how trees obscure many historic views. One hundred years ago, this cluster of trees was open meadow. New park plans call for reclaiming priceless, natural beauty and allowing natural processes to prevail. Now, interestingly, humans will affect change for the sake of restoration. Cook's Meadow has already been the focus of two important restoration projects - an old building site was re-contoured in 1993, and an old roadbed was removed in 1998. A wonderful surprise emerged when imported fill material was removed during the restoration: many species of native plants, including some rare and endangered species, sprouted from seeds dormant for nearly a century. These newly restored areas are carefully monitored and what is learned here will be applied to future meadow restoration projects.</p>",

The original tent cabins had tent flaps for entry and exit. The design transitioned to doors began taking place in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Constructed in 1904, it predates many of the Rustic buildings in Yosemite. As such, its massing and use of materials maintain some distinction from other designs throughout Yosemite. In particular, the shape of the roofline and wraparound covered deck are uncommon features of the area. Inside, exposed trusses along with paneled walls and ceilings set the design of this building apart from other rustic interiors in the park.</p> <p>The modern-day registration building was constructed as a post office in 1920 and shares many aesthetic similarities with the modern-day lounge building.

Mountain living proved tough at first. The family first lived in an abandoned barn and had to carry household water from a nearby stream in a five-gallon oil can. Shortly after, they built their own house, which included plumbing.</p> <p>To support her growing family, Bridget began selling bread and baked goods from her home while raising eight children. With increasing numbers of tourists visiting Yosemite, Bridget helped meet food service demands by baking up to fifty loaves of bread a day in her small household oven. From her porch, she sold bread and home-cooked meals to Yosemite locals and toursits, each loaf selling for 12½ cents.</p> <p>Around 1898, the Degnans built a larger home and Bridget purchased a large brick commercial dutch oven for a more permanent bakery. She could then bake 400 loaves a day, and began serving full meals on her front porch to locals and park visitors. Her bakery (pictured below) was originally connected to their family home near the chapel in Yosemite Valley and is an important reminder of Yosemite's early visitor services. Bridget's legacy continued when her children opened an even bigger bakery in 1958, still open today as Degnan's Kitchen in Yosemite Village. It remained family-owned until 1972.</p>",

The Degnan family were Irish immigrants who settled in Yosemite Valley in the late nineteenth century. Bridget Degnan baked bread to sell to tourists and residents. Her initially small operation grew to a substantial enterprise.</p> <p>During Mission 66, Degnan’s was still a family-operated business also known as Degnan-Donohue, Inc. Frank Donohue, Bridget Degnan’s grandnephew, led the business at the time of Mission 66. Donohue agreed to the National Park Service’s request to construct a modern facility, continuing the Degnan’s legacy. Donohue partnered with well-known mid-century modern architect Frank Lloyd Wright to draft a design for the new Degnan’s building. Much to Wright’s chagrin, the National Park Service rejected the proposed design, deeming it too futuristic. Director Conrad Wirth famously critiqued Wright’s design by calling it “a mushroom dome type of thing.</p> <p>”Walter Wagner and Partners, a firm from Fresno, created the distinct A-frame structure we know today. Its floor-to-ceiling windows are a signature of mid-century park designs, and the prominent wood elements and interior fireplace remind the visitor of a mountain lodge.</p>",

Half Dome is one of the most well-known features in Yosemite. To understand how this impressive feature formed, we have to journey back in time again, this time about one hundred million years ago, when the granitic bedrock of Yosemite was forming.<br /> <br /> Yosemite looked very different one hundred million years ago. Towering volcanoes existed here then making up a vast mountain chain similar to the modern Andes Mountains in South America. Deep below the volcanoes, the slipping of one tectonic plate under another created pools of hot, fluid rock called magma. Some of the magma rose to the surface and erupted from the volcanoes, but most of it cooled very slowly deep below the surface, forming the large, interlocking crystals that make up the granite of Yosemite. You may be wondering how rocks that formed miles below the surface are now exposed on the surface. Over tens of millions of years, the towering volcanoes were slowly eroded away, removing a great weight that caused the granitic rocks to rise, eventually revealing them surface. The material eroded from the volcanoes was transported west to the Central Valley of California, where the sediment is miles thick - a hidden but impressive testament to the power of erosion.<br /> <br /> After the granite of Half Dome was revealed, erosional forces set upon sculpting it further. Chief among these erosional forces were glaciers, which repeatedly scraped along both sides of Half Dome, steepening the slopes. A large vertical fracture in the granite formed a weakness that glaciers could exploit, leading to the sheer face of Half Dome. The summit of Half Dome was never overtopped by glaciers, so its rounded shape results from a different kind of erosion called exfoliation. Exfoliation is the process by which slabs of rock break and peel away along curving parallel fractures similar to the skins of an onion. On the sheer face of Half Dome, exfoliation causes rockfalls that occur every few years.<br /> <br /> Please follow the path to your left toward the Merced River to find the next stop. As you walk to the next stop, think back to the sign we saw at the beginning and recall that image of Yosemite Valley underwater. How does that image contrast with the Merced River that you see today?</p>",

        "notes": "Geology Tour - John Muirs Rockfall Experience\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/geology-tour-john-muir-s-rockfall-experience-stop-7.htm\n\n<p>On March 26, 1872 the famed naturalist and conservationist, John Muir, was sleeping in a cabin nearby when he was shaken awake by a strong earthquake. This quake, known as the Owens Valley earthquake, was one of the largest earthquakes in California's history, with a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter scale. This earthquake originated near the town of Lone Pine and shook most of eastern California and parts of Nevada. John Muir recounted his experience that night.<br /> <br /> \"...one morning about two o'clock I was aroused by an earthquake; and though I had never before enjoyed a storm of this sort, the strange, wild thrilling motion and rumbling could not be mistaken, and I ran out of my cabin, both glad and frightened, shouting, \"A noble earthquake!\" feeling sure I was going to learn something. The shocks were so violent and varied, and succeeded one another so closely, one had to balance in walking as if on the deck of a ship among the waves...<br /> Then, suddenly, out of the strange silence and strange motion there came a tremendous roar. ... and I saw ... falling ... thousands of ... great boulders ...pouring to the valley floor in a free curve luminous from friction, making a terribly sublime and beautiful spectacle-an arc of fire fifteen hundred feet span, as true in form and as steady as a rainbow, in the midst of the stupendous roaring rock-storm. It seemed to me that if all the thunder I ever heard were condensed into one roar it would not equal this rock roar at the birth of a mountain talus.\"<br /> <br /> The arc of fire that Muir saw was due to a phenomenon call triboluminescence. This occurs when quartz strikes against more quartz, creating sparks. As granite contains abundant quartz, the grinding and pulverizing of rocks as they tumbled down the cliff looked to Muir like streaks of orange fireworks. As you look towards the cliff, many of the boulders you see are likely from this event. Many other rockfalls occurred in Yosemite that night as a result of the violent shaking, including one near Nevada Fall that knocked an old hotel there off its foundation. The rockfalls triggered by the 1872 earthquake are among the largest in Yosemite's recorded history but they are small compared to some ancient rockfalls that occurred deeper in Yosemite's past. The boulders on either side of the trail here are from a much larger rockfall than the one John Muir observed.<br /> <br /> When a rockfall occurs, it exposes a scar of fresh white granite on the cliff, and the resulting talus also gleams with fresh granite. You'll notice that most of the boulders along the trail here are covered with lichen and moss. This tells us that these boulders have been sitting here undisturbed for a very long time. In fact, we have dated this rockfall, using a technique that determines how long the boulders have been exposed on the surface, and we found that it occurred about 3,000 years ago. This rockfall was so large that it traveled all the way to the Merced River. Extremely large rockfalls like this are called rock avalanches. This particular rock avalanche is made up of nearly one and a half million tons of rock! We have dated the other rock avalanches in Yosemite and found that there is a strong link to earthquakes, just as John Muir observed on that fateful night in 1872. As you make your way to the final stop on this tour, look around at the vast field of boulders and imagine the chaos that took place here just a few thousand years ago.</p>",

Together these waterfalls plunge a total of 2,425 feet, or about 740 meters, making Yosemite Falls one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. Yosemite Falls is unlike other waterfalls in Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada. To illustrate what makes Yosemite Falls so different, we'll have to travel back in time hundreds of thousands of years to a time when glaciers filled Yosemite Valley to the rim.<br /> <br /> Glaciers are masses of ice that form from the accumulation of snow, and that flow downhill under their own weight. As they move, glaciers scrape and pluck at the bedrock, excavating and transporting huge amounts of sediment. When glaciers melt, they drop the rocky debris they had been carrying in mound-like ridges called moraines.<br /> <br /> There have been many glacial periods over the last few million years, glaciers repeatedly advanced into Yosemite Valley from the high country and then retreated back. The most recent time that a glacier occupied Yosemite Valley was about 20,000 years ago. At that time, the glacier extended to as far west as Bridal Veil Fall and reached about two-thirds of the way up the cliffs. Earlier glacial periods were larger, with glaciers extending west as far as the town of El Portal and reaching the rim of Yosemite Valley.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Yosemite Creek didn't leap directly off the cliff, but rather cascaded down the steep gully that you can see to the left of the falls. What caused the creek to shift position? We can't see it from here, but behind Yosemite Falls there is a moraine left behind by one of those ancient glaciers. The moraine diverted the Yosemite Creek from its path down the steep gully and forced it directly off the cliff. This unique geological accident created one of the tallest waterfalls in the world and one of the most iconic features in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> As you walk to the next stop make some observations about the ground surface that surrounds the trail.</p>",

This picturesque view may seem timeless, but in fact it is just a quick snapshot in time. Yosemite's landscape is the result of millions of years of change, and that change continues today. Even at this moment, that granite giant is slowly wearing away from the forces of water and wind, and sometimes falling away catastrophically. Some of that material makes up the sediment particles in the riverbed before you slowly drifting along in the current and sometimes sweeping away in floods. Take a moment to reflect on the natural processes that continue to shape the awe-inspiring landscape around you. Thanks for joining me today.

Some of the talus boulders can be quite large. These boulders were once a part of the cliff face and broke loose in events called rockfalls in which boulders fall, bounce and roll down the cliffs and talus piles. The gigantic boulder in front of you now is from a rockfall that occurred about 3,000 years ago. This boulder is one of the largest you will see in Yosemite Valley but boulders like this are actually fairly common. All of them represent past rockfalls. Since glaciers retreated from Yosemite Valley, rockfalls became the dominant geological force eroding the cliffs and they still occur today. Rockfalls happen year-round, with an average of about one event every five days. As of 2020, there have been 16 deaths and more than one hundred injuries related to rockfalls in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> Geologists study rockfalls to help the Park Service reduce risk. Research has identified areas in Yosemite Valley at the highest risk from rockfalls. The Park Service use this information to move buildings out of these areas or changed how the buildings are used. These efforts led to a 95% reduction in risk from rockfalls. However, that does not mean people are completely safe. Rockfalls are inherently unpredictable, in part because there are many natural forces that can trigger rockfalls, ranging from rainfall to earthquakes. Rockfalls are a natural force shaping this landscape but they also present a hazard that we need to be aware of as we enjoy this beautiful park.<br /> <br /> As you walk along the trail east of the Chapel, take note of the large boulder field on both sides of the trail - what observations can you make about it?</p>",

I'd like to share some fun facts about Yosemite's geology that I hope will increase your appreciation for the natural beauty all around you.<br /> <br /> Let's begin by observing the sign before you that shows the floodwater level on January 2, 1997. The horizontal line on that sign marks the height of water during the largest and most damaging flood in Yosemite's recorded history. In your mind, extend that line across the valley and imagine floodwaters spread almost wall to wall.

However, on January 2, 1997 the Merced was a raging torrent. The 1997 flood is the most damaging in Yosemite's recorded history. In the center of the valley, floodwaters were more than 10 feet, or 3 meters, deep. The flood damaged roads and infrastructure, resulting in prolonged closure of Yosemite Valley. The metal marker attached to the bridge indicates the height of the five largest floods in recorded history. Compare your height to the flood water level of 1997 to get a sense of the depth of water above the bridge. Now compare it to the four other major floods. What do these floods all have in common besides their large size? Here's a hint: What time of year did these floods occur? That's right, they all occurred during the winter months.<br /> <br /> Yosemite, like the rest of California, receives most of its annual precipitation in just a few months, usually between November and March. During these cold winter months, especially at high elevations, the precipitation falls as snow. In the high country, snow depths can be tens of feet deep. Typically, the snow will melt as temperatures warm in the summer and the rivers gently rise in response. This means that there is usually a several month-long lag between the time when the snow falls and when the rivers rise. However, in some years warm, tropical storms originating near Hawaii make their way to California. The warm air accompanying these storms raises the snowline to a higher elevation. The snowline is an elevation line, controlled by air temperature, that divides rain from snow. In Yosemite, the wintertime snowline is usually around 6,000 feet, or about 1,800 meters, but during these warm storms, snowline can rise to 10,000 feet, or more than 3,000 meters, elevation. If the snowline is higher, this means that more rain is falling over the watershed instead of snow. You've probably seen heavy rain running off a parking lot. Well, heavy rain running off large areas of granite bedrock looks similar. The combination of heavy rain and melted snow across the entire watershed produces extreme flood events. It is under these conditions that the largest, most damaging floods in Yosemite's history have occurred. As global temperatures warm the snowline in Yosemite is likely to increase in elevation also increasing the likelihood of future floods.<br /> <br /> Our next stop is at a huge boulder behind the Chapel, across Southside Drive. To get there, please use one of the two crosswalks crossing Southside Drive and watch for cars. The trail picks up at the far end of the parking lot next to the Chapel.</p>",

As you near its base, look at the fires scars that remain. Fire plays a very important role in the growth of a giant sequoia.<br /> <br /> Giant sequoias have a dependency on natural fires for reproduction, which was not understood until the early 1960s. Lightning-caused fires reduce the competition from other evergreens, burn away the leaf litter on the forest floor, and leave a thin layer of nutrient-rich ash over the mineral soil, creating perfect conditions for seedlings to sprout. Look at the forest floor around you. Can you see the soil? Or, do you see leaf litter covering the soil?<br /> <br /> Also, the heat from a fire dries some of the mature trees' green sequoia cones, causing a shower of fresh seeds to fall onto a perfectly-prepared seedbed. When winter comes, snow blankets the Mariposa Grove. As the snowpack melts the following spring, sunlight, moisture, fresh seeds, ash, and mineral soil combine to create a sequoia nursery.<br /> <br /> To reduce the leaf litter and promote giant sequoia reproduction, the National Park Service began igniting \"prescribed burns,\" that are deliberately set and closely monitored by rangers, during spring and fall. When the forest returns to a more natural state, these management fires will most likely be discontinued. Then nature can resume its cycle of lightning-caused fires every five to twenty years.

Thomas “Tom” Hodgdon acquired land for grazing cattle in Aspen Valley, now within Yosemite National Park. In 1879, Tom hired workers to build an access road, and a two-story cabin, on the land. To build the two-story log cabin, he hired a Chinese American cowboy named Ah Hoy and a neighbor named Franklin Babcock. The Hodgdon family, ranchers from the San Joaquin Valley, grazed cattled on their homesteaded land in Aspen Valley each summer.</p> <p>Tom and family ran a ranching business, grazing cattle in nearby meadows. After these meadows became part of Yosemite National Park in 1890, U.S. Army troops enforced park regulations against grazing by dispersing cattle, and the Hodgdons lost grazing privileges. The family didn’t use the cabin for a while, and patrolling soldiers, and even Army horses, sheltered inside occasionally.</p> <p>No longer able to earn a living with livestock in Yosemite, the Hodgdon family adapted to make money from tourism. In 1882, as part of the Great Sierra Wagon Road, the Hodgdons’ access road was improved upon by Chinese workers, and extended to Tioga Pass for silver mining. When the Tioga Road opened to the public, tourist traffic increased through Aspen Valley. The Hodgdon family used their cabin, and created a complex of new buildings, used for tourist lodging. Eliza Hodgdon, Tom’s spouse, added to the entrepreneurial effort by selling hot meals to hungry travelers.</p>",

Deafening in spring and early summer when the waterfall peaks in volume, you can expect to get sprayed with water when standing on the footbridge near its base. The falls are often only a trickle or completely dry by August, then are revived again by late fall storms. This short, easy walk rewards with spectacular views of both Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls.

About 1 trail mile from the trailhead, beyond the Vernal Fall Footbridge, the Mist Trail and the John Muir Trail diverge. Consider accessing Vernal and Nevada Fall via the Mist Trail, looping around and taking the John Muir Trail back down to the Valley. Prepare for slippery footing and a tremendous amount of waterfall spray in spring and early summer. See more information about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/vernalnevadatrail.htm\">trails</a>. </p> <h2>Water</h2> <p>Drinking water is available at shuttle stop #16, near the trailhead, and also at the Vernal Fall Footbridge (May to October). This is the only drinking water available along the trail, so carry plenty of water for your hike.</p> <h3>Amount of water to bring</h3> <p>Vernal Fall Footbridge 1 quart/liter<br /> Top of Vernal Fall 2 quarter/liters<br /> Top of Nevada Fall 3-4 quarts/liters</p> <h2>Restrooms</h2> <p>Restrooms are located at the shuttle stop, near the trailhead. Additionally, restrooms are located at the Vernal Fall footbridge, approximately 1 mile up the trail (May to October). Vault toilets are available beyond the top of Vernal Fall (along the Mist Trail) and at the top of Nevada Fall (along the Mist Trail).</p> <h2><b>Vernal Fall Footbridge</b> (Moderate)</h2> <p>1.6 miles (2.6 km) round trip; 1-1.5 hours<br /> 400 feet (120 m) elevation gain</p> <h2>Top of Vernal Fall (Strenuous)</h2> <p>2.4 miles (3.9 km) round trip (via Mist Trail); 3 hours<br /> 1000 feet (300m) elevation gain</p> <h2>Top of Nevada Fall (Strenuous)</h2> <p>5.4 miles (8.7 km) round trip (via Mist Trail); 5-6 hours<br /> 2,000 feet (610 m) elevation gain<br /> <br /> You can also take the John Muir Trail to the top of Vernal Fall (via the Clark Point cutoff) and the top of Nevada Fall, or combine the Mist Trail and John Muir Trail into a loop. See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/vernalnevadatrail.htm\">map</a>.</p> <h2>Hours</h2> <p>Year-round, however, the lower portion of the Mist Trail along Vernal Fall closes in winter due to risk of falling ice and rock. Also, the upper portion of the John Muir Trail between Clark Point and the top of Nevada Fall is closed in winter due to treacherously icy conditions. Keep in mind that the sections of trail that remain open in the winter may be very icy and/or snowy. View <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">current conditions</a> for trail closures.</p> <h2>Getting Here</h2> <p>Located at Happy Isles at shuttle stop #16. Follow the signs across the bridge to where the trail begins. There is no parking in the immediate area.</p> <h2>Rules & Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on the established trail: do not swim or wade in the river and do not walk along the edge of the river.</li> <li>Observe warning signs and railings - these exist for your safety.</li> <li>Pets, bicycles, and strollers are prohibited.</li> <li>Do not shortcut switchbacks, which causes rapid trail erosion and results in injuries.</li> <li>Keep your food within arm's reach at all times and do not feed the wildlife.</li> <li>Carry out all trash and food waste (fruit peels, shells, etc.).</li> </ul> <h2>Hazards & Warnings</h2> <p>Carry a head lamp (with fresh or extra batteries) in case you end up hiking more slowly or farther then planned and find yourself hiking back in the dark.<br /> Sprained ankles and knee injuries are common on this trail. There are many areas of loose rock/decomposed granite, mixed with steep steps, and water, which makes for slippery footing in places.</p> <p>Avoid becoming dehydrated or experiencing heat exhaustion. Drink plenty and drink often; pace yourself; rest in the shade; and eat salty snacks.</p> <p>The granite steps along the Mist Trail leading up to the brink of Vernal Fall can be slick and crowded. Consider making a loop by continuing on the trail, past the brink of Vernal Fall and Emerald Pool, taking the cutoff trail to Clark Point, and then hiking down the John Muir Trail.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>This trail is not accessible.</p>",

It was the job of these rangers to protect the natural resources, stop forest fires, and assist visitors. Their duties were made more difficult as automobiles had recently been allowed to enter the park.</p> <p>The ranger patrol cabin was built in 1915 to house rangers at Crane Flat, a busy road junction. Buildings such as this were used as automobile check stations. Here drivers paid a fee to enter the park and were informed of regulations. Along sections of the Big Oak Flat and Wawona roads, automobiles were only permitted to go east, downgrade, on odd hours and west, upgrade, on even hours. At Crane Flat and others Yosemite locations, rangers needed to live close to backcountry patrol routes and roadside stations where they assisted visitors arriving by automobile. In 1916 the National Park Service was created and the rangers living here became some of the first National Park Service Rangers.</p> <p>Gabriel Sovulewski, a Polish immigrant, embodied the administrative transition from the military to the National Park Service in Yosemite. He first saw Yosemite in 1895 while on a summer deployment to the park with the U.S. Army. In 1902, he left the Army and returned to Yosemite to work as a packer and guide. In 1906, Gabriel was placed in charge of Yosemite National Park, serving as the top park official for thirty years. During that time he directed the construction of trails and buildings such as the Ranger Patrol Cabin. Gabriel Sovulewski remained in Yosemite for the rest of his life, and is buried next to his wife, Rose in the Yosemite Cemetery.</p>",

Stephen T. Mather, the first director of the National Park Service, employed park rangers to guide tourists and protect the park from poachers. In 1920, Mather hired architect Charles Sumner to construct a home for members of his newly organized ranger force, paying $39,380 for the building out of his own pocket. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985 for significance in the development of the Rustic style and is still in use today as a home for seasonal rangers.</p> <p>Sumner designed a large, modified chalet with wood shingles and steeply pitched roofs. Instead of leaving simple corners, every edge of the building is defined with heavy log pilasters, strengthening the connection between the building and surrounding forest edges. The steep roofs shed the winter snows and emphasized the structure's verticality—an homage to the surrounding mountains.</p> <p>Rangers’ Club is a private residence, do not approach the building or disturb the residents.</p>",

As an experiment in construction methods, it was built with relatively fireproof materials. Instead of wood, concrete and granite was textured and stained to resemble redwood. The stately building combines rustic and art deco influences. The massing of a central tower and two wings, forming a “Y” shape, is unusual compared to other rustic-era park lodges. The vertical granite buttresses, piers, and chimneys reflect the granite cliffs of Yosemite Valley.</p> <p>In the original design, visitors would enter through the modern-day bar area. Shortly before the opening date, staff noticed that this entrance caused vehicle fumes to fill the hotel. Instead, contractors quickly constructed the covered walkway and porte-cochere entrance in use today.</p> <p>Drs. Phyllis Ackerman and Arthur Pope, renowned art historians, decorated the interior primarily with a bold array of American Indian art of the day. Ansel Adams aptly described the decor as a “miracle of color and design.”</p> <p>The Ahwahnee dining room represents a particularly grand example of rustic influences, with its massive ceilings and opulent but organic details. To preserve the building’s rich heritage, many recent projects have restored existing features and improved building safety to modern standards.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

        "notes": "Upper Yosemite Fall Trailhead\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/upper-yosemite-fall-trailhead.htm\n\n<h2>Overview</h2> <p>One of Yosemite's oldest historic trails (built 1873 to 1877), the Yosemite Falls Trail leads to the top of North America’s tallest waterfall, which rises 2,425 feet (739 m) above the Valley floor. This trail starts near Camp 4, along the Valley Loop Trail, and immediately begins its climb, switchback after switchback, through oak woodland. You will begin to climb above some trees and into exposed plateaus that offer you a glimpse of what's to come: great views of Yosemite Valley and its many iconic landforms. Do not stray off of the maintained path, as you will find steep drops adjacent to the trail.</p> <p>If you make the one-mile, 1,000 foot climb (via dozens of switchbacks) to Columbia Rock, you will be rewarded with spectacular views of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, and Sentinel Rock. From there, it is worth the time and energy to hike another 0.5 miles (0.8 km) (some of which is actually downhill!) to get a stunning view of Upper Yosemite Fall. Depending on the season, you may even feel the mist from the fall, which may be welcome respite after the tough climb.</p> <p>The upper half of the trail is steep and rocky, but the arduous climb is well worth the amazing views you will be rewarded with at the top. Here you may be surprised by the small size of Yosemite Creek, which feeds this massive waterfall. Use extreme caution when near the creek and remember you are directly above a waterfall.</p> <h3>Columbia Rock</h3> <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 2 miles (3.2 km) round trip<br /> <strong>Elevation:</strong> 1,000 ft (328 m) elevation gain<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate<br /> <strong>Time:</strong> 2-3 hours round trip<br /> <strong>Begin at:</strong> Camp 4 area (near shuttle stop #7)</p> <h3>Top of Yosemite Falls</h3> <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.2 miles (11.6 km) round trip<br /> <strong>Elevation:</strong> 2,700 ft (823 m) elevation gain<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous<br /> <strong>Time:</strong> 6-8 hours round trip<br /> <strong>Begin at:</strong> Camp 4 area (near shuttle stop #7)</p> <h2>Hours</h2> <p>Year-round.</p> <p>The Yosemite Falls Trail is open year-round; conditions vary depending on the season. In spring, when the waterfall is at its peak, this hike is stunning, and you may even get wet from the spray of the waterfall during a section of the hike. In summer, conditions are hot and dry, and the loose decomposed granite along the trail can be slippery. Keep in mind that by August, the water levels are low and you may only see a trickle here. During winter, the lower portion of this trail gets direct sunlight, so hiking can be snow-free while other trails are icy. Visiting Columbia Rock, located one mile up the trail, is a worthwhile trip at any time of year. The upper portion of this trail, which receives little to no sunlight in winter, can be very icy and slippery, or buried beneath feet of snow, making traction difficult. In winter, hiking in the colder early morning or late afternoon hours can be even more dangerous if the trail is icy.</p> <h2>Getting Here</h2> <p>Begin at the Yosemite Falls Trailhead, beyond the Camp 4 parking lot (Yosemite Valleywide shuttle stop #7)</p> <h2>Rules & Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>Pets and bicycles are only permitted on paved bike paths.</li> <li>Pack out what you pack in.</li> <li>Overnight backpackers need a wilderness permit, which can be obtained at the Yosemite Valley Wilderness Center.</li> <li>Bear canisters are required for wilderness food storage for overnight hikers.</li> </ul> <h2>Hazards & Warnings</h2> <ul> <li>Wading and/or swimming upstream from waterfalls is extremely dangerous. Each year, unsuspecting visitors drown or are swept over to their deaths.</li> <li>Stay on trails: taking shortcuts causes trail erosion-and is both dangerous and illegal.</li> <li>Carry (and drink) plenty of water: Be sure to treat river, stream, lake, or spring water.</li> <li>Be prepared for sudden changes in weather and conditions.</li> <li>Feeding and approaching wildlife is dangerous and illegal! Be sure to properly store your food.</li> <li>Rocks in and around waterways are often slippery. Use caution when crossing streams.</li> <li>During winter, the upper portion of this trail, which receives little to no sunlight, can be very icy and slippery, or buried beneath feet of snow, making traction difficult.</li> </ul> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>This trailhead and associated trail is not accessible.</p>",

Accommodations consist of 50 standard hotel rooms with private bath and 54 standard hotel rooms with shared restrooms. The hotel dining room serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. In the evening, wind down your fun filled day by gathering around the piano for musical performances in the lounge. Seasonal amenities include a nine-hole golf course, a swimming pool, and a riding stable.</p> <p>Galen Clark, a former gold prospector, built the first structure on this site. He built the simple log cabin along the original trail. Positioned to ensure a constant flow of foot traffic, it was built along the original trail into Yosemite Valley. Visitors would stop along the way to restock their provisions and rest before continuing their travels. From these humble beginnings, the Wawona Hotel came to be-attracting many famous travelers of the day, including President Theodore Roosevelt.</p> <h2>Hours</h2> <p>March to November and several weeks in December<br /> For opening dates see <a href=\"https://www.travelyosemite.com/lodging/big-trees-lodge/\">Website</a> .</p> <p>The front desk is staffed 24 hours a day.<br /> Check-in: 5 pm<br /> Check-out: 10 am</p> <h2><b>Getting Here</b></h2> <p>The Wawona Hotel is located 27 miles from Yosemite Valley on the Wawona Road (Highway 41).</p> <h2>Rules & Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>Smoking is strictly prohibited at all accommodations and buildings in Yosemite.</li> <li>There are no pets allowed on property.</li> </ul> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>All Lodging facilities in the park meet accessibility requirements.

The chapel was listed on the prestigious National Register of Historic Places in 1973.</p> <p>The Yosemite Chapel was originally erected near where the present Four Mile trailhead is located today. By 1901, the surrounding \"Lower Village\" had nearly disappeared, so the chapel was relocated to its present location in the Old Village. In 1965 some interior restoration was completed, and the foundation was raised 3 feet to help protect the structure from periodic flooding. In spite of these efforts, the chapel sustained damage during the 1997 flood and required further restoration.</p> <p>With a few minor exceptions, the Yosemite Chapel has been the park's sole church facility since its construction over 140 years ago.

The lodge is a transitional structure of strong European roots combined with the revolutionary way that Bay Area environmental designers used building materials.</p> <p>The lodge was built by the Sierra Club in 1903 at the base of Glacier Point at a cost of approximately $5,000. As Camp Curry expanded, the lodge was rebuilt in its current location in 1919.</p> <p>Architect John White donated his time to design the lodge. The building displays distinctive features of the First Bay Tradition, including its steeply pitched roof, emulating Yosemite Valley’s steep granite walls, and its use of local materials, such as granite and timber. The building’s steep roof pitch, masonry walls, and prominent chimney are also distinguishing features of the Tudor Revival style. The interior has a highly unusual, exposed roof structure of hammer beams supporting scissors trusses. The central fixture of the main lodge room is its massive stone fireplace.</p> <p>During relocation and rebuilding, contractors removed the roof and rebuilt the rest of the lodge in its new location using John White’s drawings. Some elements such as windows appear to have been salvaged and reused in the new building. Rough‐cut granite was brought from Madera County for the reconstructed lodge walls.</p>",

Take care on this crossing early in the season when the creek is high. Continue on the trail to Ten Lakes Pass, overlooking the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne and the Sierra Crest. Then descend 693 feet (211 m) into the Ten Lakes Basin, which contains a series of beautiful High Sierra lakes.<br /> <br /> <b>Yosemite Creek Trailhead</b><br /> This is a beautiful path that mostly follows Yosemite Creek to the rim of the Valley and Yosemite Falls. This trail drops about 2.6 miles through lodgepole pine stands before joining the trail from the Yosemite Creek Campground.

(740 m), and is one of the tallest waterfalls in the United States.</p> <h2>Source of the Falls</h2> <p>Yosemite Creek, which flows over this waterfall, is fed entirely by snow melt. At its peak in late spring, 2,400 gallons per second can flow over the lip of the upper fall. Yosemite Falls usually runs dry by late summer.</p> <h2>Ice Cone</h2> <p>In winter, a cone of ice accumulates at the base of Upper Yosemite Fall. The height of the cone can reach as high as 322 feet, about as tall as a 25-story building, and is usually melted by mid-April.</p> <h2>Moonbow</h2> <p>As the full moon rises in April and May, the light is captured and refracted in the massive spray at the base of Lower Yosemite Fall, creating a phenomenon called a moonbow.</p> <h2>Frazil Ice</h2> <p>In early spring, frazil ice sometimes forms in waterfalls and creeks when waterfall mist becomes very cool. Ice crystals form and group into spongy masses which sometimes overflow the creek bed. In 1997 frazil ice was above the railing of the Lower Yosemite Fall bridge, almost completely burying it!</p> <h2>Seasonality</h2> <p>While you can visit Yosemite Falls year-round, there is often no water in Yosemite Fall by late summer. </p> <h2>Getting Here</h2> <p>Yosemite Falls flows over the north rim of Yosemite Valley. Access to the base of the waterfall is located on Northside Drive, near the Lower Yosemite Falls shuttle stop (Valley Shuttle #6), and across from the Yosemite Valley Lodge. The walk to the base of the waterfall is an easy 1 mile (1.6 km) hike which can be done as a loop.</p> <p>Access to the top of Yosemite Falls is via the Upper Yosemite Fall Trail, located west of Lower Yosemite Fall near the Camp 4 Campground. Accessing the top of Yosemite Falls is a strenuous 7.2 mile (11.6 km) round-trip hike with 2,700 feet (823 m) of elevation gain. This trailhead can be accessed most easily by parking in the Yosemite Falls Parking Area or by using the free shuttle (Valley Shuttle #7). </p> <h2>Rules & Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>Share the trail! Leashed pets and strollers are allowed.</li> <li>Bicycles are prohibited. Numerous bicycle racks are located at the two trailheads (east and west side of the Lower Yosemite Fall loop) for your convenience.</li> <li>Keep your food within arm's reach at all times and do not feed the wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Hazards & Warnings</h2> <p>Stay on the paved trail. Above the wooden footbridge that crosses Yosemite Creek, the rocks and boulders are slippery even when dry. Scrambling off-trail in this area frequently leads to serious injuries.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>An accessible trail to access the base of Yosemite Falls is available near the shuttle stop. Only the eastern portion of the loop is accessible.  </p>",

The Yosemite Museum was the first building constructed as a museum in the national park system, and its educational initiatives served as a model for parks nationwide.</p> <p>It was constructed in the emerging village center, in which all buildings were to have a unified architectural theme. Maier described the relationship between the Museum and its natural surroundings by saying, “The elevation of the museum stresses the horizontal—that seemed the logic of the situation…to attempt altitudinal impressiveness here in a building would have meant entering into a competition with the cliffs.</p> <p>”Indigenous building material, such as native rocks, logs, and wood shingles, were utilized for all visible exterior parts. The architectural philosophy was that rustic style “gives the feeling of having been executed by pioneer craftsmen with limited hand tools. It thus achieves sympathy with natural surroundings and with the past.</p> <p>”The Museum differs from the others in that where the others have frame floors to the second stories (and ceilings to the first), the ground floor of the Museum is completely fireproof, separated from the frame second story by a thick concrete ceiling, a design factor resulting from its intended museum use with the purpose of preserving artifacts, specimens, and exhibits.</p>",

Many thought he was crazy to leave behind his landscape architecture work, and his father made sure Frederick knew his displeasure over the move. However, at the time no one could have known that this move would set the stage for the creation of parks from the natural domain.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{30}\" paraid=\"1014588677\">A year after his move to California, the state had secured a grant deeming Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove inalienable parkland. A commission was formed to oversee the creation of the public preserve, with Olmsted serving as Superintendent and Chairman.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{34}\" paraid=\"1912661631\">Another year would pass before Olmsted wrote his report on Yosemite Valley and Mariposa, stressing the uniqueness of the valley, not because of the towering cliffs, but because of the union of the entire landscape, and the experience of taking it all in, uninterrupted.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{38}\" paraid=\"1710684116\">Olmsted wrote his report for Yosemite and Mariposa with a distinct eye for the times; the Civil War was over and he was expanding upon Lincoln’s vision for a broader, more inclusive interpretation of democracy as he wrote the foundation for our national park system.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{42}\" paraid=\"242410202\">Like father, like son, Olmsted Jr. would join in on his father’s fight 50 years later when asked to refine his father’s work and address the need for a new bureau to manage scattered parks and monuments. This would start a 6-year correspondence, culminating in Jr.’s writing of the Organic Act, which would help solidify the creation of the NPS, keeping great natural wonders in the hands of the people.</p>",

However, the final fourteen-mile leg of the journey from El Portal to Yosemite Valley was still made by stage, and later by autos.</p> <p>Upon arrival at this terminal in Yosemite Valley, passengers could book a stay in a hotel and make transportation arrangements with travel agents, who lived in the building’s back rooms. Despite its rustic design, the office provided modern conveniences. Visitors could make telephone calls or send telegrams to anywhere in the world. By 1914, automobiles were common in Yosemite, and in that year, horse-drawn stage service was discontinued. However, annual visitation to the park in 1915 doubled to 31,000. Consequently, stage operation was renewed but only for one additional year. In 1916, the era of stage travel ended and another began. The National Park Service, a federal agency created to preserve and manage our country's national parks, was established.</p> <p>The reliance on transportation companies for park access diminished greatly when the All-Year Highway (now California Highway 140) opened in 1927, and personal cars soon became the dominant means of transportation in Yosemite.</p>",

Spencer designed three new buildings oriented around a central courtyard. Most buildings are connected by covered walkways. This comprehensive building and landscape plan includes the present-day guest registration area, cafeteria, restaurant, cocktail lounge, outdoor amphitheater, and gift shop. Completed in 1959 at a cost of $1.5 million, Yosemite Lodge, as it was then known, was the most expensive project the Yosemite Park and Curry Company had taken on up to that point.</p> <p>Spencer was inspired by John Muir’s words describing the Sierra Nevada mountains as a “range of light.” When designing the lodge complex, Spencer incorporated a sense of openness and lightness. The walkways and courtyard between buildings take the visitor through natural environments and views of Yosemite Falls. The large window walls create a sense of openness and allow natural light and scenery to reach visitors indoors. Steel framing and glass windows are unobtrusive and blend with the natural environment. The low horizontal massing of the buildings does not compete with the grand height of Yosemite Falls and nearby trees, allowing visitors to appreciate the sense of scale.</p> <p>Like other Mission 66 buildings in Yosemite Village, the lodge complex features mountain chalet motifs. For instance, inside the cocktail lounge, a large central fireplace features stylized images of skiers embossed in metal. Vaulted wood panel ceilings in several buildings impart both openness and warmth.</p>",

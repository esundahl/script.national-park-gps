In certain cases, they had to build aqueducts to cross over creeks or other barriers. The Espada Aqueduct is the oldest Spanish aqueduct in the United States. The aqueduct carries water over Six-mile creek (historically piedras creek) connecting the ditches. The aqueduct is located north of Mission Espada. Water can still be seen today flowing over the aqueduct on its way to Mission Espada. </p> <p paraeid=\"{c890a3de-fd0d-40b5-bde7-31f33917ba23}{249}\" paraid=\"496001976\"><strong>Acequias: The Lifeblood of the Missions </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{e2a07835-f0ef-4e22-9d5e-aa9d0dd53340}{162}\" paraid=\"588735967\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The Espada aqueduct was built between 1740 and 1745 and showcases European engineering feats and masonry work.  The aqueduct has withstood major floods and has survived for over 275 years.  The aqueduct spans Six-mile creek with two arches and one support pier. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3775832d-ae72-42b8-8fca-0e94aa803b98}{44}\" paraid=\"114541270\">Before the completion of the aqueduct, the Spanish would’ve used hollowed out logs, or canoas, to carry water over the creek. Once complete, water flowed across the top of the aqueduct in a channel until reunited with the earthen ditch on the other side. Once the water left the aqueduct, the acequia carried it southwardly towards Mission Espada and the farm fields. </p>",

Farms required acequias as the rain in South Texas was too infrequent and could not be depended on to water the crops.  A river with dependable flow, proper bank height, and slope were all requirements for establishing a mission. The San Antonio river met all those requirements. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5a0d1efb-0fa5-4e3e-8235-3b5fde9f94a3}{166}\" paraid=\"379189508\">Acequia systems began with a dam that would raise the water level. The dam diverted water from the San Antonio river and forced it into hand dug earthen ditches that carried the water to farms around the missions. Eventually emptying back into the San Antonio River.  The Espada Dam still diverts water from the river into the Espada acequia system, the oldest continually used acequia system in San Antonio.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{5a0d1efb-0fa5-4e3e-8235-3b5fde9f94a3}{186}\" paraid=\"1082033129\"><strong>Acequias: The Lifeblood of the Missions </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{2b357f2c-284d-4f64-a1b6-c2c54783fe1c}{88}\" paraid=\"869676761\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">A short walk from the parking lot takes you to the Espada Dam, the only Spanish built dam that remains.  The Espada dam was constructed by 1745. The dam is built from flagstone layers placed on a natural ledge across the San Antonio River. The shape of the dam is unusual in that it points downstream instead of upstream. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5a0d1efb-0fa5-4e3e-8235-3b5fde9f94a3}{210}\" paraid=\"817406788\">The Espada dam is a diversion dam. The dam raised the level of the water and pushed it into the acequia.  Gravity did the rest! </p> <p paraeid=\"{5a0d1efb-0fa5-4e3e-8235-3b5fde9f94a3}{222}\" paraid=\"1240247742\">The Espada Acequia was constructed between 1731 and 1745.

At this spot along the river you can see Double-crested Cormorants resting on logs, Great Egrets wading along the rivers edge looking for its next snack, and Black-bellied Whistling Ducks in flocks floating in the river. Listen and you might hear how they got their name, from their boisterous whistle of a call. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4ff1ef97-a9cf-436e-a771-528a45a21026}{65}\" paraid=\"1269387204\">This spot is also a great place to catch turtles sun bathing. Look along the top of the dam or on a floating log and you might see a Red-eared Slider or Texas River Cooter. </p>",

The thick weathered church and convento (priest’s residence) walls and roofs of Mission Concepcion still stand tall 250 years later making the church one of the oldest unrestored stone churches in the United States. If you look closely at these faded walls, you will find remnants of their colorful past. Colorful geometric designs covered the church inside and out. The exterior frescos have long since faded or worn away but frescos are still visible inside the buildings. There are several rooms in which to see the remaining frescos, the most famous being the “Eye of God” located on the ceiling in the library.

The park visitor center and restrooms are located just outside of the mission walls near the parking lot. At mission San Jose there are several activities for visitors to enjoy. You are welcome to experience the museum in the visitor center, view the park film, buy souvenirs in the gift shop, take a guided walk with a ranger, or enjoy a self-guided walk.<br /> <br /> Mission San Jose is part of the World Heritage Site.

The mission walls, parts of the church, and granary were restored in the 1930’s by the Works Progress Administration.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{e01e0b6c-5bc8-4022-ba8b-c4de94cc769f}{212}\" paraid=\"1228434312\">The mission was moved twice before it found its current site. The first site was moved perhaps to make room for another mission, San Francisco Xavier Najera. The second location was too close to the river and the mission suffered heavy losses due to an epidemic. The mission was then moved a third time to its current location around 1740. The stone walls were completed in 1755. The walls had two purposes, protection from hostile threats, and living quarters for the indigenous people.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{d4d73c02-d2af-4580-87cf-0f05cf23b111}{15}\" paraid=\"1889109280\">The living quarters consisted of a room and a kitchen. They were furnished with a metate, a comal, a pot , water jar, closet, pantry, bed, and dresser.  During the peak of the mission in 1768, 350 people would live inside the walls. </p> <p paraeid=\"{d4d73c02-d2af-4580-87cf-0f05cf23b111}{35}\" paraid=\"466397946\">The mission was partially secularized in 1794 and fully secularized by Mexico in 1824.   </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9e55fa2c-08aa-4b90-a432-a36514b8e270}{166}\" paraid=\"1347121810\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Bicycle Information</strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9e55fa2c-08aa-4b90-a432-a36514b8e270}{168}\" paraid=\"2117331880\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Please walk bikes on sidewalks inside the missions. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9e55fa2c-08aa-4b90-a432-a36514b8e270}{170}\" paraid=\"1362376894\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Bike racks are located in the visitor center patio and by the gristmill.

Beginning in 1779, several attempts were made to grow wheat but failed due to storms and seed germination. The first successful harvest of wheat was in 1794 at Mission San Jose. The same year the mill was completed.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{126}\" paraid=\"910138816\">The gristmill at Mission San Jose was the first mill in Texas and it was powered by water from the acequia. The mill was likely built into the quarried area after the lime kilns were discontinued.  The lime kilns can still be seen today at the back of the mill. There you will see three circular indentations into the wall.  These are remnants of the lime kilns.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{168}\" paraid=\"1567351437\">The mill you see today was restored in the 1930’s.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{178}\" paraid=\"635439960\"><strong>Acequias: The Lifeblood of the Missions </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{0cc0d2d0-3439-4ef2-9cb7-00c873f94e36}{34}\" paraid=\"2000980281\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Acequias not only irrigated crops but they also powered machinery.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{190}\" paraid=\"808912478\">The acequia water was diverted through a ditch and sluice gate to the gristmill forebay. The Miller would open the gate when he was milling the wheat. The water would flow through the sluice gate to the forebay, a containment area to hold the water. The forebay gate, located at the bottom of the forebay, would be closed. Water would fill the forebay. Once filled, the miller would open the forebay gate to allow water to flow through the forebay channel to move the horizontal wooden water wheel. Water flowed out of the forebay channel and powered the wooden water wheel pushing the wheel counter clockwise. Once the water had powered the wheel, the water would flood a field behind the mill. Water continued to flow from the acequia into the forebay during milling operations to maintain a steady flow of water to the water wheel. </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{200}\" paraid=\"645572537\">Inside the mill house you can see the two mill stones. The wooden water wheel below moved the grind stones in the mill house. The miller would pour flour into the wooden hopper, then the wheat would spread between the two mill stones and be ground into flour. Flour would pour out the bottom as the finished product. </p>",

This church, although smaller than the churches found on the mission sites to the north, still represents one of the most dramatic changes that indigenous people undertook as they moved from their traditional way of life to that of being a citizen of Spain. Walk the mission grounds and visit the church and park museum. Explore the Yanaguana Trail, a paved 1/4 of a mile loop trail that takes you to an original stretch of the San Antonio River. South of the mission behind the tree line, you will find historic farm fields that are still in use today. Follow the acequias, or irrigation ditches, that still carry water from the San Antonio River to the mission fields.   <br /> <br /> Mission San Juan is part of the World Heritage Site.

It was on the feast day of San Antonio de Padua and so they named the river the San Antonio River.</p> <p paraeid=\"{59a56b3c-7bc8-421e-a7ac-9b49a7ba5edf}{72}\" paraid=\"282682060\">Mission San Juan was originally founded in East Texas, not far from Cushing, and named Mission San Jose de los Nazonis, an indigenous group. The French pushed the Spanish out o East Texas requiring the mission to move to its current location. They moved supplies and renamed the mission San Juan Capistrano. The name was changed because there was already a Mission San Jose along the San Antonio River.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{59a56b3c-7bc8-421e-a7ac-9b49a7ba5edf}{96}\" paraid=\"1946118533\">In 1756 the mission was home to 265 indigenous people and the first stone church with sacristy, granary and convento were completed.  The mission would build and complete two churches with a third church never being finished. The second and current church was completed in 1772.  The third church was built beginning around 1775 and would accommodate a growing population. The church was never complete because the mission population declined.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{59a56b3c-7bc8-421e-a7ac-9b49a7ba5edf}{184}\" paraid=\"1808646160\">The mission was partially secularized in 1794 and fully secularized in 1824 by Mexico.   </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{3c013b28-fd64-45f4-9748-c7ac568a7f78}{36}\" paraid=\"1479540010\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Bicycle Information </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{3c013b28-fd64-45f4-9748-c7ac568a7f78}{100}\" paraid=\"1239521138\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Please walk bikes on sidewalks inside the missions. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{3c013b28-fd64-45f4-9748-c7ac568a7f78}{102}\" paraid=\"1590934022\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The bike rack is located near the mission entrance.

The first priority of the missions was to develop the farmlands to supply and support the mission populations. Mission sites were chosen on their ability to farm and build acequias, or irrigation ditches.  Each mission site had a farm, but Mission San Juan farm is the only one that remains. Visit the small demonstration farm.

During the mission period, this acequia would water all the Mission San Juan farmland. This was easily done using wooden gates. Gates could be opened or closed depending on what fields needed water. In our demonstration garden, you can see how they planted their seeds on the berms and dug furrows for the water to flow.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{9c6db387-d7c7-4843-b36f-0e47f5167a4c}{201}\" paraid=\"685540323\">The irrigation ditches are still flowing today and are used by the San Antonio Food Bank to irrigate their crops.

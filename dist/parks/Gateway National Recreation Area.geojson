        "notes": "20 Inch Rodman Gun\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/20-inch-rodman-gun.htm\n\n<p>The 20-inch Rodman Gun is the largest muzzle-loading, smoothbore cannon ever made. It is located in Fort Hancock across from the Sandy Hook Chapel.</p> <h3>Lieutenant Thomas Jackson Rodman</h3> <p>Lieutenant Rodman graduated from the military academy in 1841 and was assigned to the Ordnance Department at Allegheny Arsenal in Pittsburgh. When Lieutenant Rodman heard that a large new cannon blew up while being fired on board the U.S. Navy warship USS Princeton in 1844, he started to think about how a big cannon could be made that was safe enough to fire. Lieutenant Rodman theorized that a cannon cooled from the inside out would make a super strong gun metal.</p> <h3>The Wet Chill</h3> <p>Rodman believed that internal cooling would cause the outer molten metal to compress against the bore and create enough tension to resist the pressure of large powder charges. Basically, he brought back the hollow casting process, but, instead of a solid core, he used a hollow tube. Water circulating through the tube cooled the bore while coals were piled against the mold to keep the outer surface hot. Lieutenant Rodman's manufacturing method, now known as the \"wet chill process\", forced the impurities outward while the outer metal shrank against the hardened interior.</p> <h3>Persistence</h3> <p>The first 15-inch Rodman gun was cast on December 23,1859. During the gun trials, 509 proofing rounds were fired. Since there were no accidents or misfires during the testing, the government saw fit to order these large guns in November 1861. During the Civil War, the Rodman guns were the largest in the U.S. arsenal. Two 20-inch guns were purchased, but the 15-inch gun, along with the 200 pounder (12-inch) muzzle loading Parrot Rifle, became the main seacoast armament.</p> <h3>No. 2 Rodman Gun</h3> <p>The second 20-inch gun was made in 1869, and, as far as anyone knows, it was never fired. The No. 2 Rodman gun was exhibited at the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition that celebrated the 100th birthday of the United States. At some point after the exposition ended, the No.2 gun ended up at the U.S. Army Sandy Hook Proving Ground, where it sat in storage for many years. In 1903, the commander of Fort Hancock wrote the Army's Chief of Ordnance, requesting that the gun be transferred from the Ordnance Department over to Fort Hancock, operated by the Army's Coast Artillery Corps. The gun was transferred to Fort Hancock where it was displayed \"as a monument to the old class of guns,\" as the Fort Hancock commander referred to it. The move probably saved this rare cannon from being scrapped.</p>",

Due to Battery Weed’s lack of lack of capacity for anything larger than the 10-inch Rodman guns, other batteries were constructed to mount larger cannons, like the 15-inch Rodman guns that would have been located here and at the South Cliff Battery. In 1885 President Grover Cleveland created the Endicott Board, which was tasked with updating the increasingly obsolete coastal fortification system in the United States with the latest in military technology. The concrete batteries scattered around the tour route like Battery Catlin are the remnants of this system of fortification, most of which were constructed between 1890 and 1910.</p> <p>Advancements in military technology in the 20<sup>th</sup> century led to the construction of more forts located even further out, like Fort Tilden in the Rockways and Fort Hancock at Sandy Hook. Following WWI the use of planes in combat completely changed the nature of warfare and defense; anti-aircraft guns were added to Fort Wadsworth’s batteries to attempt to deal with this new threat.<br /> <br /> How would you have felt as an immigrant travelling to Ellis Island passing through the narrows?

Gunnison was built in 1903 as a twin six-inch disappearing gun battery. This site is only open to the public while on a tour.</p> <h3>Captain John W. Gunnison</h3> <p>Battery Gunnison was named in honor of U.S. Army Captain John W. Gunnison in 1904.<br /> Captain Gunnison served in the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and was killed in 1853 at Sevier Lake, Utah, in the line of duty. He was part of an expedition searching for a feasible passage across the Continental Divide for a transcontinental railroad route from Saint Louis, Missouri to San Francisco, California.</p> <h3>Two 6-inch Guns</h3> <p>The south side gun and carriage was mounted in 1905, and the north side gun and carriage was mounted in 1908. During World War II, the Army wanted to make Battery Gunnison a faster firing gun battery. To do this, the Army removed the old disappearing guns and carriages, raised up the gun platforms with more concrete, and emplaced another pair of 6-inch guns, mounted on pedestal carriages. These carriages enabled the guns to fire 108-pound armor-piercing projectiles in any direction up to ten miles away.</p> <h3>New Battery Peck</h3> <p>The guns and carriages for the revamped Battery Gunnison came from Battery Peck, which was one mile north of Battery Gunnison overlooking the tip of Sandy Hook. The Army renamed Battery Gunnison \"New Battery Peck.\" Around 1949, the Army stopped using the former Battery Gunnison and abandoned it.</p> <h3> </h3>",

        "notes": "Battery Kingman\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/battery-kingman.htm\n\n<p>To out range enemy battleships, the U.S. Army Ordnance Department developed a new barbette gun carriage that allowed 12-inch caliber guns to fire at a high angle, just like battleship guns. Mounted on large, round concrete platforms located out in the open, the battery's 12-inch guns could fire their half ton, armor piercing projectiles over 20 miles in any direction. Battery Kingman is a good example of a World War One designed barbette gun battery. The battery was constructed during 1917, but it's two 12-inch guns did not arrive until December 1918, just one month after World War One had ended. The long range gun batteries were the fort's first line of defense against battleships from 1919 through the end of World War Two. Battery Kingman's guns and carriages were scrapped in 1948.</p> <h3>Gun Battery Design</h3> <p>The design of the battery was simple. The battery had two circular concrete gun emplacements, one on the north side and one on the south side, spaced 420 feet apart from each other. Between the two gun emplacements the army engineers built a large rectangular shaped reinforced concrete blockhouse called a traverse. The traverse contained rooms for storage of ammunition, plotting rooms where soldiers could plot where enemy ships were headed, latrines, and heating and generator buildings. The north and south ends of the traverse had open ends so that supply trains could deliver ammunition and anything the battery needed to operate. The army covered the traverse hill with dirt and planted trees, shrubs and grass to prevent erosion by wind and rain and to make the hill look more natural looking.</p> <h3>Battery Casemate</h3> <p>During World War Two, Battery Kingman's two gun emplacements were enclosed with thick concrete walls and ceilings called casemates. The casemates protected the guns from being bombed by enemy airplanes.</p> <h3>Brigadier General Dan C. Kingman</h3> <p>Battery kingman was named in honor of Army Chief of Engineers Brigadier General Dan C. Kingman. He retired March, 1916. He died in November 1916 in Atlantic CIty, NJ.</p>",

Wooden sheds were used to shelter the guns from the weather.

Battery Peck served many years in Fort Hancock's Underwater Mine Defense Command.</p> <h3>Advantages</h3> <p>The battery had two advantages over many of Fort Hancock's other gun batteries:<br /> - each 6-inch gun could fire rapidly at a rate of 3 to 4 rounds a minute<br /> - the guns had a 360-degree field of fire to cover a wide area of 10 miles in any direction around Sandy Hook. During World War II, the battery was modernized to meet the new defensive needs of the war. During the spring of 1943, Battery Peck was renamed Battery No. 8 and its two guns and carriages were transferred to Battery Gunnison.</p> <h3>Battery No. 8</h3> <p>The battery was armed with four new 90mm gun, two of which were mounted on Peck's old concrete gun emplacements, and two others were located in the sand dunes west of the battery. In the coast artillery service during World War II, 90mm guns were known as \"dual purpose\" because they were assigned to shoot at both fast moving warships and warplanes. They were also referred to as AMTB batteries, which stood for Anti Motor Torpedo Boat. When World War II ende,d Battery No. 8 was disarmed.<br />  </p> <h3>1954-1955</h3> <p>During 1954-1955, an Army Missile Battalion used the old battery as an operations center for a temporary Nike Ajax defense missile battery and radar site set up in the tip area of Sandy Hook. When permanent Nike Missile launch and radar sites were completed at Sandy Hook during 1955-1956, the army stopped using the battery and it faded into obscurity.</p> <h3>U.S. Lieutenant Fremont P. Peck</h3> <p>Battery Peck was named in honor of U.S Army Lieutenant Fremont P. Peck. Peck was mortally wounded in 1895 when a new gun that was being tested at the Sandy Hook Proving Grounds blew up.</p>",

The second gun was mounted in 1895.<br /> In operation from 1893-1906, it was obsolete by the time it was built because the fastest firing of the gun took over two minutes to load and fire. In the meantime, the Army had developed a new gun carriage that used a counterweight to raise and lower the gun called the Buffington-Crozier carriage. This carriage allowed the guns to fire two rounds per minute.<br /> Battery Potter stayed in operation until 1906 because it had a 360 degree range of fire and was capable of protecting Sandy Hook Bay. When Battery Arrowsmith was constructed on the bay side of Sandy Hook at Camp Low, Battery Potter's guns were no longer needed.

Although it is called a cedar, the eastern red cedar is truly a juniper. Eastern red cedar is known for its reddish, fragrant, and durable wood. The dense evergreen foliage of this native tree offers good nesting cover for robins, house finches, and mockingbirds. Cedar waxwing birds love to eat its blue berries in the fall. In winter, birds such as saw-whet owls roost in its branches. Eastern red cedar like these were among the first trees planted by Herbert Johnson. Does the scent of this tree smell familiar?

It does not hold water, has few nutrients, and can get hotter than 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. The Eastern red cedar or red juniper gets around this by producing evergreen leaves that take less energy to grow. Despite this, the red cedar still struggles in the environment here because it cannot tolerate salt. When Hurricane Sandy flooded this area, it killed many cedar trees that you will see on the trail.

Although the threat of a major city in the United States being attacked from the sea had been miniscule for decades, the looming threat of nuclear war brought about major changes in defense preparation. Nike missiles designed to intercept high-altitude bombers were located near large urban centers.

By this time, Fort Wadsworth’s value as the Guardian of the Narrows had long since passed.</p> <p>Do you think nuclear weapons made the world more or less safe?<br /> <br /> In 1973 Gateway National Recreation Area was created. While it was always intended that Fort Wadsworth be one of its primary sites, the Park Service didn’t take over until 1994. An 1876 article in Scribner’s Monthly describing a pleasant day at the fort could have been written today: “Battery after battery, trench after trench, wall after wall of solid granite are discovered in our walk down the winding paths; and, when we are tired of this warlike exhibition, we can retire to a position on the grass knolls that sweep upward from the water and view the varied expanse of land and sea, while a cool salt breeze plays about us.”<br /> Do you think residents of New York from the 19<sup>th</sup> century came back from their outings at Fort Wadsworth with a newfound appreciation for the security of their city?<br /> Did your experience at Fort Wadsworth resemble the one described in Scribner’s?</p>",

The Red Knot, a robin-sized shorebird that travels 9,000 miles each way on its annual migration from the tip of South America to the Canadian Arctic, is one shorebird that fuels up each year on the tiny green horseshoe crab eggs found along these shores.

        "notes": "Jacob Riis Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/jacob-riis-park.htm\n\n<p>Jacob Riis Park was designed by Robert Moses, who in 1929 had created Jones Beach as a state park further east on Long Island. The Atlantic Ocean beach, boardwalks, courtyards, and walkways gave the city's poor a respite from cramped tenements and crowded city streets. The majestic Art Deco bathhouse acted as a symbol of democracy on this shoreline. Today, it is an excellent example of beachfront recreational architecture of the early twentieth century. Jacob Riis Park is one of Gateway's three swimming beaches. Lifeguards are on duty daily between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day from 10 am to 6 pm. Please only swim in lifeguarded areas when lifeguards are on duty. There are also playgrounds and a picnic area at the park. <br /> <br /> The park was largely built on the site of the former Rockaway Naval Air Station, one of the first US naval air stations.</p> <h3>Rockaway Naval Air Station</h3> <p>The Rockaway Naval Air Station was located on undeveloped New York City park land. In 1918, there were 21 buildings in use there, including hangars for servicing HS-2 flying boats, hangars for housing blimps and Navy-Curtiss flying boats, as well as a variety of other aviation-related structures. In 1919, one of the four Navy-Curtiss flying boats that departed from the air station completed the first transatlantic flight totaling 3,936 miles in 53 hours, 58 minutes.</p> <h3>Jacob Riis Clock</h3> <p>The Wise clock, sometimes known as the Riis Park Memorial clock, was installed on the promenade at the east end of the eclipse on March 4, 1941. Although the exact origin of the clock is unknown, it was probably built in the 1890s as a specially made item by the Wise jewelry store in Brooklyn (although some sources claim that the clock was manufactured by the Howard clock company of Boston). The clock stood in front of the Wise jewelry store at Flatbush Avenue and Nevins Street for approximately 30 years, and then was moved with the company before being moved to the park. The clock was donated to the department of parks by William A. Wise and son in 1941 when the firm went out of business. The clock was restored in 2019. </p> <h3>The Name Behind the Park</h3> <p>Originally named Seaside Beach when it opened in 1912, Jacob Riis Park was later renamed for the famous journalist Jacob August Riis (May 3rd, 1849 - May 26, 1914), who reported on the plight of the poor in New York City. Riis, himself an immigrant from Denmark who had experienced poverty himself, is best known for his book How the Other Half Lives. A bust of the \"muckracking\" journalist was installed during the city park years, but disappeared in the 1960s. A group of local schoolchildren donated a new bust in 2010.</p> <h3> </h3>",

        "notes": "Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/jamaica-bay-wildlife-refuge.htm\n\n<h3>Introduction</h3> <p>Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is one of the most important urban wildlife refuges in the United States. Encompassing more than 9,000 acres, it is comprised of diverse habitats including salt marsh, upland field and woods, several fresh and brackish water ponds and an open expanse of bay and islands - all located within the limits of New York City.</p> <h3>Wildlife</h3> <p>From its inception, the refuge has been managed to provide a variety of habitats that accommodate a diversity of wildlife species. Songbirds and small mammals find food, shelter and nest sites in the upland woods and gardens; egrets, herons, ibis and waterfowl utilize salt marshes and ponds. The wildlife refuge is nationally and internationally renowned as a prime birding spot where thousands of water, land and shorebirds stop during migration. More than 325 species have been recorded here during the last 25 years.</p> <h3>West Pond Trail</h3> <p>This wide gravel trails follows the shoreline of the West Pond, giving visitors the opportunity to walk through the diverse habitats of Jamaica Bay. Salt marshes, mudflats, shorelines, and woodlands can all be found along the West Pond Trail. The abundance of wildlife and plants provide a unique experience for nature lovers throughout the year.<br /> <br /> Take a minute to observe the Osprey platform. Or stop by the northern-most part of the trail to take in breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline. For visitors looking for peace and quiet, or perhaps a bit of shade, the North and South Gardens offer a wonderfully serene experience.<br /> <br /> In order to enjoy the entire walking trail, plan to spend two hours outdoors.</p> <h3>East Pond Trail</h3> <p>The 117-acre East Pond was created in 1951 to support a variety of plant and animal life. Although the pond appears natural, it is in fact a Robert Moses creation. The manmade pond requires the water level to be manipulated throughout the year to provide mud flats for the surprising number of migrating shorebirds and waterfowl that stop here on their journey along the Atlantic Flyway.<br /> <br /> Located across from the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center on the east side of Cross Bay Boulevard, the East Pond demands some preparation for a successful visit. Be sure to wear waterproof walking shoes (or shoes that you won't mind getting muddy and wet). It is also recommended that you bring insect repellent from late Spring through early Fall.</p> <h3>Visitor Center</h3> <p>The Visitor Center building at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge treads lightly on the earth through sustainable design and the use of environmentally friendly materials and technology. Inside, the lobby floor is a sleek, blonde bamboo - a strong and resilient materials made from a quickly growing type of grass. The counters and shelves are made of sycamore, grown for lumber, and wheat (wheat board). The light-colored paint on the walls brightens the space and is made with low volatile organic compounds.<br /> <br /> This building fits into the landscape of the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge through its use of color, design, materials, and technology. To learn more about this environmentally-friendly building, ask a ranger at the front desk for more information.</p> <h3>Other Services</h3> <p>Birding, Nature Walks, Bird Blind, Benches, Parking Lot, Water Fountains, Restrooms</p>",

In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century residents complained that poor landscaping and frequent construction at Fort Wadsworth was leading to pools of standing water, from which foul vapors, known as miasmas, were issuing, causing outbreaks of diseases like malaria and yellow fever. Today we know that their fears weren’t entirely unfounded—both yellow fever and malaria are spread by mosquitos, which breed in pools of stagnant water. Major landscape work on the grounds did in fact lead to a decline in cases of malaria. It was also the start of the park like setting Fort Wadsworth has today.<br /> <br /> How is your community kept safe?

Sandy Hook became the only place in the US and its possessions having a nine gun battery mounting large caliber, disappearing guns. However, the Army found that having only one gun commander for the whole battery made it difficult to coordinate the loading, aiming, and firing of nine big cannons. To solve this problem, in 1904, the Army divided the long battery into four distinct gun batteries, each one commanded by its own gun commander.</p> <h3>Four Gun Commanders</h3> <p>The Army found that one gun commander had a hard time coordinating the loading, aiming, and firing of nine big cannons.

The battery was named in honor of Major General Henry W. Halleck, who was the U.S. Army's Chief of Staff during the American Civil War.</p> <h3>Battery Bloomfield</h3> <p>This battery, next to Battery Halleck, consisted of two Model 1888, 12-inch, breech loading, rifled guns mounted on Model 1896 disappearing gun carriages. The battery was named in honor of Brigadier General Joseph Bloomfield, who served during the American Revolution and was governor of New Jersey when the War of 1812 began.</p> <h3>Battery Richardson</h3> <p>This battery, the most southern battery, had two Model 1900, 12-inch, breech loading, rifled guns mounted on Model 1897 disappearing gun carriages.

If you plan to paddle; be prepared, know your limitations, the weather, and the tides. <br /> <br /> **Please refrain from landing a kayak on the shoreline of Rulers Bar Hassock as this refuge provides vital habitat for turtles, birds and other fauna and flora.**</p> <h3>At The Water's Edge</h3> <p>This sand and pebble beach provides access to the northeast side of Jamaica Bay. Parking lots are on either side of Crossbay Boulevard. Low tide reveals mudflats and launches can be muckier.<br /> The Pumpkin Patch Channel heads South from the Western parking lot. Paddling in good conditions along the cloistered edge of the salt marsh usually provides great viewing of wading birds and a pleasant paddle. More experienced paddlers also use this launch for a variety of longer trips.<br /> <br />  </p>",

These homes were built for officers in 1898 and 1899. Families could plant flowers and shrubs close to their houses, but plants had to remain below the railings of the front porch. In later years, porches were screened in to keep out insects. White poplar trees lined the street, but they were no match for the constant salt spray and heavy winds.

Here, with the marsh as a happy medium between water and land, they can fish while staying close to their nest, which they build themselves and return to each year. The Osprey was one of the many bird populations that was devastated by the use of DDT, a pesticide that caused birds to lay thin-shelled eggs that broke during incubation. However, when DDT was banned in 1972, the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge was one of the first places in New York City to witness the return of nesting ospreys. For decades, an Osprey sighting was a rare and joyous occasion; today, they are one of spring's most reliable marvels and serve as a reminder of nature's resiliency.</p>",

While you may have seen this plant on your plate as nopales, Prickly Pear Cactus is actually native to this area, thriving in the demanding, desert-like environment where other plants are unable to survive. Specially adapted pads or flat stems are thick and low-lying to conserve water and limit sun exposure on hot dry days during the summer. Most of the plant's water is stored in the stems because its true leaves are thin smaller pads. Prickly pear blooms big yellow flowers in the summer, followed by a bulbous purple prickly pear fruit. Animals eat the fruit and paddles, somehow avoiding the spines that make the plant prickly. Humans are not so lucky to have that adaptation.</p>",

The infectious disease ward at the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital that opened in 1911 is perhaps the best-known example of a quarantine in New York today, but for many years it was these two islands that served as New York City’s first line of defense against contagion. Hoffman and Swinburne islands, as they are known today, were created artificially atop a shoal in the harbor in the early 1870s.</p> <p>Ships coming to New York Harbor were required to stop at a new quarantine station on Staten Island in Rosebank, where the quarantine’s administrative offices were located. Doctors from the quarantine station would inspect the ships, with particular attention given to any that had travelled from South America and Africa. Tropical diseases were more easily spread amongst New Yorkers, who had little exposure and thus little natural immunity to them. Swinburne Island served as a hospital; people who were known to be infected and displaying symptoms would be treated there. Those who had been exposed to contagion but did not show signs of infection were quarantined on Hoffman Island, where they would remain until they either became ill or until enough time had passed that they could be considered healthy. For decades, these islands were the first—and sometimes only—stop for immigrants entering the United States. Today, they are unpopulated and comprise part of the Staten Island Unit of Gateway.<br /> <br /> The quarantine was located on these artificial islands because no one wanted a hospital for infectious diseases in their community.<br /> <br /> Would an infectious disease hospital near your home make you feel uncomfortable? Is it much different from objections to prisons or drug treatment centers in your neighborhood?</p>",

        "notes": "Sandy Hook Lighthouse\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/sandy-hook-lighthouse.htm\n\n<p>The Sandy Hook Lighthouse is the oldest operating lighthouse in the nation. The lighthouse was completed on June 11, 1764 due to the efforts of 43 prominent New York merchants. The merchants petitioned the Colonial Assembly of New York to request that a lighthouse be erected on Sandy Hook to guide ships safely into New York Harbor. The New York Assembly supported the proposal and passed an act to raise money through a lottery. The funds raised from the lottery were used to purchase the land and build the lighthouse. </p> <h3>Sandy Hook Lighthouse Newspaper Article - June 18, 1764</h3> <p>The June 18, 1764 edition of the New York Mercury Newspaper reported that: \"On Monday Evening last (June 11, 1764), the NEW- YORK LIGHT HOUSE erected at Sandy Hook was lighted for the first Time. The House is of an Octagonal Figure, having eight equal Sides; the diameter at the Base, 29 Feet; and at the Top of the Wall, 15 Feet. The Lanthorn (lantern house) is 7 Feet high; the Circumference 33 feet. The whole Construction of the Lanthorn is Iron; the Top covered with Copper. There are 48 Oil Blazes. The Building from the Surface is Nine Stories; the whole from Bottom to top, 103 Feet\".</p> <h3>Sandy Hook Lighthouse Tours</h3> <p>Tours of the Sandy Hook Lighthouse should resume in late spring.</p> <h3>Third Order Fresnel Lens</h3> <p>In 1822, Augustin Fresnel introduced a glass lens that revolutionized the lighting of lighthouses. The Fresnel lens resembled a giant old-fashioned beehive, inside of which was a single lamp. The lens' thick prisms bent the lamp's light to the center of the lens, greatly magnifying the light into a powerful beam that could be seen for miles at night. Fresnel made his lenses in six different sizes, or \"orders.\" The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order lenses were usually installed in seacoast lighthouses to warn ships that they were approaching land. The 4th, 5th, and 6th order lenses were used in harbor and sound lighthouses. A Fresnel lens was shipped to America in 1840, destined for the Sandy Hook Lighthouse, but it was slightly too large to fit inside the lens house. That lens and a second one were transferred over to the Twin Lights in Navesink, NJ, making them the first American lighthouses to uses Fresnel lenses. The Sandy Hook Lighthouse was refitted with its present 3rd order Fresnel lens in 1857 when the iron lens house (lanthorn) was added to the tower.</p> <h3>National Historic Landmark</h3> <p>On June 11, 1964, the Sandy Hook Lighthouse was declared a National Historic Landmark on the 200th anniversary of its first lighting. This faithful sentinel still continues its original function. The light is currently an automated 3rd order Fresnel lens, fixed white light, visible for nineteen miles on a clear night. The light is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and is kept on 24 hours a day.</p>",

        "notes": "Sandy Hook Proving Ground\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/sandy-hook-proving-ground.htm\n\n<p>More than two decades before Fort Hancock was commissioned in 1895, the U.S. Ordnance Department tested new and experimental weapons at Sandy Hook.</p> <h3>What is a Proving Ground?</h3> <p>\"Proving ground\" is a term for a place where weapons can be tested. The Sandy Hook Proving Ground was established in 1874. Less than 10 years earlier, the Civil War had introduced several new innovations in weaponry. Rifled cannons fired pointed-nosed projectiles farther and faster than cannonballs. Iron clad warships mounted guns that could easily destroy the walls of a traditional fort. The Army needed a place to test its own new weapons.</p> <h3>Testing Weapons</h3> <p>New weapons, such as artillery shells, fuses, gun powders, and other ordnances could be tested on the proving grounds of Sandy Hook. The Army had to develop new cannons and ordnance because the American Civil War had introduced new rifled, breech-loading guns, along with new steam-powered warships made of iron. Following the Civil War, foreign countries began making bigger cannons and bigger and faster warships. To keep up with the world-wide arms race, the U.S. Army began creating larger, more powerful guns that could sink any warship.</p> <h3>Location</h3> <p>Owned by the federal government since 1817, Sandy Hook was chosen for a proving ground because it was located next to a large industrial area that had rail and water transportation, yet it was isolated enough that local people would not be hurt by ordnance testing. Also, the Hook's long, flat beaches and low sand dunes provided a clear field of fire for guns firing from North Beach down to targets set almost four miles down range near the south end of the Hook.</p> <h3>Development</h3> <p>The Army developed a wide variety of weapons at Sandy Hook that included rapid fire machine guns, field artillery, howitzers (guns mounted on wheeled carriages that could quickly follow infantry and cavalry across battlefields) and siege & coastal defense artillery. Gun calibers ranged from 1-inch caliber up to a giant 16-inch gun that the Army began testing in 1902. Gun testing started in 1874 and would continue for 45 years when, in 1919, the Sandy Hook Proving ground was closed and moved to a new proving ground in Aberdeen, Maryland.</p>",

The Rockaway Peninsula, just beyond this view, shelters Jamaica Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. Over centuries, saltwater marshes, like the South Marsh in front of you, were built up from sediment accumulation. From the late-1800s until the early 1950s, the saltmarsh islands in Jamaica Bay were covered, in part, with sand and mud dredged from the bay. Where you stand right now, the land on which the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is located, was once part of a group of small islands that included a separate Broad Channel Island, until they were filled with dredge soil to create today's larger Ruler's Bar Hassock. As a result of sea level rise and the filling in of islands of Jamaica Bay, the salt marshes are rapidly disappearing. While recent conservation efforts and continued research have led to improved conditions, some scientists believe that the salt marshes of Jamaica Bay may soon vanish.</p>",

Do you hear or see any birds in the area looking for berries? Take a close look at the black cherry tree. Those parallel rows of holes were drilled by the yellow-bellied sapsucker, a type of woodpecker, as it looked for bugs to eat. Downy and hairy woodpeckers also like this area. Look for black and white birds with red patches on the backs of their heads. </p>",

When ships wrecked, the Life-Saving crew usually rowed a surfboat to the shipwreck to rescue people. When a storm was too strong, they fired a small line-throwing cannon from the shore to the ship to make connection with the stranded crew. One to two people could fit into a breeches buoy, a pair of canvas pants that hung from the line. If many people were aboard the shipwreck a \"lifecar,\" or small metal boat that held up to six passengers, could pull people to safety. This photo shows the last two crewmen of the Edmund J. Phinney being rescued in a breeches buoy at the North Beach area in December 1907 during a powerful winter storm.</p>",

Where you are standing right now, even 75 years ago, would have been a vast expanse of water and salt marsh. This has also been a hotly contested site. For decades, the Department of Docks and Ferries had wanted to transform Jamaica Bay into a cutting edge commercial and industrial seaport. The Sanitation Commissioner wanted to use the bay as New York City's dumping ground. By 1930, Robert Moses, sometimes called the Master Builder of 20th century New York City, had a different idea. He wanted to turn Jamaica Bay into the crown jewel of the New York City Park system. In 1950, an unanticipated disaster presented Moses with a bold opportunity.</p>",

For a safe and enjoyable trip, please stay on the gravel path, with the exception of the north and south garden areas. Poison ivy is a common refuge plant with leaves that are always in clusters of three. Look both high and low for poison ivy vines, as they can entwine around trees, or grow like a big shrub. The entire plant-leaves, trunks and roots-can make you itch. Also, look out for dog and deer ticks, which can be present year round. If you have any questions, stop by the Visitor Center desk where a ranger or volunteer can assist you.</p>",

This provided an excellent habitat and source of fresh water for coastal shorebirds, waterfowl, and other seasonal migrants. During fall, winter, and early spring, flocks of snow geese, Brant and other wintering waterfowl can be found on the west pond, along with ducks such as the Lesser and Greater Scaup, Ruddy Duck, Ring-necked Duck, and many more. From spring through fall, trees and shrubs around the pond often fill with roosting egrets and herons. The upland areas around the pond provide habitat for songbirds - altogether, more than 300 species of birds have been identified at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge! However, in November 2012, Hurricane Sandy breached the West Pond, turning the pond into a tidal lagoon, compromising the freshwater habitat and affecting the vegetation surrounding it.</p>",

For a small fee, visiting families of military soldiers stationed at Fort Hancock could stay in rooms on the top floor.

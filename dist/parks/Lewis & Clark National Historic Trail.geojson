It had been a stopping place for centuries.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d2f9aa6-e4c5-4391-9e9e-fe40b3458ea3}{183}\" paraid=\"550683154\">In 1797, Dr. Felix Brunot, a Frenchman who had come to the continent to serve with the French Army during the American Revolutionary War, arrived in Pittsburgh and started a medical practice. In 1800, he purchased the 129-acre island three miles downriver and started a farm.20 Blaise Cenas (related to Brunot by marriage) lived there, along with several other settler families. Meriwether Lewis knew Cenas and some of these other men through the Pittsburgh Freemasons. </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d2f9aa6-e4c5-4391-9e9e-fe40b3458ea3}{233}\" paraid=\"1129527759\">When Lewis and crew stopped at the island in 1803, they docked their keelboat and pirogue and came onshore—perhaps to say goodbye to their acquaintances, or maybe to pick up a few extra supplies. Whatever the reason, they stopped and chatted for a while.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d2f9aa6-e4c5-4391-9e9e-fe40b3458ea3}{247}\" paraid=\"1711458400\">One thing led to another, and they asked Lewis to show off his <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/lewis-s-air-gun.htm\">air gun</a>—maybe he couldn’t help but mention it so soon after purchasing it. Lewis had bought this specialty gun mostly to impress and intimidate Indigenous people along the way—a muscle-flexing icebreaker, rather than as a tool for hunting. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a859ad2c-edc9-4a7c-b60d-6039aaa2d59f}{50}\" paraid=\"106909523\">However it came up, Lewis brought out the air gun and showed it around. Lewis shot it several times himself (“with pretty good success,” he later bragged in his journal). He then passed it to Cenas, who did not have as much success. Cenas shot a woman who was watching (perhaps a relative of his) in the head. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a859ad2c-edc9-4a7c-b60d-6039aaa2d59f}{82}\" paraid=\"631316028\">She ended up being fine, but it was maybe a little too eventful for a friendly visit. Lewis and crew packed up and headed downstream.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Akta Lakota means “honor the people” in the Lakota dialect. The museum has welcomed thousands of people since opening its doors in 1991 and sits on the banks of the mighty Missouri River. It tells the story of the Lakota people beginning prior to European colonization and ending with contemporary issues facing tribes today. <br /> <br /> Many of the authentic artifacts date back to the 1800s and were collected from the immediate area in South Dakota. The museum walk-through is designed to guide visitors chronologically through Lakota (Sioux) history, associated with the four cardinal colors and directions. The center has been described as a “living museum” in that current issues receive as much attention as past ones. As part of the modern aspect, artwork by Lakota, Dakota and Nakota artists are highlighted and include paintings, photography, pottery, jewelry, and quilts. A gift shop offers similar authentic pieces for purchase. <br /> <br /> There is no admission fee to the museum, although donations are gladly accepted and appreciated.

The trail, which had been identified to Lewis and Clark by the Nez Perce, had long been an established transportation corridor for American Indians. On July 7, 1806, they passed through the Alice Creek drainage. Lewis described “much appearance of beaver many dams” and noted that the “bottoms not wide and covered with low willow and grass.” They continued “up the same creek on the east side through a handsome narrow plain” and across “the dividing ridge be­twen the waters of the Columbia and Missouri rivers.” Looking east, Lewis recognized the familiar landmark of “Fort Mountain” (Square Butte), and estimated it to be “distant about 20 Miles.”</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Located within the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/helena/\">Helena National Forest</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">, the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gis/storymaps/mapjournal/v2/index.html?appid=5c65518366224abd8d8643380b64d498\">Alice Creek Historic District</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> still evokes the 1806 landscape experienced by Lewis despite minimal impacts from cattle grazing.

From 1000-1450 A.D., the area was the site of a Middle Mississippian culture town where the cultivation and storage of corn allowed a permanent community to persist. The town’s inhabitants left by 1450 A.D. for reasons unknown, although it was possibly due to nutrient-depleted soils or lack of wild game.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ad6fb0b0-799c-4e98-a194-2532d7458915}{175}\" paraid=\"317830522\">The Angel Mounds State Historic Site strives to tell the story of these native peoples. It was first established in 1938, when the Indiana Historical Society purchased the current 600 acres, prior to which it was a working farm. Between 1939 to 1964, a crew of excavators directed by noted Indiana archaeologist Glenn A. Black uncovered more than 2.5 million artifacts from the site. Angel Mounds was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5758cb86-c812-4a5f-ac0f-7a87682995a2}{220}\" paraid=\"314586140\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Twelve earthen mounds created for ceremonial purposes are scattered throughout the property and can be viewed from the walking trail. The interpretive center details the history and culture of the site’s historic inhabitants, known as the Mississippian Culture. There is also an interactive area where visitors can explore different aspects of Black’s research. Visitors can also walk the four-mile Angel Mounds Loop Trail. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ad6fb0b0-799c-4e98-a194-2532d7458915}{205}\" paraid=\"1074725215\">For those who want a deeper look into the history of the area, Angel Mounds hosts a regular lecture series on the history of Mississipian Culture’s way of life, economics, politics, and religion. Camps and other activities for children are available in the summer. Farm Fest is another popular two-day event celebrating Indiana’s history of farming.

        "notes": "Astoria Column\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/astoria-column.htm\n\nLocated in Astoria, Oregon, the 125-foot-tall Astoria Column serves as a monument to the history Pacific Northwest. The idea for the column first came about in 1898 when the city thought to build an electrified tower that would rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. In 1914, the project began to take its first tentative steps toward becoming a reality when the City of Astoria bought 30 acres of land on Coxcomb Hill. By 1917, a flagpole was erected on the site, and Astor Park was officially created just in time for the town’s 4<sup>th</sup> of July celebration.<br /> <br /> From 1917 to 1925, little progress was made on the tower project. Then, in 1925, Ralph Budd, president of the Great Northern Railway, approached New York architect, Electus Litchfield, with the renewed interest. Together with artist Attilio Pusterla, they formulated a plan to erect a column decorated with a sgraffito-style painted histogram recounting the region’s history spanning from the discovery of the Columbia River to the arrival of the railroad. Construction began in March of 1926, and the Astoria Column was officially dedicated during a celebration attended by 8,000 people on July 22, 1926.<br /> <br /> Today, the Astoria Column attracts visitors from around the world. Pusterla’s sgraffito artwork, an ancient technique in which images are engraved into wet plaster and then colored powders are hand-blown into the outlines, is a source of wonder for many. The lower bands begin with Captain Gray’s arrival to the Columbia River in May 1792, and his first contact with the Chinook and Clatsop tribes. As it winds up to the top of the column, the histogram continues with the Lewis and Clark Expedition’s arrival in the area, the arrival of the first European settlers, and ends with the arrival of the railroad to Astoria in 1893.<br /> <br /> Admission to the park is free, but visitors are required to purchase a 1-year parking pass for $5 per vehicle. Visitors may climb the inside of the tower to the observation deck at the top, which provides a spectacular view of Astoria and the Columbia River. The gift shop’s hours of operation vary, and visitors are encouraged to call the monument at (503) 325-2963 for current hours.

As the journals discuss, Black Buffalo and the other chiefs were invited to tour the keelboat, where they were presented gifts. Captain Clark conducted them back to Lilly Park in the pirogue. He wrote, “As soon as I landed the pirogue, three of their young men seized the cable. Chief Black Buffalo then took hold of the rope and ordered the young warriors away.”</p> <p>Clark was not permitted to leave the shore; the pirogue soon returned with twelve armed men. The boat guns, and the soldiers’ muzzle-loading guns, were pointed directly at the Lakota, whose numbers had now grown to about 100. (The expedition numbered forty-four.) Both sides stood down. The captains went upstream on the west side of the river to camp for the night. Clark writes, “I called this island Bad Humored Island, as we were in a bad humor.” (Bad Humored Island was later named Marion’s Island).</p>",

Inside the boats, they saw a group of armed White men and what appeared to be trade goods. Lakota people were accustomed to seeing White men passing through to trade—many spoke French, others spoke Spanish or English. These visitors appeared to have more weapons than some of the other traders, though. The Lakota lookouts lit a fire to alert people in nearby villages of the foreign presence.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{7a06d805-186f-4939-b9ff-ffe00f17f2a4}{231}\" paraid=\"786615815\">The men in the boat asked to hold a council with Lakota leaders.

They arranged a council the following day with chiefs of the Lakota, who were camped about two miles up the Bad River. On the morning of September 25, they “raised a Flagg Staff and formed an orning & Shade on a Sand bar in the Mouth of Teton R to Council under”. Fifty to 60 members of the Lakota arrived, and the council commenced at noon. Lewis and Clark presented medals to the chiefs Black Buffalo, Partisan, and Buffalo Medicine. Fol­lowing a speech by Lewis and a military parade, the chiefs were invited onto the keelboat, where they were presented with additional gifts. However, events took a turn for the worse when Clark ferried the chiefs back to shore. Clark was prevented from returning to the keelboat, and an armed standoff between the ex­pedition and the tribe quickly escalated. Clark and the chiefs managed to defuse the situation and abstain from violence. The expedition was able to peacefully continue upriver, and agreed to transport two of the chiefs aboard the keelboat.<br /> <br /> The Bad River Encounter Site is located within <a href=\"https://www.fortpierre.com/attractions/fischers-lilly-park/\">Fischers Lilly Park</a>, in the city of Fort Pierre.

In 1792, over a decade before the Corps of Discovery set out, a small crew under the command of Lieutenant William Broughton sailed up the Columbia River up to what would become modern-day Vancouver aboard “The Chatham,” while the expedition’s leader, Captain George Vancouver, remained at sea on the main ship. It was Broughton who gave Baker Bay its moniker, naming it after a British merchant, Captain James Baker, whose ship happened to be anchored just inside the Columbia’s mouth when Broughton passed through.<br /> <br /> Years later, on November 15, 1805, Baker Bay, a popular spot for ships to shelter, would receive a new name. Lewis and Clark had just rounded “Point Distress” and established Station Camp on the sandy shore of the bay. They chose to call it Haley’s Bay in honor of a European trader that the local natives said to be their favorite. Clark mentions this in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“This Bay we call Haleys bay from a favourate Trader with the Indians which they Say comes into this Bay and trades with them.”</p> </blockquote> Today, visitors can access or view Baker Bay from a variety of locations. The town of Ilwaco, Washington, for example, is located inside the bay, as are Chinook Point and Cape Disappointment State Park.   ",

Side about 800 feet high & 400 yds round…”  His estimates were exceptionally close. Today, the site is on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail’s list of High Potential Historic Sites. <br /> <br /> As the area was settled in the 19th century, the basalt feature was given a variety of names. By 1915, river developments threatened to destroy the rock. Henry J. Biddle, a prominent Washingtonian and descendant of Nicholas Biddle, the original editor of Lewis and Clark's journals, bought it and eventually gave it to the state for a park, restoring the original name assigned by Clark. <br /> <br /> To get to the top, hike the mile-long switchback trail.  Or for the more adventurous, you’ll enjoy rock climbing or hiking to waterfalls. Cyclists and horseback riders will find trails to outstanding vistas, and boaters will delight in the majesty of the area from the waters of the Columbia.  The park includes 9,500 feet of freshwater shoreline and more than 26 miles of roads and trails. Picnicking and camping are also found at the park. <br /> <br /> The park is open daily from 8 a.m. to dusk. A Washington State Park Discover Pass is required and may be purchased at an automated station.  The park is just two miles from Skamania on state highway 14.

Lewis wrote, “from the appearance of a rock […] I could judge bet­ter of the rise of the water than I could at any point below. I think the flood of this spring has been about 12 feet higher than it was [the previous fall]; the river is here about 1½ miles wide; it’s general width from the beacon rock which may be esteemed the head of tide water, to the marshey islands is from one to 2 miles tho’ in many places it is still wider. it is only in the fall of the year when the river is low that the tides are persceptable as high as the beacon rock. this remarkable rock which stands on the North shore of the river is unconnected with the hills and rises to the hight of seven hundred feet; […] it rises to a very sharp point and is visible for 20 miles below on the river.”</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/474/Beacon-Rock\">Beacon Rock</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> is an eroded basalt volcanic plug that stands at approximately 848 feet. In the 1800s, it became known as Castle Rock.

At the base is a bust of Clark with the inscription: “William Clark – Born in Virginia August 1, 1770 – Entered Into Life Eternal September 1, 1838 – Soldier, Explorer, Statesman, and Patriot – His Life Is Written in the History of His Country.”</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Clark, aged 69, died at the home of his eldest son, Meriwether Lewis Clark.

The graves of William Clark, his wife Harriet, and several of their children were moved to the new cem­etery. The memorial was unveiled in 1904 during the centennial of the expedition with funds donated by Clark’s youngest son, Jefferson Clark. Despite a family endowment, by the late 20th century the grave site had fallen into disrepair. Clark’s descendants raised $100,000 to rehabilitate the obelisk and celebrated the rededication with a ceremony on May 21, 2004, the bicentennial of the start of the expedition.</span></span></span><br />  ",

On September 20, they began the estimated 30- mile trip around the bend. Clark wrote, “detached [Drouillard and Shields] to the 1st. Creek abov the big bend with the horse to hunt and wait our arrival proceeded on passed the lower Island opposit which the Sand bars are verry thick & the water Shoal. I walked on Shore with a view of examining this bend Crossed at the narost part which is a high irregular hills of about 180 or 190 feet, this place the gorge of the Bend is 1 mile & a quarter (from river to river or) across, from this high land which is only in the Gouge, the bend is a Butifull Plain thro which I walked”. Later, Lewis and another man also disembarked the boat to hunt. While camping overnight on a sandbar, quick action was required when Clark “observed that the Sand was giving away both above & beloy and would Swallow our Perogues in a few minits, ordered all hands on board and pushed off we had not got to the opposit Shore before pt. of our Camp fel into the river.” Circumnavigation of the Big Bend was completed before breakfast on September 21. <br /> <br /> Today, the Big Bend of the Missouri is part of Lake Sharpe, which was created by the 1959-1966 construc-tion of the Big Bend Dam 15 miles downriver.

The area was well known to local indigenous populations, such as the Delaware and Shawnee, who relied springs for salt and game. A 1744 map Louisiana marks it as the \"place where they found the elephant bones in 1739.\" Early explorers noted that the large bones lay scattered throughout the valley. The first map of Kentucky, prepared by John Filson in 1784, bore on the legend: \"Big Bone Lick; Salt and Medical Spring. Large bones are found there.\"</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/meriwether-lewis.htm\">Meriwether Lewis</a><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\"> traveled to Big Bone Lick in October 1803.

In just three weeks Clark and his team collected enough bones to ship three large boxes to the President. Subsequently, Jefferson dedicated a room in the White House to display of the Big Bone collection. The collection was divided and various sections of it went to the National Institute of France in Paris, to Philadelphia and to Jefferson's personal collection, which was unfortunately ground into fertilizer by a careless servant. Between 1756 and 1812, while excavations were continuing, the salt industry developed in the area. The salt works required 500 or 600 gallons of water to make a bushel of salt. Two furnaces were created to speed the process of evaporating the water from the salt, but the operation proved too expensive to be profitable, and the business was halted in 1812. From 1831 to 1848, various paleontologists and geologists visited Big Bone Lick, and the lick was included in indexes of all the principal geological, paleontological and scientific journals in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Besides salt, the springs were known for their medicinal qualities and by 1821 Big Bone Lick was one of the most celebrated resorts in that part of the Ohio Valley. A large hotel was erected and named Clay House, in honor of Henry Clay, the famous statesmen from Lexington, Kentucky.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> Today, visitors can view fossils of many prehistoric animals that lived in this area, displayed in the Visitor Center. Visitors can also gaze upon life size replicas of prehistoric animals at the outdoor diorama pit. Other displays at the Visitor Center provide entertaining and informative lessons in local geology and Native American history.<br /> <br /> Big Bone Lick State Historic Site, located not far from the Ohio River, offers visitors unique experiences within the rich landscape. Visit the salty natural springs from which the Site gets its name. Catch a glimpse of the Site’s bison herd roaming the grounds, visible nearly anytime of the year! Admission to the park and Visitor Center is free for everyone all year, and park grounds are open daily until dark, year around. Activities include camping, hiking, swimming, birding, orienteering, and picnicking. There is also an 18-hole miniature golf course and tennis courts available.<br /> <br /> With 4.5 miles of trails to hike, Big Bone Lick features five different trails, ranging from easy to moderate difficulty. The orienteering courses are set up for two different trails, one for beginners and one for intermediate experiences. The beginners trail is 2.7 km long and the intermediate trail covers 4.5 km. Both trails have 10 checkpoints along the way. Using a map and compass, hikers navigate the trails, learning skills while enjoying the setting.<br /> <br /> 62 campgrounds with a camp store, showers, grills, laundry and restrooms are available from mid March to mid November. The campground also includes a playground and swimming pool opened seasonally (available to campers only).

They usually appear around sulfur springs, which are places where water and minerals bubble out of the ground. It often smells like rotten eggs.  <br /> <br /> People call these places “licks” because animals like to lick the salty deposits.  <br /> <br /> The “big bone” part of its name came from huge bones in this bog. Indigenous oral tradition states that the bones were from the white buffalo, who died when they drank the salty water.<br /> <br /> Western scientists theorized that animals—including mammoths and mastodons—who came for a salty treat got trapped in the marshy areas around the springs. This site was influential in the American development of paleontology and theories of animal extinction <br /> <br /> Thomas Jefferson knew about this place and asked Meriwether Lewis to stop and collect some fossils and send them back. <br /> <br /> Someone was already running the place as a tourist destination, so, Lewis had no trouble finding it. “Mr. David Ross of Virginia” decided before Lewis arrived that he did not want anyone taking anything from the lick anymore, probably because people had quickly taken most of the biggest fossils. <br /> <br /> Lewis convinced a fellow collector, Dr. William Goforth of Cincinnati, to send specimens already excavated to Jefferson. William Clark returned to the site four years later to retrieve more fossils. <br /> <br /> These were animal bones, not human remains. Still, was it okay for Lewis and Clark to take these fossils? <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

Inside, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a>, just sixteen years old, was giving birth to her first child. The baby’s father, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, had lived in a Hidatsa town for years. Sacagawea was one of his two wives. She had lived in a Hidatsa community for several years, after being captured (or recaptured) from Shoshone people. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{106}\" paraid=\"648359806\">A few months earlier, in November 1804, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark had arrived at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/knife-river-villages.htm\">Knife River villages</a>, where they met Sacagawea and Charbonneau. Sacagawea was about six months pregnant when they arrived. The historical record provides few details about her pregnancy. Did she experience morning sickness? Did she crave certain foods? Did she wake up at night as the baby kicked inside her? It is impossible to know the answers to these questions. We do, however, know something about Sacagawea’s labor and the birth of her son. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{146}\" paraid=\"854862356\">On February 11, 1805, Meriwether Lewis wrote in his journal about Sacagawea’s labor. This was her first pregnancy and, as is often the case, “her labour was tedious and the pain violent.” Sacagawea’s attendants gave her “a small portion of the rattle of a rattle-snake” to speed the birth, and within ten minutes (at “about five oclock this evening”), the baby was born. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{186}\" paraid=\"706461428\">It is easy to imagine the relief and happiness Sacagawea may have felt that evening, holding her newborn son after a long and painful birth. They named the baby Jean Baptiste after his paternal grandfather. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{196}\" paraid=\"91843005\">At just two months old, Jean Baptiste accompanied his mother and father when they set out from Fort Mandan in April 1805 with Lewis, Clark, and crew. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{216}\" paraid=\"811243509\">Having a woman and an infant in the party signaled that its purpose was a peaceful one.

Around 1812, he went to live with Clark in St. Louis. As an adult, Jean Baptiste traveled to Europe and guided several military expeditions in the western parts of North America. He died on May 16, 1866, at the age of sixty-one.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

On August 11, 1804, Lewis, Clark and ten other men climbed the hill to visit the grave of Omaha Chief Blackbird, whose ruthlessness had gained him notoriety among other tribes and traders from St. Louis. Clark wrote, “We landed at the foot of the hill on which Black Bird The late King of the mahar who Died 4 years ago & 400 of his nation with the Small pox was buried and went up and fixed a white flag bound with Blue white & read on the Grave which was about 12 foot Base & circueller, on the top of a Penical about 300 foot above the water of the river, from the top of this hill may be Seen the bends or meanderings of the river for 60 or 70 miles round.”<br /> <br /> Blackbird Hill remained a distinctive landmark for river travelers throughout the 19th century. It was paint­ed by George Catlin in 1832 and Karl Bodmer in 1833. According to traditional Omaha tribal accounts, Chief Big Elk was also buried at this site. In a downslope gorge, natural sandstone bedrock exposures display a collection of petroglyphs which depict human, animal, and supernatural figures. While tribal or chrono­logical affiliation of the petroglyphs is unknown, one resembling a human on horseback is likely post-1700 CE. Located within the Omaha Reservation, Blackbird Hill is privately owned but publicly viewable from adjacent roadways.",

Rising 300 feet above them, they saw a promontory known as Blackbird Hill. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark already knew about this landmark. At its top lay the grave of Wazhiⁿga’ sabe (Blackbird), a former Omaha leader. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ba9a8f66-9add-4f00-8af6-14458258d8b5}{171}\" paraid=\"930675824\">Under Wazhiⁿga’ sabe’s leadership in the late 1700s, Omaha people became a strong force on the Great Plains.

In 1794, Frenchman Zenon Trudeau wrote of the need to maintain friendly relations with Wazhiⁿga’ sabe. He controlled the trade routes, and “without his consent,” they could not access Omaha or other Indigenous communities of the Upper Missouri.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ba9a8f66-9add-4f00-8af6-14458258d8b5}{219}\" paraid=\"280425263\">The Spanish Governor of Louisiana gave Wazhiⁿga’ sabe a medal in 1796, to establish his vassalage—and trading obligations—with Spain, in the tradition that all European monarchs used these medals. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ba9a8f66-9add-4f00-8af6-14458258d8b5}{243}\" paraid=\"1460503001\">Wazhiⁿga’ sabe’s power and prestige could not save him from the ravages of disease, however. In 1800, a smallpox epidemic ravaged Omaha communities. It killed Wazhiⁿga’ sabe and nearly one-third of his community. His relatives buried Wazhiⁿga’ sabe on a hill overlooking the Missouri River, at a site where he could see for miles and watch for travelers on the river. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a018b2dd-f026-45a6-94cc-4ff37ef29a07}{36}\" paraid=\"1010516605\">Lewis and Clark were aware of this history when they set out. They brought a specially made flag to leave at Wazhiⁿga’ sabe’s grave. On that day in 1804, Clark climbed to the top of the hill and “fixed a white flag bound with Blue white & read [sic] on the Grave.” They hoped that paying their respects at the gravesite would serve as an important diplomatic gesture to Omaha people. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Here Patrick Gass was formally promoted to the rank of sergeant, filling the position formerly held by the late Sergeant Floyd. Clark identified Bow Creek as the general location of an abandoned Omaha village, writing, “above the mouth of this Creek a Chief of the Maha nataton displeased with the Conduct of Black bird the main Chief came to this place and built a Town which was called by his name Petite Arch (or Little Bow) this Town was at the foot of a Hill in a handsom Plain fronting the river and Contained about 100 huts & 200 men, the remains of this tribe Since the Death of Petite arch has joined the remaining part of the nation”. <br /> <br /> Circa 1720, the Omaha Tribe established a village near the mouth of Bow Creek known as “Bad Village”, apparently due to a schism that split the tribe. Bad Village was likely occupied until circa 1750, when the factions reunited at a village site near present-day Dakota City, Nebraska. Following the rise of Blackbird, Little Bow and his followers left the Omaha Big Village and resettled in the Bow Creek area circa 1780-1790. Accounts vary, but the Omaha factions reunited following the death of either Blackbird or Little Bow, some¬time prior to 1804. The exact location of the Little Bow Village is currently unknown, but there are numer¬ous archeological sites throughout the area, which is primarily used for agricultural cultivation.</p> <h4>Recreation </h4> <p>Bow Creek Recreation Area provides many opportunities for the public to experience a part of the Missouri National Recreational River.

She led them between the Bridger and Gallatin mountain ranges through Bozeman Pass. When still encamped at the Three Forks of the Missouri on July 13, Clark had considered a route through a pass further to the north, but wrote, “The indian woman who has been of great Service to me as a pilot through this Country recommends a gap in the mountain more South which I shall cross.” The party ascended following a “well beaten buffalow road” to “the top of the dividing ridge between the waters of the Missouri from those of the river Rochehone [Yellowstone].”<br /> <br /> Although first documented by Clark and later named for John Bozeman, who in the early 1860s helped blaze the Bozeman Trail, the pass had been used as a corridor for thousands of years prior to the Corps of Discovery, particularly by tribes reliant upon following bison migrations. As modes of transportation advanced into the modern era, the Bozeman Pass remained the established thoroughfare into southwest­ern Montana. Substantial development began with the Northern Pacific Railway, completed in 1883. An automobile highway, the Yellowstone Trail, was first constructed across the pass in 1912. This was replaced in 1926 by US 10, and then in 1956 by Interstate 90. There is a historical marker documenting the expedi­tion’s passage.<br />  ",

The dam takes its name from Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville (1796-1878), a French officer who pioneered parts of the Oregon Trail. Roughly forty miles from Portland, the lock and dam system provided a 48-mile navigable channel for large vessels and eliminated the obstacle of the Cascades of the Columbia. The Bradford Island Visitor Center, located adjacent to the dam on the Oregon side of the river, displays exhibits on local history, hydropower, and fish life cycles. The Lewis and Clark Expedition camped on Bradford Island on April 9, 1806 upon their return journey. <br /> <br /> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and volunteers provides tours of the powerhouse to see working turbines and generators of the hydroelectric dam. A viewing platform allows visitors to watch salmon and lamprey using the fish ladders, making their way upstream. Sea lions can even be found nearby, feeding on the vast quantities of fish. The area provides many other activities including Geocaches at the Bonneville Lock and Dam, the Bonneville Fish Hatchery, and the Bradford Island Recreation Area which offers a spectacular view of the Columbia River Gorge. <br /> <br /> For more information visit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers website at: <a href=\" https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/columbia/Bonneville/\"> https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/columbia/Bonneville/</a>. <br />  ",

First constructed in the 1740s as a dwelling when the territory was under French control, it was converted to a courthouse in 1793 and is the oldest courthouse in Illinois. The building is an example of the French Colonial vertical log poteaux-sur-solle (“post-on-sill”) construction technique where upright hewn logs are seated on a horizontal log sill. Spaces between logs are filled with stone and mortar chinking. <br /> <br /> In 1901 the courthouse was dismantled and re-erected in St. Louis for the 1904 World’s Fair. It was moved once again in 1906 to Chicago’s Jackson Park. In 1939 it was reconstructed on the original site in Cahokia where it currently sits on its original stone foundation. <br /> <br /> This site is historically significant for serving as the headquarters of Lewis and Clark from winter of 1803 to the spring of 1804. They used the courthouse to make arrangements for their long voyage which included: gathering supplies, meeting with territorial leaders, collecting general information, and corresponding with President Jefferson. <br /> <br /> The courthouse now serves as a museum and historic site. Three exhibit rooms depict cases the court handled around 1800 and the French-roots of the structure. A fourth room is refurbished to represent the courtroom of 1790. Two massive limestone fireplaces, shuttered casement windows, and French-style doors allow visitors to step back in time to Illinois’s territorial infancy. Courthouse staff and volunteers offer guided tours, or visitors may walk through at their leisure. <br /> <br /> Managed by the State of Illinois, several special events are held at the site each year.

Europeans published these maps using geographic knowledge that Indigenous people shared with them. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/maps-of-the-missouri-river.htm\">Mackay-Evans map</a>, for example, drew on information James Mackay and John Evans received from their Mandan and Hidatsa acquaintances. Throughout their journey, Indigenous hosts drew maps and described trails, routes, shortcuts, and portages to Lewis and Clark. Most of this was not “uncharted” territory—many people knew its terrain and paths intimately and had passed down that knowledge over many generations.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

It is jarring to imagine how people could co-exist in such large numbers during an era before modern medicine, advanced irrigation, and an overall staggering amount of danger that lurked everywhere back then. It is inspiring that people could put aside their differences and come together to build something greater than themselves when the contrary would have been much easier, safer, and simpler.<br /> <br /> The settlement of Cahokia, in Southern Illinois fits this mold. From prehistory to the 1600s, the Cahokians were the most sophisticated and advanced society north of Mexico. With cities bustling with merchants, artisans, artists, priests and more- Cahokia was the premiere Native-American civilization. With their advanced knowledge of agriculture, science, and coexistence, the Cahokians managed to cultivate a civilization larger than London’s in the year 1250, this despite enduring the brutal winters and scorching summers of the Mississippi Valley. </p> <p>Not much remains of this once magnificent Native American cultural and economic hub. However, the Cahokians did an excellent job of leaving behind enough to keep their significant legacy and history intact. Visitors can tour the numerous trails offered on site where people can get a sense of what it may have felt like to live in ancient Cahokia. Bring your gym-shoes because you can even climb the 100 foot tall mounds created by the Cahokians all those years ago! From the top of one historic metropolis, you can see a modern one in S.T Louis- reminding visitors that our cities today would not exist if ancient civilizations didn’t put in the leg work.</p> <p>In the interpretive center, visitors can learn from the myriad exhibits, videos, and knowledgeable volunteers. Visitors will learn everything from the day-to-day life of the Cahokians to what qualified the settlement as an urban-hub. With over 5.4 miles of trails, 100 foot tall mounds, and the engaging interpretive center-visitors will leave the mounds with a much greater understanding of the prehistoric city.</p> <p paraeid=\"{31d09435-0d17-4e84-b147-77b8fd983774}{93}\" paraid=\"104\">Admission to Cahokia Mounds is free to the general public, although donations of $7 per adult, $5 per senior, $2 per child, and $15 for families are suggested.

Lewis, Drouillard and the two Field broth­ers reached the expedition’s northernmost campsite on July 22, 1806, and spent three full days exploring the area. With observation efforts frustrated by continual bad weather and increasingly wary of encounter­ing hostile Blackfeet, they departed on the morning of July 26. After failing to establish a latitude with his instruments, coupled with an understanding that the Marias River did not reach as north as hoped, Lewis wrote, “we set out biding a lasting adieu to this place which I now call camp disappointment.”</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Camp Disappointment lies within an open landscape of meadows interspersed with cottonwood stands along Cut Bank Creek.

The location was also convenient to St. Louis and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cahokia-courthouse-illinois.htm\">Cahokia Courthouse</a>. Today, the exact location of the camp is unknown due to shifts in the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9190fb7-a9ca-46a8-a18e-2a4989c5cc83}{208}\" paraid=\"1547947899\">Clark spent most of the winter at Camp Dubois supervising and training the recruits. His journals frequently mention French and Indigenous people stopping at Camp Dubois. They sometimes brought meat or other provisions to trade. Often they stayed and exchanged stories about communities upriver.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9190fb7-a9ca-46a8-a18e-2a4989c5cc83}{242}\" paraid=\"677176191\">Lewis spent much of the winter in St. Louis, meeting with fur traders and others who had experience on the Upper Missouri.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{863f9b38-68e7-4833-beb0-84e877664963}{5}\" paraid=\"244331779\">In the late afternoon of May 14, 1804, Clark and forty-one men set out from Camp Dubois. Curious onlookers along the riverbank may have watched the keelboat and two pirogues (a type of canoe) depart. They would have been accustomed to seeing vessels traveling up and down the Missouri. Did they know the political significance of this diplomatic mission of colonization? Did they have any idea of what it would mean for the Indigenous people who lived along the Missouri and beyond? </p>",

Coboway and other Clatsop people visited often to trade, smoke, and play games.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{23}\" paraid=\"1513737495\">But on this particular day in late December, Coboway shared some news: a “large Fish was drove by the Wind & waves on the shore.” Through the gestures Coboway made, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark realized it was a whale.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{67}\" paraid=\"426705541\">A week later, Coboway and his friends returned with whale blubber.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{81}\" paraid=\"919153190\">Lewis called the blubber “excellent food” and elaborated, “it was white & not unlike the fat of Poark, tho’ the texture was more spongey and somewhat coarser. I had a part of it cooked and found it very pallitable and tender, it resembled the beaver or the dog in flavour.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{119}\" paraid=\"912805097\">Clark decided that they should retrieve some blubber themselves. He hired a Clatsop man to guide him, twelve men, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a> (and presumably her baby) down the coast to the whale. They packed items that people in the nearby Nehalem village might want to trade for whale blubber, like fishhooks, files, and glass beads. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{185}\" paraid=\"953706985\">When they arrived at the beach, the 105-foot-long whale was “nothing more than the Sceleton.” Nehalem families were “busily engaged boiling the blubber, which they performed in a large Squar wooden trought by means of hot Stones; the oil when extracted was Secured in bladders and the Guts of the whale.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{227}\" paraid=\"2075660567\">Nehalem families offered to trade whale blubber and oil for elk meat, but Clark had not brought any with them. After more haggling, they decided that the glass beads would suffice. Clark, Charbonneau, Sacagawea, and the other men divided the heavy whale blubber and oil among their party and returned to Fort Clatsop.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ede000-4a11-4ad5-bec0-a94b06272a6b}{12}\" paraid=\"377814310\">On the way, they passed many Chinook and Clatsop people who were also carrying large amounts of whale blubber home. Maybe they felt similar to Clark’s party: energized by the festive environment around this giant spectacle on the beach and excited to bring their families a special treat.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Finally, in the dark of night, they cached their saddles and some powder for the return trip over the divide. <br /> <br /> Four of the canoes are believed to have been large, although no journal keeper reported any dimensions.  The fifth canoe was smaller, designed to more easily scout ahead of the others and check on the conditions of the rivers.  <br /> <br /> On October 7, the men broke camp, loaded the canoes and shoved off around noon.  For the first time since the fall of 1803, when they left the Ohio River, Lewis and Clark were going with the flow of a river, instead of against it.  <br /> <br /> Today, Canoe Camp is a part of the 38-site Nez Perce National Historical Park.  There are six wayside exhibits at Canoe Camp spaced along a short interpretive trail. They tell the story of the original meeting between Lewis and Clark and the Nez Perce, the Nez Perce role in the building of the canoes, the mission of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and the Nez Perce historic use of the area. The site also includes a reproduction of one of Lewis and Clark's canoes. The camp site is within the unincorporated town of Ahsahka, Idaho, about 50 miles east of Lewiston.  <br />  ",

Hike through old-growth forest or around freshwater lakes, saltwater marshes and ocean tidelands. Gape at the breathtaking views. Launch your boat from Baker Bay. Benson Beach is a popular clam-digging destination, and fishers love to set up on the North Jetty to catch salmon and crab. The beaches at Cape Disappointment also lure kite-fliers, sand-castle builders and those who love to walk and explore.  <br /> <br /> But be sure to visit the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center for numerous interactive displays. Standing high on the cliffs of the Cape, 200 feet above the pounding Pacific surf, the Center is filled with information, artwork, and film presentations about the Corps of Discovery.  From April 1 to October 31, it’sr open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.<br /> <br /> Summer hours for the park are from 6:30 a.m. to dusk. A Washington State Park Discovery Pass is required; an automated pay station is on site.  A separate fee is required for the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center.  For more information, go to: http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment\">Cape Disappointment</a> is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> On November 14, 1805, while the expedition sheltered at Dismal Nitch, Lewis “concluded to proceed on by land & find if possible the white people the Indians Say is below and examine if a Bay is Situated near the mouth of this river as laid down by Vancouver in which we expect, if there is white traders to find them.” On November 17, Lewis “returned haveing travesed Haleys Bay to Cape Disapointment and the Sea Coast to the North for Some distance.” Gass remarked, “They had been round the bay, and seen where white people had been in the course of the summer: but they had all sailed away.” The next day Clark and 11 others “who wished to See more of the main Ocian” made the trip to Cape Disappointment and the northern coastline, rejoining the main party at Station Camp on November 20.<br /> <br /> The cape was a notable maritime landmark of the Pacific Northwest, with the first known documentation in 1775 by Spanish explorer Bruno Heceta, who named it “Bahia de La Asuncion.” British trader John Meares named it “Cape Disappointment” in 1788, due to his mistaken belief that the mouth of the Columbia River was only a bay. The United States deemed Cape Disappointment strategically significant enough to base military fortifications there during the Civil War and World War II. Construction of a lighthouse was complet­ed in 1856. The decommissioned military fortification and lighthouse are now encompassed by the <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment\">Camp Disappointment State Park</a>, which includes a <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment\">Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center.</a></p>",

Children can try to pack a canoe without tipping it, follow a treasure hunt, and check out what the Corps ate on their journey.  The center features a short film presentation, a nicely outfitted gift shop, and a glassed-in observation deck with fabulous views of the river, headlands, and ocean.  Additional displays focus on local maritime and military history. <br /> <br /> During winter and spring, trained volunteers come to the center to help visitors spot migrating Gray Whales.  You can also learn about the nearby North Head and Cape Disappointment Lighthouses.  The lighthouses both function to protect mariners from the rough and ever-changing Columbia River Bar in the treacherous area known as the “Graveyard of the Pacific.”  The Cape Disappointment Lighthouse is the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast.<br /> <br /> Cape Disappointment was armed with smoothbore cannons to protect the mouth of the Columbia during the Civil War.  In 1875, the area was expanded to become Fort Canby which remained in use through the end of World War II.  Today, near the visitor center, you can explore the remains of the military bunkers and defense batteries.<br /> <br /> Be sure to set aside time to hike through old-growth forest or around fresh-water ponds, saltwater marshes, and ocean tidelands.  The beaches are perfect for kite-flying, sand-castle building, or simply walking and exploring.  Camping, picnicking, clamming, boating, fishing, crabbing, and bird watching are also fun activities within the park. <br /> <br /> Cape Disappointment State Park is open year-round for camping and day use, 8 a.m. to dusk.  A Washington State Park Discover Pass is required.  The hours of the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center vary by season.  Be sure to check their website for current rates, hours, and information:  <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment\">https://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment</a>.<br />  ",

The building is based on more than a decade’s worth of archaeological research at the site, which began in the 1990s where a large village of the Cathlapotle Nation once stood. It took over 100 volunteers two years to complete it, and the official opening ceremony was conducted on March 29, 2005.<br /> <br /> Meriwether Lewis and William Clark mention the village in their journals, both when they passed the town on November 5, 1805, and on their return journey on March 29, 1806. According to the explorers’ entries, they traded deerskins with the Cathlapotle in exchange for dogs and other provisions during both encounters. Their visit spelled disaster for the local populations since, only 20 years later, European diseases like smallpox took a heavy toll on tribes of the area. By the late 1830s, those who survived abandoned the site. In 1840, the Carty family claimed the land and built a homestead. It became part of the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge in 1965.<br /> <br /> Today, the Cathlapotle Plankhouse plays an important role in the life and community of the tribes of the area. It also serves as an outdoor education center and is used by tribal members for special events throughout the year.<br /> <br /> The plankhouse is currently closed to the public.",

        "notes": "Cave Hill Cemetery & Arboretum\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/cave-hill-cemetery-arboretum.htm\n\n<p>Cave Hill Cemetery is a 296-acre Victorian era National Cemetery and arboretum. It is the largest cemetery by area and number of burials in Louisville. Cave Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Cave Hill National Cemetery, containing military graves, is also on the National Register, added in 1998.</p> <p>Cave Hill was chartered in 1848 on what was William Johnston’s Cave Hill Farm, then a rural property some distance east of Louisville. Johnston, who died in 1798, had built the first brick house in Louisville on the grounds circa 1788. City officials had purchased part of the land in the 1830s in anticipation of building a railroad through it, and a workhouse was built there. The railroad was built elsewhere, and the land was leased to local farmers.</p> <p>In 1846, Mayor Frederick A. Kaye began investigating the possibility of developing a rural or garden-style cemetery on the grounds, a popular concept at the time. Hartford, Connecticut civil engineer Edmund Francis Lee was hired, who planned a cemetery with winding paths, graves across the tops of hills, and lakes and ponds in the valleys. The Cave Hill Cemetery Co. was chartered in February 1848, and the cemetery was dedicated on July 25, 1848. Reverend Doctor Edward Porter Humphrey delivered the dedicatory address and elaborated on the idea of the garden cemetery, noting, among other things, that “. . .Reason and taste suggest that [this cemetery] should be decorated appropriately by the beautiful productions of our great Creator. . .”</p> <p>Before the era of large municipal parks, it was common for cities to promote a garden cemetery as a green oasis and recreation destination, and Louisville was no exception. This largely ended with the opening of nearby Cherokee Park in 1892. After administrators sold several acres of land for the burial of Union soldiers during the Civil War, local Confederate supporters purchased nearby land as well. Several deceased patients from the Brown General Hospital and other nearby army medical facilities were interred in Cave Hill Cemetery.</p> <p>The grounds were expanded and remapped in 1888 to their modern size of nearly 300 acres (1.2 km<sup>2</sup>). In the 1980s, razor wire was added to the brick walls surrounding Cave Hill to keep out after-hours visitors.</p> <p>The first scenic overlook for the cemetery, Twin Lakes Scenic Overlook, opened on August 20, 2008.</p> <p>There were about 120,000 people interred by 2002, with space remaining for 22,000 more graves. Notable among those interred in the cemetery is:</p> <ul> <li>George Rogers-Clark – A soldier from Virginia and the highest ranking American military officer on the northwestern frontier during the American Revolutionary War. Brother to Captain William Clark of the Corps of Discovery.</li> <li>Patty & Milred Hill – The sisters who composed the Happy Birthday song.</li> <li>Colonel Harland Sanders – The founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken</li> <li>Muhammad Ali – American professional boxer, activist, philanthropist, and Louisville’s Native Son</li> <li>Enid Yandell – An American sculptor who studied with Auguste Rodinand and Frederick William MacMonnies. The sculpture collection at Speed Art Museum (Louisville, KY) includes a large number of her works in plaster.</li> <li>Jeptha Barnard Bright, Jr – Better known as Barney Bright, was a sculptor from Louisville, KY and is best known for his work on the Louisville Clock.</li> </ul>",

There were 17 lodges above the falls and five more below. Lewis and Clark determined a portage route “on the Stard. Side, and the distance 1200 yards one third of the way on a rock, about 200 yards over a loose Sand collected in a hollar blown by the winds from the bottoms below which was disagreeable to pass, as it was Steep and loose.” They received a great deal of assistance from the villagers, including the use of their horses. The Corps camped two nights on the north bank below the falls, “close under a high range of clifts of rocks, where the body of the River beat against it and formed a verry large eddy.” The return portage was made on April 21, 1806. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">Over the years, Celilo Falls has been impacted by infrastructure developments such as a canal, railroad bridge, transmission lines, and inundation from the Dalles Dam. Even so, the portage route on the Wash­ington side of the river remains intact and above water.

The spring and fall salmon runs were the most bustling times for the communities along the rapids. Wasco-Wishram (Chinookan-speaking) people who lived here caught salmon, dried it, and pounded it into cakes, which they then wrapped in dried grass and salmon skin.

To buy the killuk, people traded what they had: horses, knives, axes, copper kettles, guns, beads, buffalo robes, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/dismal-nitch-washington.htm\">cedar clothing</a>, shells, blankets, cloth, and more—materials that had been made anywhere from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Basin to England to China. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark’s group bought hazelnuts, berries, grass mats, and lots of killuk. The dried fish cakes ended up being the only food they still had left later that year. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdfa7f07-23c9-4fec-b2a1-26f070fd4105}{235}\" paraid=\"2070553916\">People came for community here.

Located in Grand Ronde, OR, the Yamhill Kalapuya people once called the Grand Ronde Valley Chachalu, meaning “place of the burnt timbers” for the large forest fire that ravaged the area shortly before the United States Government imparted a forced relocation of Native Tribes in 1856. Like the forests and salmon in the rivers, the Confederated Tribes have survived, endured, and returned to their homeland where their way of life has been revitalized. <br /> <br /> The resiliency of the Tribes and the history of their lands and cultures serve as the integral message highlighted across exhibits. Self-guided or staff-guided tours of the museum by Tribal members take visitors through galleries and artifacts of ceremonial items which are still used in rituals today, like as hand-carved canoes. The in-museum app, “Chinuk Wawa”, was created by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community and has a selection of quizzes, games, songs, and stories that aid in teaching the Chinuk Wawa language to visitors. <br /> <br /> For current exhibits and hours, please visit <a href=\"https://www.grandronde.org/history-culture/culture/chachalu-museum-and-cultural-center/\">https://www.grandronde.org/history-culture/culture/chachalu-museum-and-cultural-center/</a>. <br />  ",

Chief Black Buffalo raised the pipe of peace from its stand of forked sticks and pointed it to the heavens, the four quarters of the globe, and the earth. After smoking and speeches, the group feasted on cooked dog, pemmican (buffalo meat and fat), and ground potato. At dark, a large fire was made in the center, and the dance began.</p> <h3>Thursday, September 27, 1804</h3> <p>The men of the expedition were invited by Chief Black Buffalo back to the large council house for another dance, which lasted until about 1:00 p.m. Lewis and Clark and company returned to their keelboat, accompanied by two chiefs. As the pirogue approached the keelboat, the steersman misjudged, cutting the metal anchor cable.</p> <h3>Friday, September 28, 1804</h3> <p>After searching in vain for the lost anchor, the captains prepared to depart. Several of the Lakota warriors seized the rope holding the keelboat, and refused to leave. Captain Clark negotiated with Chief Black Buffalo, Black Buffalo jerked the rope back from his soldiers and ordered his men ashore. The confrontation over, the expedition continued upstream.</p>",

George Gibson had suffered a serious thigh injury after being thrown from his horse, making land travel for him all but impossible. Clark wrote that they “found some large timber near which the grass was tolerably good I En­camped under a thick grove of those trees which was not Sufficiently large for my purpose.” However, there were no better trees in the vicinity to be found. The next day Clark “deturmined to have two Canoes made out of the largest of those trees and lash them together which will Cause them to be Study and fully Suffi­cient to take my Small party & Self with what little baggage we have down this river.” The party remained at the camp until July 24 building the canoes, hunting, and stitching new clothing from deer and elk skins. One night half of their horses disappeared.

As they waited for the arrival of George Drouillard and John Shields, who were traveling separately on horseback, Lewis and Clark took measurements and recorded observations. Clark climbed the hill behind their camp on June 2, noting in his journals that he “assended the hill in the point 80 ps. from the pt. found it about 100 foot high, on the top is 2 graves, or mouns, a Delightfull prospect from this hill which Comds. both rivers.”<br /> <br /> Although the confluence of the two rivers was visible from Clark’s Hill in 1804, it subsequently shifted to a location approximately six miles further downstream. However, the woodland character of the river valley remains intact and visitors are afforded views that are relatively undisrupted by modern intrusions. The site is operated as a state park unit, and features a hiking trail that accesses a viewing platform over the rocky outcrop that Clark stood upon. The two burial mounds documented by Clark remain intact, and have been dated to the Late Woodland period (BCE 600-900).

The terrible weather had made it impossible to stay at their current camp and had left them all wet and miserable, to the point that even their clothing was beginning to rot away.<br /> <br /> When the weather worsened a few days later, the expedition was forced to relocate once more on November 12 in the hopes of finding a drier campsite. Clark describes the dire weather and the new camp in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“A Tremendious wind from the S. W. about 3 oClock this morning with Lightineng and hard claps of Thunder, and Hail which Continued untill 6 oClock a. m. when it became light for a Short time, then the heavens became Sudenly darkened by a black Cloud from the S. W. and rained with great violence untill 12 oClock, the waves tremendious brakeing with great fury against the rocks and trees on which we were encamped. our Situation is dangerous. we took the advantage of a low <em>tide</em> and moved our camp around a point to a Small wet bottom at the mouth of a Brook, which we had not observed when we Came to this cove; from it being verry thick and obscured by drift trees and thick bushes…” </p> </blockquote> The point of land that Clark describes is located at the upstream end of Hungry Harbor and is known as Cliff Point. Unfortunately, this meant that the crew was separated from their cargo by half a mile, as they were unable to carry it with them. The canoes were left to “the mercy of the waves,” having been secured to the best of their ability by using stones to sink them and keep them from being dashed to pieces against the rocks.  <br /> <br /> The weather finally let up on November 15, and the expedition hurriedly loaded their gear into the canoes. They made it around Point Distress (modern-day Point Ellice) where they established Station Camp, which would serve as their base of operations until November 24.<br /> <br /> Today, Cliff Point can be viewed from the Lewis and Clark Trail Highway (WA-401), approximately two miles southwest of Knappton, Washington. There is no marker at this location, but there is a pullout for vehicles on the harbor side of the road.",

Persevering through rain, hail, and snow, the fatigued expedition struggled over steep mountainsides made nearly impassable by a plethora of fallen tim­ber. They ended the day “Encamped opposit a Small Island at the mouth of a branch on the right side of the river which is at this place 80 yads wide, Swift and Stoney, here we wer compelled to kill a Colt for our men & Selves to eat for the want of meat & we named the South fork Colt killed Creek, and this river we Call Flathead River.” The horsemeat was a welcome addition to the paltry food rations. Gass wrote, “none of the hunters killed any thing except 2 or 3 pheasants; on which, without a miracle it was impossible to feed 30 hungry men and upwards, besides some Indians. So Capt. Lewis gave out some portable soup, which he had along, to be used in cases of necessity. Some of the men did not relish this soup, and agreed to kill a colt; which they immediately did, and set about roasting it; and which appeared to me to be good eating.” </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">The Colt Killed Creek Campsite is located on the grounds of the Powell Ranger Station, within </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/nezperceclearwater/\">Clearwater National Forest</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">.

The park occupies 3,338 acres on Horsethief Lake, an impoundment of the Columbia River, and was created in 2003 with the merger of Horsethief Lake State Park and Dalles Mountain Ranch. It also includes Horsethief Butte and Crawford Oaks, both popular hiking areas. Horsethief Lake section of the Columbia Hills Historical State Park is a National Historic Site.</p> <p>Located on the site of a former Native American village, Columbia Hills State Park is along the rolling hills of the Columbia River Gorge, with nearly two miles of freshwater shoreline on the Columbia River. This made it the perfect stopping point for the Lewis and Clark expedition on their way to the coast. A group of significant Native American pictographs and petroglyphs are located in this area of the park. The Temani Pesh-Wa exhibit is open daily for self-guided viewing. The world-famous Tsagaglalal, (She Who Watches) and other pictographs and petroglyphs can be viewed by making a reservation to participate in a regularly scheduled ranger-led tour (see Interpretive Opportunities on website for registration instructions).</p> <p>Across Highway 14 from the main part of Columbia Hills State Park, Horsethief Butte dominates the skyline, standing over Horsethief lake like an ancient castle. The lake itself is enormous, flooded into existence by the construction of The Dalles Dam. Lupine and balsamroot bloom in mid-April, making spectacular fields of purple and gold. Songbirds flit about, while larger birds of prey — like eagles and falcons — soar on air currents high above your head.</p> <p>The commission combined the park with Dalles Mountain Ranch and renamed the area Columbia Hills State Park in 2003. Now, in addition to the more than 12 miles of hiking trails in the area, visitors can enjoy swimming, freshwater fishing, bird watching and wildlife viewing, sailboarding, and playing horseshoes. Rock climbers also frequent this park. Dalles Mountain is known for the spectacular wildflower displays in the spring.</p>",

Stroll up a gently curving 150-foot ramp to the bird blind, constructed of sustainably harvested, durable black locust wood.</p> <p>From this quiet spot, you can view birds and wildlife that inhabit the area today as you learn about the flora and fauna–some of which are now extinct, endangered or threatened–that existed here 200 years ago. The artwork serves as a lasting reminder of the impact humans have had on the environment and a model for a new way to envision the connection between people and the natural world.</p> <p>The site was formally dedicated August 23, 2008, with more than 500 people attending.</p> <h4>The Bird Blind</h4> <p>A 1.2-mile trail, built primarily by volunteers, leads from the parking lot to Maya Lin’s elliptical bird blind. The wood used to build the bird blind comes from the black locust tree, a long-lasting, sustainable hardwood that is considered invasive in the Northwest. Using locally harvested black locust for this project supports efforts to eradicate the tree from native forests and reinforces the Confluence Project’s goal of promoting sustainability. The vertical wooden slats of the bird blind are inscribed with the name and current status of each of the 134 species Lewis and Clark noted on their westward journey.</p> <h4>Project Partners</h4> <p>The Sandy River Delta site was built by James E. John Construction, of Vancouver, and Krekow Jennings Inc., of Seattle. Other key partners include the Oregon Department of Transportation, which built a new, safer deceleration lane at Exit 18 on westbound Interstate 84; the U.S. Forest Service, who owns the land at the site; and the Oregon National Guard, who built a new parking lot at the site as part of a training mission.</p> <h4>Directions to Sandy River Delta</h4> <p>The Sandy River Delta is just north of I-84 off Exit 18. Driving east, exit the freeway and turn right at the T, go under the overpass and enter the park at the sign. If you’re driving west on I-84, take Exit 18 and take an immediate right. At the parking lot, look for the gravel path marked “Confluence.” Follow the path for 1.2 miles to reach the Bird Blind.</p> <h4>About Confluence</h4> <p>Confluence connects you to the history, living cultures, and ecology of the Columbia River system through Indigenous voices. We are a community-supported nonprofit that works through six art landscapes, educational programs, and public gatherings in collaboration with northwest tribes, communities, and the celebrated artist Maya Lin.

Today, the Listening Circle honors native traditions in a landscape that today remains similar to what the explorers described in their journals. Visitors will experience the Listening Circle and focus their attention on the breeze through the trees, the gentle sound of the water, and the muted browns, greens, and yellows of the enduring landscape that surrounds them.</p> <h4>The Listening Circle</h4> <p>The Listening Circle is a basalt amphitheater inspired by the Nez Perce blessing ceremony that took place here in 2005 where the women faced north, the men faced south, the elders faced east, and no one passed behind them. From above the arced basalt seating resembles ripples of water.</p> <h3>Timeline</h3> <p>The Chief Timothy Park site was completed and dedicated in a Nez Perce ceremony in 2015.</p> <h3>Project Partners</h3> <p>Chief Timothy Park was chosen as a Confluence Project site by Nez Perce elders and Maya Lin. With collaboration from the Nez Perce Tribe, the Listening Circle was designed by Maya Lin with support from Maya Lin Studio, Greenworks Landscape Architecture and JE John Construction, with permitting from the US Army Corps of Engineers – Walla Walla The project was funded by the State of Washington – Department of Commerce, Asotin County with promotional support from Visit Lewis Clark Valley. Chief Timothy Park is owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers and managed by Northwest Land Management.</p> <h3>Directions to Chief Timothy Park</h3> <p>Chief Timothy Park is an island just off Highway 12, 9 miles west of Clarkston, WA.

Because of its significance as a well-established gathering place for Native people, the explorers knew where they were for the first time since entering uncharted territory. Maya Lin has designed seven story circles that explore the Native cultures, language, flora and fauna, geology, and natural history of the site. As you pass from one story circle to the next, consider how the intersection of the Snake and Columbia rivers, cultures, communities, and environmental forces have shaped and continue to affect the land around you.</p> <h4>Story Circles</h4> <p>Maya Lin’s artwork at Sacajawea State Park tells the tales of people, place and the connection between them in text etched into seven circles, some raised above and some lowered into the ground. The information in the story circles comes from tribal stories, Lewis and Clark’s journals, Yakama elder and Sahaptin speaker Virginia Beavert, Ph.D., and the natural history of this site, which has been a gathering place for Native people for more than 10,000 years.</p> <h4>Timeline</h4> <p>The formal dedication of the site happened on Friday, August 27, 2010. The dedication was highlighted by tribal, local and civic speeches, music, and prose.

They would travel to their family’s regular fishing spot when the salmon were running, or when the weather was too frigid in the high country. For Sahaptian-speaking residents of the Columbia River Plateau, including the Umatilla, Cayuse, Yakama, and Walla Walla people, fishing for salmon was and is a way of life and of obtaining sustenance. It was and continues to be spiritually and culturally important.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{76a12922-2f99-481d-b9ff-92c82cd3f84a}{35}\" paraid=\"559552909\">William Clark’s sketch of the confluence of the Walla Walla and Columbia Rivers noted so many times the “lodges of Indians fishing.” The expedition passed through at a time when the salmon were swimming upstream—everyone was down at their fishing spot. Bobbie Conner, director of the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, explained,  </p> <p paraeid=\"{76a12922-2f99-481d-b9ff-92c82cd3f84a}{83}\" paraid=\"1047980918\">Sahaptian-speaking people fishing here welcomed these distant visitors. Many probably knew the Nez Perce men, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/weippe-watkuweis.htm\">Walamottinin (Twisted Hair) and Tetoharsky</a>, who were traveling with them. They sold the visitors dogs—dozens of dogs that the expedition members then killed and ate. The locals wondered why these men would rather eat dogs than the delicious salmon that were spawning. </p> <p paraeid=\"{76a12922-2f99-481d-b9ff-92c82cd3f84a}{165}\" paraid=\"1682703636\">On the party’s journey upstream the following year, another man who lived in the region and knew the river well accompanied the travelers. In exchange for the ride, he helped the party decide which villages to visit.

He hosted the party for several days at his village on the visitors’ journey downstream in the fall and then upstream in the spring. They socialized, sang, danced, and rested. They traded canoes and horses and Yelépt helped them prepare for the upstream journey.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{668f12b7-67b6-411a-87a2-80460054d273}{7}\" paraid=\"1910529062\">Fishing for salmon along the Columbia has long been a way of life for Indigenous people of the Columbia River Plateau. That continues to this day, despite <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/celilo-falls-oregon.htm\">the dams</a> that have made it harder for the salmon to make their way upstream.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Clark, who was traveling on foot, passed above the bluffs and did not view them.<br /> <br /> Located nearly a mile east of the city of Townsend, the distinctive bluffs are an exposure of Pre-Cambrian Greyson Shale. By the late-1990s the scenic quality of the natural features was increasingly threatened by encroaching real estate development. A preservation effort led by the <a href=\"http://www.crimsonbluffs.org/\">Crimson Bluffs Chapter of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation</a> culminated in the 2002 acquisition of a 50-acre parcel of land encom­passing the bluffs by the Bureau of Land Management.

The lake is said to take its name from a man named Cullaby, a well-known Indian thought to be the son of Jack Ramsay, a native man whom Meriwether Lewis and William Clark met on December 31, 1805. Described by Clark as being “…freckled with long duskey red hair, about 25 years of age, and must Certainly be half white at least, this man appeared to understand more of the English language than the others of his party, but did not Speak a word of English, he possessed all the habits of the Indians,” it is speculated that Ramsay’s father was had either been shipwrecked or deserted from a British trading ship.<br /> <br /> The park offers public access to Cullaby Lake, along with a boat launch and docks and a variety of activities for visitors to enjoy, such as playgrounds, fishing, swimming, nature observation areas, and picnicking, just to name a few. Four-stall restrooms with flushing toilets are also on site.<br /> <br /> The picnic shelters are available for rental year-round. The fee is $35 per day.

The refuges serve as habitats for endangered and native species, as well as Migratory Birds during certain parts of the year.<br /> <br /> The DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge was originally named after the town of DeSoto, Nebraska, which was itself named after the DeSoto River Bend. Prosperous in the mid 19th century, the town served as a key transportation destination along the Missouri River. In the mid 20th century, the area was identified as having high potential for the development of wildlife. The DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge was officially established on March 12, 1958. In the Lewis and Clark expedition, the DeSoto River Bend served as the location of the captains’ campgrounds during their first meeting with the Native Americans at Council Bluff.<br /> <br /> The Boyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge, named after the Boyer Chute that crosses through the middle of the Refuge, was created in 1992. The Boyer Chute had originally been blocked off in 1937 in an attempt to simplify the path for boat travel, to the detriment of the chute’s native species. The Refuge’s mission is to preserve the habitats of various wildlife and aquatic species that reside in the area.<br /> <br /> Today, The Boyer Chute and DeSoto National Wildlife Refuges are managed jointly. The refuges provide opportunities for fishing, hunting, wildlife viewing, photography, education, and self-guided tours. The DeSoto Visitor Center features the Bertrand Steamboat Museum, which displays the remaining cargo found from the sunken Bertrand Steamboat of the 1860s.",

The following day Lewis wrote, “This morning early we passed over and formed a camp on the point formed by the junc­tion of the two large rivers. here in the course of the day I continued my observations […]. An interesting question was now to be determined; which of these rivers was the Missouri”. Most of the party believed the north branch to be the Missouri, because its water was the same muddy consistency as the rest of the Missouri. By contrast, the waters of the south branch ran clear. Lewis and Clark suspected this branch was the Missouri, as the clear water indicated it sprang from the mountains. Choosing the wrong course would, at the least, cost valuable time and damage morale. At the worst, it could have derailed the entire expedi­tion. To gain greater certitude, Lewis and Clark spent the next five days exploring both rivers. By June 8, they correctly determined the south branch to be the Missouri River. The expedition spent the following few days refitting equipment and caching supplies to be retrieved during the return trip. On July 28, 1806, Lewis reunited with part of the Corps several miles upstream on the Missouri River, following a skirmish with the Blackfeet two days prior. They then retrieved a cache left at the mouth of the Marias River.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/montana-dakotas/upper-missouri-river-breaks\">Decision Point</a>, owned and managed by the BLM, is located near the town of Loma.

Getting around Point Ellice/Distress would have allowed them to meet up with one of the last trading ships of the season and refresh their supplies.<br /> <br /> What the Corps didn’t realize, however, was that it was about to run into some of the journey’s most treacherous moments. A fierce winter storm forced the Corps off the river on November 10, and pinned the group to a north shore cove consisting of little more than jagged rocks and steep hillside. Captain William Clark named the dreary spot “that dismal little nitch.” For six stormy days, the group was trapped by fierce wind and high waves at the rocky shoreline. For only the second time in the expedition, Clark said he was concerned for the safety of the Corps. <br /> <br /> It would be five days later, on November 15, that a break in the weather finally allowed the men to move forward. Once the wind and river calmed, Clark ordered the canoes loaded as quickly as possible and the Corps was able to make it around Point Ellice/Distress. They landed on a sandy beach where they established Station Camp. They missed the trading ship, but eventually achieved their exploration goals.<br /> <br /> In the following years this site became a fish receiving station to support a cannery operation, and later a ferry landing and train station. Eventually in 1968 and 1969 the Washington Department of Highways demolished the ferry landing and constructed the Megler Rest Area in its place. The Megler Rest Area was renamed the Dismal Nitch Rest Area in 2005. <h3>Today</h3> Located on SR 401, ten miles south of Naselle, Washington, visitors will find interpretive wayside exhibits about the expedition, as well as a short trail that leads to the approximate location of Lewis and Clark’s campsite.

The Center is owned and operated by Woodbury County Parks and is also where the Woodbury County Conservation Board is located.<br /> <br />    In August of 1804, The Corps of Discovery led by Lewis and Clark passed through present-day Sioux City, near where the Dorothy Pecaut Nature Center is currently located. Here, the expedition met with the Otos to inform them that their land was now part of the United States of America. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sergeant-charles-floyd.htm\">Sergeant Charles Floyd</a> died in Sioux City on August 20th, 1804, making him the only member of The Corps of Discovery to die during the expedition.<br /> <br />    Today, the Dorothy Pecaut Nature Center offers an opportunity to see what Sioux City may have looked like before it was inhabited by United States Citizens. The Center is over 14,000 square feet large and boasts an amphitheater, playground, exhibits, gardens, and hiking trails, among other amenities. Admission is free to the general public, although rooms in the center can be rented out for a fee.

S. and the upper of the 6 Villages the Mandans occupied about 25 years ago this village was entirely cut off by the Sioux & one of the others nearly, the Small Pox distroyed great Numbers.” The abandoned site documented by Clark – now known as Double Ditch – was another ancient Mandan earthlodge village that had been occupied for nearly 300 years until the ravages of the 1781-1782 smallpox epidemic. Although called Double Ditch, the site actually features evidence of four concentric ditches. The ditches were part of defensive perimeters. The earliest settlement, established circa 1350 CE, is estimated to have contained about 160 lodges and 2,000 families. It occupied an approximately 22-acre area. As the population subsequently diminished, the village contracted and smaller defensive perimeters were built. The fourth and final settlement at Double Ditch – established sometime in the 1700s – was reduced to only about four acres in size. <br /> <br /> The <a href=\"http://www.history.nd.gov/historicsites/doubleditch/index.html\">Double Ditch Historic Site</a> is located along the east bank of the Missouri River about seven-and-a-half miles north of Bismarck. It is publicly accessible, featuring walkways and interpretive signage. The archeo-logical remains of earthlodges, refuse mounds, and fortification ditches are clearly discernable.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr8ZbAHuRpM&feature=youtu.be\">Double Ditch animation</a>",

        "notes": "Double Ditch Indian Village\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/double-ditch-indian-village.htm\n\n<p>Double Ditch Indian Village is an archaeological site located seven and one-half miles north of Bismarck, ND. For nearly 300 years (from approximately AD 1490 – 1785), this site was the location of a large earthlodge village inhabited by the Mandan Indians. According to Mandan oral history, Double Ditch was one of seven to nine villages simultaneously occupied near the mouth of the Heart River. The Mandan population in this area probably totaled 10,000 or more during this time. The earthlodge villages were centers of trade between the Mandans, their nomadic neighbors, and later, Euroamerican traders. A massive smallpox epidemic swept the interior of North America about 1781-1782. This catastrophe was apparently responsible for the abandonment of Double Ditch and all the other Mandan villages near the Heart River. The Mandans had moved to new villages farther upriver. People of Mandan Indian ancestry live today throughout much of the Northern Great Plains. As one of the Three Affiliated Tribes, the Mandan tribal headquarters are at Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota.</p> <p>The Mandans built dome-shaped houses of logs and earth, known as earth-lodges. All that remains of the earthlodges on the surface are circular depressions. The men usually decided how large an earthlodge would be, and the women did most of the building. To build an earthlodge, a wooden framework was erected, then covered with layers of willow branches, grass, and finally, earth. It took about 150 trees to build one earthlodge. Earthlodges typically were 35 to 45 feet in diameter, although they varied from 20 to 65 feet, and housed a family of eight to twenty people.</p> <p>The Mandans are one of the best-known agricultural tribes of the Missouri Valley region. The Missouri River valley provided water, food, and shelter for the Mandans. Abundant timber and game could be found in the wooded bottomlands, and bison flourished on the surrounding prairie grasslands. The terrace-edge settings of the villages offered access to garden land and abundant timber as well as extensive views up and down the valley. The Mandans developed a rich and elaborate culture based on farming and bison hunting. Farming produced a large surplus of food which could be stored for use during leaner times and traded to nomadic, non-farming groups. Principal crops include corn, beans, and squash. Sunflowers and tobacco also were grown.</p> <p>In the archaeological record the dominant role of bison, hunted for their hides and meat, is evident. Other animals also were hunted and trapped, including pronghorns, deer, wolves, rabbits, beavers, muskrats, porcupines, foxes, mink, badgers, and bobcats. A diverse variety of birds (waterfowl, hawks and eagles, grouse, cranes, owls, woodpeckers, crows, ravens, and small songbirds) and fishes (sturgeons, gars, mooneyes, pikes, suckers, catfishes, and cods) are represented in the archaeological record. These animals all contributed to the subsistence of the villagers. Each supplied an important source of bone for tools and ornaments, as well as being tapped for their hides, furs, and plumage.</p> <p>Fortification systems consisted of a deep moat and a wall of wooden posts that formed a palisade. Natural features, such as steep terrain and riverbanks, also were used for added protection. Fortification systems attest to the fierce warfare between villagers and surrounding nomadic tribes that is reported in early historic records.</p> <p>The raised areas around the village are midden mounds or earthen mounds ranging from one to ten feet high. There are more than 30 mounds surrounding the village. The oldest mounds, dating to AD 1550-1650, occur directly atop Ditches 3 and 4. Excavations showed some mounds to be accumulations of household refuse – animal bones, broken pottery, and ash from hearths – carried and dumped in huge heaps. Other mounds were composed partially or entirely of fill excavated from elsewhere in the village, clearly indicating that those mounds were intentionally constructed. During one phase of occupation, the village defense involved a combination of Ditch 2, which lacked bastions, and several large mounds placed as strong points just inside the ditch.</p>",

Clark marveled at the “inoumerable rocks of emence Sise out at a great distance from the Shore and against which the Seas brak with great force [and] gives this Coast a most romantic appearance.” He also noted a “village of 5 Cab­ins on the Creek which I shall call E co-la or whale Creek.” Unfortunately, the whale was “pillaged of every valuable part” and “noting more than the Sceleton.” At the village, Clark “purchased some oile and about 120 w of Blubber after rendered, finding they would not trade I Deturmined to return home with what we have.” On the journey back to Fort Clatsop, an attempt to rob and kill Hugh McNeal was thwarted.

The river falls twenty-six feet in 2.5 miles, enough to make a canoe descent tumultuous at high water and impossible at low water.106 In 1805, Josiah Espy described the falls viewed from Clarksville as a “zigzag channel which is only navigable at high water.” <br /> <br /> People who regularly traveled the busy Ohio River—whether French, American, Shawnee, Haudenosaunee, or Delaware—knew how to get around these rapids. They knew when the water was high enough to take a boat or canoe over them and when they needed to carry their vessels around the waterfalls (known as a <a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/portage-route.htm\">portage</a>).  <br /> <br /> William Clark’s family had <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/falls-of-the-ohio-old-clarksville-site.htm\">settled near these falls</a>. Here he met up with Meriwether Lewis here to begin their transcontinental journey.<br /> <br /> The falls no longer look like they once did. Private interests constructed a canal and locks south of the falls starting in 1825, to improve navigation on the river. The federal government later enlarged the canal and added additional dams, so that by 1964, dams made the river no longer navigable at this point: all traffic had to go through the canal.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

The Society was founded on May 15, 1884, by ten men, mostly amateur historians based in Louisville, led by Reuben T. Durrett. The Society takes its name from Kentucky’s first historian, John Filson, whose map of the state and book, <em>The Discovery, Settlement, and Present State of Kentucke</em>, brought him fame in 1784.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{be2c73cd-e4dd-4828-b8f2-bdd27afa8c8e}{165}\" paraid=\"1780415081\">The Ferguson Mansion, built in 1905 by the architectural firm Cobb & Dodd for Edwin Hite Ferguson, has served as the headquarters for the Filson Historical Society since 1986. The mansion boasts its own historical significance and is a stunning showcase of Beaux-Arts architecture, a style characterized by order, symmetry, and extensive decorative detail. It later served as a funeral home and passed through two more owners before being purchased and renovated by the Filson Historical Society.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{be2c73cd-e4dd-4828-b8f2-bdd27afa8c8e}{169}\" paraid=\"259932834\">According to the Society, its mission is “to collect, preserve, and tell the significant stories of Kentucky and Ohio Valley history and culture.” Their many collections of photographs, manuscripts, books, and artifacts represent a period that spans more than 230 years. Included among them are six original letters written by William Clark and one original letter written by Meriwether Lewis, all transcribed during their 1803-1806 expedition. Several related documents include a diary by Clark’s brother, Jonathan Clark, and a prospectus by Lewis detailing the official expedition history. Artifacts and portraits of the explorers and their kin are also included in the collection.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{be2c73cd-e4dd-4828-b8f2-bdd27afa8c8e}{173}\" paraid=\"1341187474\">Several physical and virtual resources are available for research purposes and are regularly utilized by guests from all over the world. The staff is very knowledgeable and available for assistance and private tours. The Filson Society helps edit the peer-reviewed journal, Ohio Valley History, and also publishes a seasonal news magazine, The Filson, with articles written by staff and volunteers to aid in community outreach. Educational events and discussions are held regularly for the public, and rooms within the charming Ferguson Mansion are available to rent for special events and gatherings.

Such knowledge was necessary so that the American representatives could establish a precedent that all occupants of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-and-clark-enter-into-louisiana-purchase.htm\">Louisiana Territory</a> were under the rule of the United States.

Among them was Big Horse, who had returned from the bison hunt. The formal council began on August 3. Lewis and Clark had ordered a makeshift pavilion set up on a tall bluff rising seventy feet above the Missouri River. From the top, they “observed the most butifull prospects imagionable.” They saw expanses of grassy prairie, groves of cottonwood in the bottomlands, and the river meandering through it all. From this vantage, the two delegations exchanged speeches. Lewis informed their guests of the transfer of land—their land?!—from France to the United States. He explained the “wishes of our government to Cultivate friendship & good understanding.” He gave the leaders of the delegation peace medals and invited them to send envoys to Washington, DC. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a89454bb-7605-4a31-92e7-730758662897}{65}\" paraid=\"481792242\">The historical record provides few clues to what Big Horse and the other Missouri and Otoe leaders may have thought about the meeting. They had held many diplomatic meetings with people of European descent before. Lewis and Clark’s grandiose language of U.S. sovereignty might have seemed like just a shift in trading partners, as had happened many times before among the White people. And so, Big Horse and the others “made Some verry Sensable Speeches,” were kind to their guests, and then moved on with their lives.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Convincing the wary Shoshone to return across the continental divide with him and then assist the expedi­tion in portaging over Lemhi Pass proved to be a tremendous test of Lewis’ skillful diplomacy. However, it was Sacagawea’s joyful reunion with her brother Cameahwait that cemented the trust and goodwill between the two groups. Subsequently, Lewis and Clark were able to barter for 29 or 30 horses to transport all of their supplies through the mountains. They also secured the services of a guide, whom they nick­named “Old Toby.” The Corps of Discovery departed Cameahwait’s Shoshone camp on August 30.<br /> <br /> The First Flag Unfurling Site is a five-acre National Register-listed property located on BLM land adjacent to the Salmon-Challis National Forest. A historical marker and interpretive wayside exhibit are located next to a pull-off on NF-185, also known as Warm Springs Road. Despite the name and designation, there is no sup­porting evidence that this was the actual site Lewis unfurled the flag. However, it provides a good overview of the terrain and general area occupied by the Shoshone and traversed by the expedition.<br />  ",

Tribal representatives finally arrived on the evening of August 2, and council was held throughout the following day. Recognizing the strategic value of the location, Clark wrote, “The Situation of this place which we Call Council Bluff which is handsom ellevated a Spot well Calculated for a Tradeing establishment, the Bank high & leavel on top well Calculated for a fort to Command the Countrey and river the low bottom above high water & well Situated under the Command of the Hill for Houses to trade with the Natives a butifull Plain both abov and below at no other bend on either Side does the High land touch the river for Some distance up, as I am told.” <br /> <br /> In 1819, <a href=\"http://outdoornebraska.gov/fortatkinson/\">Fort Atkinson</a> was established at the site of Council Bluff. As the first U.S. military post west of the Missouri River, it was a gateway to the fur trade in the Upper Missouri and Rocky Mountains. The fort’s strategic importance eventually dwindled and it was abandoned in 1827. By the 1850s, it had almost entirely deteriorated. In the 1950s, the <a href=\"https://history.nebraska.gov/\">Nebraska State Historical Society</a> completed archeological surveys to determine building sites. The <a href=\"http://outdoornebraska.gov/\">Nebraska Game and Parks Commission</a> acquired the property in 1971, and reconstructed the fort during the 1980s and 1990s. Currently, <a href=\"http://outdoornebraska.gov/fortatkinson/\">Fort Atkinson</a> is open to the public as a Nebraska state historical park.<br /> <br /> On July 30, 1804 the Corps set up camp at a site which later became known as Fort Atkinson. During their stay here hosted the first formal meeting between representatives of the U.S. government and western tribes. At sunset on August 2, a party of Otoe and a few Missouris arrived at the camp, and official meetings began after breakfast on August 3. The structure of the council would establish the routine for all subsequent councils on the expedition. Upon it’s conclusion, the explorers continued their journey up the river.<br /> <br /> Fort Atkinson was established officially established during the Yellowstone Expedition of 1819. Named after the Expedition’s commander, Col. Henry Atkinson, it was the U.S. military post west of the Missouri River. During it’s existence, between 1820 and 1827, it served as the first school and library in Nebraska. It was also a gateway to the fur regions of the Upper Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, and served as the starting point for several early expeditions to the Mexican settlements of Taos and Santa Fe. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"> </p>",

Col. Jacob Kingsbury, the fort was the first U.S. military installation west of the Mississippi River.  The trading fort was an important gathering place for officers and enlisted men; Native peoples; and French, Spanish and American settlers, trappers, and traders.  <br /> <br /> The original site of the Corps campsite and the first Fort Belle Fontaine have been destroyed by shifts in the Missouri River channel. The grounds below the bluff became a popular summer retreat during the late 1930s and in 1936 the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built a grand limestone staircase down from the bluff along with a number of other structures. Today, Fort Belle Fontaine Park is a 305-acre park of St. Louis County. <br /> <br /> Fort Belle Fontaine<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">is a </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> on the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">The expedition first camped on an island opposite Coldwater Creek on May 14, 1804. During 1805, Canton­ment Belle Fontaine was built on the south bank of the Missouri River at the mouth of Coldwater Creek by companies of the 1st U.S. Infantry under Lt. Colonel Jacob Kingsbury. The expedition visited the new fort on their return journey. On September 22, 1806, Ordway wrote that “towards evening we arived at Bell foun­tain a Fort or cantonement on South Side which was built since we ascended the Missouri & a handsome place. we moovd. a short distance below and Camped, the Company of Artillery who lay at this fort fired 17 Rounds with the field peaces the most of our party was Quartered in the Canonment.” The next day they returned to St. Louis. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">The original cantonment housed a government-operated trading post (or factory), until that function was transferred to Fort Osage and Fort Madison in 1808. By 1809, the post had deteriorated and relocation to a new site above a bluff began. The new Fort Belle Fontaine, completed in 1811, included 30 buildings, several blockhouses, a rectangular palisade, and an arsenal. In 1826, the second fort was abandoned and replaced by Jefferson Barracks, a new post located in St. Louis. The City of St. Louis acquired the Fort Belle Fontaine property in 1913 and built a detention home and training school for boys. In the 1930s the Work Progress Administration (WPA) built a “grand staircase” of stone steps from the riverbank to the top of the bluff, as well as trails and facilities.

After finding a location that offered plenty of game and close proximity to the ocean, Clark sketched a preliminary site plan, and they began construction in early December. The fort was completed by January 1st and housed 32 men, one woman, a baby, and a dog. Joseph Whitehouse wrote that the officers named the fort \"after a nation of Indians who resided near us, called the Clatsop Nation.\" They spent the extremely rainy winter collecting supplies, making salt and leather, and preparing their maps and journals. <br /> <br /> After the expedition finally departed on March 23, 1806, Fort Clatsop gradually deteriorated. A reconstruction of the fort based on Clark's sketch was completed in 1955, but burned down in 2005. Today a second replica, completed in 2006, can be explored in the same location.</p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>Visitors can experience the newest replica of Fort Clatsop by walking through the rooms, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/trails.htm\">hiking the trails </a>around the area, chatting with costumed rangers, and participating in ranger-led programs during the peak seasons.<br /> <br /> The visitor center located at this site provides basic amenities and offers a museum, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/learn/bookstore.htm\">bookstore</a>, and two films.

Lewis arrived at Fort Kaskaskia on November 29, where he sought recruits with a range of skills, from hunting to carpentry to blacksmithing. <br /> <br /> Indigenous communities that were part of the Illinois Confederation had hunted and farmed these lands for millennia. French settlers established a trading post at Kaskaskia in 1703, near an existing Illiniwek village, and then built an earthworks fort in 1759. The French officially ceded the land to the British in 1763, but French-speaking people remained. After the American Revolutionary War, the British transferred the Illinois Country, including Kaskaskia, to the United States. Indigenous people living here had not consented to these land transfers between colonial powers.  <br /> <br /> When Lewis arrived in 1803, the civilian population at Fort Kaskaskia was still largely French speaking, but the U.S. military controlled the fort. Many Shawnee, Delaware, and other Indigenous people lived nearby. <br /> <br /> Lewis recruited ten members of the Corps from Kaskaskia: John Boley, John Collins, John Dame, Patrick Gass, John Ordway, Ebenezer Tuttle, Peter Weiser, Isaac White, Alexander Hamilton Willard, and Richard Windsor. These men ranged in age from nineteen to thirty-two years old, and most were hired as laborers. Only two of the men were ranked higher than privates: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/patrick-gass-and-john-ordway.htm\">Ordway</a> was recruited as a sergeant. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/patrick-gass-and-john-ordway.htm\">Gass</a>, a carpenter, would be promoted from private to sergeant after the death of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sergeant-floyd-s-death.htm\">Charles Floyd</a>. <br /> <br /> Lewis also hired French and Métis engagés. (Métis is a term for Indigenous people who also have French or other European heritage, and engagés was a common name for river navigators in the North American fur trade, many of whom spoke French.) These engagés operated the boats that ferried new recruits up the Mississippi River to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/camp-dubois-illinois.htm\">Camp Dubois</a>. Some of these men stayed with the expedition to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-mandan.htm\">Fort Mandan</a>.

Garrison Hill Cemetery, established in 1891, is also within the site grounds. This special cemetery was established for the gravesites of early settlers whose original resting places were under threat from flood waters in the late 19th century. The Mississippi River overlook includes nearby tables and a pavilion for picnics. At the bottom of the bluff is a path that takes visitors to the historic Pierre Menard Home, built around 1815. This well preserved and beautiful site is named in honor of its builder, Pierre Menard, who served in the Illinois legislature and was a fur trader and businessman.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a81d6967-528e-436a-819a-5d0c1e561df2}{110}\" paraid=\"4\">For tent campers, there are both primitive and 32 electric-hookup campsites. Water is also available at select locations. Fire pits are located at each site. Two playgrounds are also available in the day-use area. The park is open year around for campers and visitors.

Lewis wrote, “This place we have named Fort Mandan in honour of our Neighbours.” Clark “fixed on a place for to build a fort and Set to work.” As described by Gass, “the huts were in two rows, containing four rooms each, and joined at one end forming an angle. When rasied about 7 feet high a floor of puncheons or split plank were laid, and covered with grass and clay; which made a warm loft. The upper part projected a foot over and the roofs were made shed-fashion, rising from the inner side, and making the outer wall about 18 feet high. The part not inclosed by the huts we intended to picket. In the angle formed by the two rows of huts we built two rooms, for holding our provisions and stores.” The Corps stayed at this location until April 7, 1805. While there, they engaged in diplomacy with area tribes, made preparations for the next leg of the journey, and consolidated records and specimens that would go back downriver with the keelboat in the spring. Fort Mandan is also the site where Sacagawea and Charbonneau first joined the expedition.<br /> <br /> The historic site of Fort Mandan is located on privately-owned land along the northeast banks of the Mis­souri, about 12 miles west of the city of Washburn.

With a rich history that stretches back well before the Revolutionary War, Fort Massac is the site where, in November 1803, the Corps of Discovery added George Drouillard to its expedition. The park is also the site where, in 1778, William Clark’s older brother, Colonel George Rogers Clark, led a Virginia militia regiment known as the “Long Knives” up through Massac Creek and into Illinois Territory, later taking the territory from the British. Today, an 8.8 mile trail named in honor of George Rogers Clark stretches from the nearby city of Metropolis, IL, through Fort Massac State Park, crossing over Massac Creek in the East of the park. <br /> <br /> While the original fort no longer stands, a replica was built in 2002, based on the 1802 fort constructed by Americans. Fort Massac became Illinois’ first state park on November 5, 1908, initially covering a mere 22 acres. Today, visitors can visit the park’s museum which boasts of myriad prehistoric objects on display. The park also offers various historic programs that cover the time period of the mid 18th century to the Civil War. Every October the park puts on the Fort Massac Encampment, a multi-day event in which visitors can see and interact with period performers. The family friendly event offers contemporary food, music, and educational reenactments to show visitors how early American pioneers, settlers, and the military conducted day to day life. Throughout the rest of the year, Fort Massac hosts “Living History” weekends for visitors (contact the park directly for further details). <br /> <br /> Campers can choose from tent camping, or vehicular camping sites. The 50 sites designated for vehicle camping include showers and electricity. In addition to the history and scenery, campers are also welcome to play 9 or 18 holes of disc golf on the park’s disc golf course.<br /> <br /> Hunters and anglers are welcome to the park. Check in with the park first for regulations. Hunting game includes squirrel, woodcock, deer, dove and rabbit. Fishing game includes bullhead, carp, catfish, crappie, drum and largemouth bass.<br /> <br /> When you visit the park, make sure to stop by the visitor center to see museum artifacts and collect information about the park and surrounding areas.

The French built the original fort in 1757, in an area where Chickasaw, Osage, and Shawnee people lived. In 1794, the U.S. military took it over and it became a stopping point for White American settlers moving west.  <br /> <br /> Here, Lewis and Clark sought men with a diversity of skills, including hunting and carpentry, to join their expedition. Language skills and cultural knowledge were especially important, since this was a diplomatic mission into Indigenous lands.  <br /> <br /> Two key members joined the party at Fort Massac: George Drouillard and Private Joseph Whitehouse. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/profile-of-george-drouillard.htm\">Drouillard</a>, whose father was French-Canadian and mother was Shawnee, was hired as an interpreter. He spoke Shawnee, French, English, and the sign language that was common among Indigenous communities and non-Native traders across North America.  <br /> <br /> Whitehouse, who was already enlisted in the U.S. Army, was stationed at Fort Massac. Like many people living in the area, his family moved west to Kentucky during the wave of White settlers displacing Indigenous people. Whitehouse learned valuable skills during his time in the Kentucky woods, including hunting, curing meat, and preparing hides. <br /> <br /> The expedition journals note many times when Whitehouse’s skills as a tailor and skin curer were useful to the crew. During the summer of 1805, Lewis tasked Whitehouse with preparing and sewing together elk skins for construction of his <a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/portage-route.htm\">iron-framed boat</a>.  <br /> <br /> Whitehouse was one of the only lower-ranking members of the expedition who was tasked with keeping a journal. In it, he often mentioned being asked to repair or make new clothing for the party. In Idaho, for example, he made caps from otter skins procured through trade.<br /> <br /> Both Drouillard and Whitehouse brought skills critical to the Lewis and Clark Expedition. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

The Corps of Discovery first passed through the area on June 23, 1804, although no mention regarding the site’s suitability for a fort was noted in the journals. At the time, Clark only documented an island that was then across the river from the later site of Fort Osage. However, when he returned in 1808 as a brigadier general in the Louisiana Territory militia and U.S. agent for Indian Affairs, Clark referenced his initial un­documented impression of the location, writing that he “examined the Situation and the points of a Small Island which is opposit, found the River could be completely defended and Situation elegant, this Situation I had examined in the year 1804 and was delighted with it and am equally so now, […] and fixed on the spot for the fort and other buildings.” In 1810, as Nicholas Biddle prepared the expedition journals for publica­tion, he interviewed and corresponded with Clark in order to elaborate on details within the text. Based on information provided by Clark at this time, the first edition of the journals, published in 1814, revised the original June 23, 1804 journal entry to insert the text: “Directly opposite on the south, is a high command­ing position, more than seventy feet above high-water mark, and overlooking the river, which is here but of little width; this spot has many advantages for a fort, and trading house with the Indians.” Following aban­donment in 1827, archeologists rediscovered the fort’s foundations in the 1940s. It was then reconstructed to portray the circa-1812 appearance.</p>",

The expedition’s first introduction to the region was on the evening of Monday, September 24, 1804 when Lewis, Clark and their entourage of 43 men and three boats anchored at the mouth of what is now known as Bad River. This location today is Fischers Lilly Park in Fort Pierre. The consequent days which saw the expedition’s first interaction with the Lakota people, then known as the Teton Sioux, proved contentious. Challenges in communication and differing objectives led to what many believe was the closest the expedition came to ending. We know this today because much of the interaction was recorded in Captain Clark’s journal, including the following excerpt:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“and such curiosities as we thought might amuse them; in this we succeeded to well; for after giving them a quarter of a glass of whiskey, which they seemed to like very much, and sucked the bottle dry, it was with much difficulty that we could get rid of them. They at last accompanied Captain Clark on shore in a dugout canoe with five men; but it seems they had formed a design to stop us; for no sooner had the party landed that three of the Indians seized the cable of the dugout canoe, and one of the soldiers of the chief put his arms around the mast; the second chief, who was intoxicated, then said, that we should not go on, that they had not received presents enough from us…” </i></p> </blockquote> <p>Today, visitors can visit Fischers Lilly Park along with the thriving towns of Pierre and Fort Pierre, located on opposite sides of the Missouri River. The area is known for its political significance as capital of the state, high density of museums and historic sites, its plethora of outdoor recreation activities including fishing and water sports on the Missouri River, and hunting and bird watching in the Fort Pierre National Grassland and surroundings. </p>",

Today Fort Stevens is a 4,300-acre park offering a variety of recreation adventures including camping, beach-combing, a freshwater lake, museum, trails, wildlife viewing, and a historic shipwreck.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Georgia, Times, \"Times New Roman\", serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">History</span><br /> Situated inside Fort Stevens State Park at the mouth of the Columbia River, Point Adams has served as an important landmark for centuries. When Europeans first arrived in the area, it was the site of a large Clatsop settlement, and William Clark noted eight large houses on the site when they passed by in 1805. <br /> <br /> The area later became a Civil War-era military fort established in 1863. The original earthen fort was built to keep British and Confederate gunboats from entering the mouth of the Columbia River. <br /> <br /> After World War II, Fort Stevens was considered obsolete, and it was turned over to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for use as a headquarters in 1947. Then, in 1975, the site was officially designed a state park after being leased to Oregon State Parks.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Georgia, Times, \"Times New Roman\", serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Today</span><br /> Visitors can visit the historic Fort Stevens and Point Adams. The park’s visitor center and museum interpret the site’s long history. Tours through the old earthen fort and artillery gun batteries are also available. Those with a passion for the outdoors will enjoy the golf course, fishing, 15 miles of multi-use trails, and access to Coffenbury Lake for swimming and boating. Picnic tables are available on a first-come-first-served basis.<br /> <br /> There are several camping options available in one of the countries largest public campgrounds. All campsites are ADA accessible and come equipped with a picnic table and grill. Yurts and cabins are also available for rent.

It was in the area of an abandoned Kansa Indian village that had been occupied in the 1740s and 1750s. <br /> <br /> The men camped on the Missouri side of the river, and William Clark noted that on the Kansas side the French had established a small fort known as Fort de Cavagnial (or Cavagnolle). He was informed of this fort by one of the French voyageurs. <br /> <br /> Named after the French governor of Louisiana, the fort was built in 1744 and abandoned in 1764 when France transferred the territory to Spain. It was located just north of present Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and was not a military fort, but rather a stockade to control the trade with the Kansa and Osage Indians and perhaps to promote trade with the Spanish to the southwest.<br /> <br /> According to the Frontier Army Museum at Fort Leavenworth, the log structure was 80-feet square, with protective extensions at each corner. Inside the fort was the commandant’s house, the guard house, and a powder and traders’ house. It’s believed the post population totaled about 40 people, consisting of the commandant, about 10 French soldiers, and the traders and their families.<br /> <br /> Today, a plaque marks the likely area of the fort site, about three miles northwest of Fort Leavenworth.  It mentions Lewis and Clark visiting the abandoned fort, but nothing is written in the July 2, 1804 journal entries about the Captains crossing the river and actually visiting the remains.",

Though France’s colonies were sparsely populated, the French influence can still be felt in Southern Illinois, with perhaps the best example  being Fort de Chartres.</p> <p>Originally a wooden fort, Fort de Chartres was upgraded to a stone fort from 1753 to 1754, right around the time when the French and Indian War began. While it was an important French fort, the Fort du Chartres was abandoned by the British and it fell into disrepair. Eventually, the only things remaining were foundations and the powder magazine. </p> <p>The Fort de Chartres, however, stands again, after many years of restoration. It is full of buildings and reenactors who make visitors feel like they’ve been transported back to the 18th century. Reenactors wear period clothing and give a great perspective on what life was like when the fort was built. Visitors will quickly notice the quality and authenticity of all of the restorations, as the fort has been steadily improved upon with painstaking detail since the 1920s. One would hardly know that they weren’t in France!</p> <p>History lovers will be able to gather during the trade fair, where craftspeople sell reproductions of period crafts and people play historic games, as well as events like demonstrations of 18th century cannons and a popular New Year’s Eve celebration. While there are always adventures to be had at Fort de Chartres, these event days have a special feeling of community amongst the visitors who all decide to travel back in time together.</p> <p>Whether you are in the area during one of these special occasions or passing through on non-event days, be sure not to miss Fort de Chartres!</p>",

On the Missouri River, not far from present day Helena, the hardy members of the Lewis and Clark expedition toiled to move upstream. Rock embankments made towing from shore impossible, and the deep channel forced the men to row rather than pole their boats forward.</p> <p>Suddenly, there loomed before them towering rock formations unlike any they had ever seen. From both sides of the river, limestone cliffs rose to a spectacular height of 1200 feet. “In many places,” wrote Meriwether Lewis, “the rocks seem ready to tumble on us.” At each bend in the waterway, great stone walls seemed to block passage, only to open like gentle giant gates as the expedition drew near. In his journal, Meriwether wrote: “I shall call this place: “GATES OF THE MOUNTAINS“.</p> <p>The name stuck, and for nearly two centuries travelers have ventured down this stretch of the Missouri to marvel at its natural wonders. Today, most visitors enjoy the beauty of the Gates of the Mountains from aboard a tour boat – the “Canyon Voyager” or the “Sacajawea” (named after the only women and indigenous person on the Expedition). Aboard a comfortable open-air boat (covered in case of rain), you’ll glide through magnificent country Meriwether Lewis would still recognize if he could return.</p> <p>Great towering walls of limestone still stand guard over the river. Bighorn sheep and Mountain Goats scamper in the rocks high above the water. Ospreys, eagles (bald and golden), vultures and falcons (peregrine and prairie) still soar on the updrafts. The canyon is also home to otters, deer, squirrels, ermine, beaver, mountain lions, black bears and other wild creatures. The life list for bird species is over 120 right now.</p> <p>From the vessel you can see Mann Gulch, the site of the raging forest fire that killed 13 smokejumpers, August 5, 1949. This tragedy was the main subject matter of Norman Maclean’s book “Young Men and Fire”. The story of Mann Gulch is one of the more interesting stories told by the guide and pilot.</p> <p>Near Mann Gulch the pilot will hug the shoreline to give you a look at Indian pictographs painted on the rock wall. Proof that indigenous people lived here long before Meriwether named it the Gates of the Mountains.</p> <p>The tour’s main attraction, though, is the inexhaustible scenery – wooded slopes, rugged rock formations, and the placid beauty of the timeless Missouri.</p>",

While the overall landscape has changed with time and while the area is not specifically cited in the Lewis and Clark journals, geologic and riverine scientific study suggests a high probability the island existed during the passage of their expedition in 1804 and 1806. Today the 800-acre property supports a wide variety of wildlife on its sandbars and within its dense forested areas of cottonwood and Eastern red-cedar. Chutes paralleling the island, free-flowing water, vegetation, and sandbars not only provide important wildlife habitat, but add to the aesthetic qualities of the Park’s 59-Mile District.<br /> <br /> Goat Island provides unique and unparalleled recreational opportunities, as well as a place to simply pause and reflect. Situated along the Missouri National Recreational River Water Trail, the island is one of only a few places in both Nebraska and South Dakota where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mnrr/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm\">island camping</a>, hiking, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mnrr/planyourvisit/hunting.htm\">hunting</a>, and other pleasure activities are available on publicly owned land. As part of the National Park Service System, the island is ideally suited as a stopover point for boaters navigating the river. Similarly, Goat Island provides a natural setting to hike trails or set out on one’s own to explore and enjoy the riverine backdrop.<br /> <br /> <b>Primitive Camping </b><br /> Two designated tent camping only areas. The first (southern) campground area is in the process of being established. The second (northern) is targeted to be established in 2021. Primitive camping is allowed anywhere on the Island, with the exception of the established hunting season after Labor Day to January when camping is restricted to the two designated camping areas. Please email or call (605-665-0209) for a back country use permit issued by the Park's HQ Office.<b> </b><br /> <br /> The Goat Island Management Plan emphasizes the intent to retain the primitive character of the island in permanency. The overarching goal and management objectives outlined in the plan is to provide a quality recreational experience for visitors in the same spirit that historically contributed to the island’s popularity.<br /> Visit the <a href=\"https://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?parkID=151&projectID=71840&documentID=98316\">Goat Island Management Plan and Environmental Assessment FONSI</a> through the NPS Planning Environment and Public Comment (PEPC) website: <a href=\"https://parkplanning.nps.gov/projectHome.cfm?parkID=151&projectID=71840\">http://parkplanning.nps.gov/goatislandplan</a>.</p>",

On June 16, the expedition consolidated at a lower portage camp, about one mile below Belt Creek (named Portage Creek by Lewis and Clark). They encountered Sulphur Spring, located across the river from Belt Creek, and Lewis used its waters to aid the treatment of an extremely ill Sacagawea. While encamped they surveyed a suitable portage route, constructed wagons to haul canoes and supplies, and undertook the arduous task of moving their equipment 18 miles overland to the Upper Portage Camp. By June 28, the last load was transported away from the lower camp and remaining supplies cached in place. The white pirogue was left there and retrieved on the return trip in July 1806.<br /> <br /> The Great Falls Lower Portage is one of two discontiguous segments of the Great Falls Portage NHL, separated by the intrusion of Malmstrom Air Force Base. It includes the lower portage camp site, Sulphur Spring, and the northern portion of the portage route. The majority of the Great Falls Lower Portage is under private ownership.

On June 22, Lewis, Clark, and a contingent of the expedition began transporting the first load of equipment, to include the components of Lewis’ iron frame boat. The next day they arrived at the site selected for their upper por­tage camp, along a stretch of the Missouri River marked by three islands they named White Bear Islands. Lewis began the assemblage of his experimental boat, while Clark directed the portage endeavor. All sup­plies had been moved to the upper camp by July 2, but efforts to make the iron boat river-worthy contin­ued until July 9 when Lewis finally “relinquished all further hope of my favorite boat and ordered her to be sunk in the water, that the skins might become soft in order the better to take her in peices tomorrow and deposite the iron fraim at this place as it could probably be of no further service to us.” Putting the failed experiment behind them, Clark and ten men traveled 14 miles upstream and fashioned two cottonwood dugout canoes. By July 13, the entire expedition relocated to the “Canoe Camp,” and finally, on July 15, resumed their journey up the Missouri.<br /> <br /> The Great Falls Upper Portage is one of two discontiguous segments of the Great Falls Portage NHL, separated by the intrusion of Malmstrom Air Force Base. It includes the upper portage camp site and the southern portion of the portage route. Great Falls Upper Portage is under mixed private ownership, but there is a public parking area with interpretive wayside exhibits and expansive viewshed of the portage route landscape located off of 40th Avenue.<br /> <br /> On June 13, 1805, the Great Falls Portage presented Lewis and Clark with one of the most challenging ordeals of the Expedition. The Corps needed to find a way around the falls - a journey that would require all equipment and supplies be carried 18-miles overland. Progress was slow. The crudely-made wagons required almost constant repair. They trudged through intense heat, and prickly pear cacti tore through their moccasins. Lewis described his men's condition:</span></span></span></span></span></span></div> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">“. . .

Shore resembling a hat at a rapid at the lower point of an Island in the middle of the river on which there is 7 Lodges of nativs drying fish, and opposit the head of an Isld. near the Std. side on which is 5 Lodges of na­tivs drying fish.” During the 1805-1806 winter at Fort Clatsop, Clark prepared a list of “Estimated Distances in Miles” from Fort Mandan to the Pacific Coast, using “remarkable places” such as distinctive landmarks, confluences, and villages as reference points. Included in that list is “the hat rock.”<br /> <br /> Located about nine miles east of Umatilla off of Highway 730, Hat Rock is a formation of exposed basalt that rises approximately 70 feet to a plateau.

Imagine seeing this otherworldly boulder in the middle of a field of rolling hills in a vast, unexplored territory. The members of the expedition must have felt like they were on a different planet!</p> <p>While visiting Hat Rock today doesn’t have the same element of surprise, visitors will be able to enjoy a truly unique and beautiful landscape. The main attraction is of course, Hat Rock, and most people hike in the park to admire its natural beauty. Outside of Hat Rock, there are fields of scrubland peppered with flowers, as well as lush trees surrounding bodies of water. The park has its own pond, which is popular for fishing as it is teeming with rainbow trout. It also has access to a lake, a great place for water sports, and a sand volleyball court near the weather shelters. It is a perfect place for the whole family to experience the beauty of Oregon along the Columbia River.</p>",

        "notes": "Haystack Rock at the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/haystack-rock.htm\n\nThe Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established on May 6, 1935, to protect the breeding grounds for seabirds and marine mammals. It stretches for miles along the Oregon coast. Among the many species that make their home here are the Tufted Puffins, Common Murres, Black Oystercatchers, sea lions, and seals.<br /> <br /> Within the refuge are 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands, all of which have been designated National Wilderness Areas. One of the most iconic and recognizable of these is Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach, Oregon. On January 8, 1806, William Clark and a few other men of the Lewis and Clark Expedition had arrived in the area searching for a blue whale that the local tribes had reported to them. They were hoping to harvest a bit of meat from the carcass to bolster their dwindling supplies, but it was not to be. When they found the animal, the 105-foot-long behemoth was indeed laying net to Haystack Rock, but it was little more than a skeleton. A few days later, when the men returned to Fort Clatsop, another expedition member who had remained behind with Meriwether Lewis and the rest of the party, Joseph Whitehouse, recorded their report in his journal on January 10, 1806, saying: <blockquote> <p>“…In the evening late <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Captain Clark</a> & some of the party returned to the Fort. they informed us that they had been about 25 Miles along the Sea Coast, nearly a South course to see the Whale, <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-10#n27011016\"><sup>[16]</sup></a> expecting to get some of the Meat of it, and that they had to pass over rough <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">rockey mountains</a>, <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-10#n27011017\"><sup>[17]</sup></a> to get to the place where the whale lay, & that the Indians had showed them, to where a whale lay; which had been a long time Dead, which was on a very large Rock. It was about 105 feet long & every way proportionable. the head was shaped they said like the bow of a Vessell nearly. The party got some of the Jaw bones &ca…”</p> </blockquote> Rising 235 feet above the shoreline, Haystack Rock is an irregular basalt formation that was first created some 17 million years ago as lava flowed through the old Columbia River drainage system and intruded into soft marine sediments. Erosion and geologic uplift eventually revealed it and the many other large stone formations along the coast.<br /> <br /> Today, Haystack Rock is protected as one of Oregon’s seven Marine Gardens. It’s a popular location for tidepooling and, at low tide, visitors can walk right up to the enormous rock. A wide variety of birds can also be seen year-round. Gray Whales, Humpback Whales, Orcas, and Sperm Whales are often spotted from December to March. Visitors are encouraged to bring binoculars, spotting scopes, and cameras if they want to spot some of the giant creatures out in the water.<br /> <br /> The Haystack Rock Awareness Program presents interpretive programs from February to late October. Program schedules are available from City Hall, local businesses, and the Chamber of Commerce Information Center.

Little is left of the village, but depressions south of the campground are the remnants of pit houses used for years by the Nez Perce as they fished for lamprey near Asotin Creek.<br /> <br /> Lewis and Clark traveled through this area in the fall of 1805 as they continued down the Clearwater River until it entered the Snake.  The Lewis and Clark Discovery Center, located within the park, features indoor and outdoor displays and a film describing the journey of Lewis and Clark through Idaho. The Center has a two-acre outdoor interpretive plaza on the banks of the Snake River with a beautiful moving stream featuring sculptures by artist Rip Caswell.  While you're at the Center, don't miss the 32-minute movie called \"From the Mountains to the Sea: Lewis and Clark in Idaho,\" and be sure to stop by the Lewis and Clark gift shop.<br /> <br /> Hells Gate State Park offers plenty of outdoor fun – from camping to biking, boating to horseback riding, and disc golfing to fishing.  To learn more about the park and the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, go to <a href=\"https://parksandrecreation.idaho.gov/parks/hells-gate.\">https://parksandrecreation.idaho.gov/parks/hells-gate. </a>",

In the late summer and fall, people from far up- and downriver flocked to the area to trade. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark had heard of these prominent trading towns and hoped to spend the winter near them. </p> <p paraeid=\"{baf44ae0-62eb-4d02-a41a-ab403d7f0399}{59}\" paraid=\"1840044147\">In early November 1804, Lewis, Clark, and their crew arrived at the Mandan and Hidatsa villages. While the crew began to “Cut Down trees and raise our houses,” a French-Canadian trader came to introduce himself. His name was named Toussaint Charbonneau. He had lived in these villages for years, and he had two wives. One of these women was named <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a>.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{baf44ae0-62eb-4d02-a41a-ab403d7f0399}{119}\" paraid=\"533600784\">Charbonneau offered Lewis and Clark his own skills as an interpreter (he spoke French and some Hidatsa), as well as Sacagawea’s (she spoke Hidatsa and Shoshone). Lewis and Clark were aware of the importance of good interpreters. They also knew, from what Mandan people had told them, that would need to trade for horses with the Shoshone to cross the Rocky Mountains. They agreed to hire Charbonneau and Sacagawea for the duration of the journey. </p> <p paraeid=\"{baf44ae0-62eb-4d02-a41a-ab403d7f0399}{169}\" paraid=\"1087023120\">At age forty-six, Charbonneau became the oldest member of the permanent party, while Sacagawea, age sixteen, became the youngest.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{baf44ae0-62eb-4d02-a41a-ab403d7f0399}{205}\" paraid=\"1545934955\">As interpreters, Charbonneau and Sacagawea acted as critical links in a translation chain. Charbonneau did not speak English. But he could speak in French with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/profile-of-george-drouillard.htm\">George Drouillard</a>, as well as with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/st-charles-historic-district-missouri.htm\">French and Métis boatmen</a>. Sacagawea did not speak French or English, but she could speak Hidatsa with Charbonneau. A chain formed in which, during meetings with Shoshone people, Sacagawea would translate from Shoshone to Hidatsa. Charbonneau then translated from Hidatsa to French for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/profile-of-george-drouillard.htm\">Drouillard</a>. He would then translate to English, so Lewis and Clark could understand.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

        "notes": "Historic Fort Steuben\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/historic-fort-steuben.htm\n\nHistoric Fort Steuben is a reconstructed military fort located in Steubenville, Ohio, along the Ohio River. The Reconstruction of Fort Steuben began shortly after 1986, 200 years after the fort’s initial creation, and was led by the Old Fort Steuben Project. The name for Fort Steuben originates from Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, George Washington’s drillmaster during the revolutionary war. The fort offers a glimpse into what military life was like during the 18th century.<br />  <br /> Fort Steuben began its original construction in 1786, and completed construction in 1787. The First American Regiment built the fort with the purpose of protecting surveyors who were tasked with mapping the United States’ Northwestern territory to prepare it for settlement. Fort Steuben was abandoned in 1787 and later eradicated by a fire in 1790. The town of Steubenville was established after the abandonment of the fort. <br /> <br /> Lewis and Clark of the Corps of Discovery passed through the city of Steubenville as the expedition made their initial progress westward. On September 6th, 1803, as the group traveled down the Ohio River, Lewis wrote in his journal that they had reached the city of, as he spelled it, “Stewbenville.” He described it as a “small well built thriving place” despite the fact that the city had only been “five yers since it was wilderness.” No note was made of Fort Steuben because, by 1803, the fort had long since ceased to be.<br />  <br /> Today, Historic Fort Steuben features attractions such as an herb garden, an archaeology site, and the visitor’s center. The Exhibit Hall located inside the visitor’s center is home to a variety of exhibits that center around Ohio’s history. Fort Steuben provides the opportunity to explore the reconstructed Fort, and self-guided tours are available to visitors.<br /> <br /> For more information, call 740-283-1787 or email info@oldfortsteuben.com.

Horse Island was located just below the mouth of the Kaskaskia River at the beginning of a sharp bend in the Mississippi. As a result of changes in the course of the river, Horse Island has been absorbed into the Missouri shoreline in the vicinity of this marker, and the Mississippi River has shifted its course eastward, carrying away the original village of Kaskaskia.</p> <p>When the party reached Horse Island, Capt. Meriwether Lewis left his co-commander, William Clark, in charge of the keelboat and pirogues, while he was put ashore to walk the six-mile distance to Fort Kaskaskia. The fort was now an American Army post situated on the high ground on the east side of the Kaskaskia River opposite the village of Kaskaskia.</p> <p>Clark and the rest of the men, meanwhile, pushed their boats into the Mississippi and begin to work their way around a long and difficult bend, known as Coco Bend. Clark had wanted to make calculations of latitude with his sextant but a thick morning mist obscured the sun. The west side of Coco Bend hugged the Missouri shore and Clark observed a range of highlands next to the river. At 1 p.m., the party passed Joseph Donahoe’s landing. Boats loaded salt from the salt works in Saline Creek at this place. Two hours later, Saline Creek itself was passed. In addition to the salt works on this creek, there was also a thriving settlement. The party rounded Coco Bend and pulled up to Kaskaskia Landing on the Illinois shore. On the opposite side of the river was the former west bank community of Old Ste. Genevieve, known locally as “misar” (phonetic for misère in French, or misery in English). This community was relocated after disastrous floods in the 1780s.</p> <p>There is a roadside historical marker for visitors to glen into the times and landscape of 1803 when they camped here.</p> <p>(description courtesy <a href=\"https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM3TFV_Kaskaskia_Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition_Across_Missouri_Perry_County_MO\">waymarking.com</a>)</p>",

They cultivated corn, beans, squash, and watermelon in gardens along the river.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8457be30-8e20-4aad-82a7-1e957b3e545b}{205}\" paraid=\"572313948\">For generations, a large Kanza village existed near where Independence Creek meets the Missouri River. The village, with some 1,500 residents, consisted of nearly 150 lodges. It was large enough that Frenchman Étienne Veniard de Bourgmont documented it in on his map in 1724.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8457be30-8e20-4aad-82a7-1e957b3e545b}{237}\" paraid=\"363647661\">When Lewis and Clark arrived in July 1804, they found the village empty and mistakenly assumed that Kanza people had abandoned it.

He wrote, “Those Bluffs appear to have been laterly on fire, and at this time is too hot for a man to bear his hand in the earth at any debth, gret appearance of Coal. An emence quantity of Cabalt or a Cristolised Substance which answers its discription is on the face of the Bluff.” Ordway further elaborated that the bluff “had a Sulpheras Smell”.<br /> <br /> Following Lewis and Clark, later fur traders and travelers frequently noticed dense smoke and fire in this region. In 1839, French explorer J. N. Nicollet attempted to prove that these phenomena were not of vol­canic origin. He theorized that the decomposition of beds of iron pyrites in contact with water resulted in a heat capable of igniting other combustible materials. Still, by the late 1800s the bluff was known as the Ionia Volcano. It was named after the nearby town of Ionia, established in 1856. In 1878, a flooded Missouri River undermined the bluffs and a large section of the “volcano” fell into the river. The same flood heavily damaged the town of Ionia, which was later completely abandoned. By 1900, there was scientific consensus that the eruptions were due to the heat caused by the oxidation of damp pyritiferous and carbonaceous shale exposed by erosion. The Ponca Tribe consider the bluff to be a sacred site. Located north of Newcas­tle, Nebraska, the Ionia Cemetery is across the road from a small overlook and the top of the Ionia Volcano remnants.<br /> <br /> Learn more at <a href=\"http://www.lewis-clark.org/article/3351 \">Discovering Lewis and Clark</a>",

You can start your visit at the Missouri State Capitol. First, examine the Capitol grounds. Just a half-block east of the Capitol, you can visit the Lewis and Clark KATY Trailhead Plaza. The plaza features statues of Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, York, George Druillard, and Lewis’ dog Seaman. The plaza commemorates June 4, 1804, when the expedition camped in the area. Then, proceed to the north side of the Capitol to view the Louisiana Purchase statue, originally designed for the 1904 World’s Fair. One can get a great view of the Missouri River from this location. On the south side of the Capitol is a large statue of Thomas Jefferson, commemorating the namesake for the city.</p> <p>After touring the Capitol grounds, venture inside to see the Missouri State Museum, which encompasses both wings on the first floor, to learn about the history and resources of the state. The governor’s portraits in the first-floor, west wing have paintings of both Lewis and Clark honoring their respective terms as Missouri Territorial Governors. Throughout the Capitol are a variety of artworks related to the expedition. Proceed to the second floor hallway to view the lunette mural titled, “Lewis and Clark at the Mouth of the Osage River.” Then go up one floor to the third-floor Rotunda to view the Lewis and Clark statues and associated lunettes. From the windows of the Senate viewing gallery doors on the fourth-floor you can view the large mural titled, “Jefferson, Lewis and Clark.”</p> <p>After seeing the resources of the Capitol Complex, venture downtown for coffee, lunch, and shopping. Then go to the Jefferson City Greenway Skywalk Trail to walk over the Missouri River (adjacent to the highway bridge) and have a splendid view of downtown Jefferson City. At the Carl R. Noren Access, you can walk right up to the river’s bank. The Noren Access will also lead you to the KATY hiking/biking trail, which crosses virtually the entire state east-west.</p> <p>If you want a short-road trip, drive eight miles east to Clark’s Hill/Norton State Historic Site and enjoy the same view that William Clark did on June 2, 1804, when the expedition camped at the base of the hill, and Clark decided to climb to the top of the hill to enjoy its view.</p>",

The Knife River Indian Villages are spread out over 1,758 acres of land where the Knife River winds its way north before cutting back southwest. Here, at the confluence of the Missouri and Knife Rivers, was the home of the Corps of Discovery during the winter of 1805. It was at this location that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first met Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau, central figures to the expedition as it headed west in the spring of 1806. But while this area is significant to the history of the Corps of Discovery, the land has a long and rich history of its own.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ee77148d-e173-4f42-9b08-6d0f3e96a988}{176}\" paraid=\"1730831961\">With a Native American history dating back to at least 1300 CE, the land is home to the Mandan and Hidatsa people. Evidence of their long history is still visible in the site’s three villages. The southernmost of these villages, called the Awatixa Xi’e Village (also known as the Lower Hidatsa Site), is just a short distance (quarter mile) north from the Knife River Indian Village Visitor Center. Visitors can see the site of what once was home to 50 earth lodges, set out upon about 10 acres of land. Not too far north is the second village, called Awatixa Village, a stone’s throw from the Knife River itself. Of particular note to those interested in the history of the Corps of Discovery is that this village was the home of Sacagawea; in fact, it’s referred to as the Sacagawea Site. Originally, the site consisted of around 60 earth lodges, but today only 31 lodge sites are still visible. Awatixa Village is under threat from the river itself as nature gradually erodes the banks and edges closer to the lodge sites. But the erosion does allow for a unique experience along the walking trail: the chance to see artifacts from the village itself, buried between layers of earth that are gradually eroding, revealing the history below.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ee77148d-e173-4f42-9b08-6d0f3e96a988}{246}\" paraid=\"171397149\">The largest, and newest village (established around 1600 CE), is the Hidatsa Village (also known as the Big Hidatsa Village). This is the northernmost site of the Knife River villages and also sits near the Knife River. At one time, the 15.5 acres contained over 100 earth lodges and, at its designation in 1964 as a National Historic Landmark, its remaining constructions were considered among the best examples of Native American earth lodges.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{9}\" paraid=\"1571515515\">Before heading out on the trail to explore the Villages, be sure to stop by the Visitor Center and step inside a modern earth lodge construction, built in 1995 by the National Park Service. Here visitors can get an idea of the varied uses and complexity of these lodges. The earth lodge is available to visitors during regular park hours. In addition, the Knife River Indian Villages website offers more extensive history about the earth lodges and a helpful schematic of what the lodges looked like.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{19}\" paraid=\"48969615\">Admission to the site, its museum, and visitor center is free for all. The site is seasonal, so be sure to check with the visitor center to plan ahead. Keep in mind that the weather also varies in the extremes, from -35 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, to upwards of 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{41}\" paraid=\"1778755593\">While there is no camping on the Knife River Indian Villages NHS grounds, there are trails of different length throughout the site that link up and loop around all three villages. As you snap photos along your hike, be sure to share them on the iNaturalist app! This app helps the Knife River Indian Villages NHS research and study the plants and animals found throughout the park. Instructions on how to get and use the app are available through the Knife River Indian Villages NHS website.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{61}\" paraid=\"1513733091\">No food is sold at the visitor center, but hikers are permitted to bring their own food and picnic at designated picnic tables along the trails. In addition to the Indian Villages, there are ample natural sights and wildlife to see. If you are planning to visit the site over multiple days and would like to camp, the Stanton City Park (located at 501 Harmon Avenue, Stanton) is open to campers.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{80}\" paraid=\"1103688598\">Before your visit, check out the Knife River Indian Villages website where you can read up on the history of the area and download a checklist for wildlife viewing. Kids can join the Junior Park Ranger program on the site, as well. If visiting during the summer months, kids are welcome to join the kids camp (free to all) where they can learn about Native American history and partake in canoeing, fishing, crafts, Native American games, and hiking.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{90}\" paraid=\"1923339244\">To get the latest on hours of operation, or to find out more, call the Knife River Indian Villages NHS at (701) 745-3300. </p>",

Along that river were two Hidatsa towns, which were also home to many Mandan. Awatixa was the town where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a> and her husband, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, lived. These were winter villages, which were smaller than and upriver from summer villages. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{179}\" paraid=\"914467629\">Mandan and Hidatsa people cultivated crops in the fertile riverine lands, and they were well-acquainted with the French, British, and Spanish traders who traveled the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers to trade with them. They even permitted some of these traders, like Charbonneau, to live with them, as was customary in many Indigenous villages across the continent. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{223}\" paraid=\"1030498113\">In the winter of 1804–1805, Mandan and Hidatsa people permitted members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition to build a dwelling for the winter seven miles downriver. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{251}\" paraid=\"810725828\">Meriwether Lewis and William Clark wanted to be at this site because of its proximity to the Mandan and Hidatsa villages on the Knife River. They wanted to have access to the expansive trading network that revolved around these towns, which spanned west to the Rocky Mountains, north into Canada, and south through the Great Plains. A wide array of goods was available at these marketplaces: Spanish horses, Cheyenne leather goods, English and French guns and ammunition, and food grown and preserved by Mandan and Hidatsa people.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ab000ee8-b82f-45c3-a12b-0e56a16726af}{44}\" paraid=\"339846512\">Lewis and Clark wintered here because they needed access to the goods and information that Mandan and Hidatsa people had thanks to generations of developing relationships and trade networks with people who lived up and down the Missouri River. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The mounds are believed to have been constructed by the Oneota people. The site is significant because it shows the expansion of the Oneota during the late Prehistoric period.<br /> <br /> While at the Leary Site, Corps member Alexander Willard was charged with lying down and sleeping while on guard duty. He was sentenced to receive 100 lashes to be broken up and given at four different times. The Corps of Discovery left the site early on July 13 to continue their westward trek.<br /> <br /> Sources<br /> http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/15695<br /> <br /> Leary Site is a High Potential Historic Site on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> Clark visited this site on July 12, 1804, and observed raised mounds that were American Indian grave sites.

Although Meriwether Lewis and William Clark passed through the area in 1805 on their trek westward, Fort Lemhi was established in 1855 by a group of Mormon missionaries.

Their objectives were to “find a portage if possible” and make contact with the Shoshone Tribe in order to acquire horses. A few days later, on August 12, Lewis crossed the continental divide through Lemhi Pass. This marked the point of departure from both United States-controlled territory and the Mis­souri River watershed. Lewis wrote, “two miles below McNeal had exultingly stood with a foot on each side of this little rivulet and thanked his god that he had lived to bestride the mighty & heretofore deemed endless Missouri. after refreshing ourselves we proceeded on to the top of the dividing ridge from which I discovered immence ranges of high mountains still to the West of us with their tops partially covered with snow. I now decended the mountain about ¾ of a mile which I found much steeper than on the opposite side, to a handsome bold running Creek of cold Clear water. here I first tasted the water of the great Co­lumbia river.” Following successful contact with the Shoshone and acquition of horses, the full expedition crossed the pass on August 26.<br /> <br /> The pass was named in 1855 by Mormon missionaries for King Limhi, a character from the Book of Mor­mon. Located in the Beaverhead Mountains of the Bitterroot Range, it spans about two miles across the boundary between Montana and Idaho. Lemhi Pass is encompassed by two national forests – <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/bdnf\">Beaverhead- Deerlodge National Forest</a> in Montana, and <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/scnf\">Salmon-Challis National Forest</a> in Idaho.</p>",

In return, they received clothing, tools, and other items that the expedition members had brought with them. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8b986a3a-5b00-4402-8a76-989a248a7ba0}{16}\" paraid=\"1204245438\">A few Shoshone men, led by Pikee Queenah (also known as Swooping Eagle, but who the travelers called Old Toby), led Lewis and Clark’s party over Lemhi Pass.

Upon finding the whale, little flesh was left on its skeleton, the usable parts already having been harvested by the local people. Disheartened, the men returned to a small Tillamook village of five houses that they had passed earlier that day, where the people were processing whale blubber.<br /> <br /> After purchasing some whale oil and fish from the villagers, Clark shot a raven and gull with a small rifle and, after a meal, the explorers crossed the creek and set up camp. Some of the Tillamook men came to smoke with the captain, but their visit was interrupted by a loud commotion from across the creek. Concerned, Clark, his men, and the Tillamook visitors discovered that Private Hugh McNeal was missing. Clark describes the event in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“…I Suspected perhaps Some of my party was over after the Squars, by exemening found that <em><a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh\">McNeal</a> </em>was not in Camp, 〈I was〉 my guide who Staid with me told me Some body throat was Cut.

I kept a guard & Sentinel all night…”  </p> </blockquote> Today, the location of Clark’s campsite and the event that came to be known as “McNeal’s Folly” is encompassed within a small local park, known as Les Shirley Park, situated at the northern end of the city of Cannon Beach.

Glenn Bishop initially spearheaded this immense project of constructing the boats. His vision continues to be realized today with re-enactments featuring the magnificently, hand-crafted, and highly unique fleet.  The Keelboat and two pirogues have been showcased in several films, documentaries and an upcoming televised miniseries.  When the boats are not appearing in events or re-enactments, they are on display at the Boat House. <br /> <br /> On the second floor is the Museum and Visitors’ Shop.  Formed in 1985, the educational Museum provides visitors the opportunity to explore the Lewis & Clark Expedition, Native American displays, various Missouri River habitats, and natural discoveries the Corps encountered during the journey. The museum’s artwork, \"Missouri River Walk,\" is the largest indoor mural in the state.<br /> <br /> Classes, private presentations, and tour-group talks are conducted in the classroom area and when not in use an award-winning film is shown throughout the day.  Adjacent to the Boat House is Bishop’s Landing with its huge sculpture of Lewis, Clark, and Seaman. <br /> <br /> Unique items for all ages are available in the Visitors’ Shop featuring a wide selection of books of all reading levels. Titles include those related to Lewis & Clark, Native Americans, general history, local interest, and nature.<br /> <br /> The first Missouri State Capitol State Historic Site and the historic town of St. Charles are both easily walkable from our site. <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.lewisandclarkboathouse.org.\">Learn more about the boathouse</a> </li> <li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/78ihrg99d-Q\">Watch a short video overview of the musem</a></li> </ul>",

Built to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the beginning of the Lewis & Clark Expedition, construction on the monument was completed on May 14, 2010.<br /> <br /> How does it relate to the Lewis & Clark expedition, you ask? Well, in many ways, it was the first step on what would become known as the Lewis & Clark Expedition. In December of 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark established camp at Wood River, otherwise known as Camp Dubois. Located along the Mississippi River between St. Louis and the modern-day Confluence Tower, the camp served as the winter quarters for the two men and those who joined them on their expedition. Here, they spent the winter gathering supplies and recruiting other intrepid explorers from St. Louis. Then, in May of 1804, the group embarked on their historic journey westward from the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.<br /> <br /> For those wishing to get a bird’s eye view of the area, the Confluence Tower has observations decks at the 50, 100, and 150-foot marks, and all three levels are accessible by either stairs or elevator. Exhibits focusing on Lewis and Clark and the importance of the Missouri-Mississippi Confluence can be found on every level. Guests can also request a short, guided tour that ends with a trip to the highest level of the structure. On particularly clear days, parts of St. Louis and the Gateway Arch can be seen from the upper decks.",

Why? <br /> <br /> Newfoundland dogs are known to be intelligent, hard-working, loyal, and well-tempered animals, as well as good hunters and swimmers. This meant Seaman could handle a mostly river-bound journey and help with hunting, all while being good-natured.<br /> <br /> Seaman especially loved to chase squirrels in the river. Maybe he loved it even more because of how much his human liked eating them. Day after day on the Ohio River, Lewis saw squirrels swimming across the river—almost always from the north to the south shore, he observed. Most days, Seaman would hop in the river and chase after a few.<br /> <br /> After he swam his heart out, Seaman would return to the boat, sopping wet. Maybe Lewis would have to help hoist him back onto the boat, or maybe he’d jump himself, heavy fur and all. He may have been proud to please his human with a squirrel offering, and perhaps excited to hop back again into the river and go chase some more.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

It only allowed Indigenous communities to retain a so-called “native title.” This meant they could occupy and use, but not own, their own homelands. It still required Europeans to negotiate treaties with Indigenous leaders to fully take over their land. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4f3bb0a7-5b26-4a51-8558-b1aa05f246a0}{88}\" paraid=\"1248712408\">The French first claimed the territory west of the Mississippi River in 1682 and called it La Louisiane after King Louis XIV. French settlers knew about Indigenous nations who had lived, farmed, and hunted near great cities like Cahokia for millennia, but according to the rules that the European leaders wrote, Indigenous claims were not as valid as those of these new arrivals.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4f3bb0a7-5b26-4a51-8558-b1aa05f246a0}{136}\" paraid=\"2038097171\">France, Britain, Spain, and eventually, the new United States of America, vied for and divided up this land that had been occupied by many people since time immemorial. This back and forth culminated in 1803, when the United States agreed to pay France $15 million for 818,000-square-miles of territory west of the Mississippi River that France claimed. With this purchase complete, the U.S. government could negotiate directly with Indigenous communities for their lands. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4f3bb0a7-5b26-4a51-8558-b1aa05f246a0}{200}\" paraid=\"1951756841\">One of President Thomas Jefferson’s main goals for the Lewis and Clark Expedition was to establish contact with as many Indigenous people as they could and understand “the extent & limits of their possessions.” Once armed with this information, the United States could take these lands, either through treaty or through force.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4f3bb0a7-5b26-4a51-8558-b1aa05f246a0}{246}\" paraid=\"373067890\">For Indigenous people west of the Mississippi River, the Louisiana Purchase was the beginning of a hundred years of land loss, forced relocation, and threats to traditional lifeways.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Here you’ll learn about the lives of the Native peoples, the explorers, and the traders.  Two galleries feature rotating art and history exhibits. <br /> <br /> A short drive away stands a full-size replica of Fort Mandan, where you can get a first-hand experience of what the Corps of Discovery’s life was like.  <br /> <br /> What you’re sure to enjoy the most is the Center’s nationally certified interpretive staff.  The team works hard to make your visit a remarkable learning experience that captures your every sense. <br /> <br /> While the Interpretive Center is primarily self-guided, there are both self-guided or interpreter-led tours of the Fort, during the season. And special events are scheduled throughout the year – check their website for details. <br /> <br /> Washburn is approximately 40 miles north of Bismarck.",

There is a stone marker nearby for the bicentennial as well. The Iowa tribe was assigned this land as a reservation in 1836 after it had been ceded by the Kansa. This hollow became the favored hunting ground for its head chief, White Cloud II. After the Iowa ceded this location in 1854, the town was established in 1857 and named in honor of the Iowa chief White Cloud. The town was a bustling one, as the site of a steamboat landing, the oldest opera house west of the Missouri R., and it was where the inventor of the Gatling gun lived.<br /> <br /> The national Piggy Bank movement was started here, and it is considered the birthplace of the piggy bank.

From April 15 to October 1, another replica keelboat provides guests with short tours of the lake.  <br /> <br /> The 1930s-era Works Progress Administration (WPA) historic lodge still stands overlooking the water.  The park has more than 30 acres of picnic grounds with tables, fire grills, and drinking water.  And campers enjoy the large campground with electric and full hook-up sites, a modern restroom, and showers.  Those who seek water activities will enjoy a fine beach for sunbathing and swimming, and a boat ramp provides access to the lake.<br /> <br /> The park’s Lewis and Clark Festival is held in June each year, featuring movies, history enactors in frontier attire, bluegrass music and historic presentations.  <br /> <br /> The park is less than five miles from Onawa, Iowa on State Highway 175.  It is about 40 miles south of Sioux City.  To learn more, go to: <a href=\"https://www.iowadnr.gov/Places-to-Go/State-Parks/Iowa-State-Parks/parkdetails/parkid/610142\">https://www.iowadnr.gov/Places-to-Go/State-Parks/Iowa-State-Parks/parkdetails/parkid/610142</a><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

It was named after Baron Von Steuben, the Prussian military leader who helped American troops during the American Revolutionary War.31 Von Steuben wrote Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States, which was the U.S. military’s conduct manual at the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. </p> <p paraeid=\"{70f8b990-abea-452b-9b92-2dadbdf0b72e}{188}\" paraid=\"2120541905\">The fort burned down in 1790, and by 1797, settlers formed a small village near the site of the fort.

Black families, who were enslaved by the White families, were often forced to join them. Many Shawnee, Delaware, Haudenosaunee, and Cherokee people lived in the multicultural Ohio River Valley, as did folks of French, Spanish, and African descent. It was a place of commerce, a bustling highway full of traders and travelers.

Keelboats—in heavy use by the 1790s—could transport forty to fifty tons of material upriver quickly due to their long, narrow shape, heavy wooden keel, and pointed prow. Men used iron-tipped poles to push against the river bottom and cajole the boat upstream. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0994e29f-2bbf-4e66-b546-66ad6fb03ac9}{118}\" paraid=\"1821667116\">When Lewis arrived at Fort Fayette on the afternoon of July 15, 1803, he saw only the skeleton of the fifty-five-foot keelboat that was supposed to be ready for him.

We ended up using legendary images from different tribal traditions to represent the diversity in Native American culture, and we placed these giant images on top of pillars in the shape of maple tree trunks.”</p> <p>The educational aspect of the Ainsworth project was enhanced by including a poetry project for students at the Ockley Green Middle School . Students learned to write poetry, and in keeping with the aims of the greenspace goals, were inspired to write about nature. The class was taught by collaborating artist and author, Gail Tremblay, who has worked frequently with Lillian over the years.

The Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (Tri-Met) promotes transit use and community pride by integrating permanent and temporary art works that celebrate the contributions of the cultural richness in the region.</p> <p>The art project at the Rosa Parks station was completed by a team including Native American artist Lillian Pitt, Ken MacKintosh, Rick Bartow, Elizabeth Woody, and Gail Tremblay. The artists used traditional motifs to symbolize the life-sustaining relationships of nature. Pitt served as team leader of five members to complete her vision. She states, “The Interstate project was the first public art project I worked on. At the time, there was not one public art project in Portland that was done by a Native American artist. So I thought, that’s not right, and I went ahead and applied for the job.”</p> <p>Artistic interpretations of historic petroglyphs from the Columbia River Gorge appear on columns, custom benches, and railing panels. A traditional basket weave pattern is repeated in the pavement. And, at the ends of each of the shelters near the apex of the roofline, are sculptured images of birds, fishing apparatus and other symbols of cultural significance. “I designed the bricks into a basket design, the fence railings and the gable ends,” states Pitt.</p> <p>Pitt’s artwork along the Tri-Met has become known for an iconography rooted in the Columbia River petroglyphs of her ancestors. Through her use of this and other petroglyph symbols, Pitt has helped to bring the Indigenous iconography of the Columbia River to the public eye and affirm the ancient as well as contemporary Indigenous presence in the region.</p> <p>Lillian Pitt is a Pacific Northwest Native American artist. She was born and raised on the Warm Springs reservation in Oregon and her ancestors lived in and near the Columbia River Gorge for over 10,000 years.

The Welcome Gate by artist Lillian Pitt represents how Chinook people welcomed someone arriving by canoe and serves as a fitting entry to the Vancouver Land Bridge (Link: <a href=\"https://nativeamerica.travel/listings/confluence-land-bridge-in-vancouver\">https://nativeamerica.travel/listings/confluence-land-bridge-in-vancouver</a>).</p> <p>At this location, the Hudson’s Bay Company stood as the first European trading post in the Pacific Northwest, and Lewis and Clark camped at this site during their expedition. Fort Vancouver was built twenty years later.</p> <p>“The Land Bridge is a real link connecting back to the Klickitat Trail, Lewis and Clark, and the development of the Northwest. It completes a circle that’s been broken,” states Johnpaul Jones, acclaimed Native American architect and landscape architect who worked on the project along with designer Maya Lin.</p> <p>The Welcome Gate is the perfect creative entryway to the Land Bridge, which tells the story of river, land and people along the Columbia River. Artist Lillian Pitt states, “The site was built to honor the Chinookan people, who were awesome traders. They lived and traded from the mouth of the Columbia River in Astoria, all the way upriver to the area where my ancestors lived at Celilo. And this area they established within modern-day Vancouver was a major gathering place for them . . . and so it was here that they welcomed many people to trade.”</p> <p>About the author: Lillian Pitt is a Pacific Northwest Native American artist.

Her work is the largest collection of public art by a Native American artist in any public space within the City of Portland. Ten artists were selected through a public invitation process to produce work for the center’s permanent collection, one of the most varied convention center art programs in the country.</p> <p>The twenty-six plaques in the exhibit represent the voices of Native people throughout the region. Lillian is a descendent of Wasco, Yakama and Warm Springs ancestors, and she felt it was her obligation to honor all of the Native peoples of the region in her work.</p> <p>Lillian states, “My goal wasn’t just to produce public art but to educate viewers about the rich cultures and history of the various Native peoples who lived throughout Oregon.” She further states, “We titled the work “Voices” because we thought of the plaques as giving our ancestors a voice … giving them an opportunity to be heard in this modern world where the memory of them is otherwise being drowned by progress.”</p> <p>Lillian Pitt is a Pacific Northwest Native American artist.

They named it Locust Grove, after the trees that grew nearby. The Clark-Croghans were wealthy and well-connected. Visitors to their house included James Monroe, Aaron Burr, and John J. Audubon. Many people lived at Locust Grove, as the Croghans enslaved about thirty-five individuals of African descent. These enslaved people built the estate’s houses and other buildings, did all the farming, and performed other labor as demanded by the Clark-Croghans. <br /> <br /> William Clark and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bios-of-the-ten-men-from-kentucky.htm\">York</a> grew up at nearby Mulberry Hill. This plantation was built and run by people enslaved by the Clarks—including York’s parents.<br /> <br /> Clark and Meriwether Lewis left the Louisville area in 1803. They were gone for three years. No one knew if they were still alive or how the journey had gone. <br /> <br /> When they finally arrived back in Louisville in 1806, Clark invited Lewis to stay with him at his sister’s home to rest and recuperate. They spent three weeks there. Settlers in Louisville had a party to welcome them back. York’s wife and family were surely happy to have him home, but their reunion was not recorded by local newspapers.  <br /> <br /> What had changed in Louisville while they were gone? <br /> <br /> More American settlers farmed on the lands around Louisville—lands that until recently, Indigenous families had called home. There were likely more Black people in the area, since White settlers who moved here (like the Clarks) brought with them the people they enslaved.  <br /> <br /> The hard work of these enslaved individuals meant that the ports of Louisville were probably bustling even more—more goods to trade up and down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, from Pittsburgh down to New Orleans.  <br /> <br /> Would it have felt differently to Lewis, Clark, and York? <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The dangerous terrain, harsh weather conditions, and near-starvation resulted in the most arduous portion of the entire expedition in which the men resorted to eating some of their own horses to survive. The visitor center is also located on the Nez Perce National Historic Trail, a path followed by a band of Nez Perce Indians while fleeing from the U.S. Calvary in 1877 to avoid being forced onto a reservation. <br /> <br /> At the visitor center, visitors will find information detailing Lewis and Clark's journey across the Bitterroot Mountains and the flight of the Nez Perce Indians, along with other historical, natural, and general information. As a major trailhead for cross-country skiing and snowmobiling, the center also has a warming hut for skiers and recreationists, a 24-hour restroom, a snowmobile parking log, and maps and information pertinent to winter visitors.<br /> <br /> For more information or current Lolo Pass conditions, visit <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nezperceclearwater/recarea/?recid=80112\">Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests - Lolo Pass Visitor Center (usda.gov)</a> or call (208) 942-3113. ",

The reservation stretches across 988,000 acres of wide-open plains and grasslands, and along both sides of the longest river in North America, the majestic Missouri River, or its native name of “Awati.”</p> <p>Lewis and Clark stayed with the Mandan when they passed through the Upper Missouri region on their expedition to the Northwest, including five months in the winter of 1804–1805. Sakakawea then joined the expedition as an interpreter and native guide. Because of her role in salvaging the expedition, she was honored with an image on the U.S. dollar coin. On the return trip, the expedition brought the Mandan chief Sheheke with them back to Washington, DC.</p> <p>The native lands of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people once extended from North Dakota across the Missouri River basin through western Montana and Wyoming. The Mandan, or “Nueta,” were prosperous farmers and traders, noted for their excellent maize cultivation and crafting of Knife River flint. The Hidatsa, or “Nuxbaaga” are considered a parent tribe to the Crow in Montana. The Arikara, or “Sahnish,” lived as a semi-nomadic people on the Great Plains.</p> <p>The Three Affiliated Tribes perfected the construction of earth lodge homes over hundreds of years of life on the harsh Northern Plains. Today, visitors can experience these sacred structures at the reconstructed Earthlodge Village on the shores of Lake Sakakawea near New Town. Also of interest to adventurers, is Buffalo Ranch, which provides tours and viewing of buffalo in their natural habitat.</p> <p>Three Affiliated Tribes Museum in New Town serves as a heritage center to display and preserve the history and culture of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara people. In addition, a new MHA Interpretative Center at New Town, North Dakota, will open in the fall of 2020, and dedicated to the Arikara people. The center features ten offices, a 250-seat event room, gift shop, coffee shop, kitchen for preparing traditional meals at events, and a classroom for cultural educational classes such as traditional food, beading, and tanning hides. An outside amphitheater with 500 seating is also under construction.</p> <p>In addition to the Missouri River, Lake Sakakawea offers excellent opportunities to enjoy the pristine waters of North Dakota. 4 Bears Casino & Lodge operates a yacht charter for public tours and private events, and Mossett Bay features boating, camping, and swimming. Also within the reservation, 760-acre McLean National Wildlife Refuge is managed as part of the Audubon National Wildlife Refuge Complex.</p> <p>4 Bears Casino & Lodge is a perfect base camp for visitors and offers rooms overlooking Lake Sakakawea, a full-service RV park, and lakeside cabins. Lodge amenities include an indoor pool, jacuzzi, sauna and exercise room. For fine dining, the Bison Room Steakhouse overlooks beautiful Lake Sakakawea and features North Dakota prime beef, fresh seafood flown in daily, and made-from-scratch desserts. Also inside 4 Bears Casino & Lodge, Cache Buffet features soups, salads, entrees and numerous specialty stations, including pizza, pasta and dessert bars. For a quick bite, the Corner Café serves burgers, fries, chicken strip baskets, and more.</p>",

The habitat is almost entirely rugged badlands with stands of juniper and pine, with some open native prairie at the “top” of the park. Large mammals like mule deer and mountain lions (though they are rarely, if ever seen) inhabit the park. Native birds such as mountain bluebirds and turkey vultures return to Makoshika each year to breed. Many other bird species, including bald and golden eagles, can also be seen. Besides its outstanding natural beauty,</p> <p>Makoshika is also a world-class fossil bed and a place of incredible scientific importance, especially to paleontologists. The badlands of Makoshika are part of the celebrated Hell Creek Formation, famed worldwide as one of the richest caches of dinosaur fossils on the planet. Dinosaur fossils are routinely recovered from Makoshika, including the most popular dinosaurs like triceratops and Tyrannosaurus Rex. Several fossils of particular importance to science have been recovered from Makoshika.</p> <p>Dig expeditions from major scientific institutions such as the Museum of the Rockies, the Burpee Museum, the University of Wisconsin, Notre Dame University, and others come to the park every summer to search for new fossil finds.</p>",

Masters of agriculture, the tribes settled near the fertile banks of the river and built large circular homes 30–60 feet across to accommodate multiple families, typically sisters and their kin.</p> <p>Construction of the heavily insulated earth and wooden homes was overseen by elder women within the community. Women also managed most of the building, framing the cottonwood posts and rafters, and filling the frame with willow branches, dried gasses and thick sod. Each house would take between seven and ten days to build and had to be reconstructed about every ten years.

        "notes": "Middle Village & Station Camp\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/middle-village-station-camp.htm\n\n<h3>Middle Village History</h3> <p>Right along highway 101 on the north side of the Columbia River, east of Chinook, Washington, you’ll find Middle Village, the site of a significant Chinook village. For thousands of years, the Chinook people have lived along the Columbia River and their home near the river's mouth was strategically located to provide abundant food, such as salmon and shellfish. In addition, the nearby forests were home to game animals and the grasslands and marshes provided ample materials for making shelter, clothing and trade and household goods. The river provided a way for Chinook traders to travel to the south shore and up and down the Columbia.</p> <p>They developed a sophisticated, rich culture and enjoyed great success as traders. The waterway near Middle Village became a virtual trade \"water highway.\" During the 10 years before Lewis and Clark arrived overland at the this spot almost 90 trade ships from Europe and New England are documented to have crossed the Columbia River Bar to trade with Native Americans. These ships brought metal tools, blankets, clothing, beads, liquor and weapons to trade for beaver and sea otter pelts. By the time the Corps reached the site, the Chinook's had moved to their winter village and this village was unoccupied.<br /> <br /> In 2005, archeologists found abundant physical evidence to support the importance of the site as a Chinook trade village. More than 10,000 artifacts were uncovered, including trade beads, plates, cups, musket balls, arrowheads, Indian fish net weights and ceremonial items. The European artifacts are from both before and after the Corps' visit in 1805, and attest to the vitality of the Chinook social and economic life at the site.</p> <h3>Station Camp History</h3> <p>The Corps spent just 10 days here, but used Middle Village as a departure point for an overland trek to their first view of the Pacific Ocean and an exploration of the area. Historians called the spot \"Station Camp\" because it was Clark's primary survey station to produce a detailed and accurate map of the mouth of the Columbia River and surrounding area. This was the most detailed and accurate map he made during the entire trip.</p> <p>On Nov. 24, 1805, the explorers desperately needed a winter campsite, one rich with game and near friendly tribes who would trade for supplies. To assist in deciding where the Corps should winter, the captains took <em>\"Solictations of every individual.\" </em>This included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/york.htm\">York</a>, who was an enslaved man, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sacagawea.htm\">Sacagawea</a>, a Lemhi Shoshone woman who was married to Toussaint Charbonneau. The majority chose to cross to the south side of the Columbia River, near modern-day Astoria, Oregon, to build winter quarters, which soon would be known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-clatsop-or.htm\">Fort Clatsop</a>. </p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>The Middle Village - Station Camp site focuses on the Chinook Indian Nation history, as well as telling the story of early contact, the Corps', and the town of McGowan. Middle Village - Station Camp was dedicated on August 18, 2012.<br /> <br /> The site is open during daylight hours. Check in at the visitor center at Fort Clatsop to pay any <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">park fees</a> and get additional information.</p> <p><br /> Middle Village - Station Camp is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a></p>",

Lewis wrote, “the water of this river possesses a peculiar whiteness, being about the colour of a cup of tea with the admixture of a tablespoonfull of milk. from the colour of it’s water we called it Milk river.” They correctly surmised that this was the “River which scolds at all others” or “Ah-mâh-tâh, ru-shush-sher” which the Hidatsa had first told them about during their stay at Fort Mandan. Whitehouse noted that, “We halted at a point above the Mouth of this River to dine, where Some of our party went a short distance up this River […they reported] that the River continued its breadth and depth as high up as where they had been—the Water Clear, and deep; the banks tolerably high, and the land very rich, and the country fertile, being partly Priaries and some Skirts of woodland.” <br /> <br /> The Milk River rises in the Rocky Mountains of northern Montana and flows for 721 miles, running north into the Canadian province of Alberta, and then southeast to the confluence with the Missouri River near Fort Peck, Montana. The distinctive color of the Milk River is the result of fine clay and silt sediments that erode along the river basin in Alberta and remain suspended in the waters.

Since time immemorial, the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers have been sources of water for communities living along its banks. Indigenous families planted crops of corn, beans, and squash along the rivers. They relied on the regular flooding to both water the crops and provide nutrients to the soil. The land along the Mississippi was fertile enough to support the growth of large cities like Cahokia.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f06f6517-ccd2-4244-bcf8-55601902afd2}{55}\" paraid=\"1372586299\">Located near the confluence of two great rivers, Cahokia was a hub for trade and transportation. During its golden age between 1000 and 1350 CE, the population of Cahokia may have reached as many as 20,000 people. People from the Northern Great Plains used canoes and bison-skin boats to travel to this trading center. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f06f6517-ccd2-4244-bcf8-55601902afd2}{81}\" paraid=\"75781732\">The Spanish traveled up the Mississippi River in the 1500s. The French came a century later, followed by the British. Throughout this period, European traders and trappers used the same water routes that Indigenous travelers had utilized for millennia.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f06f6517-ccd2-4244-bcf8-55601902afd2}{117}\" paraid=\"869016423\">European powers fought over control of this river.To them, mastery of the river also meant dominion over the surrounding lands. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f06f6517-ccd2-4244-bcf8-55601902afd2}{141}\" paraid=\"964100258\">European settlers brought with them enslaved people of African descent.

S. of 30 yds wide Called big Monetou.” He documented that a “Short distance above the mouth of this Creek, is Several Courious Paintings and Carveing in the projecting rock of Limestone inlade with white red & blue flint, of a verry good quallity, the Indians have taken of this flint great quantities. We landed at this Inscription and found it a Den of rattle Snakes, we had not landed 3 minutes before three verry large Snakes wer observed on the Crevises of the rocks & Killed— at the mouth of the last mentioned Creek Capt. Lewis took four or five men & went to Some Licks or Springs of Salt water from two to four miles up the Creek on Rt. Side.”<br /> <br /> Manitou and Moniteau are variations on the Algonquian name for the Great Spirit. The eponymous creek and limestone bluffs were likely first so-named by early European explorers due to pictographic represen­tations of the Manitou and other related symbols. The construction of a tunnel for the Missouri–Kansas– Texas Railroad in the 1890s obliterated a large segment of the bluff along the west side of Moniteau Creek. Although the pictographs described by Clark at this location are no longer extant, there are preserved examples about four miles downriver at Torbett Spring.

Near the mound to the N. stands a small town lately laid out called Elizabeth-town there are but about six or seven dwelling houses in it as yet, in this town there are several mounds of the same kind of the large one but not near as large, in various parts of this bottom the traces of old intrenchments are to be seen tho' they are so imperfect that they cannot be traced in such manner as to make any complete figure; for this enquire I had not leasure. I shall therefore content myself by giving a discription of the large mound and offering some conjectures with regard to the probable purposes for which they were intended by their founders; who ever they may have been.— </p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{ac88bdd6-65e2-45f2-8148-90353cf277e5}{59}\" paraid=\"222227045\">In 1866, Elizabethtown and Mound City, established in 1831, were consolidated into the town of Moundsville. The name was chosen in honor of the many burial mounds built by the Adena Culture more than 2,000 years ago, the largest of which is known as Grave Creek Mound. Today, Moundsville offers a multitude of attractions, including the Four Seasons Pool & Fitness Center, a riverfront park, several playgrounds, and many wonderful shopping and dining opportunities.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ac88bdd6-65e2-45f2-8148-90353cf277e5}{97}\" paraid=\"429009061\">Those interested in Native cultures and the Adena burial mounds will enjoy a visit to the Grave Creek Mound & Archaeological Complex, which houses artifacts and exhibits focused on the life of the Adena People. For more information and operating hours, visit their website at <a href=\"http://www.wvculture.org/museum/GraveCreekmod.html\">WVDCH ­Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex</a>. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ac88bdd6-65e2-45f2-8148-90353cf277e5}{132}\" paraid=\"1229771996\">The West Virginia Penitentiary, built in 1876 in the Gothic architectural style, closed in 1995.

Discovered a high mountain S E. Covered with Snow which we call Mt. Jefferson.” <br /> <br /> The day was March 30, 1806, and Clark, Meriwether Lewis, and the Corps of Discovery had been on the homeward trail for just five days since leaving Fort Clatsop.  They named the towering peak after President Thomas Jefferson, the only volcanic peak they named of the five observed rising over the Cascade Range.  At 10,495 feet in elevation, Mount Jefferson ranks as the second highest peak in Oregon.<br /> <br /> Mount Jefferson is a stratovolcano that has erupted periodically over the past 300,000 years.  The volcano can produce large, explosive eruptions, and the last one was about 15,000 years ago.  Smaller events have also occurred, including lava flows and lahars.  Much of Mount Jefferson’s history is unknown since erosion by glaciers has long since erased the evidence of past eruptions.  Even today, the mountain is covered in glaciers, making it a significant challenge for climbers.<br />  ",

For Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery, their experiences with the Warm Springs Tribe was at times cordial and friendly, but other times distrustful and hostile. The Celilo Falls and The Dalles sites on the Columbia River were considered one of the most important fishing and trading centers of the northwest region. The importance of this area and the people who lived there were overlooked by the Expedition.</p> <p>Today, the Museum at Warm Springs provides visitors the opportunity to learn about this very same land, and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, which now represents the Wasco, Warm Springs and Paiute Peoples. The Paiutes were moved to the reservation in the late 1870s following the Bannock wars. Entering the museum begins with a walk next to a live stream, then into a circular stone drum, and up to an exquisite door with handles shaped like a bustle. The exterior, designed to resemble a traditional encampment among beautiful cottonwood trees, is situated alongside Shitike Creek which empties into the majestic Deschutes River. The impressive museum entry is the first glimpse into a rich, unique culture.</p> <p>The 25,000 square-foot museum provides an impressive sight to the public as well as a safe conservatory for the traditional treasures of the Tribes. Its mission includes educating the public as well as preserving the history, culture, and traditions of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. “We wanted the museum to tell the story of our People,” explains Delbert Frank, Sr., President of the museum’s Board of Directors in 1993 and an influential member of the Tribal Council. “We wanted it to tell the truth. To educate both the public and our own children. To tell them who we are.”</p> <p>After entering the building, the stream continues as a gray polished slate floor. Visitors encounter huge columns of what was once tall native trees of the Reservation. This is the main lobby of The Museum, and the entrance to the Permanent Exhibit Hall.</p> <p>The Permanent Exhibit details the culture and history of The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. “Technically one of the best unified exhibition plans in any museum in America,” states James Nason, Curator of New World Ethnology, Burke Museum, University of Washington, commenting on the permanent exhibit gallery. The curatorial department has one of the largest and most complete Native American artifact collections in the country, including an exquisite collection of Plateau Native American artifacts.</p> <p>The museum also features a rotating exhibit gallery, library and archives, education room with cooking facilities, conference/board room, artifact collection space and office, and an administrative area. The gift shop offers a tremendous array of locally-made beadwork and arts, Pendleton products, huckleberry products, jewelry, books and traditional and contemporary Native American music. Performances, demonstrations and other public events are held at a small outside amphitheater.</p> <p>In addition to special exhibits, annual events at the museum include the Warm Springs Tribal Member Art Exhibits in October, and the Annual Warm Springs Tribal Youth Art Exhibit in January.</p>",

This small public park was once the site of a prosperous native village, known as NeCus’ to the local tribes, prior to colonization.<br /> <br /> It was here, in January 1806, that William Clark and a few members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, while searching for a 105-foot beached whale, met with members of the local tribes from whom they bought whale oil and blubber. Expedition member Hugh McNeal also nearly met his end here because of a plot to steal his clothes and blanket by a man visiting from a distant village. McNeal was saved by a Tillamook woman who, upon realizing she couldn’t stop him from going with the man, alerted the other men of the village to the danger.  <br /> Today, Necus’ Park is incredibly important to the Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes. In 2016, a 10-foot cedar statue of a young Clatsop man, called a welcoming pole, was erected along the bank of Ecola Creek at the park’s edge. Carved by native artist, Guy Capoeman, the welcoming pole commemorates a time, prior to the arrival of Europeans, when the tribes traveling to the Columbia River or Nehalem Bay would visit one another and attend celebrations and potlatches (gift-giving events to celebrate friendship between members).<br /> <br /> The statue is one of the highlights on the Cannon Beach Public Art Walking Tour, a 1.5-mile self-guided tour through the city.

Each was home to an extended family—some 100 people may have lived in the village. They caught fish, and when the tide was low, they gathered crabs, mussels, snails, and barnacles. Some men in the village hunted seals and sea lions. To walk down to the beach, they carved handholds in the rocky cliff.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{143}\" paraid=\"1465818087\">White men and a Shoshone woman, members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, arrived at NeCus’ in January 1806 during a time of bounty and commotion: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cannon-beach-oregon.htm\">a huge whale</a> had just washed ashore!  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{185}\" paraid=\"203910835\">The whale blessed them with enough food for themselves and to trade with their neighbors, Clatsop and Chinookan people. Nehalem people were hard at work boiling the whale for oil and cutting up the blubber, to prepare it to eat or sell.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{213}\" paraid=\"348821851\">William Clark wanted to buy some of the whale blubber and oil, trading glass beads for it. He bought so much that some people might have wondered how he planned to carry it back. He did so with the help of others in his party, including Sacagawea. Maybe the people of NeCus’ Village were excited to have such a bustling town with so many visitors—what an opportunity, what a big party! Maybe some children liked meeting all of the visitors from across the region. Older people may have been happy for an excuse to reunite with old friends. And maybe some people were just plain tired of smelling the rotting whale, even if they liked the taste of blubber.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2e553370-7fce-44b3-9d51-8197b92d1518}{12}\" paraid=\"154739475\">Whatever they felt, NeCus’ Village was the place to be that January. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Located in the city’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, it was designated an Historic Landmark in 1977. The Neill family lived in it from 1774 to 1795 on 262 acres that is now part of Schenley Park, one of two large city parks in Squirrel Hill. It was first built and occupied by a soldier stationed at Ft. Pitt. The complete story can be accessed by the link to the “Lewis and Clark Trail Experience,” on the Home Page of the Squirrel Hill Historical Society – <a href=\"https://squirrelhillhistory.org/\">https://squirrelhillhistory.org/</a></p> <p>The historic connection between the Neill Log House and Lewis and Clark’s Expedition is believed to have taken place in May of 1803, when Meriwether Lewis traveled to Pittsburgh to launch the keelboat he had constructed up-river from Pittsburgh. Several months later, he began his trip down the Ohio River from the Point, the confluence of the Three Rivers in Pittsburgh and early Gateway to the West.</p> <p>From here, Lewis traveled to the Falls of the Ohio at Clarksville, Indiana, across from Louisville, Kentucky. Soon after, he met up with William Clark.  It is said that “When they shook hands in Clarksville, the Lewis and Clark Expedition began.” More crew members were added and they traveled to winter quarters outside of St. Louis, in final preparation to journey west. This was all after earlier preparation on the rivers of Pittsburgh, where their keelboat was first constructed and launched.</p> <p>May of 1803 was Lewis’ second trip to Pittsburgh, having traveled earlier as a young Virginian volunteer to put-down the Whiskey Rebellion. On both trips, he journeyed from Maryland to Pittsburgh on the ancient Nemacolin Indian Trail, later called Braddock’s Road. There is also evidence that Lewis later traveled with two wagons, close-by the Neill Log House, on his last 4 miles overland to the Point. Early travelers on the Nemacolin Trail through what is now Schenley Park would water their horses at Snyder’s Springs, source of the historic Catahecassa Fountain at the Neill Log House. Research for all of this appears in articles on our linked site.</p> <p>Squirrel Hill is a scenic residential city neighborhood with a vibrant central business district, and the largest green-space in Metropolitan Pittsburgh with historic Frick and Schenley Parks. It is also home to both Chatham and Carnegie-Mellon Universities, and near the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Institute. Great dining, culture, recreation and, of course, history are all abundant here.

Bring your non-motorized boat or sign up for a<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/paddle-tours.htm\"> ranger guided canoe and kayak trip</a> during the summer months.</p> <p>The launch is part of the Lewis and Clark Columbia River Water Trail, a 146-mile stretch of water that follows the explorers' route on the Lower Columbia River from Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean, near Ilwaco, Wash. For more detailed information go to the<a href=\"https://www.estuarypartnership.org/water-trails/columbia-river\">Lower Columbia River Water Trail website</a>.</p> <p>Netul Landing also marks one end of the new Lewis and Clark River Trail. The river trail is a 1.5-mile gentle walk along the river to Fort Clatsop. Visitors may park in the parking area and follow the trail to the Fort Clatsop Visitor Center, where they will learn about the area’s history. At the landing and along the trail, interpretive panels are installed that discuss Lewis and Clark’s time here. Visitor's can also connect with the Fort to Sea trail and trace the Corps' trip to Sunset Beach.</p> <p>Visitors are required to pay an entrance fee to Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, which can be paid at the visitor center.

At the time, the Nez Perce resided in the northwestern quarter of what would become the United States of America. In 1863, the village of Lewiston was incorporated as part of the Idaho Territory, just three years after Captain E.D.

After some initial apprehension, the Nez Perce embraced the expedition and provided help when the party was nearing starvation. After journeying further west, Lewis and Clark returned in the spring of 1806. They spent more time with the Nez Perce than any other tribe encountered during their expedition.</p> <p>Lewis and Clark engaged in a diplomatic exchange with Nez Perce chiefs. The captains sought to establish trading posts and intertribal peace in the region. The Nez Perce were willing to cooperate as long as guns and other weaponry were provided to the tribe.</p> <p>Like their Shoshone neighbors, the Nez Perce were without guns or ammunition. This left them vulnerable to their enemies who could obtain weapons from Canadian traders and also hampered their ability to hunt buffalo. The Nez Perce were known for their horsemanship and breeding, especially the Appaloosa horses, which provided a great advantage in traversing long distances in order to hunt and fish.</p> <h3>The Flight of 1877</h3> <p>Chief Joseph’s father refused to sign the 1863 Treaty. On June 15, 1877, The Wallowa Band of  Nez Perce (Nimíipuu) fled their homelands in Wallowa Valley in northeastern Oregon to escape being forced to move to the reservation in Idaho. They hoped to evade violent engagements with settlers and the United States Army and find a more peaceful existence living according to their traditions. An estimated 750 to 800 men, women and children and 250 warriors were pursued by military which included the 7th Infantry and 7th Calvary of the U.S. Army. They set off near Wallowa Lake in eastern Oregon and traveled a circuitous 1,170 miles over five months through Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. The Tribe planned to ally with the Crow for security, but when the Crow refused aid, the Tribe headed toward the Canadian border.</p> <h3>Route through Yellowstone National Park</h3> <p>They entered Yellowstone National Park on August 23. Only a small part of the route taken by the Nez Perce who fled from the US Army in 1877 went through Yellowstone (established in 1872), and they largely eluded their pursuers while there.</p> <p>During their time here, the Nez Perce encountered about 25 visitors in the young park, some more than once. Warriors took hostage or attacked several of these tourists, killing two. The group continued traveling through the park and over the Absaroka Mountains into Montana. </p> <h3>Nez Perce Commemorative Sites in Yellowstone</h3> <p>Although none of the officially designated historic sites associated with the Nez Perce are located in Yellowstone, the historic trail goes through the park, and it is considered a sacred place by many Nez Perce who have continued to honor their ancestors and carry on their memories through ceremonies conducted in the park.</p> <h3>End of the Flight</h3> <p>Leaving Yellowstone, the Nez Perce continued their flight to Canada. Along the way, the Nez Perce warriors valiantly fought U.S. military and citizen volunteers across a series of battles. But starved and exhausted from the journey and persistent clashes, the brave Chief Joseph surrendered following a battle near Bears Paw Mountains in Montana, less than 40 miles from the Canadian border. It is here that it is believed the flight ended and Chief Joseph said, “From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.”<br /> <br /> Led by Chief White Bird, nearly 300 Nez Perce men, women and children managed to escape the battle at Bears Paw and make their way into Canada where they joined Sitting Bull and the Lakota near Fort Walsh. Following surrender, the Nez Perce were sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and eventually to reservations in Oklahoma, where deplorable conditions led to the death of most babies born on the Indian Territory. Today, the trail represents a sacred journey, connecting the surviving Nez Perce people to the past, present and future.</p> <h3><strong>Auto Tours:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Travelers can retrace the Nez Perce National Historical Trail by car along more than 1,500 miles of federal, state and county roads narrated by the Auto Route, with trail signs along the way.</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/maps-pubs/?cid=fsbdev3_055663\">Auto Tour Pamphlets </a>with maps, history and points of interest of all eight segments of the trail</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=45.890008,-116.828613&spn=1.911731,3.295898&hl=en&msa=0&z=8&source=embed&ie=UTF8&mid=zv7KavdVnCwU.kid9pjyMdX-c\">Google Map </a>of Nez Perce Historic Trail Auto Tour</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Hiking/Horseback Tours</strong></h3> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.discovernw.org/store_1877-nez-perce-flight-nez-perce-nee-me-poo-national-historic-trail-map_18998.html\">Trail Map </a>with modern-day travel routes and sites to visit along the trail.</li> <li>Essential Trail Companion: Following the Nez Perce Trail, A Guide to the Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trail with Eyewitness Accounts by Cheryl Wilfong</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPwhQoY6BdkOyoCAPkATlA!/?ss=110199&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=null&navid=151120000000000&pnavid=151000000000000&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&ttype=main&pname=Nez%20Perce%20National%20Historic%20Trail-%20Outdoor%20Safety%20&%20Ethics\">Outdoor Safety & Ethics </a>&<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/home/?cid=stelprdb5245913\"> FAQs</a></li> <li>Each summer, the Nez Perce Trail Foundation offers a week-long driving, hiking and camping <a href=\"http://nezpercetrail.net/summer-educational-trail-tour/\">educational tour </a>of the trail, visiting sites that include Wallowa Valley, Lolo Trail, Nez Perce National Historical Park, Big Hole Battlefield and Tamkaliks Celebration & Friendship Feast.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Quick Facts:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Bear Paw Battlefield is the site of the final conflict of the Nez Perce War and Flight of 1877.</li> <li>Beartooth All-American Road: Lush forests become alpine tundra in just a few miles on the highest elevation road in the Northern Rockies, with access to Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>The Chief <a href=\"https://travelwyoming.com/listing/yellowstone-national-park/chief-joseph-scenic-byway\">Joseph Scenic Byway in northwest Wyoming</a> links the town of Cody with the Beartooth Highway and the Northeast Gate of Yellowstone National Park.

Others enlisted when they signed up.  <br /> <br /> Kentucky was a place where White settlers were arriving and Shawnee, Delaware, and other Indigenous people were still living. Many of the men from Kentucky had experience surviving in the woods, as well as on the infrastructure left by Indigenous residents of the valley.  <br /> <br /> The men that William Clark recruited in Kentucky are often called the “Nine Young Men from Kentucky.” This term comes from the 1814 narrative of Lewis and Clark’s journey, published by Nicholas Biddle. It accounts for men who joined with Clark at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/falls-of-the-ohio-old-clarksville-site.htm\">Falls of the Ohio between Louisville and Clarksville</a>. It does not include York, even though York joined at this time and also lived in Kentucky, where he was enslaved by Clark. <br /> <br /> York was about the same age as William Clark. Clark “inherited” York when Clark’s father died. York had a wife (he was one of only four expedition members who were married). <br /> <br /> The lens through which we view the Lewis and Clark Expedition is often still influenced by those who wrote the journals and those who published accounts of them.  <br /> <br /> After the “Nine Young Men” (details on the individuals <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bios-of-the-ten-men-from-kentucky.htm\">here</a>), other recruits enlisted when the expedition was at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/camp-dubois-illinois.htm\">Camp Dubois</a>.

Sergeant John Ordway observed that “the water Shoots in to the Missiouri verry Swift, & has thrown the Sand out, which makes a Sand bar & Sholes from the mouth a considerable distance.” The shoals and the rapids, according to William Clark, made the river “not navagable for even Canoos without Great difficulty.” Clark managed to eke his way a few miles up the river, however, where he saw an empty Ponca village (everyone was out on a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/independence-creek.htm\">bison hunt</a>). </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{58}\" paraid=\"787271977\">To Ponca people, the rivers and surrounding landscape are a source of sustenance, physically and spiritually. This is their homeland.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{80}\" paraid=\"1310773078\">Stories passed down by Ponca elders describe the area around the Niobrara as Wašé, or plenteous. The silty deposits in the river bottoms created fertile soil for cedar, oak, and elm trees. Ponca families farmed in the bottomlands, growing corn, squash, and pumpkins. Fish flourished at the confluence of the Missouri and Niobrara Rivers. The high bluffs and sheltered gullies teemed with mule deer, bison, geese, and other game.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{92}\" paraid=\"1539239419\">Ponca camps and villages could be found as far north as the Black Hills of South Dakota and as far south as the Platte River. But, according to Ponca elder Louis Headman, the Niobrara “was the last area of land they considered theirs before the removal” to reservations in Kansas and Oklahoma.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The Northern Plains Heritage Foundation is the coordinating entity for the heritage area who celebrates traditional and modern native cultures, farming and ranching heritage, and its infinite legacies. </p> <p paraeid=\"{154f891e-a0db-4853-ad9f-37e83e605222}{252}\" paraid=\"9\">The Northern Plains National Heritage Area is rooted in the historical significance of the Missouri River. The first peoples traversed this landscape in the Paleo and Archaic eras. Settlements of the region trace back to the ancestral homelands of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people who utilized the fertile Missouri River bottomlands for agrarian purposes. The Oceti Sakowin ( known as “The Great Sioux Nation” in the 19th century) have ancestral ties to this nationally important lived-in landscape.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6435e32d-15f2-4c3d-8cb8-a7b28a6a5cee}{5}\" paraid=\"10\">Lewis and Clark spent 1803-1804 wintering here and the Mandan and Hidatsa people helped them during their long journey. This is also where Lewis & Clark met Sakakawea (or \"Sacagawea\"). Indigenous communities formed relationships with the early European fur traders from the 1730s to the 1860s. Numerous European artists, such as George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, dedicated time visiting the area to paint portraits of the Mandan people and the landscapes they inhabited. Through this, the Mandan are one of the most documented indigenous groups in all of North America.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6435e32d-15f2-4c3d-8cb8-a7b28a6a5cee}{20}\" paraid=\"11\">With westward expansion and the tension created by encroaching Euro-American settlements, the area became the battleground for the U.S. Dakota Wars of 1862-1865. The arrival of Jay Cooke’s Northern Pacific Railroad to the area in 1872 brought a new wave of European immigration to the region. With the establishment of the railroads, global immigration descended into the area. In 1883, the Northern Pacific Railroad completed construction of a permanent bridge that spanned the Missouri River at Bismarck. Completion of the bridge in 1883 coincided with the first agricultural economic “boom” in Dakota Territory. Immigrant farmers established cooperative and social activities that influenced local politics to push for their own economic agency. In 1919, a North Dakota state-owned Mill, a state Elevator, and the Bank of North Dakota were established to allow farmers and ranchers better local market control. </p> <p

Perhaps the most hallowed ground in the Cemetery was the interment sections which contained the remains of soldiers who died in battle or in Evansville hospitals from battle-incurred wounds during the Civil War. The remains of 500 Union men, 24 Confederate soldiers and 98 local dead were buried in three separate sections—all victims of Civil War battles. In 1868, the city began efforts to secure designation of the Union veterans’ areas as federal property, eventually succeeding with a Congressional appropriation and recognition in 1898. Several years later, in about 1903, the Fitzhugh Lee Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy erected a monument in remembrance of the 24 soldiers who died for the South. A memorial for local Union dead was added in 1909.</p> <p>Established in 2017, the William Halbrooks Arboretum at Oak Hill Cemetery was named for William Halbrooks, Oak Hill’s third superintendent.Its purpose is to provide a quiet and healing landscape for mourners while respecting the history and dignity of those interred at Oak Hill Cemetery. It will promote public awareness and appreciation of urban greenspaces by providing a safe, serene and beautiful setting. “This is a tremendous accomplishment that represents a team effort in achieving the certification for our historic facility,” said Chris Cooke, Superintendent. This accreditation” represents the culmination of many hours of labor put in by countless volunteers as well as a generous grant from the Southwestern Indiana Master Gardener Association,” he added. “Without each and every one of them, we would not have reached this goal.” A core goal of the Arboretum is to protect and cultivate existing trees and woody shrubs, while augmenting the historic landscape by selecting and appropriately locating new acquisitions. Additionally, it will promote general awareness and appreciation for trees and landscaping through social media, publications and public events.</p> <p>More than 120 individual tree species are represented within the Halbrooks Arboretum including juniper, holly, blue spruce, tulip tree, dogwood, catalpa, sycamore, locust, Japanese ginkgo, magnolia, and varieties of pine, oak, cedar, maple, and willow.</p> <p>The Halbrooks Aboretum has achieved Level II Accreditation from <strong><a href=\"http://arbnet.org/accreditation/levels-accreditation/level-ii-criteria\">www.ArbNet.org</a></strong>.</p> <p>Oak Hill Cemetery and Arboretum is centrally located off Highway 41 just north of the Lloyd Expressway and offers traditional ground spaces, mausoleum chapel, cremation garden, and a Veterans’ Memorial Plaza.</p>",

They finally resorted to using water hauled three-quarters of a mile from the Missouri River to flush out the animals. Five barrels of water later, they finally succeeded in capturing a single prairie dog. John Shields later killed a second prairie dog, which the captains ate.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{47659420-962a-4308-9475-4d00a2db7669}{241}\" paraid=\"849453922\">Lewis and Clark wanted to capture a prairie dog to fulfill President Thomas Jefferson’s instructions to make note of “the animals of the country generally, & especially those not known in the U.S.” The captured animal joined the expedition for a short time. It traveled with them to Fort Mandan where it spent the winter. Lewis then shipped it down the Mississippi River in the spring, and it arrived, still alive, in Washington, DC, and was presented to Jefferson. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Clark wrote that he “came to at 3 oClock at the Kohokia Landing, which is at the mouth of Kohokia Creek ¾ of a mile from the Town, and in view of St Louis which is about 2 ½ miles distant.” While encamped at nearby Wood River into May 1804, Lewis and Clark used the Cahokia Courthouse as a headquarters for collecting infor­mation, meeting with territorial leaders, gathering supplies, and corresponding with President Thomas Jefferson through Postmaster John Hay. The courthouse greatly facilitated their ability to comprehensively plan the expedition.</p> <p>The courthouse, initially built as a dwelling in the 1730s, is a unique remnant of the French presence in Illinois. Converted to a courthouse in 1793, for the next 20 years it served as a center of political activity in the Northwest Territory. It was dismantled in 1901, re-erected twice, and reconstructed on its original site in 1939. The structure is an excellent example of early French log construction known as poteaux-sur-solle. Upright hewn logs are seated on a horizontal log sill; the spaces between logs are filled with stone and mortar chinking. The building rests on its original stone foundation and contains four rooms that originally functioned as a courtroom, a schoolroom, and legal offices.

Sergeant Ordway wrote, “we passed the mouth of the Mahar Creek below an Island S. Side of the Missouri R. we proceeded on to the lower point of another Island N. S. opposite to which we Camped on S. Side Near the Mahar Village, I and 3 more of the party went out to the Village or to the place where it formely Stood.

The Omaha Tribe thrived under Chief Blackbird, controlling the fur trade on the Upper Missouri River. By 1795, their village had grown to approximately 1,100 people. That same year, James Mackay established a nearby fur trading post for the Spanish, known as Fort Charles. (Although the post operated for only a few years, Clark mapped its location in 1804, indicating that remnants remained intact.) By 1800, a smallpox epidemic killed approximately one-third of the tribe’s population, including Chief Blackbird. The diminished village was occupied until 1845. The Omaha Big Village archeological site is located on private property, with restricted public access, but may be publicly viewed from a pull-off along US-75.",

The site, located near the confluence of the Heart River with the Missouri River, was a former Mandan settlement that has come to be known as On-A-Slant Village. Estimated to have included about 75 earthlodges and perhaps 1,000 residents, the village had likely existed for over 200 years before a 1781 smallpox epidemic decimated the population.<br /> <br /> A military post named Fort Abraham Lincoln was established at the site in 1872. It became a base of opera­tions in the U.S. Army’s campaign against the Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne nations during 1876 and 1877. The fort was abandoned in 1891, after the completion of the railroad into Montana reduced its strategic importance. The site was designated <a href=\"http://www.parkrec.nd.gov/parks/falsp/falsp.html\">Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park</a> in 1907.

Clark wrote, “we proceeded over a mountain to the head of the Creek which we left to our left and at 6 miles from the place I nooned it, we fell on a Small Creek from the left which Passed through open glades Some of which ½ a mile wide, we proceeded down this Creek about 2 miles to where the mountains Closed on either Side crossing the Creek Several tmes & Encamped.” They passed through the area return­ing east on June 29, 1806.

But nothing had actually changed in the meadow itself. What had changed was Lewis and Clark’s knowledge about it. During the year between their visit to the site, Nez Perce people had shared with these visitors their knowledge of this meadow and of the camas that grows in it.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19b1d9be-e8f1-4751-b51c-1acd040b4bec}{75}\" paraid=\"886207110\">Camas is a plant with an edible root that grows in marshy areas in this mountainous region.

Nez Perce people told them to wait to cross the Rocky Mountains until the snow had melted, but the visitors tried to continue eastward. They turned around in just a few days. For their next attempt, they waited until Nez Perce people said the time was right and paid a Nez Perce man to accompany them.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19b1d9be-e8f1-4751-b51c-1acd040b4bec}{169}\" paraid=\"326580665\">For generations, Nez Perce people had traveled the Lolo Trail and stopped at this meadow to harvest camas.

They shared their knowledge and foodways with the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition—and in so doing, they helped them stay alive.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19b1d9be-e8f1-4751-b51c-1acd040b4bec}{219}\" paraid=\"741018600\">Camas continues to be an important plant for Nez Perce people and for many other Indigenous communities in this region. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Paducah Wall to Wall is public art painted by renowned Dafford muralists. 50+ life-size images, including the Lewis & Clark Expedition, famous Clark brothers, and American Indian scenes, make history come alive in this UNESCO creative city. At the confluence of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers, the riverfront attraction boasts bronze interpretive panels telling the story of each painting, spot lighted when the sun goes down. Visitors and locals alike experience an appreciation of art and history 24/7. As a tourism attraction, the portraits of Paducah’s past inspire both young and old like icing on the cake for this charming western Kentucky river town.</p> <p>Originally sponsored and funded by the private sector, an all-volunteer group of dedicated citizens started and continues to coordinate the City-maintained attraction. Now in its 25th painting season, Dafford muralists return annually to touch up or sometimes entirely repaint images. Books, postcards, posters, prints, t-shirts and coloring books are sold to support maintenance. Book signings and special events celebrate the project.

He is buried in Brooke Cemetery in Wellsburg, West Virginia, along with his wife, Maria Hamilton (who died almost twenty-five years before her husband).  <br /> <br /> Gass was the last living member of Lewis and Clark’s crew. Did any of his neighbors in Wellsburg know about his life story? <br /> <br /> Born in Pennsylvania’s rolling hills, Gass spent his childhood in Pennsylvania and Maryland. He joined the Army as a young man and spent two years serving in what the United States then called the Northwest Territory, which consisted of much of the land around the Ohio River. The Army troops that Gass served with were here to clear Indigenous people from the region to make room for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-in-steubenville.htm\">White settlers</a>.  <br /> <br /> Gass trained as a carpenter and helped build <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-kaskaskia.htm\">Fort Kaskaskia</a>. He did most of the carpentry and design for Lewis and Clark, including the construction of the crew’s winter quarters in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-mandan.htm\">Mandan territory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-clatsop-stealing-the-canoe.htm\">Clatsop territory</a>. Having a carpenter on the crew was also handy when a boat needed repairs.  <br /> <br /> After Sergeant Charles Floyd’s death, Gass was elected by his peers to step into the role of sergeant. He kept a journal as part of his duties in the new position, despite lacking a formal education.  <br /> <br /> After he arrived home from the expedition, a schoolteacher named David McKeehan asked Gass if he would consider publishing his writings from the trip. McKeehan filled out missing holes and polished up the story to make it easier to read—more of a narrative than diary entries. McKeehan published the book in 1807. It was the first published account of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (Lewis and Clark’s journals were not published until 1814).  <br /> <br /> Gass made little money from sales of the book. He sometimes struggled to feed his family in Wellsburg. And then, the man who first popularized the Lewis and Clark Expedition died quietly almost sixty-five years after the journey finished.38 <br /> <br /> Did anyone in Wellsburg ever read Gass’s book? Did people traveling up and down the river know that one of the people who helped the U.S. government colonize the western parts of continent was quietly living here, raising children and farming? <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

Of French descent, Dorion was born in Quebec City in 1740, but had already migrated to the area around today’s Yankton, South Dakota by 1774. By 1804, he was considered a seasoned veteran of the region and his knowledge of the geography and the Lakota people and language made him invaluable to the Captains. So they hired him to be a translator and consultant, at least until they passed the Lakota’s territory.<br /> <br /> When the Expedition reached the mouth of the James River (just east of the city of Yankton today), Dorion was dispatched to gather members of the Yankton Sioux for a meeting at Calumet Bluffs. There he translated Lewis’s long speech and helped the Captains document details about the Native peoples’ culture.  <br /> <br /> A few days later, Lewis and Clark convinced several chiefs of area tribes to go with Dorion to St. Louis and on to Washington City to meet President Jefferson. When Dorion traveled south (downstream) with the chiefs, the Corps returned to their upstream journey. <br /> <br /> Dorion continued trading in the region and in 1806 was commissioned by the U.S. War Department to be a sub-agent along the Missouri and the western tributaries. He assisted William Clark in 1807 by coordinating a meeting with several chiefs. <br /> <br /> Dorion died in 1810 and was buried along the Missouri River, where his body remained until about 1890 when Yankton brick makers digging for clay uncovered it. The location was lost through time, but was rediscovered by local historians around 1999. Since then, Yankton officials erected a monument in 2002 at the intersection of West 2<sup>nd</sup> and West Riverside Drive in Yankton, at the grave’s location.",

On their return trip in 1806, Lewis and Clark returned to the area, this time camping on the Pierre side of the river, spending the night on LaFramboise Island, which they called Bad Humored Island as a reference to the difficulties they encountered with Blackfoot’s band of Sioux Indian.</p> <p>Today, both of these sights, Fischers Lilly Park and LaFramboise Island, can be visited along with the thriving towns of Pierre and Fort Pierre, located on opposite sides of the Missouri river.

Lewis wrote of the Platte, “by a boiling motion or ebolition of it’s waters occasioned no doubt by the roling and irregular motion of the sand of which its bed is entirely composed...particles of this sand...hurried by this impetuous torrent in large masses from place to place in with irristable forse, collecting and forming sand bars in the course of a few hours which as suddingly disapated to form others...” They conducted experiments to measure the water’s velocity, comparing it to the slower currents of the Missouri and the Mississippi. Lewis and Clark ventured on foot a short distance up the Platte River and crossed it, noting that the depths did not exceed “over 6 or 7 feet.”<br /> <br /> The Platte River Confluence can be publicly accessed via the <a href=\"http://visitcasscounty.com/outdoor-activities/schilling-wildlife-management-area/\">Schilling Wildlife Management Area</a>, enabling visitors to view the confluence within a natural setting comparable to what members of the expedition would have experienced. The character of the Platte River has evolved since 1804, as the channel width and current have both diminished, primarily due to the diversion of water along multiple points upstream for agricultural irrigation. Although greatly reduced, the confluence of the Platte remains in essentially the same historic location.",

It manages one of two unchannelized stretches of the Missouri National Recreation River. A popular destination for tourists and naturalists alike, the park boasts heavily forested hills, scenic vistas, wetlands, abundant wildlife, and a fascinating history.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{956d49fb-c8c8-4bba-9a2f-6bced35094b2}{124}\" paraid=\"1031131558\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">It was here along the banks of the Missouri River that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark traded with the local tribes, specifically the Ponca, to ensure their survival on the expedition westward in 1804. Years later, when the Ponca were forcibly removed from their land, Chief Standing Bear fought for all native peoples to be recognized under U.S. law as a “person,” appealing to the United States government for that right in 1879. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{3101ae6d-8a5f-4201-be96-d6b88efe6743}{146}\" paraid=\"197858468\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Often known as the location “where people and nature meet,” the park offers a wide variety recreational opportunities. From birdwatching to archery to horseback riding, Ponca State Park has something for everyone. Children will particularly enjoy the swimming pool and playground, while adults might love a round of 9-hole golf on the Highland Oaks Public Golf Course. The park also offers many modern accommodations for outdoor enthusiasts, such as canoeing, kayaking, guided bird tours, and fishing.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{61d42434-81e2-4d44-9437-975b9bff4ebe}{209}\" paraid=\"44\">For more information, call (402) 755-2284 or visit <a href=\"http://outdoornebraska.gov/ponca/\">http://outdoornebraska.gov/ponca/</a>. </p>",

The land is located on the ancestral homeland of the Ponca people and was part of their reservations in the 1800-1900’s. The building where the museum is located was built in the 1930’s with the help of the Civilian Conservation Corps to serve as the headquarters for tribal government and as a community building for the Northern Ponca members. It has since been repurposed as an office site and museum displaying Ponca artifacts from different eras to tell our story.</p> <p>The Tribe’s Powwow Arena was placed next to the Museum for that historical and cultural significance. Considering the fact that many Ponca members no longer live in Niobrara, it provides an opportunity for them to come back to the homeland and feel that connection to the earth. The Annual Norther Ponca Powwow is held on the 2nd weekend of August and is open to all who wish to join in a celebration of Ponca culture.</p> <p>Around the Powwow grounds and Museum, an educational trail was put in. Along this path are statues that depict traditional Ponca stories such as How the Rabbit Caught the Sun and the Coyote and the Turkeys. There is also a recreation of a traditional Ponca earth lodge for visitors to enter and experience. During work hours, staff is available at the museum to give guided tours to tell these stories and explain more about Ponca history and culture.</p> <p>The crowning jewel is the statue of Chief Standing Bear overlooking the grounds. Now with a road and a parking lot, the statue represents an important moment in Ponca history when Chief Standing Bear fought for the right, in court, for the Ponca to return to Niobrara after being relocated to Oklahoma. If visitors are lucky, the Tribe’s buffalo herd can be visible from here, too.</p> <p>Come visit to learn more about the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska!</p>",

The term was common in 1805, but we do not use it very often today. A portage is when you take your boat out of the water and carry it overland for period, usually to get around dangerous waterfalls, shallow water, or pass between two separate bodies of water.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1846facf-c9ae-4af7-875d-edaf7a9ae27d}{220}\" paraid=\"211568191\">This portage was exceptionally difficult because it involved an eighteen-mile overland trek that required going up and down “several deep ravines.”253 Men in the expedition double-soled their moccasins to protect their feet from prickly pear cactus needles and sharp points of earth caused by bison trampling on it after heavy rains.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{29e639e8-1340-429e-85ac-40d8b60376ae}{19}\" paraid=\"1104958586\">One day during the portage, a thunderstorm blew through with huge hail. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a> lost her <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/birth-of-pomp.htm\">baby’s</a> cradle, and she and her <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">husband</a> almost drowned. York was stranded on the plains during the torrent, and several other men, who wore no hats and few clothes, were left bruised and bloodied by the massive hailstones.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{29e639e8-1340-429e-85ac-40d8b60376ae}{69}\" paraid=\"1601503715\">The weather continued to be extreme, and unrelenting heat exhausted them. Everyone complained about the mosquitos. On easier days, they caught fish, hunted bison, and repaired their guns.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{29e639e8-1340-429e-85ac-40d8b60376ae}{113}\" paraid=\"1565652235\">They built wheeled carts to tow their canoes and luggage over those steep ravines and unforgiving ground. They left behind some boats, and Clark led some men to carve new dugout canoes above the falls. They dug another <a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/portage-route.htm\">cache</a> to lighten their load. At one point, the wind blew so hard at their back that they hoisted the sail of the canoe. “this is Saleing on dry land in everry Since of the word,” wrote John Ordway.</p> <p paraeid=\"{29e639e8-1340-429e-85ac-40d8b60376ae}{173}\" paraid=\"2113707229\">On July 15, over a month after they arrived at this stretch of river, they loaded up the canoes and set off again. This was the hardest portage that they experienced. And perhaps related, it was one of the only portages where they received no help from Indigenous people. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The Yellowstone Trail originally followed existing wagon roads, but changed over time as new roads were built. The Yellowstone Trail passes through Prairie County from Mildred to Fallon to Terry and westward to Miles City. Look for Yellowstone Trail markers to guide you through Prairie County and to visit some historic points of interest. Following are historic sites marked along the trail.</p> <h4>Captain Clark’s Camp</h4> <p>Captain William Clark’s party of the Lewis & Clark Expedition camped one-and-a-half miles below where the Powder River runs into the Yellowstone River on the left bank under a large cottonwood tree on July 30, 1806 on his way to rejoin Lewis at the mouth of the Yellowstone.</p> <h4>Terry Supply Station</h4> <p>The Terry Supply Station was established June 7, 1876 to supply military operations in the area. Supplies were transferred from Stanley’s Stockade at Glendive by Captain Marsh on the steamer “Far West”.</p> <p>Private George of the 7th Cavalry was badly shot during the Battle of the Little Big Horn on Reno’s Hill. He died on July 3, 1876 on the Far West steamer from those injuries. He was buried by the river bank. There is a gravesite for Private George about seven eighths of a mile northwest of this sign.</p> <p>Scout Wesley Brockmeyer was killed near the mouth of the Powder River on August 2, 1876 in a skirmish between US Infantry and Sioux and Cheyenne warriors. The infantry eventually drove off the warriors with a 12-pound cannon.</p> <h4>Father DeSmet-Sitting Bull Council</h4> <p>Father DeSmet, accompanied by Trader Galpin and his wife, traveled overland from the Missouri River to meet the Hunkpapa Sioux at the Sitting Bull Council on June 20, 1868 for a peace conference. Runners from Father DeSmet’s party were sent ahead to Chief Sitting Bull’s camp and Sitting Bull sent his men back to let Father DeSmet know he would be welcomed. Father DeSmet met at Sitting Bull’s camp about four miles above the mouth of the Powder River, near where Camp Creek empties into the Yellowstone. The camp was made up of 500-600 tipis, 4,000-5,000 Sioux Indians, and thousands of horses. DeSmet was not able to convince Sitting Bull to sign a peace treaty, but the council was considered a success because Sitting Bull did agree to allow some white travel and settlement.</p> <h4>Powder River Stage Station</h4> <p>The Powder River Stage Station was one of the stops on the Fort Keogh-Bismarck stage coach route. It operated from 1878 until 1883 when the railroad became the primary means of transportation to Miles City.</p> <h4>Milwaukee Railroad</h4> <p>Work on the 225-mile eastern Montana section of the Milwaukee Railroad took place from 1907-1908. The Milwaukee Railroad ran through a region of river and creek valleys, making for the building of many bridges. The Yellowstone River was crossed three times between Terry and Miles City. The first crossing is five miles West of Terry, the second 25 miles further west at the Tusler Crossing, and the third crossing was five miles west of Miles City. Supplies to build the Milwaukee Railroad first came by rail on the Northern Pacific tracks, then across the Yellowstone River by boat, ferry, and cable. The Old Milwaukee Railroad Bridge is about three miles west on Milwaukee Road.</p> <h4>Calypso Trail</h4> <p>Calypso Trail was a stop on the Milwaukee Railroad. The community had a school and a ferry crossing in addition to the railroad section houses. An interpretive sign reached by crossing the Old Milwaukee Railroad Bridge marks the beginning of the Calypso Trail. The rustic five-and-a-half mile trail leads to the scenic Terry Badlands.</p>",

Twice during the expedition, he got lost, and on many occasions he forgot important items—like his tomahawk—and had to retrace his steps to retrieve the property.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8afed2c6-751b-4729-b791-66ed15831f3d}{168}\" paraid=\"2059624470\">Shannon was born in Pennsylvania around 1785. In 1800, his family moved to Ohio to farm land that formerly belonged to Indigenous people and that the U.S. government was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-in-steubenville.htm\">doling out</a> to White settlers. Shannon followed Meriwether Lewis to Kentucky to enlist in the Army and join the expedition. At eighteen, he became the youngest member of the expedition. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8afed2c6-751b-4729-b791-66ed15831f3d}{206}\" paraid=\"1297639477\">Shannon’s first misadventure started in the summer of 1804. On August 26, Shannon and George Drouillard set out to search for two horses that had strayed. The men separated to cover more territory. When Drouillard came back to camp the next day, Shannon had not returned. The captains sent search parties, but Shannon remained missing for sixteen days.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8afed2c6-751b-4729-b791-66ed15831f3d}{238}\" paraid=\"1443196545\">They finally encountered Shannon on September 11. He had apparently found the horses early on but misread some tracks and assumed the expedition had passed him. Shannon therefore proceeded upriver expecting to meet the party, but they were actually downstream of him.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9c78fe7b-97a9-44a1-84e3-07635260e5bb}{1}\" paraid=\"877271837\">When they found Shannon, he was sitting beside the river, “nearly Starved to Death” waiting for a boat to pass. He hadn’t eaten for twelve days, having run out of ammunition for his gun. He foraged some wild grapes and managed to kill a rabbit “by shooting a piece of hard Stick in place of a [musket] ball.”</p> <p paraeid=\"{9c78fe7b-97a9-44a1-84e3-07635260e5bb}{15}\" paraid=\"518279971\">Ponca and Omaha people who lived here knew how to feed themselves and how to find their way home based on thousands of years of ancestral knowledge. Shannon did not. There was food in these woods, there were trails to follow—he just was not from here and did not know where to find them.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

I now thought that if a skillfull painter had been asked to make a beautifull cascade that he would most probably have pesented the precise immage of this one.” Accord­ingly, Lewis and Clark named this landmark waterfall “Handsome Falls.”<br /> <br /> Now called Rainbow Falls, the feature is located directly upstream from Crooked Falls and about a mile downstream from Giant Springs. The height of the falls is crested by Rainbow Dam, which was constructed in 1910. Water flow is diverted to a hydroelectric power plant, which has all but eliminated the tremendous cascade witnessed by Lewis. An overlook of the falls is accessible by roadway or footpath, and a <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/helena/learning\">USFS Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center</a> is located about 1.5 miles to the west.",

Originally built in 1797 by community founder and French-Canadian, Louis Lorimier, the structure overlooks the banks of the Missouri River. Although the original building was destroyed by a tornado in 1850, the site was rebuilt in 2003 thanks to many volunteers using the poteaux-sur-solle (\"post-on-sil\") technique once favored by French settlers. <br /> <br /> In the early 19th Century, the \"red house\" was the best-known trading post between St. Louis, MO and Memphis, TN. It also served as a fledgling community and government center for the area. In November of 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark stopped to visit with Lorimier's family and purchase supplies for the expedition ahead. <br /> <br /> The reconstructed house displays several exhibits depicting the lives of the area's early settlers. Visitors can peruse 19th-century merchandise in Lorimier's Trading Post or visit the Lorimier Room to see how a home of this period may have been decorated. In the Girardeau Room, a large map of the territory under control of Don Louis Lorimier for the Spanish Government is on display. Visitors can also walk through the Historic Gardens on the north side of the house which contains flowers, vegetables, and herbs typical of a garden in 1803. <br /> <br /> Today, the Red House Interpretive Center is maintained by the City of Cape Girardeau and is open to visitors from May to October. Admission is free. Guided group tours are available on weekdays by appointment only. Call (573) 339-6340.<br />  ",

They buried it 600 feet back from the river and remarked the grave. <br /> <br /> After Floyd’s journal was discovered and published in 1894, there was renewed interest in his story and the 1857 grave marker was stolen by thieves.  So his remains were moved once more on August 20, 1895 and placed beneath a large stone slab.  That’s when this piece of the 1857 walnut coffin was recovered and retained by the Floyd Memorial Association. <br /> <br /> For more information about the museum and affiliated sites, go to <a href=\"www.siouxcitymuseum.org\">www.siouxcitymuseum.org</a>. ",

There were “a great many Indian camps, their lodges made chiefly of poles and cedar bark.” Particularly notable was the Chinookan village of Cathlapotle, which Clark described as “a large village, the front of which occupies nearly ¼ of a mile fronting the Chanel, and closely Connected, [with] 14 houses in front.” During the return journey, the Corps stopped to visit the village on March 29, 1806.

In 1805, some White visitors with lots of luggage paid Wasco-Wishram people to help them around these dangerous waterfalls, as others had done before them. After finishing the portage, these visitors—whose leaders were named Meriwether Lewis and William Clark—stopped at a high point not far from the villages.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1829bdfe-00f0-424f-be33-b653d65d2241}{242}\" paraid=\"378018622\">Local people called the nearby stream Que-nett, while Lewis named their camping spot “Rock Fort.” The visitors stopped here to repair canoes, dry out their soaked belongings, gather food, read the stars, and rest.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8b59f856-d419-4d5e-aa7b-01f27e116e16}{21}\" paraid=\"1995235655\">People from the Wasco-Wishram villages came to visit, trade, and relax a little with these damp and weary travelers. After exchanging gifts of deer meat, buckskins, clothes, ribbons, and more, some men made a fire, Pierre Cruzatte played the fiddle, and York danced. They all commiserated—maybe through translators, maybe through hand motions—about the annoying fleas present at the campsite. More people joined the next day and they all smoked and ate together—some people came from nearby communities, other traveled from sites farther downstream. The expedition members stayed three nights here. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8b59f856-d419-4d5e-aa7b-01f27e116e16}{107}\" paraid=\"1314369476\">A year later, the expedition came back up the Columbia River and camped in the same spot. Wasco-Wishram people remembered the travelers from last time and asked for more music and dancing. They taught the visitors games through which players could win goods. The visitors wanted horses, but no one had any to spare.

The Salish, called “Flathead” by members of the expedition, gave them a warm welcome. Ord­way wrote, “when our officers went to their lodges they gave them each a white robe of dressed skins, and spread them over their Shoulders and put their arms around our necks instead of Shakeing hands as that is their way they appeared glad to See us. they Smoaked with us, then gave us a pleanty Such as they had to eat…” Lewis and Clark spent the next day communicating with chiefs (complicated by the task of translat­ing across several languages), exchanging gifts, bartering goods, and purchasing horses. Rested and refitted, on the afternoon of September 6 the Corps of Discovery continued north along the Bitterroot valley.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Ross’ Hole was later named for Alexander Ross, a fur trader with the Hudson Bay Company who camped there on March 12, 1824. The site is currently experienced as a wayside stop along US Highway 93, next to the Sula Country Store. A roadside pull-off is lined by an array of interpretive signage that detail the story of Lewis and Clark’s visit, later exploration and development, and the settlement of Sula. Despite prominent modern intrusions in the foreground, this vantage point allows expansive views of Ross’ Hole and conveys the timeless quality of the natural landscape.</span></span></span><br />  ",

We know that she grew up with Shoshone people near what is now the Montana/Idaho border, and that, at the age of twelve, she was captured by Hidatsa people. There is some debate over whether she was originally born in a Hidatsa or Shoshone village, but we do not know for sure.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{6}\" paraid=\"1942345195\">From age twelve to sixteen, she lived along the Knife River in a Hidatsa village called Awatixa.</p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{26}\" paraid=\"330487570\">She was married by age sixteen, and we do not know how much choice she had in the matter. Her husband, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, was thirty years older than her and had another wife, named Otter Woman. Sacagawea <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/birth-of-pomp.htm\">had a baby</a> at age sixteen, and her son had a French name, like his father.</p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{84}\" paraid=\"57537365\">We know she was happy to reunite with her Shoshone family and friends. She served as a translator and diplomat for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, a liaison between cultures.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{108}\" paraid=\"399326120\">But there is so much we will never know. Oral histories and written documents only tell us so much.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{134}\" paraid=\"1644853394\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/what-was-the-journey-like-for-sacagawea.htm\">What would it have been like to be an Indigenous woman on this American military expedition?</a> In their respective journals, Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, Patrick Gass, and Joseph Whitehouse often used an offensive term to describe Sacagawea. These men, on a colonizing mission, saw her usefulness while also discriminating against her based on her race and gender. How was Sacagawea different than the woman we read about in those journals?  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{182}\" paraid=\"1372147630\">Whoever she was, Sacagawea has captured the imagination of so many people over the last two hundred years. In the 1910s, women fighting for suffrage used Sacagawea as an example of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-vote-at-station-camp.htm\">a woman casting a vote</a>. In 2000, the U.S. Mint put an image of Sacagawea and her baby on a dollar coin. There are more statues of Sacagawea in this country than of any other American woman. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{214}\" paraid=\"1122002545\">Perhaps it is because she was a woman—with a baby!—in a male space. Perhaps it is because she had a foot in so many cultures. Very likely we remember her because, unlike other Indigenous women, White men wrote about her, and those words lived on in print.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

They were immediately met by Yakama and Wanapum who sold them much needed food and gave them information about the area. The following day, William Clark explored the Columbia River to the north in search of another river he heard about from local Native Americans the night before. After paddling up-stream for about 10 miles (16 km), Clark and his two companions found the mouth of what is now the Yakima River at present-day Richland, Washington. By 1810, fur traders had followed explorers into the Pacific Northwest.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{228}\" paraid=\"2126314892\">Following the War of 1812, the United States and Great Britain jointly occupied this region from 1818 until1846, when the Oregon Treaty finally decided the border between the two nations. During this period, the British controlled the fur trade and local economy but were unable to successfully colonize the region. US settlers, on the other hand, increasingly moved into the region, arriving either by sea or over the Oregon Trail. </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{234}\" paraid=\"1132912260\">Roman Catholic missionaries arrived in the region in 1826 to minister to the French-Canadian and Native American trappers employed by the fur companies. Protestant missionaries began to arrive 10 years later. Perhaps the most well-known of those were Dr. Marcus Whitman and Narcissa Whitman, who in 1836 established a mission among the Cayuse Indians and fur trappers in the Walla Walla Valley. While the missionaries were not successful in their efforts to convert Cayuse Peoples to Christianity and a settled agricultural lifestyle, the mission station provided aid to some Oregon Trail immigrants from 1843-1847. </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{240}\" paraid=\"893900717\">In 1847, a devastating outbreak of measles occurred among the Cayuse, killing nearly half the tribe. Dr. Whitman’s medical care seemed to work on the white measles patients, however appeared to be ineffective in helping the Cayuse patients with measles. Some Cayuse people feared that Dr. Whitman was intentionally poisoning them instead of healing them. These fears were not ill-founded; there had been multiple poisoning incidents stemming from the mission station in the years leading up to the measles epidemic. Dr. Whitman was cautioned multiple times that he was endangering himself if he stayed. On November 28, 1847, he was once again warned to leave the mission. He did not heed this last warning. By evening of the following day both missionaries and many of the adult men at the mission were dead. Forty-seven others at the mission station were held hostage for one month.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{246}\" paraid=\"1863855212\">Officials of the British Hudson’s Bay Company arranged the release of the 47 people still at the mission site. News of the event quickly spread across the continent and back to the United States where reactions were so severe that Congress moved to create the Oregon Territory in 1848. As a result of the actions at the mission station the Oregon Volunteer Militia and, later, the US military fought the Cayuse War against the Cayuse Nation, leading to further deaths and suffering. To end the persecution they faced from the military, Cayuse leaders surrendered five men in 1850.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{252}\" paraid=\"260227017\">In 1855 several thousand tribal members from present-day Idaho, Oregon, and Washington met in the Walla Walla Valley to discuss agreements between sovereign tribal nations and the United States. In less than a month, leaders from both sides signed three treaties that created the Nez Perce, Umatilla-Cayuse-Walla Walla, and Yakama reservations. These treaties were ratified in 1859 and became supreme law of the land, part of the constitutional fabric of the United States. These treaties guarantee the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Nez Perce, and Yakama nations legal status and their government-to-government relationship with the United States. These treaties are still in place today. The Wanapum people never fought white settlers and never signed a treaty with the US government. As a result, they did not retain federally recognized land rights. </p> <p paraeid=\"{df73a8d7-b9ab-4232-9eb6-eec3316158b9}{5}\" paraid=\"1320234732\">The treaties of the Walla Walla Council of 1855 also guaranteed Native American signatories access to resources such as salmon, game, and medicinal plants at their “usual and accustomed places,” retaining some of their traditional lifeways even though they lost million acres of land and billions of dollars in resources. The influx of white settlers that continued throughout the 1800s and 1900s severely impacted indigenous communities and led to conflict between Native Americans and settlers over environmental resources. This conflict continues today.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{df73a8d7-b9ab-4232-9eb6-eec3316158b9}{11}\" paraid=\"1124500813\">Native Americans were again displaced from a portion of their traditional homelands with the arrival of the Manhattan Project in 1943. The Manhattan Project’s need for a large safety and security perimeter would further dispossess Native Americans when the federal government appropriated 670 square miles (1740 sq kilometers) of land for the Hanford Site. Tribes lost access to their “usual and accustomed places” for fishing, hunting, and gathering on the Hanford Site that were guaranteed to them in the treaties of 1855. Today, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Nez Perce, Wanapum, and Yakama nations actively consult with the US Department of Energy at Hanford to ensure protection of their sacred places and tribal resources, including the Columbia River, on the Hanford Site.  </p> <h2 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d93888d2-45b8-4c47-bca6-2707f8d0ebc4}{243}\" paraid=\"1124500813\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d93888d2-45b8-4c47-bca6-2707f8d0ebc4}{243}\" paraid=\"1124500813\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><br /> The <a href=\"https://www.parks.wa.gov/575/Sacajawea\">Sacajawea Interpretive Center</a> features interactive exhibits on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacajawea, and the Sahaptian-speaking tribes of the region.

They had briefly visited the area on November 3, 1805, and named the tributary “Quick Sand River.” Lewis now noted there was one “large wooden house” of the Watlala Nation nearby, remarking, “when we decended the river in November last there were 24 other lodges formed of Straw and covered with bark near this house; these lodges are now distroyed and the inhabitants as the indians inform us have returned to the great rapids of this river…” They learned a great deal about Sandy River from area villagers and sent Sergeant Pryor to explore as far upriver as possible within a day. With game relatively plentiful, the captains resolved “to remain at our present encampment or some where in this neighbourhood untill we had obtained as much dryed meat as would be necessary for our voyage as far as the [Nez Perce].” During this time they also made detailed celestial and natural observations. By April 6, the food supply was adequately restocked, and they continued upriver.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\">Much of the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=29976\">Sandy River Delta</a><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\"> lies within the eponymous 1,400-acre USFS park, which includes an extensive trail system through forests, fields, and wetlands.

They thought that a river next to it, which Clark called the “quicksand river,” (now known as the Sandy River), was the larger stream.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{47976350-ec83-4dc8-90b4-9e77d919db5a}{132}\" paraid=\"161135171\">On their trip back up the Columbia in 1806, Chinookan and Kalapuyan people who lived here kept telling the visitors that the Sandy River was not a substantial river. They informed them that there was a larger one, the Multnomah (now called the Willamette). After first arguing, the travelers eventually believed the locals.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{47976350-ec83-4dc8-90b4-9e77d919db5a}{166}\" paraid=\"1545039858\">The next day, Lewis and Clark’s party saw several Upper Chinook men paddling in a canoe—nothing unusual, since the Columbia River (imaɬ or iyagaytɬ imaɬ, in Chinookan, meaning “great water”) was a busy highway. </p> <p paraeid=\"{47976350-ec83-4dc8-90b4-9e77d919db5a}{206}\" paraid=\"468414567\">They told the party that two of the men in their boat were from near the waterfalls (Multnomah Falls) upstream. One drew a map of “this river which they called <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?places=Willamette%20%28Multnomah%29%20River\">Mult-no-mâh</a>” . . . “which they drew on a mat with a coal.” Another agreed to guide Clark and seven other men up the river. He took as payment from Clark a “birning glass,” a lens that focused sunlight and helped spark a flame. </p> <p paraeid=\"{47976350-ec83-4dc8-90b4-9e77d919db5a}{253}\" paraid=\"1135972114\">This Chinook man brought the men up the Multnomah River, stopping by his village on the way. Clark described this man’s house and explained that the ruins of many more houses were behind it—the man explained many people of their town had died of smallpox twenty-five or thirty years before. </p> <p paraeid=\"{afa70d2a-260a-4c53-a405-04afe0aa2b5e}{32}\" paraid=\"310698843\">Clark described the depth and length of the river in terms of whether it could accommodate large ships. He did this because this expedition was not just to casually observe this land, but to prepare the way for American traders and settlers. A river of sufficient depth could accommodate a port for large ships to bring goods from around the world.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{afa70d2a-260a-4c53-a405-04afe0aa2b5e}{64}\" paraid=\"653381956\">Chinook and Kalapuya people already knew how great the Willamette River was—they lived along it in densely populated towns. They could, and did, tell their visitors what they knew about the river.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Lewis named Werner Creek, now called the Clearwater River.</p> <p>We are a small community in the God-given green valley on the southwest side of the Crown of the Continent, the largest intact ecosystem in the continental United States. The local scenery and wildlife along Highway 83 is between the world class Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks. Seeley Lake is a never-never land for shutterbugges – they’ll never run out of things to photograph.</p> <p>Relatively few people hold title to the wildlands surrounding Seeley Lake. Although there is enough private land in the valley to accommodate 10,000 (now 2,000) people, the vast majority of the open space is public, dominated by National Forest Land. The forest is dotted with lakes and wetlands throughout the countryside. Grasslands at the southern end of the valley begin the progression of ecotones through mid-elevation mixed tree species up to subalpine higher mountains.</p> <p>Our valley is blessed with an incredibly wide spectrum of biologic diversity. Our ecosystem is influenced by the convergence of maritime from the west, some arctic from the north, Great Plains from the east and high plains from the south.</p> <p>Our wildlife is still wild. The mid to upper portions of the Blackfoot Valley remains one of the few places along the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail where one may encounter a grizzly bear. Several noted species of wildlife are in the valley, including several top of the food chain varieties (grizzly bears and gray wolfs). Birders think this is the best area within 100 miles. Avifauna ecosystem niches are spread from elevation ranges of 4000 feet to 8000 feet above sea level — grasslands to subalpine environments. If birds move too fast, enjoy a heaven of wild flowers with colors moving throughout the seasons.</p> <p>Seeley Lake is at the epicenter of wilderness. The Bob Marshall-Great Bear-Scapegoat Wilderness Complex lies just beyond the skyline to the east. The Swan Mountain Wilderness beckons from the northeast. And the Rattlesnake Wilderness touches the southwest corner of the valley. Seeley Lake is only a few hours hike or horseback ride from the wild­erness edge. A primitive road from Jocko Pass links us to the Jocko Valley and Flathead Indian Reservation on the western side.</p> <p><strong>We have plenty of breathtaking experiences.</strong></p> <p>Our scenery is relaxing while many hikes can be breathtaking. Not all who wonder around are lost. They are just looking for rocks. You can find a different outdoor experience every day of the year. If you return to a special summer place when it has four feet of snow, it will be so different you’ll swear you’ve never been there before.</p> <p><strong>Enjoy our relaxing hospitality.</strong></p> <p>Visit like the snow geese enroute to other lands, like the loons that stay as long as they can or our resident ravens.</p> <p>Our people are very accepting and accommodating, respectful of other opinions and preferences. Most are outdoor enthusiasts sharing experiences rather it be motorheads or traveling by shanks mare. Water based recreation opportunities are on lakes and streams, liquid or frozen. People have been snowmobiling here for 40 years and still haven’t run out of new nooks to explore. Newer residents are overwhelmed with choices of places to explore. Lifetime residents accept the fact they can never do it all.</p> <p>Visitors have a choice of accommodations ranging from camping in a primitive environment or with modern conveniences. Select a siwash camp under a tree, developed campground, rent a cabin, stay in a motel, or find a vacation rental. Those who prefer brighter lights can visit for the day from Missoula.</p> <p>Seeley Lake is the regional hub for leisure travel. People here can enjoy the attractions with a one to three hour drive in some of the larger Montana cities — Missoula, Helena, Butte, Great Falls and Kalispell. Those folks are the bulk of our visitors. Those airports can also be starting points for exploring here and beyond Montana.</p>",

Writing in his diary on July 31st, Floyd noted, \"I am verry sick and has ben for Sometime but have Recovered my helth again.\" However, this quick recovery was followed by a turn for the worse. The night before his death, Clark remarked, \"Serjeant Floyd is taken verry bad all at once with a Biliose Chorlick we attempt to relieve him without success as yet, hr gets worst and we are much allarmed at his Situation, all attention to him.”<br /> <br /> On August 20, 1804, Floyd passed away, most likely from peritonitis, caused by the inflammation or rupture of his appendix. He died from an illness that even the best doctors of the day could not have cured. Clark wrote:<br /> <br /> “. . . Serj. Floyd died with a great deal of composure.

Clark wrote, “we Came to make a warm bath for Sergt. Floyd hopeing it would brace him a little, before we could get him in to this bath he expired, with a great deel of composure, haveing Said to me before his death that he was going away and wished me to write a letter— we took Buried him to the top of a high round hill over looking the river & Countrey for a great distance Situated just below a Small river without a name to which we name & call Floyds river, the Bluffs Sergts.

Local settlers recovered and reinterred most of the skeletal remains in a different location on the bluff. The grave was moved again in 1895. The Sergeant Floyd Monument, a 100-foot high sandstone obelisk, was built in 1901. Floyd’s remains were moved a third time and reburied at the base of the monument. Located along US-75 in Sioux City, Iowa, the monument is within a 23-acre park overlooking the Missouri River valley.</p>",

Sergeant Floyd tragically died, likely of a ruptured appendix, on August 20th, 1804 in present-day Sioux City, Iowa, making him the only member of the Lewis and Clark expedition to die on the journey. The M.V. Sergeant Floyd was created over a century later, keeping the memory of the fallen sergeant alive. </p> <p paraeid=\"{64365f7f-e189-485b-8dbd-359a969b7a05}{198}\" paraid=\"85\">The M.V. Sergeant Floyd was deployed in 1932 in Jeffersonville, Indiana. The boat was mostly utilized by the Corps of Engineers for menial work, such as water inspection and towing. She was used until 1975, at which point she became a moving exhibit for the Army Corps of Engineers to celebrate their Bicentennial. M.V. Sergeant Floyd functioned as an exhibit for 18 months, before finally being decommissioned. After her decommissioning, the boat was moved around and considered for various uses before she finally became the museum she is today. </p> <p paraeid=\"{64365f7f-e189-485b-8dbd-359a969b7a05}{216}\" paraid=\"87\">The museum currently offers free admission to its various exhibits covering the history of transportation on the Missouri River and the Lewis and Clark expedition. The restored third level of M.V.

Would they return to their families and their homes? Remarkably, all but one of the expedition survived. Sergeant Charles Floyd was the only expedition member to die en route. </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{92}\" paraid=\"20011559\">Floyd was born in 1782 just outside <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/locust-grove-kentucky.htm\">Louisville</a>, Kentucky. His father, Robert Clark Floyd, had served with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/locust-grove-kentucky.htm\">George Rogers Clark</a>, William Clark’s brother, in the American Revolutionary War. The two families kept in touch over the years. William Clark probably knew Charles Floyd as the constable of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/falls-of-the-ohio-old-clarksville-site.htm\">Clarksville</a>, where Clark lived.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{134}\" paraid=\"1566322574\">When it came time to recruit men for the expedition, Clark reached out to Floyd. Just twenty-one years old, he enlisted on August 11, 1803, along with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bios-of-the-ten-men-from-kentucky.htm\">several other young men from Kentucky</a>. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant in April 1804. </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{158}\" paraid=\"882461934\">Floyd fell ill sometime toward the end of July 1804. On July 31, he wrote, “I am verry Sick and Has ben for Somtime but have Recoverd my helth again.”178 The recovery was short lived. He became sick again on August 15 and “remained so all night.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{202}\" paraid=\"2015956081\">Diagnosed with “bilious colic” at the time, Floyd likely had a ruptured appendix. None of the members of the expedition had <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/medicine-on-the-lewis-and-clark-expedition.htm\">formal medical training</a>, but Lewis and Clark did what they could for their ailing crew member. York was Floyd’s principal caretaker, and Clark helped care for Floyd during his last nights. Floyd died “with a great deel of composure” on the afternoon of August 20, 1804, after telling Clark that “he was going away and wished me to write a letter.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{238}\" paraid=\"1506754026\">On the day Floyd died, Clark wrote in his journal, “I am Dull & heavy.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{246}\" paraid=\"2122786144\">It cannot have been easy for Clark to watch his family friend die, especially so far from home and loved ones. After a brief funeral service, the expedition members buried Floyd on top of a hill overlooking the Missouri and surrounding plains. They marked the grave with a cedar post, onto which they engraved Floyd’s name.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{252}\" paraid=\"565305150\">Floyd’s death may have felt like a reality check for other members of the expedition.

The Middle Ohio Valley was the ancestral homeland of the Shawnee people before the tribe was pushed east into present day Oklahoma.</p> <p>To learn more about the history of the Shawnee, visit the Shawnee Tribe Cultural Center in Miami, Oklahoma. The Center is a self-guided museum featuring rotating and permanent exhibits. Dedicated to sharing Shawnee culture, the center hosts a variety of events that allow visitors to take part in, and experience, this vibrant heritage.</p> <p>The Center’s mission is to provide a place for Shawnees to tell the story of their past, how that past informs and shapes Shawnees today, and who they see themselves becoming tomorrow. Through interactive exhibits visitors can listen to stories of the past, learn about traditions, and help envision the tribe’s future.</p> <p>The Shawnee exhibit visually tells the story of the Shawnee people through objects that represent essential aspects of Shawnee life— both today and throughout history. The installation displays no written information. Shawnee language, like many indigenous languages, is not traditionally a written language. History and ways of life are deeply rooted in oral tradition, with knowledge being shared and sustained from one generation to the next. While much has been written about Shawnee culture, a considerable amount of the information is incomplete. From sacred ceremonies to family stories, the exhibit supports Shawnee people in telling their own story. It invites conversation and investigations about Shawnee culture, with consideration for different ways of learning, sharing, and preserving.</p> <p>The Shawnee Tribe Cultural Center also features work by tribal artists, like that of Shawnee artist Gibson Byrd, who was a lifelong artist and educator. To honor his passion for art and teaching, interactive art exploration activities accompany the display. Past shows include “From Ancient Hands,” the center’s inaugural, award-winning exhibition featuring historic Shawnee pottery as well as contemporary pottery made in partnership with community members as well as scholars and scientists.</p>",

It hosts free photo and art exhibitions, and offers free programs, events and activities that explore themes of the land, rivers and people of the region. Themes are as diverse as agriculture, Mighty Mo fishing, heritage food and music, and Native Games days.  The 10,000-square foot Encounter Center features galleries, an activity room, an amphitheater, and areas for outdoor games and events. The Stanley Evans Auditorium hosts lectures, music and theatre programs, movies and panel discussions. An enclosed pathway known as “The River Connection” invites visitors to encounter maps and images of the Missouri River.<br /> <br /> The Interpretive Center and Betty Strong Encounter Center are both open Tuesday – Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 12 noon to 5 p.m.  Admission is free.  Access is easy, just off I-29, at 900 Larsen Park Road.  <br /> <br /> While in the Sioux City area, you’ll want to visit the Charles Floyd Monument, just five miles from the Centers.  Here on a bluff overlooking the Missouri, you can honor the memory of the first U.S. soldier to die west of the Mississippi River. <br /> <br /> For more information on the Sioux City Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center and the Betty Strong Encounter Center, go to: <a href=\"https://www.siouxcitylcic.com/\">www.siouxcitylcic.com.</a>",

That evening, the expedition camped among a grove of cottonwoods across the river (along the north bank) and nearly a mile upstream from a tributary they named “Slaughter River.” Lewis and his detachment camped there again on July 29, 1806, during the return journey and two days after the fight at Two Medicine.<br /> Today Lewis and Clark’s Slaughter River is known as Arrow Creek and is located within the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/montana-dakotas/upper-missouri-river-breaks\">Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument</a><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">. In 1967, the Montana Department of Fish and Game designated the site as a primitive boat access recreation area. Currently, the camp area includes a shelter and two privies. The Lewis and Clark Camp at Slaughter River is primarily publicly accessible via boat, but it can also be reached overland by a rugged two-track drive that leads from 8 Mile Bench Road. The overland route is restricted and requires access permission from the BLM.The Camp at Slaughter River was one of the few sites used by the explorers on both their outgoing and return trips. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">They first camped here on May 29, 1805. They had discovered the remains of over 100 buffalo, which they assumed were killed at a buffalo jump. Indigenous peoples in the high Plains used jumps to kill buffalo before the advent of steel-tipped arrows, lances and rifle-muskets. They would draw a herd to the edge of a butte, cliff, or river gorge and then instigate a stampede that forced the buffalo over the edge. Lewis explained:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">“. . . for this purpose one of the most active and fleet young men is scelected and disguised in a robe of buffaloe skin, having also the skin of the buffaloe's head with the years and horns fastened on his head in form of a cap, thus caparisoned he places himself at a convenient distance between a herd of buffaloe and a precipice proper for the purpose.the other indians now surround the herd on the back and flanks and at a signal agreed on all shew themselves at the same time moving forward towards the buffaloe; the disguised indian or decoy has taken care to place himself sufficiently nigh the buffaloe to be noticed by them when they take flight and runing before them they follow him in full speede to the precipice.the decoy in the mean time has taken care to secure himself in some cranney or crivice of the clift which he had previously prepared for that purpose. the part of the decoy I am informed is extreamely dangerous, if they are not fleet runers the buffaloe tread them under foot and crush them to death, and sometimes drive them over the precipice also, where they perish in common with the buffaloe . . .”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"> </p> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">The Corps wrongly attributed the jump to Blackfeet members, whose two-week-old campsite was found earlier in the day.

        "notes": "Spirit Mound\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/spirit-mound.htm\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\">On August 25, 1804, Lewis, Clark, and several of their men walked nine miles to Spirit Mound from their camp on the south bank of the Missouri River. They were determined to see the mound that was so feared by the indigenous people of the area. In his journal Clark explained the legend of Spirit Mound:<br /> <br /> “. . . and by the different nations of Indians in this quarter is Suppose to be the residence of Deavels. That they are in human form with remarkable large heads, and about 18 inches high, that they are very watchful and are arm'd with Sharp arrows with which they Can Kill at a great distance; they are Said to kill all persons who are So hardy as to attempt to approach the hill; they state that tradition informs them that many Indians have Suffered by these little people.So much do the Maha [Omaha], Soues [Sioux], Ottoes [Otoes] and other neighboring nations believe this fable, that no Consideration is Sufficient to induce them to approach the hill. One evidence which the Inds give for believing this place to be the residence of some unusial Spirits is that they frequently discover a large assemblage of Birds about this mound . . .”<br /> <br /> The intense heat fatigued everyone, especially Lewis’s dog Seaman who was sent back to the river to rest. Finally, Lewis and Clark reached the top of Spirit Mound where they \"beheld a most beautiful landscape; Numerous herds of buffalo were seen feeding in various direction; the Plain to the North N.W. and N.E. extends without interruption as far as can be seen.\"<br /> <br /> Today, Spirit Mound is one of the few remaining physical features on the Upper Missouri River that is readily identifiable as a place Lewis and Clark visited and recorded.<br /> <br /> Spirit Mound is a High Potential Historic Site on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> On August 25, 1804, Lewis, Clark, and ten other men hiked about nine miles north of the Missouri River to visit Spirit Mound. According to Clark, the Omaha, Sioux, and Oto tribes traditionally believed that the hill was inhabited by devils “in human form with remarkable large heads and about 18 Inches high”. They were said to be “Very watchfull” and “arm’d with Sharp arrows with which they Can Kill at a great distance”. The men encountered no such inhabitants, but found a hill “Situated on an elivated plain in a leavel and ex­tensive prarie […] with a Steep assent to the hight of 65 or 70 feet, leaveing a leavel Plain on the top of 12 feet in width & 90 in length”. Clark observed that soil consistencies with the surrounding terrain indicated the “mound” was a natural landform. He wrote of the view, “from the top of this Mound we beheld a most butifull landscape; Numerous herds of buffalow were Seen feeding in various directions, the Plain to North N. W & N E extends without interuption as far as Can be Seen.”<br /> <br /> In 1868, European-Americans began to settle in the area. Over time, Spirit Mound was extensively degrad­ed by the impacts of livestock and crop production. By the early 1980s, the landscape was cluttered with over 20 buildings, a feedlot, agricultural fields, roads, fences, and about 1,500 non-native trees. The locally-formed Spirit Mound Trust worked with the Land and Water Conservation Fund to purchase the 320-acre site from private owners, and then donated it to the state of South Dakota for restoration and preservation. The Spirit Mound Historic Prairie was established as a state park in 2001, with a focus on prairie restora­tion. In 2004, the Spirit Mound Summit Trail was designated as a national recreation trail.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Diverse Meanings - Diverse Cultures</strong><br /> Spirit Mound has taken on a variety of cultural meanings that reflect the beliefs of the diverse peoples that make up the American population. It is an important point of contact between the American Indians and Euro-Americans. It exemplifies a sometimes uneasy fusion of these two major cultural traditions.</p> <p><strong>Native Meanings - The Mandan</strong><br /> For American Indians, Spirit Mound is both physical location and spiritual place, a place of contact between the natural and the supernatural world. The sacred Turtle Drums of the Mandan were created at Spirit Mound. At Spirit Mound, Lone Man saved the Mandans' ancestors from a great flood. The first shrine built to commemorate Lone Man's saving the Mandan was built at Spirit Mound.</p> <p><strong>Native Meanings - Yankton (Sioux)</strong><br /> For the Yankton (Sioux), Spirit Mound is associated with the <em>Can O'ti na</em>, Little Tree Dwellers/Little People. Long ago two tribes battled to a stalemate. They both sought help from the spirits at Spirit Mound. They tried to manipulate the spirits for their own purposes. Their manipulation failed, but it brought two types of spirits into this world. The larger Spirits moved west to become Sasquatch, but the <em>Can O'ti na</em> stayed in the area and can still be seen there today.</p> <p><strong>Native Meanings - Lakota (Sioux)</strong><br /> In Lakota (Sioux) tradition, Spirit Mound is also associated with the <em>Can O'ti la</em>. In the distant past, Iktomi (Trickster) persuaded the Raccoon people to try to change their nature. The <em>Can O'ti la</em> are descendants of two modified Raccoon children. As the <em>Can O'ti la</em> grew, they walked upright and used their paws like hands. They also became mischievous and played tricks on men. Men were led astray and sometimes died. Later in time at Spirit Mound, the Can O'ti la were transformed into spirit helpers of men. Spirit Mound is the origin point for the <em>Wo'piye Can O'ti la</em>, the Little Tree Dweller's Medicine Bundle. This medicine bundle is still in use today by the Lakota of the Dakotas and Nebraska.</p> <p>This coming together of the American Indians and Euro-American peoples had a downside. At Spirit Mound, the Winged One predicted that the <em>Can O'ti la</em> would be forced away from Spirit Mound when the true children (European-Americans) of the trickster <em>Iktomi</em> arrived. For some, Lewis & Clark's visit to Spirit Mound marks the beginning of the end of Lakota traditional lifeways.<br /> <br /> For more information, visit the <a href=\"http://www.spiritmound.com/\">Spirit Mound Trust</a> website. </p>",

The Can O’ti na sometimes behaved mischievously and played tricks on humans. They could also serve as spiritual helpers. Today, Lakota ceremonies still include the Little Tree Dweller’s Medicine Bundle.

The following day he wrote, “this mountain has a singular appearance it is situated in a level plain, it’s sides stand nearly at right angles with each other and are each about a mile in extent. these are formed of a yellow clay only without the mixture of rock or stone of any size and rise perpendicularly to the hight of 300 feet. the top appears to be a level plain and from the eminence on which I was yesterday I could see that it was covered with a similar cost of grass with the plain on which it stands. the surface appears also to possess a toler­able fertile mole of 2 feet thick, and is to all appearance inaccessible. from it’s figure we gave it the name of fort mountain. those mounds before mentioned near the falls have much the same apeparance but are none of them as large as this one.” Although the expedition, by Lewis’ measurements, never approached closer than within eight miles as they passed upriver, the distinctive landmark dominated the landscape. Lewis recognized it again during the return when he crossed the Continental Divide on July 7, 1806, and wrote, “the fort mountain bears North Eaast, and appears to be distant about 20 Miles.”<br /> <br /> Square Butte is a laccolith, formed millions of years ago by an intrusion of magma up through weaker layers of rock. It is grouped with two other nearby laccolith formations – Shaw Butte and Crown Butte. Although privately owned and publicly inaccessible, Square Butte remains an unmistakable and highly visible land­mark with an appearance that has been only minorly altered over time.",

Additionally, several members of the Corps celebrated the coming journey heavily, resulting in court-martials and punishments. John Collins received 50 lashes for being absent without leave (AWOL), misbehaving at a ball and using disrespectful language to Clark. William Werner and Hugh Hall were also found guilty of being AWOL and received sentences of 25 lashes each.

By the time of the 1804 Louisiana Purchase, the French inhabitants of the town were surrounded by American settlers in the countryside. As both river and land transportation increased, St. Charles grew in prominence. It became Missouri’s first state capital, from 1821 to 1826. The St. Charles Historic District encompasses an area eight-and-a-half blocks long and one-and-a-half blocks wide and includes buildings constructed between 1807 and the 1890s. Frontage along the west bank of the Missouri River includes a commemoration of Lewis and Clark in the approximate area of their campsite.

The village consisted of about a hundred houses inhabited by mostly French-Canadian settlers. There were also Osage and Kickapoo towns nearby. According to Clark, when the boats arrived in St. Charles about noon on May 16 “a number Spectators french [sic] & Indians flocked to the bank to See the party.” The group remained in St. Charles until Lewis arrived on May 20.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1ec972f8-30e2-4226-b878-0a565d8836a4}{181}\" paraid=\"1313891788\">While in St. Charles, the captains hired about a dozen mostly French-Canadian boatmen, or engagés, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/pierre-cruzatte.htm\">Pierre Cruzatte</a> and François Labiche. Many of the engagés had traveled and traded on the Missouri. They knew the river and could help navigate its trickier sections.

Cruzatte and Labiche were Métis, people with both Indigenous and European, mainly French, heritage. Cruzatte and Labiche each had a French-Canadian father and an Omaha mother. They spoke multiple languages and had first-hand knowledge of many of the Indigenous communities along the river.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{17df10fa-f52c-4bfb-a28f-67e8977a5422}{46}\" paraid=\"2103321137\">For example, Labiche had experience trading with Otoe communities and spoke some Chiwere, the Siouan language spoken by Otoe people. When the expedition encountered a group led by the Otoe leader We ‘ar ruge nor (Little Thief), Labiche served as an envoy and interpreter. Cruzatte, Labiche, and the other French and Métis boatmen helped to ensure the success and safety of the expedition from beginning to end.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The exhibit focuses on the experience of St. Joseph during the war years, drawing direct parallels to issues that face our community today and commemorating the lives of those who lived through the era.</p> <p>The War required sacrifice from all citizens and those who remained at home were not immune. As men left home to fight abroad, their families faced real hardship – frequently the salaries they earned as soldiers were far less than what they earned in civilian life (in order to alleviate this and to encourage enlistment, the Tootle-Lemon Bank in St. Joseph announced that it would cover the wage gap for any of its employees who enlisted).</p> <p>Learning to make ends meet with fewer resources was a particular challenge for households. As the war continued, rationing measures were implemented. The city official in charge of enforcing the rationing – and convincing citizens that “meatless Tuesday” and “wheatless Thursday” were their duties as members of society – was, coincidentally, Harry L.

Meriwether Lewis and William Clark knew that they would need to trade for horses with Shoshone people—who Sacagawea had lived with for over a decade—to cross the mountains.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{48}\" paraid=\"1566517783\">She had her infant son, Jean Baptiste, with her. He was only four months old at the time.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{72}\" paraid=\"676588433\">What was it like to be so sick? Did her husband rock the baby to sleep while she laid in the shade of the pirogue? </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{78}\" paraid=\"570431242\">Clark and Lewis took all measures to help Sacagawea. They needed her. They could not get over the Rocky Mountains without her help. They needed her to live. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{94}\" paraid=\"943070407\">Clark bled Sacagawea for a few days (a popular treatment in Western medicine at the time), but it likely only made her symptoms worse. He also gave her salts, bark, and opium. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{124}\" paraid=\"757698567\">A week into her illness, the expedition reached a sulfur spring. Indigenous and non-Native people across the continent drank from sulfur springs to help heal a range of maladies.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{138}\" paraid=\"17411942\">Soon after Sacagawea drank from the spring, she felt better. It may have been that the illness just ran its course, but regardless, she recovered and helped the group through the Great Falls portage a few days later.</p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{154}\" paraid=\"625973615\">Was Sacagawea still weak in those days after she drank from the spring? Could she hold her baby without feeling faint? She must have known how desperately the American men needed her—did that give her solace or add pressure to her recovering body and mind? <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

        "notes": "Tansy Point\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/tansy-point.htm\n\nNamed for the abundance of Tansy Ragwort that grows here, Tansy Point in Warrenton, Oregon, has a long history of human occupation. Before the arrival of Europeans, Chinook villages stretched along the numerous waterways that fed into the Columbia River, including the area at Tansy Point. It was here, on November 24, 1805, that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark’s Corps of Discovery paused to take a vote on their next campsite. While here, they also met with members of the local Chinook tribes.<br /> <br /> Clark recorded the visit in his journal, stating: <blockquote> <p>“A fair morning Sent out 6 hunters, and we proceeded to make the following observations <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1805-11-24#n26112407\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> a Chief and Several men of the <em><a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?lc_native_nation_ss=Chinook%20Indians\">Chin nook</a> </em>nation Came to Smoke with us this evening one of the men brought a Small Sea otter Skin for which we gave Some blue beads— this day proved fair which gave us an oppertunity of drying our wet articles, bedding &c. &c. nothing killed to day except one Brant. the variation of the Compass is 16° East.”</p> </blockquote> The vote itself was recorded by John Ordway, an expedition member, who wrote: <blockquote> <p>“clear pleasant morning. a white frost Several men went out a hunting we put out our baggage to air. The Calumbian River at this place is three miles 660 yards wide. Some of two nations of Indians came to our Encampment the Clatsop and Chinuck nations they behave very well as yet. our officers conclude with the oppinion of the party to cross the River and look out a place for winters quarter<span style=\"font-size: 10.5px;\">  </span> Some where as near the ocean as possable on the account of makeing Salt.”</p> </blockquote> The vote regarding the expedition’s winter quarters is thought to be a rather momentous event in early U.S. history as the first vote in the Pacific Northwest. It’s considered especially noteworthy because Clark’s slave, York, and Sacagawea also voted.<br /> <br /> Several years later, in 1851, Tansy Point served as the meeting point between the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Oregon Territory, Anson Dart, and representatives from several Chinook nations. The results of these meetings are collectively known as the Tansy Point Treaties. Sadly, the treaties were never ratified by the U.S. government, and the participating tribes lost their land without receiving any of the promised rights outlined in the treaties. They still struggle for federal recognition to this day.  <br /> <br /> Visitors to the Tansy Point will find spectacular views of the Columbia River and the town of Astoria, located three miles away. A scenic overlook with interpretive panels known as the Lewis and Clark Observation Platform marks the historical location of Lewis and Clark’s stay.<br /> <br /> The observation platform can be found by following the Warrenton Waterfront Trail. The trail runs for 4.7 miles through the city of Warrenton. Parking for the trail can be found at both its northern end at Seafarer’s Park and its southern end at Skipanon River Park, with an additional parking area located near the trail’s middle at Eben H. Carruther’s Memorial Park on Fort Stevens Highway. The trailhead at Eben H. Carruther’s Memorial Park is the closest one to Tansy Point.<br /> <br /> For more information on the Warrenton Waterfront Trail, visit <a href=\"https://www.traillink.com/trail/warrenton-waterfront-trail/#trail-detail-parking\">Warrenton Waterfront Trail</a>.

They have been lost to erosion or changes in the river, both natural and man-made (whether dams and other developments).  </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e684b9d-4d03-4aa3-9d88-139b4eecbca9}{148}\" paraid=\"1524394268\">Tavern Cave, however, remains much as it was when Lewis and Clark visited on May 23, 1804, a few days after leaving St. Charles, Missouri. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e684b9d-4d03-4aa3-9d88-139b4eecbca9}{154}\" paraid=\"1421427953\">For thousands of years, Indigenous people used Tavern Cave as a shelter. Later, European-American fur traders and other Missouri River travelers also utilized it. The cave entrance is at the base of a large sandstone bluff on the south bank of the river. Rocks jutting out over the cave opening made it a highly visible landmark. Many maps of the area, including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/life-at-camp-dubois.htm\">Mackay-Evans map</a>, noted its location. Names and markings etched into the cave wall showed the centuries of use. Clark remarked that “many names are wrote up on the rock,” and he felt compelled to add his. Some of the markings, possibly even Clark’s, still exist today. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e684b9d-4d03-4aa3-9d88-139b4eecbca9}{186}\" paraid=\"1654042460\">Tavern Cave is notable for another reason. Lewis nearly fell to his death climbing on the rocks above the cave. According to Clark’s account, Lewis attempted to scale the sandstone cliffs to the rocks protruding out over the cave entrance. The brittle sandstone could not withstand Lewis’ weight, however, and he lost his footing. He fell about twenty feet before he “Saved himself by the assistance of his Knife,” presumably driving it into the rock wall to break his fall.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The expedition arrived in present day Montana on April 27, 1805 and on June 13, Captain Meriwether Lewis was witnessing:</p> <blockquote> <p>“…the grandest sight I ever beheld…whin my ears were saluted with the agreeable sound of a fall of water and advancing a little further; I saw the spray arise above the plain like a collumn of smoke . . . which soon began to make a roaring too tremendous to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri…”</p> </blockquote> <p>-Captain Meriwether Lewis</p> <h3>The Great Falls | Ryan Dam</h3> <p>The best view of The Great Falls is done from the highest peak at <a href=\"https://www.visitmt.com/listings/general/recreation-area/ryan-island-park-picnic-area.html\">Ryan Island Park</a>, which is accessed from a suspension bridge across the Missouri River. After traveling a two-lane road that provides views of the expansive high plains and agricultural land, you will arrive at the viewing point of the Great Falls, located at 160 Ryan Dam Road.</p> <p>There are few hints given along the way of the canyon or the river contained at the end of the road. The roar of the falls is best witnessed in the Spring, just like Captain Lewis experienced. The canyon walls show the arduous task of portaging around the Falls that laid ahead of the Expedition. Although Ryan Dam, constructed in 1915, controls the flow of the water over the falls, the enormity of The Great Falls is still impressive. The dam follows the natural break in the landscape that created the falls and was more than 80 feet high when first seen by Captain Lewis. Today, The Great Falls stand 148 feet due to the dam.</p> <h3>Crooked Falls</h3> <p>Upstream 7 miles from the Great Falls, Crooked Falls flows over an irregular shelf, 19 feet high and 300 yards across. Untouched by a dam, and inaccessible by vehicle, Crooked Falls can be witnessed today just as the Expedition saw it in 1805.</p> <h3>Rainbow Falls | Rainbow Dam</h3> <p>Recorded by Captain Lewis as “Beautifull Cascade” in his journal, Rainbow Falls’ “cascade of about fifty feet perpendicular” was untouched when the dam was constructed in 1910. You can see the magnificent Rainbow Falls at 6401 Giant Springs Road.</p> <h3>Colter Falls</h3> <p>A half mile upstream from Rainbow Falls, the smaller, 6 foot Colter Falls could be found. Set behind Rainbow Dam, these falls are now submerged.</p> <h3>Black Eagle Falls | Black Eagle Dam</h3> <p>Nearest to Great Falls’ city limits, Black Eagle Falls are 2.5 miles above Rainbow Falls. At 26 feet high and 600 yards, these falls were the first to be dammed in 1890. From the top of these falls, the confluence of the Missouri River with the Sun River is visible and from the bottom, Black Eagle Memorial Island Park gives you the closest breathtaking vantage possible. These dramatic falls are located at 5401 River Drive North.</p> <h2>The Dams</h2> <h3>Morony Dam</h3> <p>The old town site of Morony still stands and offers a glimpse into where present-day Great Falls almost was. Below Morony Dam is great fishing and a natural spring, Sulphur Springs, accessible by foot or bicycle on River’s Edge Trail.</p> <h3>Cochrane Dam</h3> <p>Cochrane is the newest dam, constructed in 1958, between The Great Falls and Crooked Falls and is only seen along the River’s Edge Trail while walking or biking.</p>",

        "notes": "The Lewis & Clark Salt Works\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-salt-works.htm\n\n<h3>History</h3> Much of the Corps' stay on the North Coast was spent securing sustenance for the winter and provisions for the trip home. On December 28, 1805, the Lewis & Clark Expedition sent out a detachment of five men in search of a good place to make salt. The expedition, which had been wintering at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-clatsop-or.htm\">Fort Clatsop</a>, had run out and were in desperate need of more. Salt was important for meat preservation and thus for the crew’s survival on the trip back home. The rivers near the fort weren’t salty enough, and so a better place had to be found. The men found an ideal spot on the Pacific Ocean approximately 15 miles from Fort Clatsop where they set up the salt processing camp.<br /> <br /> Making salt required a bit of planning and a lot of work. Sea water had to be collected and allowed to sit till the sand sank to the bottom. Then the men had to collect a large supply of firewood and build a stone furnace, on top of which they placed five kettles that had to boil 24 hours a day to produce the salt. Captain William Clark and few additional men joined the others at the salt works a little over a week later on January 9, arriving in the early afternoon. The group stayed at the salt works until February 20, when they left with 3.5 bushels (about 28 gallons) of “Excellent, fine, strong & white” salt. <p> </p> <h3>Today</h3> Today, visitors can see the site believed to be the expedition’s salt works. It was identified by a rock cairn and the testimony of Jenny Michel, born in 1816 to a Clatsop man who had pointed the place out to her when she was a child. According to her father, this was the place he had seen white men boiling water.<br /> <br /> The site is located on the Promenade. At the intersection of US Highway 101 and Avenue G, turn west to Beach Drive, then left to Lewis and Clark Way. Park where available without blocking private driveways. Walk west on Lewis and Clark Way to the Salt Cairn.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

In 1804, Sergeant John Ordway described a landscape teeming with deer and large flocks of geese. He noted rich river bottoms “covered with different kinds of Timber.” For Ponca people who called the area home, the land and rivers provided physical and spiritual nourishment.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{162}\" paraid=\"1636669915\">In the 200 years since Ordway wrote those words, the construction of settlements, farms, dams, and other infrastructure have altered the rivers and surrounding landscape. </p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{184}\" paraid=\"273957235\">Today, farms and ranches cover the prairies above the river. Pollution from nearby towns and cities leaches into the river, affecting fish and other wildlife. Most significantly, the closest upstream dam, the Gavins Point Dam, slows the current of the Missouri and catches the mud it would naturally wash downstream.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{208}\" paraid=\"190814443\">Built in 1952, Gavins Point was one of many dams that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed on the Missouri River as part of the Missouri Basin Program (also commonly called the Pick-Sloan Plan). Congress voted to build these dams, claiming that they were needed for flood control, irrigation, and hydroelectricity generation.</p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{230}\" paraid=\"1836725613\">Before the dams, spring and summer rains frequently caused flooding along the Missouri. For Ponca people, the floods provided fertile soil and needed moisture for their gardens in the bottomlands.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{244}\" paraid=\"73437295\">The dams mitigate floods, help to irrigate farms, and generate electricity. But what is lost when the river cannot flow freely? <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Indigenous residents of the valley, including Delaware, Shawnee, Haudenosaunee, and other people who had <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/ohio-river-valley-a-place-for-refugees.htm\">come to the valley as refugees</a> lived in the Ohio River Valley in the late 1700s. Shawnee communities were known for accepting refugees from other Indigenous communities and their careful diplomacy helped foster pan-Indigenous confederacies out of the valley in the late 1700s.  <br /> <br /> French traders frequented the Ohio in the seventeenth century, and by the early 1800s, many people in the valley had mixed Indigenous-French heritage.  <br /> <br /> Following the American Revolution, a huge influx of White, American settlers came to the region, thanks to state and federal policies promoting settlement on lands violently seized from Indigenous people. Thousands of American settlers took<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/locust-grove-kentucky.htm\">roads through Kentucky</a> or floated down the Ohio on flatboats to claim these lands. Lewis passed several American settlements in 1803, and at one point, bought corn and potatoes from an American farmer. <br /> <br /> The water was low, which delayed their journey. To keep moving, they rowed, used poles to push the boat downstream, and at one point, “cut a channel through the gravel with our spade and canoe paddles and then drag the boat through.” These were all techniques that the many people who navigated the Ohio’s busy waters had likely used before.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

Clark wrote, “Capt Lewis & my Self walked up, to the top which forms a Cone and is about 70 feet higher than the high lands around it, the Bass is about 300 foot in decending this Cupola, discovered a Village of Small animals that burrow in the grown (those animals are Called by the french Pitite Chien).” They managed to kill one prairie dog and capture a second, which joined the expedition and survived the winter at Fort Mandan. In the spring, it (along with other collected specimens) was sent downriver and transported to Washington, D.C., to be received by President Jefferson on October 4, 1805. Lewis and Clark are credited with the first scientific description of the prairie dog, or Cynomys ludovicianus. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the Tower has changed very little since it was first documented by Lewis and Clark. Located about a half-mile south of the Missouri River in Boyd County, Nebraska, the landform rises an ad-ditional 70 feet above a line of bluffs along the southern edge of the Missouri valley. The surrounding land-scape is characterized by open prairie and burr oak woodlands. In 2005, a 524-acre conservation easement was enacted to protect the Tower and the environs.

William Clark polled everyone on November 24, 1805, and tallied their votes in his journal.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{72}\" paraid=\"401436884\">Clark recorded the vote of York, a Black man he enslaved. This was decades before Black men had the right to vote in the United States. Several years after the Lewis and Clark Expedition, York asked for his freedom. Clark denied his request. How meaningful was York’s vote, if he still was not free? </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{108}\" paraid=\"1376804430\">Clark also asked Sacagawea’s opinion on where to stay over the winter. Her vote was not tallied, but Clark made a note that she wanted to stay somewhere with lots of wapato, to make sure they had enough food for the winter. The group decision did not heed her concerns, but her point played out: they spent much of the winter trading with the Clatsop for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/wapato.htm\">wapato</a> and other food. And their health suffered at times when they had only dried salmon or spoiled elk meat to eat. </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{166}\" paraid=\"1297852312\">Ultimately, Lewis and Clark’s party decided to stay south of the Columbia River, where the Clatsop people lived and where there would be easy access to the ocean. The hunting would be good there, it was close to the ocean for salt-making, and they hoped the rain wouldn’t be as bad. </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{178}\" paraid=\"641365020\">Sacagawea voicing her opinion in 1805 gained more attention a century later. The women’s suffrage movement used Sacagawea’s input at Station Camp as a symbol of why women deserved the right to vote. That right came at the national level in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. However, barriers to suffrage still existed for people of color, including Indigenous women, until well into the twentieth century.</p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{218}\" paraid=\"1878192478\">Sacagawea and York gave their opinions to the White men leading the expedition—an expedition that neither of them freely chose to join. But did their votes make a lasting difference for Black people, Indigenous people, or women?  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Owned and operated by the Salish, Kootenai and Pend d’Oreille tribes, the new Three Chiefs Culture Center is temporarily housed in a log building built several years ago for Colonel Doug Allard as his first restaurant. It will continue to be more than a museum; it is a vital, living encounter with Native American culture.</p> <p>Three Chiefs Culture Center is a place to experience the rich cultures of the Salish, Kootenai and Pend d’Oreille tribes. The traditions of these people have been passed down orally from generation to generation. As their lifestyles change with time and technology, they continue to preserve and protect their heritage, history and culture. Explore the artifacts and exhibits, hear the stories of their people, and participate in cultural activities, traditional arts and crafts, cultural education, Native games and other events. Visit the Center’s Gift Shop which has a beautiful collection of Native arts and Native made crafts.</p> <p>From 2003 to 2006, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes were very active in the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial commemoration which shared the tribal perspective of the Expedition. They worked together with the Circle of Tribal Advisors in telling the Native American story. Compiled by the Salish-Pend d’Oreille Culture Committee and the Elders Cultural Advisory Council, the University of Nebraska Press published <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Salish-People-Lewis-Clark-Expedition/dp/0803216432\"><em>The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition</em></a>.

Today, the Tribes still thrive in their homeland and the Center honors this rich cultural heritage.</p> <p>“Our elders knew the curves of the hillsides and the lines of the trails as intimately as they knew the curves and lines of their mother’s faces.

It was here that Sacagawea had previously been kidnapped by the Hidatsa during a raid on a Shoshone camp. Clark, who led a scouting party ahead of the main body, wrote, “we proceeded on a fiew miles to the three forks of the Missouri those three forks are nearly of a Size, the North fork [Jefferson River] appears to have the most water and must be Considered as the one best calculated for us to assend middle fork [Madison River] is quit as large about 90 yds. wide.

Initially uncertain, Lewis and Clark determined the Jefferson River their best route forward in anticipation of meeting the Shoshone and gaining their assistance.

First, find the Shoshone people and pay for Shoshone guidance and horses to help carry the expeditions’ things over the mountains. Second, find the pass (again, with help from Shoshone people) that would bring them closest to the Columbia River headwaters. This would shorten their overland journey significantly, since traveling by boat was easier and more efficient than by land.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1788c8c6-39e8-40d4-82b1-4d99eee2d04b}{134}\" paraid=\"1868182088\">They looked for signs that someone had recently been at the headwaters but found none.

With their work now complete, there are a total of 23 access points along the Ohio, Monogahela, and Allegheny Rivers, establishing what is known as The Three Rivers Water Trail. The trail, now having been open to the public for 10 years, was granted National Recreation Trail status by the U.S. Department of Interior, and it allows for perfect accessibility to some of Pittsburgh’s greatest features. Some access points have boat racks, benches, and interpretive signs.</p> <p>Access points can be spotted via the road or river, and they are characterized by red-paddle-shaped signs. These signs list the distance from the Point at Point State Park, a nearby scenic attraction that you can travel to via your non-motorized boat. The access points have ramps or docks for easy access to the water, and most of them have resources such as parking, boat racks, and interpretive signage that discuss the historical significance of the rivers. No permits or registration are required, and the trails can be used free of charge.</p> <p>Launch your canoe, kayak, or SUP and ply the Ohio River where the Lewis & Clark journey began.

On November 27, they proceeded “around a verry remarkable point which projects about 1½ Miles directly towards the Shallow bay the isthmus which joins it to the main land is not exceding 50 yards and about 4 Miles around.” Clark named it “Point William” and wrote, “below this point the waves became So high we were Compelled to land unload and traw up the Canoes, here we formed a Camp on the neck of Land which joins Point William to the main at an old indian hut.” The main party remained while Lewis took a detachment on November 29 to scout for suitable winter quarters. The interim days were miserable with nearly continuous winds and rain, and “nothing to keep our Selves or Stores dry, our Lodge nearly worn out, and the pieces of Sales & tents So full of holes & rotten that they will not keep any thing dry.” The men explored the point and surrounding area while hunting for game.

In 1830, the United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. This law required native tribes to vacate their ancestral lands and relocate to reservations in Oklahoma, then simply called Indian Territory. Then, in 1835, a small group of the Cherokee Nation signed the Treaty of New Echota, which divided the Cherokee People into two factions—those that supported the treaty and those that opposed it.<br /> <br /> In May 1838, the U.S. Army, bolstered by various state militia groups, forcibly removed over 16,000 Cherokee from their homelands so that white settlers could move in. This journey, now referred to as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears</a>, saw more than a thousand Cherokee, mainly the old, young, and infirm, perish on this brutal forced march. Thousands more died shortly thereafter from the exposure, disease, and starvation they had suffered while en route to the reservations.<br /> <br /> The park’s visitor center offers exhibits focused on both the forced removal of the Cherokee People and the area’s natural history. A 23-minute documentary titled “Trail of Tears” is also available on demand. Interpretive programs are scheduled throughout the summer from Memorial Day through Labor Day.  <br /> <br /> Those looking to spend time outdoors will enjoy boating, fishing, hiking, and swimming. There are also two playgrounds within the park.Picnic sites are scattered throughout the park, some of which are accessible to those with disabilities. The park’s two covered pavilions are available for rent or, if not reserved, can be used on a first-come-first served basis for free. The campground offers basic, electric, and sewer/water/electric/water campsites, along with a special use camping area reservable for groups only.<br /> <br /> To reserve a pavilion, call (573) 290-5268.

The next day Clark wrote, “Concluded to Delay to day and make Some observations, as at this place the rout which we are to prosue will pass up the Travelers rest Creek, The day proved fair and we took equal altitudes & Some luner observations. The Latd. 46° 48’ 28” as the guide report that no game is to be found on our rout for a long ways, ads an addi­tion to the cause of our delay to precure Some meat, despatched all our hunters in different directions, to hunt the Deer which is the only large game to be found.” There was a friendly encounter with three Flat­head warriors, in pursuit of two men from another tribe who had stolen horses from them. On the morning of September 11, the expedition broke camp and continued westward into the mountains on the Lolo Trail. They returned to the area on June 30, 1806, and camped for three nights. Upon the July 3 departure, Clark took a contingent to explore the Yellowstone River, while Lewis headed for the Missouri and Marias rivers. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">While Lewis and Clark named the creek, not the camp, Travellers Rest, in popular use it now refers to the geographic location of the camp site, reinforced the establishment of the Travellers Rest National Historic Landmark and </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"http://stateparks.mt.gov/travelers-rest/\">Travelers’ Rest State Park.</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\"> Conversely, the creek itself has since been renamed Lolo Creek.

Roads such as this one were marked by the parallel ruts left by travois. A travois consisted of two attached, load-bearing poles hitched to a horse or dog with a collar. As the animal pulled the travois, the two poles dragged along the ground. While much of the historic road has since been eradicated through agriculture, the five-acre Lewis and Clark Travois Road site encompasses intact remnants of the road system. Although privately owned, the area may be publicly viewed from a pull-off along US Route 12.</span></span></span></p> <div> </div>",

The site is a High Potential Historic Site along the Lewis and Clark Trail and represents many firsts for the United Sates and for the expedition.</p> <p>The Two Medicine Fight Site represents the first encounter with the Blackfeet Nation, a Native American Tribe that for much of the trip through Montana had been narrowly avoided. The Blackfeet nation were enemies to many of the tribal nations that the Corps of Discovery were in alliance with, such as the Nez Pearce and Shoshone nations. The Blackfeet Nation was also understandably unwelcoming to white men. It is no surprise that when Meriwether Lewis and three others, George Drouillard (an interpreter hunter, and cartographer), and brothers Joseph and Reubin Field (two of the expeditions top hunters) were walking on Blackfeet Territory and happened on a group of young Blackfeet tribesmen, there was fear of an outbreak of violence. However, the expedition narrowly avoided any violence during the initial meeting.</p> <p>On the evening of July 26, 1806, the camp was awoken to the sound of Blackfeet attempting to steal firearms. Unsuccessful in their attempt, two to three Blackfeet tribesmen were killed while the rest escaped. Quickly after this encounter, the campsite was packed up and the expedition fled in fear of a larger attack.</p> <p>In addition to the Two Medicine Fight Site being the first encounter with the Blackfeet Nation and first violent encounter, it was also the first military conflict between the US and a plains tribe.</p> <p>Today, the Two Medicine Fight Site is still in the Blackfeet Indian territory on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.

Yelleppit invited them to spend several days at his village near the confluence of the Walla Walla River. Receiving a warm welcome, the expedition spent the next few days engaging in trade, council, and socializing with the Wallulapum.

Two days later, Lewis arrived with the main expedition. All were famished and exhausted. Lewis found himself “growing weak for the want of food and most of the men complain of a similar deficiency and have fallen off very much.” The Nez Perce generously welcomed and fed them meals of camas, dried salmon, and berries. Whether due to bacteria or a sudden change in diet, nearly the entire expedition became extremely sick. They departed Weippe Prairie on September 24 to prepare for their descent of the Clearwater River. Lewis and Clark reunited with the Nez Perce on May 3, 1806, during the return journey. Delayed by lingering winter in the mountains, they camped along the Clearwater River until June 10, then relocated to Weippe Prairie. On June 15, the expedition made its first attempt to cross the mountains, but found conditions to be impassable. They returned to Weippe Prairie on June 19 and remained another five days. Their final departure was on June 24. Six days later, they arrived at Travellers Rest. During the times spent with the Nez Perce, bonds of mutual friendship and respect were forged. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">The Weippe Prairie National Historic Landmark covers approximately 3,120 acres, the majority of which is privately owned.

Watkuweis had been captured many years before during a raid by Blackfeet or Atsina warriors. She then lived with White people for several years before finding her way home. Watkuweis convinced her Nez Perce family to be kind to these White visitors, since the White people she had met before had been kind to her. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bb90bca-a0f5-49f6-b770-70dbc2bf9f0a}{185}\" paraid=\"1886167736\">No one in the visiting party spoke Nez Perce, but two French-speaking men—<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/profile-of-george-drouillard.htm\">George Drouillard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/pierre-cruzatte.htm\">Pierre Cruzatte</a>—knew the sign language that was common among Indigenous communities and non-Native traders across North America. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9bb90bca-a0f5-49f6-b770-70dbc2bf9f0a}{217}\" paraid=\"313218783\">The visitors wanted to travel by boat, but they had left theirs on the other side of the Rocky Mountains. Two Nez Perce men, Walamottinin (Twisted Hair) and Tetoharsky, led the visitors to the Clearwater River.

Meriwether Lewis gives a brief description in his journal when he writes on September 7, 1803, that he and his men “passed Charles town on the E. shore above the mouth of Buffaloe over which there is built a handsome wooden bridge, this has the appearance of a handsome little Village, containing about forty houses.” Notably, Patrick Gass, a sergeant and the chief carpenter of the expedition, later settled in Wellsburg, where he died in 1870 at the age of 98. He was the oldest surviving member of the expedition. </p> <p paraeid=\"{562258c8-8b6b-4ab4-9ef2-0a0b905e9301}{151}\" paraid=\"222227026\">Wellsburg boasts a number of historic locations for visitors to see. In 1982, the Wellsburg Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Included in this section of the town are Millers Tavern and the Wellsburg Wharf, both notable for predating the expedition and among the collection of village structures noted by Lewis. Millers Tavern, built in 1797, houses the Brooke County Historical Museum. Also located in the historic district is the Patrick Gass Cottage, originally built 1797, which Gass occupied during the final decades of his life. </p>",

The Western Historic Trails Center, located on the banks fo the Missouri River in Council Bluff, Iowa, details their journey from St. Louis to the Pacific. Known as the Loess Hills region, unique deposits of windswept loess soils left behind by the last Ice Age rise 200 feet above the plains along the river. <br /> <br /> The Western Historic Trails Center is the perfect place to spend an afternoon learning about history, enjoying a musical performance, or even just to stretch your legs. The building itself was designed and built by the National Parks Service as a center of exploration in 1997. Here, visitors have the opportunity to retrace the steps of pioneers who came after Lewis and Clark, walking not only the trail blazed by the two intrepid explorers but also the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Mormon Trail.<br /> <br /> Exhibits include sculptures by Timothy Woodman, photos, maps, and quotes pertaining to the trails and America's history of Westward Expansion. Outdoor picnic areas offer a tranquil place to enjoy the sunshine and scenery. Walking and biking paths wind through 400 acres of prairie along the scenic Missouri River, offering a glimpse into what the two explorers and the Corps of Discovery observed more than 200 years ago. <br /> <br /> Admission is free. School and group tours are available, but require advance scheduling by calling the center at (712) 366-4900.

He purchased a pirogue and some other supplies. He nearly recruited a local physician for the expedition, Dr. William Patterson. However, Dr. Patterson did not make it to the boat by the 3:00 PM time of departure on September 9, and the expedition continued downriver. </p> <p paraeid=\"{2966368e-7ec8-4e19-b4cb-9339465f0f33}{123}\" paraid=\"139131920\">Today, Wheeling is considered the birthplace of West Virginia and was named a National Heritage Area in 1996. The town boasts many recreational activities, including a 3,200-acre municipal park, a zoo, and Wheeling’s Heritage Trail System consisting of an 18-mile network of biking and walking trails. Home to a certified arts community, Wheeling is also home to the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra, the historic Capitol Theatre, and the Stifel Fine Arts Center. Several museums are also located throughout the city, including the Oglebay Institute Mansion Museum, the Kruger Street Toy & Train Museum, the Oglebay Institute Glass Museum, and the Children’s Museum of the Ohio Valley. </p>",

One of the men caught what was likely a channel catfish, which inspired the encampment’s name – White Catfish Camp. They stayed until July 26, replenishing food, refitting equipment, and attempting to contact the Otoe and Pawnee tribes. Clark wrote, “This being a good Situation and much nearer the Otteaus town than the Mouth of the Platt, we concluded to delay at this place a fiew days and Send for Some of the Chiefs of that nation to let them Know of the Change of Govern­ment, The wishes of our Government to Cultivate friendship with them, the Objects of our journy and to present them with a flag and Some Small presents.” A party sent overland located an Otoe village near the confluence of the Elkhorn and Platte rivers, but found it empty. The expedition again stayed at this camp during the return journey on September 8, 1806.<br /> <br /> The exact location of White Catfish Camp is unknown.

Lewis characterized the landscape as exhibiting “a most romantic appearance,” and further described the distinctive geography, writing “The bluffs of the river rise to the hight of from 2 to 300 feet and in most places nearly perpendicular; they are formed of remarkable white sandstone which is sufficiently soft to give way readily to the impression of water; two or thre thin horizontal stratas of white free-stone, on which the rains or water make no impression, lie imbeded in these clifts of soft stone near the upper part of them; the earth<br /> on the top of these Clifts is a dark rich loam, which forming a graduly ascending plain extends back from ½ a mile to a mile where the hills commence and rise abruptly to a hight of about 300 feet more. The water in the course of time in decending from those hills and plains on either side of the river has trickled down the soft sand clifts and woarn it into a thousand grotesque figures”. Taken by the seeming architectural quality of the natural rock formations, he wrote that “nature presents to the view of the traveler vast ranges of<br /> walls of tolerable workmanship, so perfect indeed are those walls that I should have thought that nature had attempted here to rival the human art of masonry had I not recollected that she had first began her work.”<br /> <br /> The White Cliffs are located in the <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/montana-dakotas/upper-missouri-river-breaks\">Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument</a>, which was established in 2001. The picturesque landscape is primarily characterized by formations of Virgelle Sandstone that have eroded over millions of years.

[…] they drew [a sketch] on a Mat with a coal, it appeared that this river which they Call Mult-no’-mah discharged itself behind the Island we call the image Canoe island, and as we had left this Island to the South both in decending & assending the river we had never Seen it. they informed us that it was a large river and runs a Considerable distance to the South between the Mountains. I deturmined to take a Small party and return to this river and examine its Size and Collect as much information of the nativs on it or near its enterance into the Columbia of its extent, the Country which it waters and the nativs who inhabit its banks.” Clark, with six men and a guide, explored about seven miles up the Willamette River. Clark favorably noted, “The Current […] is as jentle as that of the Columbia glides Smoothly with an eavin surface, and appears to be Sufficiently deep for the larg­est Ship.” He returned to camp on April 3.<br /> <br /> The landscape character has altered significantly since 1806 due to riverfront industrialization and channel dredging.

        "notes": "Winter Camp at Wood River (Camp Dubois)\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/winter-camp-at-wood-river.htm\n\n<p>The Winter Camp at Wood River is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail</a>. <br /> <br /> Clark established the winter quarters for the expedition on the south side of the Wood River on a site previously identified by Lewis. On December 12, 1803, Clark wrote, “I came to in the mouth of a little River called Wood River” and the following day he “fixed on a place to build huts Set the men to Clearing land & Cutting Logs.” While there it was Clark’s responsibility to train the men of the newly-formed Corps of Discovery. Meanwhile, Lewis spent the winter in St. Louis gathering supplies and equipment. On March 9, 1804, Lewis attended a ceremony in St. Louis for the transfer of the Upper Louisiana Territory to the United States. After two months, the expedition left for St. Charles, Missouri, where Lewis joined them a week later. During the return trip, the expedition revisited the camp site on September 23, 1806. Clark noted that “here we found a widdow woman who we left here & has a plantation under tollarable good way Since we have been on the Expedition.”</p> <p>The winter camp was originally sited on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River. Since that time, the Mis­sissippi’s channel has shifted eastward, the mouth of the Missouri River has shifted southward, and a new channel for the Wood River was dredged. Consequently, the historic site of the Winter Camp at Wood River is now located on the west side of the Mississippi River, in Missouri. Nearby interpretation of the camp is found at the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site reconstruction in Hartford, Illinois.</p> <p>After the Corps of Discovery departed Camp Dubois on May 14, 1804, Sergeant Patrick Gass recorded his thoughts: “..in the evening we encamped on the north bank six miles up the river. Here we had leisure to reflect on our situation, and the nature of our engagements: and, as we had all entered this service as volunteers, to consider how far we stood pledged for the success of an expedition…”</p> <p>Camp Dubois sat at the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, near present day Hartford, Illinois. Between December 1804 and May 1805, Camp Dubois housed the men of the newly formed Corps of Discovery. During those months dedicated to final preparations for the long journey, these men brawled and drank and disobeyed. And yet as they prepared, the men began the slow process of becoming a corps, a unit.</p> <p>William Clark guided this transformation. While Meriwether Lewis wintered in St. Louis, securing provisions and consulting fur traders’ journals, Clark delegated and disciplined. Courts-martial and confinement were standards of military discipline. Hard work taught the men to rely on one another and prepared them for the long voyage. Turning mischief to skill, the men held shooting matches with local farmers and honed their marksmanship.</p> <p>Camp Dubois proved to be the expedition’s first test of cohesiveness. Living and working together prepared Corps members like Gass to face the trials the journey would bring. Still, on that spring morning in 1804, it was not without anticipation and trepidation that they “proceeded on under a jentle brease up the Missouri.”</p> <p>More information about Camp Dubois is available in the following books and web sites.</p> <p><strong>Books</strong><br /> <em>The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, vol. 2</em>.<br /> Edited by Gary E.

Several miles down, he describes passing what is today known as Yellow Bluff, saying: <blockquote> <p>4 Miles to a Small rock island in a deep nitch passed a nitch at2 miles in which there is a dreen from Some ponds back, theland low opposite this nitch a bluff of yellow Clay and SoftStone from the river to the Comencement of this nitch be-low the Country rises to high hills of about 80 or 90 feet above the water— </p> </blockquote> Visitors can still visit this location today, although much of Yellow Bluff is now covered by vegetation.

After a hike of several miles, Lewis “ascended the hills from whence I had a most pleasing view of the country, perticularly of the wide and fertile vallies formed by the missouri and the yellowstone rivers, which occasionally unmasked by the wood on their borders disclose their meanderings for many miles in their passage through these delightfull tracts of country.” The five men camped on the Yellowstone riverbank overnight. The following day Lewis “dispatched Joseph Fields up the yellowstone river with orders to examine it as far as he could conveniently and return the same evening; two others were directed to bring in the meat we had killed last evening, while I proceeded down the river with one man in order to take a view of the confluence of this great river with the Missouri”. By noon the main group arrived by river, and Lewis and Clark took measurements at the confluence. <br /> <br /> Public visitation is facilitated by the <a href=\"http://www.history.nd.gov/historicsites/mycic/index.html\">Missouri-Yellowstone Confluence Interpretive Center</a>, a museum that is operated by the <a href=\"http://www.history.nd.gov/index.html\">State Historical Society of North Dakota</a>.

The 8 foot sculpture was commissioned by the city of Louisville in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark’s historical trip. It pays homage to the contributions of York, born a slave and the childhood companion of Clark, and his significant role in Lewis and Clark’s Corps of Discovery expedition from 1803 through 1806. The York Statue sits atop the Belvedere, located at the corner of Fifth & Main Streets, overlooking the Ohio River.</p> <p>The following is taken from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/york.htm\">content created by the National Park Service</a>:</p> <p>Little is known about the life of York. He was an enslaved man owned by William Clark, and later became a member of the Corps of Discovery. William Clark inherited York as property when the elder Clark died, and the two were around the same age. York was one of only two members of the original Corps who was married.</p> <p>York is often mentioned in the journals kept by both Lewis and Clark throughout the course of the Expedition. These journal entries indicate that he experienced freedoms that few enslaved people had, though these freedoms would be revoked upon his return to the Clark plantation.</p> <p>The journals indicate that York was allowed to hunt, which was notable because African Americans weren’t generally allowed to handle guns. He became the primary caregiver to Charles Floyd, who died during the Expedition from what is believed to have been appendicitis. He risked his life to save Clark, Sacagawea, and her son when they were caught in a flash flood. York is also credited with being the first African American to have a vote equal to that of a white man. In November 1805 the Corps held a vote to decide where to camp for the winter, and both York and Sacagawea cast votes on that location.<br /> <br /> When the Corps of Discovery returned from the Expedition, each member – except York – received double pay and 320 acres of land. York, on the other hand, returned to slavery. Clark denied York’s initial requests for freedom, recording in 1808 that:</p> <p><em>“I did wish to do well by him. But as he got Such a notion about freedom and his emence Services…I do not think with him, that his Services has been So great/or my Situation would promit me to liberate him.”</em></p> <p>York was finally freed sometime after 1815. With his freedom, Clark gave York a wagon and team of horses, with which York created a hauling business. By 1832, however, Clark told author Washington Irving that York’s business failed, and that he had contracted cholera and died in Tennessee. The location of his burial is unknown.</p>",

The other was a tributary of the Yellowstone which Clark called “Yorks Dry Creek.” However, it was later renamed “Custer Creek.” The cluster of islands were officially designated as “Yorks Islands” by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names in 2000, following a push for recognition by the Crimson Bluffs Chapter of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation, located in Townsend, MT. While the islands are predominately privately owned, there is public access available at the Yorks Islands Fishing Access Site, located along the Missouri 3.6 miles south of Townsend, Montana.</p>",

On March 1, 1806, Gass noted the discovery in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“We had a cloudy wet morning. I set out with 8 men and 4 hunters to bring the meat of the elk that had been killed, which was at a greater distance from the fort than any we had yet brought in. There is a large river that flows into the southeast part of <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?places=Baker%20%28Haley%27s%29%20Bay\">Hayley's Bay</a>; upon which, about 20 miles from its mouth, our hunters discovered falls, which had about 60 feet of a perpendicular pitch.”</p> </blockquote> Located just ten miles south of the city of Astoria, Oregon, Youngs River Falls is a popular summer recreation spot for swimming. Here, the warm waters of the Youngs River tumble over a rocky 54-foot drop to a pool below, the deepest point of which is between five to seven feet and surrounded by dense forest. From the parking lot, a short 0.25-mile trail leads downhill from the parking lot to the base of the waterfall. The waterfall can also be seen from the parking lot.<br /> <br /> Admission to the site is free and is open year-round for day-use only. Dogs are welcome but must be kept on a leash. Climbing and cliff jumping are not permitted. For more information, visit https://oregondiscovery.com/youngs-river-falls.",

        "notes": "Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/dayton-aviation-heritage-national-historical-park.htm\n\n<p>Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park comprises six sites in the greater Dayton, Ohio, area. The park boundary at these six sites encompasses 111 acres. Established in 1992, the partnership park preserves and interprets resources related to inventors Wilbur and Orville Wright, writer Paul Laurence Dunbar, and sites in Dayton associated with the early development of aviation.<br /> <br /> There are five national historic landmarks and two national register historic districts within Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. These include the Wright Cycle Company building, Hoover Block, Huffman Prairie Flying Field, 1905 Wright Flyer III, Hawthorn Hill, and the Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial. Together, these sites tell the stories of the lives and legacies of Wilbur Wright, Orville Wright, and Paul Laurence Dunbar. The fourth Wright Cycle Company building and the Hoover Block are located at South Williams and West Third Streets. The fourth location of the bicycle shop operated by the Wrights is the only building remaining as testament to their bicycle business. The site was designated a national historic landmark in 1990. Wilbur and Orville Wright operated Wright & Wright, Job Printers, on the second floor of the Hoover Block from 1890 to 1895. The building houses the Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center. The Hoover Block was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the West Third Street Historic District in 1988. The Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center is co-located with the Aviation Trail Visitor Center and Museum. Aviation Trail, Inc., is one of the park’s partners.<br /> <br /> Not far from the Wright Cycle Company and the WrightDunbar Interpretive Center is the Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial. Paul Laurence Dunbar, a transformational African-American poet, novelist, and playwright, lived in the house in west Dayton with his mother, Matilda Dunbar, from 1904 until his death in 1906. After Matilda Dunbar’s 1934 death, the State of Ohio acquired the property and opened it for public visitation as the first house museum commemorating an African American. It was designated a national historic landmark in 1962. The Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial is owned by the State of Ohio, managed by the Ohio History Connection, and operated jointly by NPS staff and Dayton History. The Ohio History Connection and Dayton History are two of the park’s partners. Occupying the grounds of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Huffman Prairie Flying Field is where the Wright brothers proved the aeroplane was a practical invention in 1904 and 1905. The 84-acre Huffman Prairie Flying Field was designated a national historic landmark in 1990. The Flying Field is on an active military installation, and as such, it is subject to unannounced closure<br /> <br /> At Carillon Historical Park, the 1905 Wright Flyer III is the centerpiece of the Wright Brothers Aviation Center. The world’s first practical aeroplane, it was built by the Wright brothers in 1905 and flown at Huffman Prairie Flying Field. The Wright Flyer III was designated a national historic landmark in 1990 and a historic mechanical engineering landmark in 2003. Carillon Historical Park and the Wright Flyer III are owned and managed by Dayton History, one of the park’s partners.<br /> <br /> Hawthorn Hill, south of central Dayton, is open for tours through Dayton History. In 1914, Orville Wright, Katharine Wright, and Milton Wright moved into this large Georgian revival style mansion in Oakwood. Orville, later joined by servants Charles and Carrie Kayler Grumbach, lived at Hawthorn Hill until his death in 1948. Hawthorn Hill was designated a national historic landmark in 1991.<br /> <br /> The Wright Company factory in west Dayton opened in 1910 as the first factory in the United States designed especially for building aeroplanes, a testament to the brothers’ attempt to commercialize their invention. Students at the Wright School of Aviation also came here to learn plane controls on a simulator. The factory, currently in private ownership, is a new part of the park and is not yet open to the public.<br /> <br /> Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park is part of the National Aviation Heritage Area. Authorized by Congress in November 2004, the National Aviation Heritage Area honors the region’s leadership in the nation’s aviation history. The National Aviation Heritage Area provides visitors with an opportunity to experience several significant sites associated with aviation, including the sites of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park.</p>",

The National Aviation Heritage Alliance is the coordinating entity for the area and is continuously working to promote aviation and aerospace heritage while sustaining the legacy of the Wright brothers for current and future generations. <br /> <br /> On December 17th, 1903 the first airplane flew into reality as the Wright brothers made four flights with the Wright Flyer. Though these flights took place on the North Carolina coast, Orville and Wilbur Wright spent years refining their invention in their bicycle sales and repair shop in Dayton, Ohio. Dayton, known as Ohio’s “Gem City,” became a prosperous hub for manufacturing and invention, and is a nexus of aeronautical science, technology, logistics, and acquisitions.<br /> <br /> Starting in 1907 with the United States Department of War (the precursor to the Department of Defense) and the U.S. Army Signal Corps’ Aeronautical Division, experimental aircraft and engineering flourished in the region and brought together many of the nation's leading aeronautical engineers and researchers. Thanks to the efforts of these innovators, this area radically transformed airplane design and the development of modern civilian air transportation that people around the globe rely on for goods, services, medical supplies, and travel. <br /> <br /> In WWII, the region served as a critical airplane manufacturing hub that helped the Allies win the war. The Weaver Aircraft Company (WACO) halted production on their consumer-favorite open-cockpit biplane and manufactured a highly successful glider used by the Allied forces throughout Europe. The WACO CG-4 was the most widely used American troop/cargo military glider of World War II with nearly 14,000 delivered to the military.<br /> <br /> As the United States entered the space race in the late 1950s, the region’s aviation and aerospace history inspired a man who is now a household name. Neil Armstrong, first astronaut to set foot on the moon, was born on August 5, 1930, in Wapakoneta, Ohio. As a child, Armstrong attended the Cleveland Air Races and took his own first flight in Warren, Ohio. Armstrong earned his pilot’s license before his driver’s license and entered college at age 17 to study aeronautical engineering. The region’s rich aviation history continues to inspire generations of leaders. The National Aviation Heritage Area invites you to come, discover, and fly.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{71}\" paraid=\"19\">Historic Sites and Points of Interest: </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p aria-level=\"3\" paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{77}\" paraid=\"20\" role=\"heading\"><a href=\"https://www.daytonhistory.org/visit/dayton-history-sites/carillon-historical-park/\">Carillon Historical Park</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{86}\" paraid=\"21\"><a href=\"http://www.wright-b-flyer.org/\">Wright “B” Flyer</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"3\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p aria-level=\"3\" paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{95}\" paraid=\"22\" role=\"heading\"><a href=\"https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/\">National Museum Of The United States Air Force</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"4\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p aria-level=\"3\" paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{104}\" paraid=\"23\" role=\"heading\"><a href=\"https://woodlandcemetery.org/\">Woodland Cemetery & Arboretum </a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"5\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"5\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p aria-level=\"3\" paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{113}\" paraid=\"24\" role=\"heading\"><a href=\"https://www.nationalaviation.org/\">National Aviation Hall Of Fame</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"6\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"6\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p aria-level=\"3\" paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{122}\" paraid=\"25\" role=\"heading\"><a href=\"https://www.libraries.wright.edu/special/\">Wright State University Special Collections and Archives</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"7\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"7\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p aria-level=\"3\" paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{130}\" paraid=\"26\" role=\"heading\"><a href=\"https://www.wacoairmuseum.org/\">WACO Air Museum</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"8\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"8\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p aria-level=\"3\" paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{138}\" paraid=\"27\" role=\"heading\"><a href=\"https://visitnaha.com/aviation_site/grimes-flying-lab/\">Historic Grimes Field </a>and <a href=\"https://www.champaignaviationmuseum.org/\">Champaign Aviation Museum</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"9\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"9\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p aria-level=\"3\" paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{151}\" paraid=\"28\" role=\"heading\"><a href=\"https://www.armstrongmuseum.org/\">Armstrong Air & Space Museum</a> </p> </li> </ol> <h2 paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{159}\" paraid=\"29\">Notable People:  </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{165}\" paraid=\"30\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/wilburwright.htm\">Wilbur</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/orvillewright.htm\">Orville Wright</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{f30074a7-9c2a-4697-9360-fa4e03ffd172}{178}\" paraid=\"31\"><a href=\"https://aaregistry.org/story/lewis-a-jackson-aviation-pioneer/\">Dr. Lewis A.

        "notes": "Paul Laurence Dunbar House Historic Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/dunbar-house.htm\n\n<h2>Discover Dunbar:</h2> <p><br /> Paul Laurence Dunbar (June 27, 1872 – February 9, 1906) was a gifted and prolific American poet and author who was best known in his lifetime for his dialect work and his use of metaphor and rhetoric, often in a conversational style. In his short career he produced over 400 works including twelve books of poetry, four novels, four books of short stories, and wrote the lyrics to many popular songs. Dunbar became the first African American to support himself financially through his writing.<br />   <br /> The Paul Laurence Dunbar House is located at 219 N. Paul Laurence Dunbar Street (formerly N. Summit) in Dayton, Ohio. The two-story brick house was built in 1887-1888. In 1904, the house was purchased by Matilda J. Dunbar, the mother of poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. Paul Laurence Dunbar is generally recognized as the first African American to become widely known for literary accomplishments, and the house has long been celebrated for its association with him.<br /> <br /> Located in a residential neighborhood in west Dayton, the house was constructed by Samuel Chadwick, a businessman, and developer. In 1884, Chadwick purchased 22.19 acres of land west of Dayton. After selling some of it, Chadwick divided the remainder into lots, two of which make up the study property. It was the first house built on the block, and one of many in the neighborhood that was built by or for Chadwick. The house was sold in 1894 to Joseph A. and Josephine Shumaker. Later that year, it was sold to Enos and Anna Harley, who made numerous improvements to the property. Those included the construction of the barn and the addition of an upstairs bathroom. The house changed hands a few more times before it was purchased by the Miami Building and Loan Association.<br /> <br /> Matilda Dunbar bought the house in 1904 from the Miami Building and Loan Association. Paul Laurence Dunbar shared the house with her from 1904 until his death in February 1906. After Paul Dunbar's death, Matilda maintained the house and associated property as an informal shrine to her son until her death in 1934. The state of Ohio purchased the house soon after Matilda's death, making it one of the first publicly owned house museums to honor an African American. The house has been open to the public since 1938. In 1962, The Paul Laurence Dunbar House became the first National Historic Landmark in the United States to be established in honor of an African American. It is still owned and managed by the state, and jointly operated by National Park Service staff and Dayton History. In 1992, the property became part of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park.</p> <h2><strong>Hours of Operation</strong></h2>   <p>The Paul Laurence Dunbar House is open Friday through Sunday, from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.Tours take place throughout the day and admission is free. Last tour of the day is at 3:30 PM. You can start your visit at the visitor center entrance located on Edison Street (just around the corner from the Dunbar house) where you can view a movie and see artifacts and exhibits dedicated to the life of Dunbar. Visit the <a href=\"http://cms.nps.doi.net/daav/planyourvisit/directions.htm\">Directions</a> page for detailed directions to the Paul Laurence Dunbar House Historic Site. The house is located at 219 N. Paul Laurence Dunbar Street, Dayton, Ohio, 45402.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded restoration work on the Paul Laurence Dunbar House in 1999.</em></p>",

From there, guests can explore the interpretive exhibits and displays on the first floor which give more insight into the lives and aviation journey of Dayton's most famous figures, Wilbur and Orville Wright. Wilbur and Orville started their careers as printers and operated their second print shop, outside the home, here as Wright & Wright Job Printers. In this location, the Wrights edited and published newspapers for the West Side patrons. The Dayton Tattler, written by Paul Laurence Dunbar, was also printed at this location. Designated as part of the West Third Street National Register Historic District in 1988.<br /> <br /> Upstairs, on the second floor of the center, visitors will encounter additional interpretive displays about the Wright's and also about poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. The second floor also is home to the Aviation Trail Parachute Museum which tells the story of the development of the free fall parachute from its invention at Dayton's McCook Field after WWI, up to its role in current aviation and spacecraft.

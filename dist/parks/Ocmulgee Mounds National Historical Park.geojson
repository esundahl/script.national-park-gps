The longest wall paralleled the ancient trading path adjacent to it and had two openings, probably gates. The smallest ‘gate’ was five feet in length and possibly used for pedestrian traffic. The length of the second ‘gate’ suggests use for the pack horses loaded with incoming trading goods and outgoing deer skins.<br /> <br /> Most trading posts of this era had a building for trading, including merchandise storage and a warehouse for storing the deer skins prior to shipment. Excavations at the site revealed Indian construction techniques (wattle and daub) consistent with the practice of using Indian labor. The smaller building was approximately 11 x 11 feet and adjacent to the largest entrance. A second structure was in the southwestern area of the stockade and measured 15 x 25 feet.",

These mounds were created by the Mississippians who lived here in the 10<sup>th</sup> century CE. The flat-topped, pyramidal mounds were raised in layers at intervals over many years; and suggest intricate social relationships. The Great Temple Mound is where the village chief would have lived, and was built in four separate stages with clay steps going up the northern slope. It’s estimated that 10 million baskets of dirt, weighing about 60 pounds each, were used to build the 55-feet-tall mound! Today, there are steps that allow visitors to climb to the top of both mounds for a spectacular view of the surrounding area.",

In the 1930s, an excavation was conducted in the mound area, which was about three feet high at the time. The excavators dug seven trenches and discovered an area of tan sand over a sod layer that in turn overlays a dark tan sand layer some 70 feet wide. The mound was constructed outside of the Mississippian village's fortifications, suggesting that the mound was built near the end of the Mississippian period after the village had expanded.<br /> <br />  ",

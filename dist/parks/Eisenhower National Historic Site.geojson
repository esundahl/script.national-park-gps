In addition to the American flag, during the presidential years, whenever Eisenhower was on-site the presidential flag was flown. Once Ike left office, however, his military rank was reinstated, so the five-star general’s flag was then flown at the farm.  <br /> <br /> The fields surrounding the flagpole served a variety of purposes through the years, including hosting events at the farm. In 1952, Eisenhower hosted campaign events here during his first run for the White House. From political luncheons to family events, the fields surrounding the flagpole were a gathering place for many years here at the Eisenhower farm. </p>",

In May 1915, he first visited the historic town in south-central Pennsylvania with his West Point class. Three years later, as an army captain, 27-year-old Eisenhower was assigned the command of Camp Colt, the U.S. Army tank training camp in the middle of the Gettysburg battlefield. Through the trials and tribulations of 1918, Eisenhower grew as an officer and person. He and Mamie lived in Gettysburg with their first-born child, Doud, who would tragically die in 1921 at the age of 3.  <br /> <br /> Decades after Camp Colt, Eisenhower was returning to Gettysburg a much different person. He was the victorious 5-star general who oversaw the Allied victory in Europe during World War II. He had then spent several years as the Chief of Staff for the US Army, leaving that post for the presidency of Columbia University in 1948. “Ike”, as he was affectionately known by many, was now looking towards retirement with his beloved Mamie. When they found this 189-acre dairy farm, it was their perfect place. They purchased the property for $44,000, dreaming of a peaceful and tranquil retirement to come.  <br /> <br /> Soon after buying the farm, Eisenhower was called back to Europe to be the Supreme Commander of NATO forces. The following year, he left that role to run for the presidency, being elected the 34th President of the United States. Over his two terms in office, his Gettysburg farm was a central feature of Eisenhower’s time as president. Ike spent over 365 days here while he was Commander-in-Chief, using the farm for rest and relaxation, as well as a locale for hosting world leaders.  <br /> <br /> Finally, in 1961, 11 years after buying their farm, the Eisenhowers left the White House and, at long last, had their retirement home of their dreams. The 1960s were happy years for Ike and Mamie, and we invite you to explore the only property that they ever owned in their long and eventful lives together.  <br />  </p> <h4 paraeid=\"{e1a2eb78-f09d-48bd-b9ad-d856039a1a9a}{228}\" paraid=\"709880077\">History of the Property</h4> <p paraeid=\"{c4decad3-470f-4660-96c3-6e4a7b4dd94b}{181}\" paraid=\"349123781\">The home that Ike and Mamie lived in is not the same house that they originally purchased. This home, and the property it sits on, evolved over time.<br /> <br /> The original owner of the property, Quinton Armstrong, built a two-story log cabin on the spot in the 1750s. In the 1830s, a brick veneer was added to the exterior of the original log structure. This was the structure that the Eisenhowers purchased.<br /> <br /> Over the course of the 1800s, this property also changed hands several times. At the time of the Civil War, the farm was owned by John Biesecker who rented to Adam Bollinger. The Bollinger family watched Confederate forces march across the farm fields on July 2, 1863, during the Battle of Gettysburg. The farm was outside the main areas of combat but still suffered damage from artillery, trampling, and looting. One of the double log barns on the grounds may have been used by the Confederates as a field hospital. <br /> <br /> In 1886, John Biesecker sold the farm to John and Sarah Plank who owned the property until the early 1900s. The Planks built the large bank barn which still stands next to the house today.<br /> <br /> When Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower purchased this Gettysburg farm, they intended to live out a quiet retirement here. However, Dwight D. Eisenhower was pulled back into public service and the quiet retirement the Eisenhowers imagined when they purchased the property was put on hold.</p> <h4 paraeid=\"{c4decad3-470f-4660-96c3-6e4a7b4dd94b}{181}\" paraid=\"349123781\"><br /> Construction and Renovation</h4> <p paraeid=\"{c4decad3-470f-4660-96c3-6e4a7b4dd94b}{181}\" paraid=\"349123781\">Once Dwight and Mamie were in the White House, it was discovered that most of their Gettysburg home was in dire straits due to its advanced age and the deteriorating condition of the wooden interior. The Eisenhowers were advised to raze the home to the ground and start fresh. However, Mrs. Eisenhower wished to save as much of the original home as possible, so she implemented a new plan that saved a portion of the 1800s structure.<br /> <br /> That part of the home today contains the kitchen and butler’s pantry downstairs and the maid’s room upstairs. The older brick section has a rougher exterior appearance from the newer brick and is easily visible from outside the house. Because the older and newer brick did not match, the house was painted white. Construction began in the spring of 1953 and was finished in the spring of 1955. <br /> <br /> Originally a small summer kitchen had been adjacent to the original house in the 1800s. While all the wooden parts of that structure were removed, the Dutch oven and fireplace were left intact to be incorporated into the new home. The Dutch oven and fireplace, part of the property at the time of the Battle of Gettysburg, were incorporated into the den on the southern side of the Eisenhower home.<br /> <br /> The Eisenhowers quickly fell in love with their newly finished home, using it as a respite for rest, relaxation, and recovery during their years in the White House. They hosted numerous world leaders here.<br /> <br /> This home was the only home the Eisenhowers owned together, and they would stay here for the rest of their lives.</p>",

The large doors on the north and south ends of the building made it possible to drive equipment in and out without having to back up. Today the garage shelters a John Deere 630 tractor, disk harrow, mounted plow, and subsoiler Model # 22; as well as, a homemade snow plow for the 630 Tractor.<br /> The eastern wall of the garage contained a corn crib. Shucked corn could be stored in the narrow cavity that ran the length and height of the building. The dried corn could be used to feed livestock in winter months or before spring grasses came in.<br /> The Citgo gas pump on the southeast corner of the garage reflects the Eisenhower Farms practice of purchasing fuel in bulk for use in farm equipment and vehicles. Farm hands and employees kept track of the gas they used and would pay for it at the end of the month. One of the Eisenhower Farms partners, Alton Jones, was the president of Cities Service Oil Company (aka Citgo).</p>",

They were used for various purposes, including starting seedlings for the Eisenhowers’ orchid collection and to rehabilitate some of Mrs. Eisenhower’s house plants on occasion. It also served as an excellent spot for other flowers and plants the Eisenhowers received as gifts.  <br /> <br /> The vegetable gardens were worked primarily by Walter West and John Moaney, with occasional help from farmhands and even David Eisenhower for a few summers. They featured corn, tomatoes, spinach, kale, lettuce, radishes, cabbage, beets, peas, cucumbers, string beans, watermelon, potatoes, okra, and more. While the produce was used primarily for the Eisenhower farm, it was, on occasion, also used for meals at the White House or Camp David as well.  <br /> <br /> The small white building next to the grenhouses was a playhouse used by the Eisenhower grandchildren. General Eisenhower saw a similar playhouse elsewhere and requested one for his grandkids. It was added in 1956, and according to Ike, “The grandchildren are delighted with their new playhouse, and of course the rest of us get a great kick out of their earnest domestic efforts.”  </p>",

The home features a bedroom, a small bathroom, and a sitting room, with a porch offering tremendous views of the surrounding area. The bell on top of the guesthouse originated from the Pitzer Schoolhouse on Millerstown Road, which John and Barbara Eisenhower owned at the time. The Eisenhower grandchildren wanted the bell placed atop the guesthouse, and like many grandparents, Ike and Mamie agreed to the request of their beloved grandchildren. <br /> <br /> The guesthouse was used primarily as extra space for visiting friends and family. Perhaps the most famous visitor to stay here was Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery, the famed British general of World War II. In May 1957, President Eisenhower hosted Montgomery and took him on a tour of the Gettysburg battlefield. “Monty”, as he was often known, repaid the favor by getting Eisenhower into hot water with millions of Americans by criticizing the American generals at Gettysburg, especially Robert E. Lee.  </p>",

His inaugural presidential helicopter ride occurred in 1957, ushering in a new era of transportation for our nation’s chief executive. Eisenhower preferred using a helicopter as it saved him time in his trips from Washington, D.C. to his Gettysburg farm. A two-hour car ride to Gettysburg could be accomplished via helicopter in roughly 30 minutes.  <br /> <br /> The helipad consisted of a mowed section of grass. During Eisenhower’s time it was wide enough to accommodate two helicopters. In addition to mowing a landing area, two paths were mowed from the helipad—one leading to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/eisenhower-home.htm\">Eisenhower home</a>, and one leading towards the bank barn and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/secret-service-office.htm\">Secret Service office</a>. The Secret Service used portable lights to highlight the landing area, which was also illuminated by nearby lighting among the trees and a spotlight from the top window in the southern exterior wall of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/eisenhower-bank-barn.htm\">Eisenhower bank barn</a>.  <br /> <br /> President Eisenhower used his landing pad for both formal and informal visits. In May 1959, Eisenhower greeted Great Britain’s former Prime Minister Winston Churchill during a visit to Gettysburg at the helipad. Churchill and Eisenhower were old friends and allies from World War II, and though the former Prime Minister’s visit to the Eisenhower farm was brief, it was a warm reminder of the friendship between the two leaders—and between their two countries.  </p>",

The agents worked in three different 8-hour shifts. When in Gettysburg, the off-duty agents stayed in a local motel. The agents on duty covered the entrances to the farm, the Secret Service office, and the entrances and exits to the home itself. Inside the office, agents had access to the most up to date technology, including cameras to keep an eye on the property. The office also was used to store the nuclear launch codes in a secure location.  <br /> <br /> Agents found the Gettysburg landscape challenging as it was full of open spaces and adjacent to the Gettysburg battlefield, with hundreds of thousands of tourists passing nearby. Thus, they encouraged the closure of the nearby observation tower on the battlefield when the president was home. The Secret Service also worked hard to keep the president safe while on the local golf course, accompanying the president wherever he went.   <br /> <br /> In addition to the President and First Lady, John Eisenhower, his wife Barbara, and the four Eisenhower grandchildren also received Secret Service protection.</p>",

Alton Jones’s property predate the Eisenhower cattle operation, the one major piece of construction created by the partnership was the show barn. Constructed in 1957, the new barn was designed to not only house the cattle but to provide a facility where they could be groomed and prepped for showing. Farm Manager General Arthur Nevins and Herdsman Bob Hartley worked in close collaboration with the construction team, with Hartley choosing the location and the layout of the corrals surrounding the new barn.  <br /> <br /> While a typical day at the show barn revolved around the care and maintenance of the herd, the show barn also witnessed the visits of numerous foreign dignitaries and world leaders at the farm. President Eisenhower utilized the show barn as a diplomatic tool throughout his presidency and into retirement for “cattle diplomacy”. By showcasing what was essentially a personal hobby, President Eisenhower hoped to create a relaxed atmosphere allowing his guests to feel welcome and hopefully more at ease with him. This spot—combined with the president’s sunporch—provided a perfect setting for personal diplomacy here at the farm. </p>",

Alton Jones, a close friend of Ike’s and the owner of the adjacent farm to the south, provided the skeet range to General Eisenhower as a gift.  <br /> <br /> The skeet range provided an excellent spot for Eisenhower, Jones, and other friends to shoot targets. Eisenhower would sometimes invite the Secret Service agents to shoot targets with him, though some agents were reluctant to show off their marksmanship and potentially outshoot the president. The range saw most of its use during Eisenhower’s presidency. By the time of his retirement Ike did not frequent it as much.  </p>",

The original gate was installed during Eisenhower’s presidency, and the one in existence today appears much as it did in 1967. <br /> <br /> In 1954, the driveway was lined with fifty-three Norway Spruces, which were gifts to the Eisenhowers from Republican State Committees from U.S. states and territories. The trees were along both sides of the driveway with spacing of roughly 100 feet between them. Each had a small bronze plaque indicating which state or territory had provided it. The following year, crabapple trees were planted along the driveway as well, a birthday gift to the president from members of his cabinet.  <br /> <br /> In 1955, Eisenhower suffered the first of what would be several heart attacks during his lifetime. That fall, he spent several weeks at his Gettysburg farm recovering and regaining his strength. As part of his rehabilitation, the president took daily walks on his farm, especially up and down the front lane. After his walks, Ike would come back and report to Mamie which state or territory’s Norway Spruce tree he had gotten to that day, using the small bronze plaques to mark his signs of progress and recovery with familiar and beloved landmarks from their property.  </p>",

Isaac Armstrong may have constructed the building sometime in the 1790s, and by the time of his death in 1835, the home was part of a prosperous tannery. In 1954 the farm was purchased by W. Alton Jones, the president’s cattle partner, and become part of the Eisenhower show cattle operation. <br /> <br /> Initially farmhand Ivan Feaster lived in the house until his resignation in 1957. It was then that herdsman Bob Hartley and his family moved into the home. They would remain there until the show cattle operation ended in 1967. Today the building is the headquarters for the Eisenhower National Historic Site, housing the site’s administrative offices. </p>",

Historic documentation shows that roses were always intended to decorate the landscape around the Eisenhower home. The rose gardens were established by early 1955 and contained a wide variety of roses, many of which were gifts to the Eisenhowers.  <br /> <br /> One special variety of rose—called the “General Eisenhower” rose—was named after Ike. It was a gift from Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany. The “General Eisenhower” roses were planted in the north rose garden.   </p>",

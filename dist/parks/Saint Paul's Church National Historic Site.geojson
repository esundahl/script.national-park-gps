It has facilitated the spiritual lives of generations of local residents as an Episcopal house of worship until 1980.</p> <h3>Western Side</h3> <p>The simple, Georgian, vernacular style church was constructed as a community project utilizing local field-stone and brick, with the keystone, 1765, still visible over the door.<br /> Â </p> <h3>Symbology</h3> <p>The completion date of 1788, with initials of the chief mason, **CP**, can often be observed in the afternoon, depending on the light. Rows of unfilled scaffold holes remain from the 18th century. According to local tradition, **LV**, diagonally up from the keystone, represents Louis Vincent, a prominent parishioner who helped to save the bell at the start of the Revolutionary War. Increased wealth and a religious shift toward greater displays of symbols of Christianity led to the erection of the Victorian steeple in 1887. The copper cross replaced an earlier religious symbol knocked off by a hurricane in the early 1950s.</p>",

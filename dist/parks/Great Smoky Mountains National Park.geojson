This bridge is the only four-arch bridge in the park. The CCC was created by President Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s to help the economy and infrastructure of the country. The park had over 4,000 men living and working in 22 camps from 1933-1941. Their work included developing hiking trails, planting trees, and building roads and campgrounds. Some speculate that what the CCC accomplished in eight years would have taken today’s park staff over fifty years to complete.</p> <p paraeid=\"{2e4fd91d-04f1-46f9-8005-79e8db456da5}{25}\" paraid=\"1093215225\">“If you want to see their work, look around you.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{2e4fd91d-04f1-46f9-8005-79e8db456da5}{31}\" paraid=\"288016275\">Before the current bridge was built, trains traveled over a wooden bridge.

The cabins were built from 1910-1915 by well-known families from Knoxville. Uphill from here is “Society Hill”— these cabins were built between 1912-1922. The David Chapman House, built by one of the leaders of the national park movement, is the only cabin preserved.

It was replaced in 1928 with the gravel walkway you see today. The clubhouse served three meals a day. Listen closely and try to imagine hearing bells ringing as the clubhouse staff  “called” folks to dinner. The community always dressed in their best clothes as they walked the path towards the Appalachian Club. Daily activities included hunting, fishing, horse riding, swimming, and socializing. </p>",

        "notes": "Cable Mill Historic Area\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/cable-mill-historic-area.htm\n\nThe Cable Mill area contains many of the buildings typical of remote Appalachian farmsteads. The grist mill is on its original site. Other historic buildings in the complex were brought from elsewhere in the park. The blacksmith shop, though typical of old-time blacksmith shops in the Cove, was built in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The Cable Mill has become a symbol for the Cades Cove area of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. John P. Cable built his water-powered grist mill and sawmill around 1870. It was one of several in Cades Cove that served its upwards of 670 residents. Mills played an important role in people’s lives, and families often looked forward to “mill days.” A dam on Mill Creek directs water through a canal to the wooden flume that channels water onto the top of the mill wheel. This activates the mechanism for grinding corn with a mill stone. The same wheel powered a heavy reciprocating blade that cut logs. Such technologies made life easier for Cove residents. Many families had small “tub” mills that could grind enough for a family. However, mills like the one belonging to the Cables were larger and faster, if one was willing to give the miller a share of the grain. Many back-breaking steps required for traditional log cabin-building were removed with mills as well. <br /> <br /> Adjacent to the mill is the Gregg-Cable house built in 1879. This is the first and only remaining all-frame house in Cades Cove. All-frame houses were once popular in the cove but were removed after the park was created due to their more modern appearance. The Gregg-Cable house is believed to have been constructed using some of the earliest timber cut on the Cable Mill. A store was operated on the first floor by the Gregg family and later residents, Becky Cable and her brother, Dan Cable. Many of the products necessary for daily life could be purchased there without going to the larger markets of Maryville or Knoxville. Becky and Dan only ran the store for a few years before they sold the contents and turned it into a boarding house. Dan and his wife, Martha, were both ill and they along with their four children lived with and were supported by Becky. After Dan and Martha died, Becky raised their children, which is why she was known to many as “Aunt Becky.”<br /> <br /> A smokehouse, corn crib, barns, and sorghum mill stand in the Cable Mill area. Visitors can take advantage of programming here throughout the year. The mill is operated in warmer months. Sorghum-making demonstrations are conducted in the fall, and blacksmithing is done as staffing allows.  ",

        "notes": "Carter Shields Cabin\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/carter-shields-cabin.htm\n\nWhen Will Sparks built this cabin around 1880, he had no way of knowing it would still be standing nearly 150 years later and be one of the most photographed buildings in a national park. It’s easy to see the charm of this small cabin from the road, tucked behind a few trees in a forest clearing with a stream out back. This cabin, like the John Oliver cabin, is cozy and unassuming—one room with a fireplace, a staircase leading to the loft above, and a porch outside. Over the years, additions expanded the living space of the cabin’s occupants, and a barn and other outbuildings were added. At one time there was a chicken coop, garden, and cellar for storing foods.<br /> <br /> George W. \"Carter\" Shields, for whom the cabin is named, was one of a handful of owners over the years. Carter fought with the Union Army during the Civil War and was severely wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. His injury impacted the rest of his life, but he overcame it and shortly after the war married Lina Gregory and moved to Kansas. They returned to Cades Cove and purchased this property in 1910. The Shields would remain in this home for 11 years before selling it.<br /> <br /> Soon after this time, the property was acquired as part of the newly created Great Smoky Mountains National Park. As with most of the other buildings in Cades Cove, this cabin was returned to its “pioneer era” and stands as you see it today. Though the modern era of Cades Cove has no permanent residents, millions of visitors are drawn to this area each year for many of the same reasons as its original inhabitants—proximity to surrounding communities, flat land with scenic views, water, and abundant wildlife. The legacy of human history in Cades Cove will continue as long as people enjoy and care for this land as its past owners have done.",

When weather cooperates, it provides amazing view of the surrounding mountain scenery.<br /> <br /> Clingmans Dome Tower was constructed in 1959. It is a 45 foot high observation tower with a sweeping 375 feet long ramp for visitors to reach the tower. The Tower is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and played a significant role in the architectural history of the National Park Service. It is an prominent example of the National Park Service Modern architecture period, which broke away from the long-standing Rustic style of the NPS knows an 'parkitecture.'<br /> <br /> It is also significant as a representation of the National Park Service's Mission 66 program, which resulted in a significant change in National Park Service planning, management, and architecture. The Mission 66 program, which spanned from 1955 to 1966, resulted in the construction of hundreds of building and structures. Yet, of the many structures built during the program, only nine were towers. As one of the nine towers built during the program, Clingmans Dome Tower is an example of a comparatively rare Mission 66 structure type. It was also the model for two other later Mission 66 towers - Look Rock Tower in Great Smokey Mountains NP and Shark Valley Tower in Everglades NP. <br /> <br /> Check out the view from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/air/webcams.htm?site=grcd\">webcam</a> at Clingmans Dome and plan your visit to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/clingmansdome.htm\">Clingmans Dome Tower</a> today! <br />  ",

These included industrialists, politicians, lawyers, artists, professors, and businessmen, among others. W.B. Townsend, owner of the Little River Lumber Company, became a member and leased logging land to the club to create a hunting and fishing camp. Soon after, Knoxville families began building vacation homes along Jakes Creek. Between 1910 and 1935, almost 80 cabins were built. Before 1925, families arrived by trains (a 3-hour trip) operated by the lumber company. When the logging operations in the area ended in 1925, the railroad tracks were removed, and families began driving their cars to their vacation cabins. The tourist season typically stretched from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Cabin owners brought trunks of clothes and supplies to stay the entire summer. Many would also bring their servants to care for the children. </p> <p paraeid=\"{57177f9e-9629-44e9-860b-ba364cdd9db5}{64}\" paraid=\"1766794687\">“Some brought a servant with them, usually Black women who developed their own social life in the mountains.

The Dan Lawson house was originally constructed in 1856 using logs, but later additions were framed. Even later, the entire building was covered with siding. Viewing the house from the side offers a clear visual of these additions. The brick chimney, unusual for the time and locale, was built of bricks made on site. The small building closest to the house is a smokehouse; the other is a granary.<br /> <br /> Dan Lawson was postmaster of the Cove for over 25 years, and for many years the post office was in the center room of this building. The small room on the front porch with an interior window might have been where people picked up their mail. Another idea is that this room functioned as an office during Dan Lawson’s time as Justice of the Peace. This room likely started as a “stranger room” (see Elijah Oliver Place) and then was converted to a new use.<br /> <br /> Dan Lawson also operated a store and owned one of the largest tracts of land in Cades Cove. During the 1890s, Dan Lawson and other residents constructed a telephone line into Cades Cove. As a result, several homes in the Cove had telephones. Even residents without a telephone on their property could access the one at the Lawson store.<br /> <br /> The typical story of Cades Cove is of pioneer life, but the last residents, the Caughrons, left in 1999. They had an agricultural lease and helped the park maintain the open fields of the cove. Their home was to the left of the Dan Lawson place. None of the structures they used remain, except the barn which they had moved from the Cable Mill area when it was threatened with demolition. Today, to the left of this barn, you can still see an old apple tree and a handful of lilies that were once part of their garden—a reminder that though Cades Cove has changed much over the years, some things remain the same.",

Although he spent most of his life living in the cove, he did leave during the Civil War, relocating to Tuckaleechee Cove to escape attacks from Confederate supporters and rebel groups out of North Carolina. Attacks were devastating for the Cades Cove community. In 1850, Cades Cove had over 600 settlers, but the population plummeted to under 300 in the war era. Many settlers returned, but it took time for Cades Cove to recover to pre-war population levels.<br /> <br /> Elijah and his family did return to Cades Cove after the war and bought property in 1865 for a farmstead. The cabin that Elijah Oliver’s family lived in was a dog trot style cabin which consists of two cabins that were connected by a breezeway and shared a common roof. Along with the dog trot style cabin, Elijah Oliver’s homestead would eventually include a corn crib, smokehouse, springhouse, and barn. The springhouse was built over a trickling spring to ensure clean water for the family. The spring’s cool temperature was also harnessed to extend the life of perishables such as eggs, milk, and butter. The springhouse is a unique feature since it is the only one remaining in the cove.<br /> <br /> Another unique feature of the Elijah Oliver place is the stranger room. This room is located off the front porch and was built to house overnight visitors. The room allowed the family to accommodate visitors, but in an area separate from the family’s space. Stranger rooms were fairly common in the cove. The hospitable spirit that inspired their existence endures into modern times as visitors come to enjoy the stories and the legacies of the settlers that once lived here.</p>",

It is also the oldest. John, Lucretia, and their young daughter, Mary “Polly,” arrived and began settling in Cades Cove in 1818.<br /> <br /> Although the Olivers were the first permanent European-American settlers, Cherokee peoples had lived in this area for thousands of years. The Cherokee were present at the time of the Olivers’ arrival and had an active settlement. According to Lucretia Oliver, the family survived their first winter only because of the generosity of the Cherokee who provided them with food.<br /> <br /> John Oliver was a War of 1812 veteran and collier (charcoal maker) by trade. He lived in neighboring east Tennessee counties before the prospect of settlement in Cades Cove came to be. The cove was different in 1818 from how it looks today. When the Olivers arrived, it had not yet been extensively cleared for agriculture and was densely forested except for the west end of the cove which was swampland. The Olivers decided to settle on the drier east end of the cove.<br /> <br /> A well was dug for a reliable water source as the neighboring creek often dries in the summer. Fields were cleared for planting wheat and corn. Cattle were kept along nearby Abrams Creek. A barn with grain storage was constructed. A second cabin, the one that still stands today, was built in the 1820s just a few dozen yards from the original cabin (not standing today). A kitchen was added to the present cabin but has since been removed by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> Generations of Olivers lived on the homestead until the park was established over a hundred years later. Several descendants, including Elijah Oliver, branched out and settled elsewhere in Cades Cove, a testament to the family’s ties to this fertile valley.",

Rockefeller’s wife Laura. With only a budget of $20,000, and working in harsh winter conditions, Olmsted Brothers tasked partner Henry Hubbard with the design.<br /> <br /> Hubbard was tasked with transforming the “nose of a little hill” into a spiral of two terraces climbing up the hill’s slope. When it came to construction for the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, the Civilian Conservation Corps were commissioned, working until 1940.<br /> <br /> When development began, Hubbard created a clay model of two semicircular stone block terraces hugging the face of the hill, connected by steps leading to a lookout. Models were created at the request of a client and were almost immediately taken apart after completion of the design. After Hubbard created his model for the Spelman Memorial, he took a light and tracked the path of sunlight, to ensure that light shined on the memorial. This extra attention to detail is what helped make the Olmsted firm so prolific.",

The congregation can be dated back to 1830, with the first Methodist circuit riders visiting the cove in the early 1820s. Originally, services were held in homes until a log meeting house was built in 1840. The Methodists had a good relationship with the Primitive and Missionary Baptists, the latter of which used the log building for meetings and worship.</p> <p>As the larger Methodist Episcopal Church started to split in 1844 over the issue of slavery, the Methodists of Cades Cove were not immune, and began to break apart. One group split off, and in 1880 built the Hopewell Methodist Church near the south end of Hyatt Lane; but this building is no longer standing. After the Civil War, the original log meeting house soon became a schoolhouse, but was still used for worship.</p> <p>In 1902, the cove’s Methodists replaced the old log meeting house with the current frame building. Blacksmith and carpenter Rev. J.D. McCampbell was said to have built the structure for $115 in 115 days. McCampbell later served as the church’s minister for many years. The new building follows the design of having two entrances for the practice of dividing men and women up during services, but the Methodists in Cades Cove never followed that custom.</p> <p>Today, many of the cove’s early settlers like the Tiptons, Feezells, and Sparkses are buried at the Methodist Church’s cemetery. This cemetery is most likely the second oldest church burial plot in the cove and continues to be used by descendants. Like the other churches in Cades Cove, the Methodist Church is still occasionally used for worship.</p>",

Across the road from the building is Rich Mountain Road, a route used by those who lived near the middle of Cades Cove to go directly to Tuckaleechee (near modern-day Townsend).<br /> <br /> Missionary Baptist Church started in 1839 when thirteen members split from the Primitive Baptist Church based on differences in beliefs concerning missions, Sunday school, and temperance societies. The congregation remained small and initially met in homes and sometimes in the Methodist Church for Sunday school and worship. Like other churches in the cove, the Civil War disrupted meetings from October 1862 to 1865. There was an additional period from 1880 to 1889 in which no meetings were held with no record of reasoning. In 1889, a Sunday school was started, and the small congregation began meeting again.<br /> <br /> In 1893, evangelist Rev. Thomas Sexton led a successful revival for the Missionary Baptist Church that resulted in the congregation almost doubling in size, going from 22 members to 40 members. After this, J.M. Saults was called as the new pastor and the first physical building for the congregation was built in 1894. The first building was on Hyatt Hill near the present-day site, replaced in 1915 by the current building. A Sunday school was started in 1898 and continued to meet until 1944, 10 years after the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established.</p>",

Before it became the largest campground in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Elkmont was the second largest town in Sevier County. By 1918, the town had over 1,500 residents and was considered a “company town” built by the Little River Lumber Company and Railroad in 1908. The company owned almost 80,000 acres of what is now the national park. Elkmont’s strategic location (halfway between Clingmans Dome and the town of Townsend) made it economical to transport cut trees by railroad to the sawmill in Townsend, then off to markets around the world.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{54}\" paraid=\"815106061\">Standing at the present-day yield sign on your left, look down the road to your right where the walk-in tent sites are located. Using the photograph circa 1917/18, try to imagine Elkmont’s former Main Street or Rail Street where a single railroad track ran 18 miles from Townsend. The track was divided into three tracks for the short length of the town of Elkmont. (You are standing at the bottom right corner of the photo. The flat straight drive was built directly on the old railroad bed.) The town consisted of a commissary (company store), church, school, hotel, tavern, machine shop, and employee houses. Not long after the town opened, Little River Lumber Company leased the land east of Elkmont town to the Appalachian Club of Knoxville, and west of town to the Wonderland Club. </p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{122}\" paraid=\"646166563\">By 1925, the lumber company finished logging the area, pulled up all the rails, closed the town, and started logging the area known as Tremont.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{132}\" paraid=\"131947901\">It is hard to believe that just over 100 years ago this area was a bustling town of over 1,500 residents.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{23185c20-3379-4043-89e5-dfb12b4f28cc}{146}\" paraid=\"1744571511\">As you travel between stops, look for signs of the people who came before us, watch for distinct gaps in the forest which could indicate the route of an old railroad bed, or consider the size and type of trees around you.

Humans have been using the land in this area for thousands of years. The earliest artifact collected in the park is a lithic dated to 7000 BCE. Though they may not have built structures in Cades Cove that are present today, the impact of the Cherokee is felt throughout the cove. Many trails created by the Cherokee are still traveled by visitors hiking or driving today. One of these trails is now Rich Mountain Road which connected the cove to the Tuckaleechee area. Many settlers followed in the Cherokees’ footsteps and used this route and others to reach Cades Cove. The Cherokee, like settlers after them, cut logs for structures and fires. They cleared land for agriculture, and they hunted, foraged, and traded or bought what they didn’t grow themselves. In the early 1810-1820s, Sequoyah developed the Cherokee syllabary, a written version of the Cherokee language.<br /> <br /> The Cherokee name for Cades Cove is Tsiyahi, “Otter Place.” Otters were found throughout the many creeks and streams in the cove, but they were extirpated from this area in the 1920s, after being hunted and trapped for their valuable pelts. The park reintroduced them in the 1980s and they have made a remarkable comeback. Today they are often seen near Abrams Falls. The name “Abrams” stems from Cherokee Chief Abram or Abraham, known as Ooskuah to the Cherokee. The origin of the name “Cade” also likely came from Cherokee Chief Cade (or Kade) from this area. A “cove” is a flat valley between mountains or ridges.<br /> <br /> Most of the Cherokee living in the Southeastern United States were forcibly removed starting with the Indian Removal Act in 1830 which offered territory in Oklahoma in exchange for land in this region. In 1835 the Treaty of New Echota ceded most of the Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi to the federal government. These actions resulted in the “Trail of Tears” in 1938, where 16,000 Cherokee were forced to walk 1,200 miles west. Thousands died in the process. The Eastern Band of the Cherokee who live on the Qualla Boundary adjacent to the park today are the descendants of the few who remained, escaped, or those who returned. A visit to Cherokee, North Carolina offers visitors an opportunity to learn more about Cherokee history and culture.<br /> <br /> Typically, when a national park or protected area is created, many spaces that people lived in and used are returned to nature. In Cades Cove, this idea is blended with historic preservation. Cades Cove has far fewer buildings than it did at peak settlement around 1900 with over 700 residents. Instead of agricultural fields, today there are grasses and native plants. The cove is actively managed using mowing and prescribed fire to keep trees and woody shrubs at bay. If the cove wasn’t managed this way, it would revert to forest in most areas and look very similar to the woods found throughout the park.</p>",

Church meetings were held in the homes of members until the fall of 1832, when a log building was constructed for meetings and services.<br /> <br /> Shortly after, disagreement among members caused a split in the church. In 1839, 13 members left to start Missionary Baptist Church due to disagreement over foreign mission work. To reflect the difference in opinion, Cades Cove Baptist Church assumed the name Primitive Baptist Church in 1841 and has gone by that name since. The churches in Cades Cove were not isolated in this conflict. Baptist churches all over the South were divided on the issue of mission work in the early nineteenth century. In 1887, after the split, members of Primitive Baptist Church constructed the classic white frame building you see today to replace the original log meeting house. The church was built by hand, and the fingerprints of those that worked on its construction can be seen on the ceiling when inside the church.<br /> <br /> Running and maintaining the church required labor and perseverance, but this was a worthwhile endeavor for the residents of the cove who were able to celebrate and affirm their faith. The church created community, upheld social responsibilities, and kept families informed. Of the churches in the cove, the Primitive Baptist Church maintained the most members and social influence. The church was a vital part of life for many residents, but during the Civil War, life in the cove changed dramatically. The congregation ceased meeting, which was upsetting for residents and explained in church records by the statement, “we was union people and the Rebels was too strong here in Cades Cove.” In the cemetery behind Primitive Baptist Church, you can find the grave of Russell Gregory, who was murdered by Confederate soldiers from North Carolina.<br /> <br /> Although Great Smoky Mountains National Park was officially established in 1934, members of Primitive Baptist did not stop meeting at the church until the 1960s. After formally closing the church in the 1960s, the congregation continued to maintain the building and the cemetery into the 1970s through a Special Use Permit. The church is often still used for religious events or ceremonies. The cemetery at Primitive Baptist is the oldest cemetery in the cove, and descendants of early settlers such as the Olivers, Shieldses, and Cables, are still being laid to rest in it today.</p>",

With a single track and mountain terrains, it was not easy to turn one of these trains around. To address this, the logging companies developed the “turning Y” to allow trains to return easily and safely to Townsend. Today, we consider this a “three-point turn.”</p> <p paraeid=\"{a4fd7683-cfcb-461f-98be-b3b0a4f74d62}{52}\" paraid=\"1511677970\">From a birds-eye view of this spot 100 years ago, you would see an upside-down “Y\". The parking lot at the beginning of the nature trail is one “leg” of the “Y\". You can see the other leg on the nature trail to the right after you cross the wooden bridge.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a4fd7683-cfcb-461f-98be-b3b0a4f74d62}{96}\" paraid=\"603899587\">The train maneuvered past the “Y\", backed up one leg which extended over a mile, then returned via the other leg, thus turning the train in the opposite direction.  A “Y” is sometimes spelled “wye,\" and many were located throughout the logging areas of the Smokies. That is how the Townsend Wye got its name.</p>",

        "notes": "Tipton Place\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/tipton-place.htm\n\n<p>Tipton Place was part of a 640-acre land parcel obtained by William “Fighting Billy” Tipton under the Tennessee Land Grant in the 1820s. William’s land eventually covered most of the valley floor through other grants, and while he never lived in Cades Cove, he is the first recorded legal landowner. William sold his land to friends and relatives including Colonel Hamp Tipton, his grandson, who built the two-story cabin in the 1870s. Hamp Tipton’s daughters, Lucy and Lizzie, lived in the cove into adulthood and were schoolteachers. In 1878, the home was rented to James McCaulley as he built his own homestead that included blacksmith and carpentry shops. In 1895, Hamp Tipton passed away and his estate was sold to Reverend William H. Oliver, whose family lived there until the land was purchased for the park in 1931. The site is sometimes referred to as the Tipton-Oliver homestead in reference to both families that lived there.<br /> <br /> The homestead of Hamp Tipton included the two-story cabin he built, barn, double-pen corn crib, blacksmith shop, smokehouse, woodshed, springhouse, apple drying house, and bee apiary. Apiaries were sometimes referred to as bee gums, as early beehives were kept in hollowed out Blackgum trees (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>). The homestead now sits on 2.2 acres. The framed buildings including the springhouse and apple drying house, as well as framed additions to the cabin and a post-1900 barn, were all removed to maintain a sense of historical continuity and preserve a specific era of life in the cove.<br /> <br /> The lefthand door on the front of the house leads into the living room with three paned windows and a fireplace. To the left of the fireplace are stairs to the sleeping loft on the second floor. The righthand door leads into the main bedroom, which has two, small paned windows. The back room of the house was once the kitchen. This room has two windows and two doors; one door leads to a small porch and the other leads to the back of the property. The kitchen has two holes close together on one of the walls where a telephone was attached. This connected to the blacksmith shop on the homestead as well as a store which was located across the road.<br /> <br /> One of the most unique parts of the Tipton Place is the cantilever barn which was reconstructed in 1968. Cantilever barns have overhangs, or cantilevers, used to store hay for easy access, with spaces for livestock pens, grain cribs, and equipment storage underneath. This allowed farmers to maximize the amount of storage possible for their livelihoods, while keeping livestock and equipment dry from the rainy eastern Tennessee weather. Cantilever barns can be found across the southeastern United States, but Sevier and Blount counties in Tennessee have the highest number of cantilever barns in the world.</p>",

        "name": "Whitehead Place",
        "notes": "Whitehead Place\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/whitehead-place.htm\n\n<p>A short drive down Forge Creek Road leads to the Henry Whitehead Place, a uniquely built home and the last example of a sawn log house in the park. The story of this home begins with the smaller cabin in the back. This cabin is simple, but visitors today might notice the ‘granny hole’ by the fireplace. It provided the person tending the fire with a window outside. This one room cabin was built roughly and quickly out of necessity for Matilda Shields by her brothers in 1881. Matilda and her young son were abandoned by her husband during a visit to see family in Cades Cove. Around the same time, Henry Whitehead lost his wife and became a single father to three young daughters. He and Matilda married in 1887, and he built the larger home in the front between 1895-1898.<br /> <br /> This home is often mistaken for a frame structure because it is built of logs that were run through a sawmill and “squared up,” resulting in a smooth, consistent appearance. You can compare this construction to the more common hewn log structure of the original cabin where logs were roughly flattened by hand. Since the logs were irregular shapes, the spaces between the logs had to be filled, or chinked, with mud or clay. With a sawn log building like the Henry Whitehead cabin, the logs fit together so well that almost no chinking was required resulting in a well-insulated home. These two cabins are connected by a covered passageway and serve as an architectural link between the different construction types in Cades Cove.<br /> <br /> The outbuilding next to the cabin is a smokehouse, one of five remaining in Cades Cove today. The floor of the smokehouse was often kept as dirt, on which the fire could be built. Freshly cut oak or hickory wood was often used, but water could also be added to older wood to increase smoke production. Smokehouses have interior shelves on which the smoked hams and other meats could be stored for later use. In Cades Cove, the meat was almost always pork because hogs were inexpensive to feed and easy to raise. Smokehouses were typically constructed close to the house for convenience and to provide protection from bears which were attracted by the smell of smoked meats. The structures needed to be sturdy and well-sealed to keep out wildlife, but also to keep in the smoke used for preservation. Storing food safely from wildlife has always been an important challenge and is one people still face today.<br /> <br /> The Henry Whitehead place stands alone today, but during its occupation, homes lined Forge Creek Road. There were other large sawed-log houses built by Frederick Shields and James V. Cable, but unfortunately, these buildings were not preserved. This road also leads to another road, Parson Branch Road, which you can drive during the warmer months. This one-way, unpaved, high clearance road leads to Highway 129 and travels through the former area of the Chestnut Flats community. Return to the Cades Cove Loop Road via Forge Creek Road to continue the Auto Tour.</p>",

This area preserves 18 structures, two cemeteries, and over 100 years of stories, memories, and dreams that represent the last evidence of the tourism history of the Smokies. This area was first settled in the mid-1800s by descendants of Gatlinburg families. By the early 1900s, most of the land was bought by the second largest lumber company in the area and eventually became the first piece of property purchased to create Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Most of the cabin owners in Elkmont Historic District not only supported the national park movement, but also donated money to help buy land to create the park.</p> <p paraeid=\"{3c31ed00-873f-41a6-a02e-d594f21019fb}{165}\" paraid=\"1285606826\">The important stories of this area were almost lost, but considerable time, research, and back-breaking work preserved this piece of park history. Please help us preserve and protect this and other historic areas of the park by respecting the memories of the people who lived here and the work of the park’s preservation staff.

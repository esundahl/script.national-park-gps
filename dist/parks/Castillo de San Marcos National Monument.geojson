Concurrently, rainwater percolating down through the mowed grounds has undermined the wall as the water seeps out into the bay. These forces have helped destabilize the historic seawall and make its long-term future uncertain.<br /> <br /> In 2011 the National Park Service facilitated the construction of a living seawall 25 feet eastward of the original seawall. The living seawall is constructed of coquina boulders. (Coquina is the same stone from which the Castillo is built, which has stood strong for more than three centuries.) Over time, sand and sediment will wash through gaps in the new seawall and build up between the two walls, which will help stabilize the historic seawall. This new substrate will also create a habitat for oysters, marsh grass, and black mangroves, which will in turn attract marine life such as crabs, shrimp, and fish. At the same time, the coquina boulders and the oysters that adhere to them will act as a breakwater, reflecting pummeling wave energy away from the vulnerable historic seawall. It is hoped that the creation of natural habitat will help preserve a historic resource for many years to come.</p>",

The next casemate was the ordinance supply room where tools and materials for serving the cannons were kept and issued. The small narrow room once housed a ladder to the gun deck to make transporting gunpowder quicker. The tiny doorway you see here is the entrance to the original gunpowder magazine. The Spanish realized soon after construction that the little room was too humid to store powder, so they used it for storage and as a trash pit during the 51 days of the 1702 Siege. Eventually, a new magazine was built in the northwest corner. When the Spanish renovated the Castillo in the mid-1700s, the old magazine and the ladder room were sealed, not to be opened again until 1833, when the U.S. Army was performing their own modifications. <br /></p>",

During peacetime, soldiers would assemble here to drill with their muskets. As the common soldier of the 18th century was illiterate, musket and cannon procedures had to be learned by repetitive drilling, not by reading instruction manuals. Once the men had their drills committed to muscle memory, they would not forget them during the heat of battle. It was also here that the citizens of St. Augustine could take refuge when the town was under siege. In this sense, the Castillo was a true castle, built to protect the entire community in times of war. In 1702, the city was attacked by the English, and roughly 1,500 soldiers and civilians were packed into the Castillo for 51 days! They brought materials from their homes to set up tents and rough lean-to's for shelter inside the exposed courtyard. They could not take refuge in the rooms themselves, as they were filled with the supplies necessary to feed and defend everyone.</p>",

The fort's complex shape meant a battery of cannons on the gun deck could create interlocking fields of fire.<br /><br />Low and flat on the landscape, star-shaped forts used an obstacle course of defenses. Diamond-shaped protruding corners called bastions created crossfire to repel the enemy. From the bastions and curtain wall, cannon fire could deter or engage an advancing army. A wide ditch at the base of the fort lacked cover for invaders, allowing musket fire to rain down from above. Thick fort walls and a rising slope deflected incoming cannonballs.

        "notes": "Florida: Castillo de San Marcos National Monument\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/florida-castillo-de-san-marcos-national-monument.htm\n\n<p>The Castillo de San Marcos, in St. Augustine, Florida, serves as the oldest masonry fortification in the United States. Fortifications were built as a defensive wall or barrier to prevent potential attacks. During the height of the modern Civil Rights Movement, St. Augustine was selected in 1964 by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) as a target city for civil rights activities. Activists obtained permits from the National Park Service to use the Castillo as a meeting place for demonstrations.<br /> <br /> In early 1963, local members of the NAACP developed a desegregation plan. NAACP leaders Fannie Fullerwood and Elizabeth Hawthorne wrote letters to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. The letter urged Johnson to cancel his trip to dedicating a historic Spanish landmark. Johnson responded, stating that he would not participate in segregated functions. President John F. Kennedy was also the recipient of a letter from the local NAACP in May 1963, advocating against a federal grant of $350,000 intended for the Castillo’s Quadricentennial. All members of the Quadricentennial board were said to be white persons and were unsympathetic to issues facing the Black residents of St. Augustine.<br /> <br /> On June 25, formal demonstrations began with Black teenagers of the NAACP's Youth Council picketing the local Woolworths and the St. Augustine Civic Center. The next day, 25 teenagers conducted sit-ins at Woolworths, McCrory's, and Service Drugs. White community members did not respond well to the peaceful demonstrations. Youth council leader Robert Hayling was depicted as a violent extremist, which garnered direct opposition from Mayor Joseph Shelley. By 1964, the Ku Klux Klan had begun a campaign of violence and intimidation. Shootings, clashes of violence during protests, and chaotic court cases nearly destroying the peaceful strides of the NAACP. Officials of the local NAACP realized that white militants were trying to seize the initiative. It was time to seek help from outside the city of St. Augustine.<br /> <br /> In March of 1964, Robert Hayling and other Black local leaders met with the aides of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the SCLC annual state meeting held in Orlando, Florida. The Black leaders from St. Augustine were able to convince Rev. C.T. Vivian to visit their town and see the conditions for himself. The SCLC watched events unfold in St. Augustine from July, and after visits with Vivian, they decided that their involvement could strengthen the community. The SCLC anticipated starting their St. Augustine campaign during the week of Easter, which gave white Northern college students a chance to participate. The inclusion of whites was an important strategy within itself, showing positive examples of integration. Hosea Williams coordinated the campaign, consisting of sit-ins, marches, meetings, and demonstrations. Each strategy had the common goal of placing a national microscope on years of oppression and convoluted race relations.<br /> <br /> Several of the meetings were held on the grounds of Castillo de San Marcos, for which permits were obtained from the NPS. The national park grounds served as a safe assembly place for activists of all backgrounds. The police department and St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office failed to protect activists. Four of the local Sheriff's deputies were known active Ku Klux Klan members. On national park property, however, local law enforcement would not have authority over the activists. The successes of the movement in St. Augustine helped to convey the importance of passing a sweeping Civil Rights Act, and in July of that same year, The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson.<br /> <br /> The Castillo de San Marcos National Monument in Florida became part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> in June 2021.<br /> <br /> <i>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private elements.</i></p>",

Any ships entering the inlet faced the fort head on, unable to deploy their guns broadside. The strategic location kept marauding pirates and attacking British warships at bay. During the 1740 British siege, ships from Cuba used the inlet at the southern end of Anastasia Island to resupply the town. After the siege, knowing enemies could also use the inlet, the Spanish built Fort Matanzas to protect St. Augustine's back door.</p>",

        "notes": "Gun Deck Views\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/gun-deck-views.htm\n\n<p>Welcome to the gun deck! The Castillo de San Marcos is one of the tallest buildings in town, which means it's a great place from which to view the skyline of the Ancient City. Take time to stroll clockwise around the gun deck and learn about some of our local landmarks.</p> <h3>Anastasia Island</h3> <p>From the top of the stairs, you are looking east towards Anastasia Island, a 15-mile-long barrier island that protects the mainland from wave and storm action. For a short period of time, the first settlers of St. Augustine tried to move their community to the island, but the dynamic nature of the land made it impossible. When the British attacked from Georgia in 1740, James Oglethorpe set up a 40-gun cannon battery directly across the bay from the Castillo and bombarded it for nearly a month.</p> <h3>Water Battery & Shot Furnace</h3> <p>As you look down from the east wall, you will see an area known as the water battery. In the 1840s, the U. S. Army filled in the eastern side of the moat, installed large cannons along the seawall, and built the furnace for creating red-hot cannonballs to fire at wooden ships. The cannons were mounted on the granite blocks near the seawall, and the half-circle tracks enabled them to pivot almost 180 degrees.</p> <h3>Ravelin</h3> <p>This triangular structure stands seperate from the front entrance of the fort. It shielded the fort's weakest point. The wooden drawbridge, from enemy fire. It was never finished as planned. If completed, the outer wall would have been five feet higher, with embrasures for cannon and a powder magazine. The drawbridge here and the main drawbridge are both working reconstructions. The ravelin bridge would have been secured each night at sunset; the main bridge was secured only when the fort was under attack.</p> <h3>St. Augustine Lighthouse</h3> <p>To the st is the St. Augusoutheastine Lighthouse with its distinctive red top and black & white spiral-striped tower. It was finished in 1874 and replaced an old Spanish coquina watchtower that had been adapted for use as a lighthouse. Lit by its original first order Fresnel lens, the lighthouse still serves as an aid to navigation for boats at sea. Visitors can climb the tower for a spectacular view of the Ancient City!</p> <h3>St. Augustine Inlet</h3> <p>As you stand near the bell tower and look northwest, you can look out the St. Augustine inlet to the Atlantic Ocean. The original inlet to the Matanzas Bay was closer to where the lighthouse stands today, and anyone trying to bring a ship into the harbor had to navigate around the barrier islands and tricky sandbars, giving the city added protection. The natural inlet filled in over time, making it necessary for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to cut the current one in 1940.</p> <h3>Bridge of Lions</h3> <p>Connecting downtown St. Augustine and Anastasia Island is the Bridge of Lions, named for the Carrara marble lions guarding the west side of the bridge. Construction began in 1925 at the height of Florida's first land boom and was completed two years later. After decades of wear and tear, the bridge was taken apart, restored piece by piece, and reassembled in a 4-year rehabilitation project that was completed in 2010.</p> <h3>First National Bank Building</h3> <p>Directly south of the Castillo, you can see St. Augustine's first and only \"skyscraper!\" The building was completed in 1927 and has been owned by several different banks over the years; it was converted to a private event venue in 2014. It remains the only building of its kind in town, because St. Augustine now has a height limit of 35 feet for new construction.</p> <h3>Cathedral Basilica</h3> <p>To the right of the bank building is the bell tower and steeple of the Cathedral Basilica, the oldest church in Florida. Though it was built in the 1790s, its congregation was established in 1565 with the founding of St. Augustine, making it the oldest Christian congregation in the United States. The previous church was destroyed by fire, and the current building was gutted by fire in 1887, after which it was renovated and the bell tower was added.</p> <h3>Flagler College</h3> <p>The matching towers and brick smokestack visible to the southwest are part of Flagler College, formerly the Ponce de Leon Hotel. The hotel was opened in 1888 by railroad tycoon Henry Flagler as a luxury winter resort for his wealthy northern friends, beginning St. Augustine's \"golden age\" of tourism. It was used as barracks by the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II. Declining visitor numbers caused the hotel to close in 1967, but it re-opened a year later as Flagler College, now a 4-year, private liberal arts college of about 2,800 students.</p> <h3>Memorial Presbyterian Church</h3> <p>The green dome to the right of the college belongs to Memorial Presbyterian Church, built by Henry Flagler in honor of his daughter Jennie Louise, who died of complications following childbirth. She and her child, as well as Flagler himself and his first wife, are laid to rest in a mausoleum inside the church. The design was inspired by St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, Italy, and it is well known for its beautiful stained glass windows.</p> <h3>Cubo Line</h3> <p>As you look down from the west wall of the Castillo, you will see a replica of the Cubo Line, one of the walls that once encircled St. Augustine. When the English attacked the city in 1702, they failed to take the fort, but they burned the city to the ground as they left. To keep this from happening again, the Spanish built walls to protect their homes. The Cubo Line went half a mile west to the San Sebastian River. Another wall, the Rosario Line, bordered the west edge of town, near where Cordova Street is today. The walls were composed of earth and palm logs and had a shallow moat along the outside of it.</p> <h3>Visitor Information Center</h3> <p>The St. Augustine Visitor Information Center and parking garage are visible to the northwest of the fort. The VIC was built by the Works Progress Administration in 1935 and used as a community center until the city began using it for visitor orientation in the 1950s. The garage behind the VIC opened in 2006 and offers convenient parking 24 hours a day, year-round.</p> <h3>Great Cross</h3> <p>The large cross to the north of the Castillo stands on the grounds of Mission Nombre de Dios and marks the place where historians believe Pedro MenÃ©ndez de AvilÃ©s, the founder of St. Augustine, came ashore on September 8, 1565, and claimed this land for Spain and the Catholic Church. The Great Cross stands 208 feet tall and was dedicated on September 8, 1965, to commemorate the city's 400th birthday. Today, the mission grounds also contain a church, a museum, and a shrine to the Virgin Mary.</p>",

Eventually, a new magazine was built in the northwest corner. When the Spanish renovated the Castillo in the mid-1700s, the old magazine and the ladder room were sealed, not to be opened again until 1833, when the U.S. Army was performing their own modifications. <br /></p>",

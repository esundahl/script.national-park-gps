        "notes": "Building X\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/building-x.htm\n\nIn January 1930, George Washington Birthplace National Monument was created as a unit of the National Park Service. At the same time the park was created, the Wakefield National Memorial Association was working to preserve the landscape of George Washington's childhood. Among the Association's plans was to build a Memorial House worthy of the first president. <br /> <br /> During the building of the Memorial House, the National Park Service located a foundation yards away from where the Memorial House was built. The NPS waited until the completion of the Memorial House before further investigation of the foundation was made. When the foundation was finally opened up a few years later, many artifacts were discovered, leading some to speculate that this was the original location of George Washington's Birthhouse. The foundation was named Building X, due to the uncertainty of what it truly represented.<br /> <br /> Another archeological project was completed here in the 1970s. Despite no new evidence to state that the site was where the birthhouse had stood, the NPS began to refer to this location as the definitive ruins of the birthhouse. Why the change?<br /> <br /> Timing. In 1976, the nation would be celebrating its bicentennial year. Pressure was on to identify the location of the actual birthhouse. The birthplace of the first president of the nation could not have the location of the original birthhouse be unknown. Therefore, Building X, without any new evidence of its significance, became the location of the birthhouse.<br /> <br /> Over the next 35 years, park interpretive staff referred to the area as the birthhouse. However, in the early 21st century, with a more thorough understanding of colonial American archeology, park staff and archeological teams conducted an investigation into past excavations done at the site. A reassessment of the earlier findings led to doubts that Building X truly was the location of Washington's birthhouse. <br /> <br /> Two more significant events in the history of the location are quickly approaching; the centennial of George Washington Birthplace National Monument in 2030, and George Washington's Tercentenary (300th birthday) in 2032. Will the location of the original birthhouse be resolved by then?<br /> <br />  ",

To protect the monument, it was surrounded by an iron ornamental fence and a gate.<br /> <br /> The monument became a destination visit for many travelers. Thousands of visitors, from America, Europe, and Asia paid their respects to George Washington by visiting the monument. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt came down from Washington, D.C. on a day visit. Roosevelt noted:<br />   \"...I spent about four hours ashore, taking [my] lunch and walking up to the monument which marks where the house stood in which Washington was born. It was a simple shaft.\"<br /> <br /> In the late-1920s, the Wakefield National Memorial Association formed to commemorate the landscape at George Washington's birthplace. The group decided to build a house as a memorial to Washington on the same spot where the monument stood. Many complained that moving the monument would be too costly, since the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, and that moving the monument from the original birthhouse location would lessen its importance.<br /> <br /> Despite the objections, in 1931, the monument was removed from its original base. It was transported in pieces by carts and reinstalled at the park entrance on a new base which added five feet to the overall height of the monument. The original design was also changed with the words \"Washington's Birthplace\" and the years of its installation removed from the monument.<br /> <br /> The monument is now the first landmark that visitors to the park see. ",

At George Washington Birthplace, the National Park Service and the Wakefield National Memorial Association both had ideas for the garden's layout.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service landscape architects proposed a garden that would be divided into two sections and filled with period specific plants, surrounded by a brick walk and boxwoods that descended from original Washington hedges. <br /> <br /> The Wakefield National Memorial Association planned a much different garden. The group wanted to restore the \"old-fashion flower garden,” they believed had existed during the Washington period of occupation and to place seating areas throughout the garden to use for relaxation and reflection.<br /> <br /> When work commenced on the garden in 1931, the garden took on more of the National Park Service's vision, however, the Wakefield National Memorial Association also made contributions to the overall appearance of the space, including adding a sundial in a prominent location.<br /> <br /> Over ninety years later, the Colonial Revival Garden is one of the most visited locations in the park and is maintained by the Northern Neck Master Gardeners, who keep the garden looking as beautiful as when it was created.",

        "notes": "The Memorial House Museum\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-memorial-house-museum.htm\n\nIn June of 1923, a group of public-spirited women met in the home of wealthy socialite Josephine Wheelwright Rust, a descendant of the Washington Family, to discuss plans to develop George Washington's birthplace for the anniversary of his 200th birthday in 1932. During this meeting, the Wakefield National Memorial Association (WNMA) was born and Rust became the group's president. As president, Rust's vision was to build from scratch a \"Memorial House\" at the place of Washington's birth and surround it with the appearances of an 18th century plantation environment. This romantic, but unrealistic vision would create a series of challenges to the entire development of the Memorial Area and the Memorial House Museum.<br /> <br /> Rust initiated her plan by approaching Congress for funding to build the house. Congress agreed to the request and sent instructions to build a house as close as possible to the originial design. With no surviving images of Washington's birthhouse to use as inspiration, it is rumored that Rust decided to base the house on the architecture of local colonial structures that she had known growing up, including her childhood home, Twiford, still located in Westmoreland County today. Rust's \"Memorial House\" would not resemble the birthhouse of George Washington as it would be much larger and grander than the 1732 home. <br /> <br /> Rust was determined to place the Memorial House at the same location of the monument the War Department had placed in 1896. Although the monument stood on grounds that were reputedly the location of the birthhouse, there were many who doubted that it was the actual location. Moving the monument was also costly, and seemed to some to be a frivolous expense, considering the nation was in the midst of the Great Depression. Nonetheless, Rust perservered. The funds to move the monument arrived, and it was removed from its existing base, loaded on carts in pieces, and installed on a new base at the entrance to the park. <br /> <br /> With the arrival of the National Park Service (NPS), who arrived after the creation of George Washington Birthplace National Monument in January 1930, Rust found challenges with her ideas for not only the Memorial House, but the Colonial Revival Garden, and the buildings and layout of the Memorial Area. <br /> <br /> Rust's plans for the Memorial House Museum went forward, and the house was completed in the summer of 1931, in time for the Bicentennial of Washington's birth. On June 26, 1931, Rust died, only four days after turning over the deed for the property to the National Park Service. A tribute service was held for her on February 11, 1932, in the Memorial House Museum with many WNMA members in attendance. On May 14, 1932, the Memorial House Museum was officially opened by the National Park Service. ",

        "notes": "The Rockefeller Barn\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-rockefeller-barn.htm\n\n<p>Industrialist and philanthropist, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. was a major benefactor in the creation of George Washington Birthplace National Monument. He purchased 275 acres and held the land in trust for a matching donation by the Wakefield National Memorial Association. Rockefeller’s philanthropy at the birthplace did not stop once the land was turned over to the National Park Service in 1930s.<br /> <br /> In May 1937, Rockefeller offered to donate three of his retired carriage horses – one Morgan stallion, Gipsey King, and two mares, Minerva and Nunda. Superintendent Philip Hough agreed, with the hopes of breeding the Morgan stallion to produce saddle mounts for mounted rangers at other parks within the National Park Service. After discussing the idea with the NPS, Hough secured a promise that a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp, already working at nearby Westmoreland State Park, would construct a horse barn, paddock, and fencing, if the horses were donated.<br /> <br /> By July of the same year, Rockefeller had sent the horses on their way to the park, before the barn had even been built. Concerns had risen during the months before the horses arrived about disturbing archeological resources where the barn was to be built. This concern had delayed the planning and building of the barn. But with the horses en route, the NPS proceeded with plans to build the horse barn in the historic area core.<br /> <br /> Construction of the horse barn continued throughout the winter of 1937 and by February 1938, the project had been completed.<br /> <br /> Hough’s plan to breed the horses appears to have met with some success in the early years as three colts, Wakefield Duke, Black Baron, and Gipsey Chief, sired by the stallion, Gipsey King, were sent to Yellowstone a few years later.<br /> <br /> As the country struggled economically due to World War II, the park’s care and maintenance of the Rockefeller horses were no longer a priority and the plan of breeding the Morgan horses ended. While this was the end of the Rockefeller Barn's usage as a horse breeding facility, it was not the end of the vision here at the park; it was revived in 1968.Today, the Rockefeller Barn is utilized to support the park's agricultural program. </p>   <p>In 1968, Mrs. Richard M. Colgate, wife to the Colgate toothpaste magnate himself, visited George Washington Birthplace National Monument with an interest in donating funds to support a training station for horses. Mrs. Colgate enjoyed her visit and with the backing of the National Park Service, construction began on the Colgate Morgan Horse Farm. The National Park Service already had a facility built for training Morgan horses at Point Reyes National Seashore, but NPS Director George Hartzog felt that there were not enough horses to meet demand. Hartzog envisioned a bi-coastal system that provided horses for eastern parks, particularly for the U.S. Park Police in the Washington metropolitan area.</p> <p>The following year, the Colgate’s dedicated two stallions, eight brood mares, a show mare, and a gelding to the park. Former First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson, also attended the dedication ceremony. The dream was not so long lasting. Today, the former Colgate Morgan Horse Barn serves as the maintenance building for the park.</p>",

But by the late 19th century, the old \"family vault\" had become a decayed ruin, with the burial vault sunken into the ground, and worn and broken gravestones surrounding it.<br /> <br /> Restoration and preservation efforts at the burial ground began in 1906, ten years after the obelisk was placed to honor the birth site of George Washington. Funded by the Virginia chapter of the Society of Colonial Dames of America, Washington descendants cleaned up the gravestones and enclosed them with a block wall and an ornate iron gate. <br /> <br /> By the time the Wakefield National Memorial Association formed in 1923, the burial ground was again in disrepair. One of the group's primary goals was to \"...rescue from decay and preserve the old family vault and burial ground which is in a most neglected condition.\"<br /> <br /> The burial ground restoration effort became another place of contention between the Association, their architect, and the National Park Service. Concerned that the Association's plan for the burial ground was contemporary and expensive, the NPS wanted to pay homage to the ancestors in a \"...simple, typical Colonial graveyard.\" In the end, the design chosen came down to cost, with the National Park Service's cheaper option being selected. Restoration appears to have been completed in 1931, just before the official opening of the park. <br /> <br /> Today, the burial ground stands silent; as a reminder of the efforts to remember the lineage of George Washington at the place of his birth. ",

Manning</a> had the cabin built in 1905 for use as a mountain summer home. It was the first such retreat built in the Rincon Mountains.</p> <p>The cabin was built using pack horses and wagons to transport materials to the site. Trees for the cabin came from the immediate vicinity. The log structure contained a living room with a fireplace, a kitchen, two bedrooms, and two small bunk rooms. The cabin also housed a piano, brought up from the Rincon Valley via the wagon road.</p> <p>The Manning family used the cabin as a summer home from mid-summer 1905 to mid-1907. In 1907, the area became part of the Coronado National Forest. For several subsequent years, Manning leased the land from the Forest Service but did not use the cabin again.</p> <p>The historical importance of the cabin was formally recognized in 1975, when it was added to the <a href=\"https://focus.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/75000169\">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

There is limited parking for large vehicles. <br /> <br /> Tabitha Jane and Elijah Cutler Behunin were two of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/learn/historyculture/pioneer-settlers.htm\">early settlers</a> to file a homestead claim around the Fremont River and Sulphur Creek. Even at this time, the Latter-Day Saint pioneers recognized that this land was useful for “ordinary farming, [but] most valuable for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/learn/historyculture/orchards.htm\">fruit raising</a>.”<br /> <br /> Elijah and his family of 15 built this small sandstone cabin near the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/learn/nature/desert-water.htm#rivers\">Fremont River</a> in 1883, but only lived in it for about a year. It was not an easy place to homestead. The crops they planted were washed out by flash floods, and the cabin was only large enough for Elijah, Tabitha Jane, and their youngest children. The older boys slept in a sandstone alcove, while the older girls slept in a covered wagon box.<br /> <br /> After moving east to Caineville, the family moved back to the Capitol Reef region by 1893. They settled in the budding community of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/learn/historyculture/fruita.htm\">Junction (later renamed Fruita),</a> where daughter <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/pioneer-women-of-capitol-reef.htm#onthisPage-2\">Nettie</a> began teaching her younger siblings. By 1896, the community worked together building a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/learn/historyculture/fruitaschoolhouse.htm\">one-room schoolhouse</a> to continue education opportunities for the children.<br /> <br /> Elijah, his sons, and other men in the community worked hard to keep a wagon road open through Capitol Gorge and up to Fruita. Summer thunderstorms, flash floods, and winter snow often made the route impassable. After about ten years, wanderlust struck Elijah, and he went east again with his family, settling in Notom. His oldest daughter, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/pioneer-women-of-capitol-reef.htm#onthisPage-1\">Mary Jane</a>, stayed behind in Fruita, with her husband Nels Johnson, who is considered to be the very first settler in the area.<br /> <br /> From the National Historic Register: \"<em>The abandonment of the Behunin Cabin after only one year of occupation testifies to the tenuous nature of settlement patterns in the American West and the mobility demanded by environmental unpredictability.\"</em>",

This layer was formed during Jurassic times when mud, silt, fine sand, and volcanic ash were deposited in swamps and lakes. Bentonite clay (altered volcanic ash) absorbs water and becomes very slick and gummy when wet, making vehicle or foot travel difficult or impossible.

Local supporter Ephraim Portman Pectol and Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Roger Toll named the area in 1935, before it was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. </p> <h2>Geology</h2> <p>The white Navajo Sandstone dome known as “Capitol Dome,” isn’t actually a true dome. Capitol Dome is a series of fins that blend together, resembling a dome. This is why visitors can only see this iconic feature heading east on Utah State Route 24, and not heading west. The fins become noticeable in late afternoon light, when shadows appear. <br /> <br /> Navajo Sandstone was deposited about 180 million years ago, when most of Utah was covered by massive sand dunes. The dunes spanned such a large area, geologists call it a \"sand sea\" to convey the expanse. For Utah, this was an extremely arid time above ground, although a high water table below ground eventually helped solidify the sand dunes into stone. <br />  </p> <p>An even closer look at Capitol Dome reveals fine tilted layers, or cross bedding, created by ancient sand dunes. This sandstone played an important role in the protection of this landscape. When Capitol Reef National Monument was designated in 1937, the enabling legislation highlighted these “ancient sand dune deposits of unusual scientific value.”<br /> <br /> Learn more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/learn/nature/geology.htm\">geology of Capitol Reef</a>! </p>",

They exemplify the type of range improvements that became common in the two decades before World War II. <br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> According to the Morrell family, the cabin was built in the 1920s on Lake Creek (Thousand Lake Mountain) by Paul Christensen. It was a summer house for his family at their sawmill. Around 1935, Christensen gave up his sawmill and sold the cabin to Morrell, a local cattleman. Morrell took apart and moved the cabin to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/cathedralvalley.htm\">Cathedral Valley</a>, where he reassembled it on its present location. The building served as winter camp for Morrell's cowboys until 1970, when the family sold the cabin to the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> The Lesley Morrell Cabin was constructed during a time of drought and high livestock numbers. In a desert environment, the land couldn't support so many animals. Wide-spread damage from overgrazing made ranching unprofitable. The 1934 Taylor Grazing Act's goal was to deal with this environmental problem and make ranching profitable again.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Before the Taylor Grazing Act, huge roaming herds of cattle and sheep competed for scarce forage and grass in the Capitol Reef area. After 1934, a permit system divided the federal, public land into grazing allotments. These allotments were leased to local cattlemen by the Department of the Interior. It was hoped that local ranchers would be the most responsible and sensitive to environmental considerations. The permit system ended the era of wide-ranging, nomadic livestock grazing. The same ranchers now grazed in the same ranges from year to year. This new situation led to the construction of new wells and corrals, as well as line shacks, like the Morrell Cabin.</p> <h2>Have a Safe Visit</h2> <p>The Morrell Cabin is not accessible by vehicle.<em> </em>It is a short (0.4 miles/0.6 km roundtrip), easy walk from the road to the cabin. Download a map of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/upload/Cathedral-District-May15-low-res-locked-for-web.pdf\">Cathedral Valley trails</a>. <br /> <br /> This short hike begins 1.8 miles (2.9 km) north of the junction of the Hartnet and Cathedral Roads, at the base of a series of steep, rocky switchbacks, approximately 28.1 miles (45.2 km) from Highway 24 (via the Cathedral Road). Park to the side of the road and follow the path 0.2 mile (0.3 km) to the historic cabin. The trail crosses a wash that may have shallow flowing water. Visitors may peer through the windows to see the interior.

Do not walk or drive across flooded roads or trails - play it safe and wait until floodwaters subside. <strong>You are responsible for your own </strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">safety</a><strong>.</strong></p>",

        "notes": "Pioneer Register\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/pioneer-register.htm\n\n<p>At the end of the Scenic Drive, take an easy stroll down Capitol Gorge, and about half a mile (0.8 km) from the trailhead, look at the north side of the canyon wall (left). Notice the many names, dates, and places carved, painted, and in one case, shot, into the sandstone. Prospectors, explorers, surveyors, cowboys, area settlers, and early visitors would often stand on their wagons to carve their names into the canyon wall. They were leaving their mark above flash flood danger, likely hoping their names would survive for centuries.<br /> <br /> These inscriptions provide an important log of those who passed through the region, and they offer insight into the men and women who left their names behind. The earliest inscriptions belong to two mineral prospectors, J.A. Call and Wal. Bateman. These men were probably in search of economic wealth from mining and travelled through Capitol Gorge September 20, 1871. Aside from their names, the date, and “PROSSPECTER,” very little is known about these two men. If they hadn’t left their mark, no one would know they were likely the earliest Euro-American presence in the Capitol Reef region. They were not part of a large, government-sponsored expedition, like the 1872 trip through Capitol Reef lead by Almon Thompson, under the larger J.W. Powell Expedition. <i>It is now illegal to carve, paint, scratch, or otherwise deface any canyon wall, historic, or archeological site. </i><br /> <br /> <i></i>The names of many early Fruita and Wayne County residents can be found on the register: E.P. Pectol, Aaron Holt, Walter and E.J. Hanks as well as members of the Oyler, Smith, Carrell, and Cook families.  <br /> <br /> Other notable local people include Hanksville shop owner C.A. Gibbons who supposedly furnished Zane Gray with the story of <em>Wildfire</em>, his 1915 novel. A group of French archeologists looking at ruins in the area also left their names behind: G. Guiraud, A. Pillaud, P. Brossard, and T. Breard on January 30, 1893. <br /> <br /> As you return to the parking lot, look for four inscriptions towards the top of the cliff, on the south side of the canyon walls. These names belong to surveyors. One of their descendants, Pam Stewart, provides the story behind them. Her great-uncle, John R. Stewart, and his half-brother Quinby, worked for the state of Utah as land surveyors in 1912. They had contracted a crew of University of Utah geology students to help them over the summer.  <br /> <br /> According to Pam and her family, “It is said that Quinby got the idea of fooling the new bunch, commenting on the speed of erosion in the Reef. One evening, leaning on the buck board, he said to his youthful and unexperienced crew, \"My how it erodes down here.\" After a pause he consulted John R., \"Isn't this the place we were at this time last year?\" Later, after dark, when the rest of the camp were asleep, Quinby and John R. took some ropes, hammers, and chisels and snuck off down the draw to where canyon wall was a sheer rock face about 50 feet high. There, they climbed to the top where Quinby was lowered over the edge and down the face. There he dangled in a rope chair, while he chiseled their names and last year's date in good engineering letters two feet high on the rock face.<br /> <br /> The next day as they were working in the canyon, Quinby remarked, \"I think we were standing about here when we carved our names in some rock face...\" He then pointed out the names and date to his hapless audience, with the comment that he had stood on the bed of a wagon to do the inscribing. This would have required about 40 feet of erosion in one year.<br /> <br /> The tale stops there, leaving it to the reader to imagine the amazement of the University crew, and the ensuing confusion when they confidently informed their professors of the rapid erosion in the southern deserts. One can only hope that some kind mentor set them straight before the joke went too far.”<br /> <br /> As you continue to explore, help protect Capitol Reef National Park by not leaving your mark. Make memories, take photos & leave no trace.The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/archeology/tools/Laws/ARPA.htm\"><b>Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979</b></a> (ARPA) states that all acts of vandalism are illegal and are punishable by up to 2 years in prison and/or a $20,000 fine. Help spread the word and let others know that these activities are illegal.<br /> <br /> Anyone with information concerning vandalism within Capitol Reef National Park should immediately contact the National Park Service.

Junipers and pinyon pines live side by side in the most common plant community on the Colorado Plateau: the pinyon-juniper woodland. Junipers have overlapping scale-like leaves and light blue berries, which are actually tiny cones covered in a waxy coating. Every juniper is unique. Some are bushy, others appear to be half dead with bare twisting branches. To conserve water, the tree self-prunes, cutting off nutrients to some branches to ensure the survival of the tree. How do they obtain enough water in this very dry desert? An immense root system can account for two thirds of a tree’s mass. The main taproot can extend up to 25 feet underground and lateral roots may stretch up to 100 feet from the trunk. With the help of these adaptations, a juniper can live to be 700 years old, providing delectable berries to generations of rabbits, coyotes, and birds over its lifespan.",

He promoted the geologic features of Cathedral Valley to be included inside the park boundaries. In the 1970s, President Lyndon B. Johnson expanded Capitol Reef to include Cathedral Valley.</p> <h2>Geology</h2> <p>The monoliths (large, freestanding rock formations) are composed of the earthy, buff-pink Entrada Sandstone. Deposited 160 million years ago in the Jurassic period, this fine-grained sandstone formed by the deposition of sand and silt in tidal flats. It crumbles easily to a fine sand which is rapidly removed by water; therefore, talus (debris) slopes do not form and Entrada cliffs tend to rise sheer from their base. Above the Entrada, the grayish-green sandstone and siltstone of the Curtis Sandstone forms a hard cap rock on some of the monoliths and higher cliffs and buttes, protecting them from erosion. Above the Curtis is the thinly-bedded, reddish-brown siltstone of the Summerville Formation.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/nature/arches.htm\">Arches National Park’s arches</a> are also formed in Entrada Sandstone.<br /> <br /> Learn more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/cathedralvalley.htm#onthisPage-2\">geology of Cathedral Valley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/learn/nature/geology.htm\">Capitol Reef's Waterpocket Fold</a>.</p> <h2>Regulations</h2> <ul> <li> <p>While Capitol Reef is open 24 hours/day, car camping is limited to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/primitive-campgrounds.htm\">maintained campgrounds</a>.

        "notes": "1836 Battle Monument\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/1836-battle-monument.htm\n\n<h3>Early Plans and Indecision</h3>   <p>Inspiration for the 1836 Battle Monument came while planning the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the War for Independence in the greater Boston region. In early April 1825, the Bunker Hill Monument Association formed an agreement with the town of Concord to help fund a new monument to commemorate the fighting on April 19, 1775.<br /> <br /> From the beginning, the monument plan met resistance by local citizens protesting the proposed location at the center of town, nearly half a mile from the site of the famed North Bridge. Disregarding local opinion, officials laid the monument cornerstone at the square during the fiftieth anniversary celebration. A lead box was placed under the cornerstone containing historical currency and other relevant documents.<br /> <br /> During the following two years, officials made little progress in completing the monument. Local citizen John Shepard Keyes recalled,</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“the reason being that the funds collected in Concord by the Bunker Hill Monument Association, and appropriated to building the Concord monument were withheld or squandered so that ours was left-This huge granite block some 4 feet cube [and] was a favorite climb for the boys…and I can just remember the alarm of the great illumination, the bonfire of huge tar barrels that were piled up on it by some of the rowdy element a few years after its dedication, and burnt one dark night, in mockery of its unfinished condition.”</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, the fire damaged the cornerstone beyond repair, and the time capsule mysteriously disappeared.</p> <h3>Commemorating the North bridge</h3>   <p>After years of inaction, local citizen Reverend Ezra Ripley donated a segment of the original North Bridge Battleground to the town of Concord. This small tract of land offered a new opportunity for commemoration. Although the famed North Bridge was long gone, the parcel included the original roadbed leading to the bridge site, and the grave of two British soldiers killed during the battle.  After acquiring the land, a town committee worked with Solomon Willard, construction supervisor of the Bunker Hill Monument, to design the obelisk, and artisan James Wilkins to construct the monument. The twenty-five-foot obelisk consisted of four pieces of white granite cut from a single boulder placed on top of a granite foundation. Inset into the east face of the obelisk would be a white marble slab inscribed with a brief account of the battle at the North Bridge.</p> <p>Yet again, the monument met controversy, as John Shepherd Keyes later remembered, the monument,</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“…had been standing some six months, getting built after a dozen years fight over it in town and although then considered a masterpiece by many, was severely criticized by not a few and especially the inscription! …The committee… asked various leading men to write an inscription, and then attempted to select one from those handed in to them. It was not easy for them to decide, they liked parts of each, but none entirely. Therefore…they undertook the task of composing one out of portions of those submitted. ‘Here on the 19<sup>th</sup> of April 1775,’ was common to nearly all and so was taken it would be hard to say from whose, ‘Was made the first forcible resistance to British aggression’ this from Dr Ripley’s whose controversy with Lexington turned on those very words forcible resistance. On the opposite bank stood the American militia and here the first of the enemy fell,’ was from the lawyer like special pleading of Hon Sam Hoar ‘In the war of that Revolution which gave Independence to these United States’ was from another pen, and the concluding sentence was Mr Emerson’s ‘In gratitude to God and the love of Freedom this monument is erected AD 1836.”</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Construction of the monument began in 1836 and concluded with a dedication ceremony on July 4, 1837. Again, John Shepard Keyes recalled the <i>event </i></p> <blockquote> <p><i>“I remember it so well it was a very hot sunny July day, after the noon salute and bell ringing the village became as quiet as of a Sunday. About three oclock the procession escorted by the military companies…consisting mainly of the townspeople men women and children came slowly along the common and passed up the road to the Old North Bridge, there were assembled about the monument about two or three hundred seated on the grass, who listened to a prayer by Mr Frost an oration by Samuel Hoar and then Mr. Emersons hymn was sung by all who could join, in full chorus. This hymn was printed on slips of paper about 6 inches square and plentifully supplied to the audience I kept mine, and have a part of it now, and notice the alterations Mr Emerson has since made in it by comparing this with his book of poems. The last verse begins ‘O Thou who made those heroes dare to die or leave their children free’ Reverend John Wilder prayed and Dr Ripley gave a very solemn benediction for was not his lifes work and effort accomplished in this monument erected and dedicated on the spot he had selected.”</i></p> </blockquote> <p>As J.S. Keyes remember, the 1837 event also unveiled Emmerson’s famed poem<i> “The Concord Hymn,” </i>and coined the title<i> “The Shot Heard Round The World.”</i><br />  </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>By the rude bridge that arched the flood,  <br /> Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,<br /> Here once the embattled farmers stood  <br /> And fired the shot heard round the world.<br /> <br /> The foe long since in silence slept;  <br /> Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;<br /> And Time the ruined bridge has swept  <br /> Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.<br /> <br /> On this green bank, by this soft stream,  <br /> We set today a votive stone;<br /> That memory may their deed redeem,  <br /> When, like our sires, our sons are gone.<br /> <br /> Spirit, that made those heroes dare  <br /> To die, and leave their children free,<br /> Bid Time and Nature gently spare  <br /> The shaft we raise to them and thee.</i></p> <p><i></i></p> <h3>Words Matter: The Legacy of the 1836 Monument</h3> <br /> The creation of the 1836 monument marked a new era of myth and memory concerning the events of April 19, 1775. In this new era the language and actions of commemorating the Concord fight inspired two centuries of intense debate. When local officials began planning the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the battle debate emerged about the terminology used to describe the events. At one point, Concord Citizen Hon. Samuel Hoar referred to the North Bridge fight as the <em>“fist forcible resistance”</em> to British aggression. This seemingly innocuous statement inspired a robust response from several citizens of Lexington, who argued the Battle Green marked the location of first resistance.<br /> <br /> Using sworn testimony from members of the Lexington Militia recorded in 1775, the Citizens of Concord crafted a historical argument that Captain Parker did not order the Lexington Militia to fire on the British soldiers that morning. The resulting whirlwind of combative debate played out over the better part of a decade and struck a fever pitch when Concord unveiled the 1836 Battle Monument featuring the line “Here On the 19 of April, 1775, was made the first forcible resistance to British Aggression.” In pointed newspaper articles, Lexington citizens attacked Concord’s choice of words. This debate later expanded to include controversy over <em>“the first shot”</em>, on the Lexington Green and Emmerson’s <em>“Shot Heard Round The World”</em> at Concord’s North Bridge. Fractured over the terms and timelines, the schism between Lexington and Concord created competitive commemoration throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> century. In 1875, for the Centennial Celebration the two towns hosted separate commemorations and actively argued over the attendance of important officials such as President Ulysses S. Grant. <p>Today the battle monument stands as a firm reminder of the power historical narratives hold. In some regards, the monument speaks more to the thoughts and feelings of the people who erected it than to the events of April 19, 1775. After placing the 1836 battle monument at the North bridge, the town of Concord dedicated vast resources for improving and maintaining the battleground. During the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, the community of Concord worked together to cultivate a scenic park at the North Bridge site. This massive undertaking involved moving original stone walls, installing drainage ditches, planting hundreds of trees, and crafting new monuments of stone and wood. Future generations later expanded upon this movement to preserve and commemorate the battle site and eventually turned the ground over to the National Park Service with the creation of Minute Man National Historical Park in 1959.</p>   <p> </p> <h3>Sources:</h3> <p>John Shepard Keyes, Autobiography, transcribed from ms. in John Shepard Keyes Papers, William Munroe Special Collections, Concord Free Public Library, Concord, Mass., Concord Free Public Library website, http://www.concordlibrary.org/uploads/scollect/doc/Autobiography_final.pdf</p> <p>Dietrich-Smith D. 2004.

        "notes": "British Grave Near Bloody Angle\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/british-grave-near-bloody-angle.htm\n\n<p>At this sharp curve in the Bay Road shaded by tall trees and stone fences, there is a grave marker for British soldiers killed on April 19, 1775. In the years following the famed battle, local historians dubbed this segment of road, \"The Bloody Angle.\" Today, this grave marker at the northern curve memorializes those British soldiers buried along the roadside after the fight. Like many accounts of the fighting on April 19, 1775, written narratives of the battle's aftermath do not appear until many years later. In the case of those British soldiers killed during the retreat through Lincoln, the history is often confusing and controversial.</p> <h4><br /> The British Retreat</h4> <p>As the British column retreated through two sharp bends in the road today known as the Bloody Angle they were met with enemy fire on both sides of the road. Catching the regulars in a devestating crossfire, one Militiaman recalled, <em>\"...[the] enemy left many dead and wounded and a few tired...\"</em> Another militiaman estimated at least eight regulars were killed at the Bloody Angle with scores of others wounded.</p>   <p>Unfortunately, for the weary British column, the fire did not end after passing the second road curve. With more militia joining, the battle swept through woodlots and farmfields leading toward the Hartwell homesteads. When the fighting continued eastward, at least three militiamen and an unknown number of British regulars lay dead near the Hartwell property.</p>   <p>Today, it is estimated as many as three British regulars are buried near the Bloody Angle, while at least five more were buried some miles away in Lincoln's town burying ground. How and why those men were interred in those locations remains a mystery.</p> <h4>Burial of the Dead</h4> <p>According to local traditions, people who lived along the Bay Road collected the dead for burial. In 1880, Samuel Adams Drake published a History of Middlesex County that cited local William F. Wheeler, as the source claiming two British soldiers were buried near the curve in the road today known as the bloody angle. Although, Wheeler's claim is seemingly straightforward another History of Middlesex County published by D. Hamilton Hurd in 1890 cites Wheeler's estimate as three British soldiers, <em>\"buried by the side of the road.\" </em>Unfortunately the contradictory statements by Wheeler remain the only evidence for the interment of British soldiers near the Bloody Angle site today.</p>   <p>As for the soldiers taken to Lincoln's burying ground, more information about their fate exists. In 1850, Famed author Henry David Thoreau also cited William Wheeler, saying that Wheeler's grandfather carted British soldiers to the Lincoln burying ground the day after the fighting concluded. Thoreau even mentioned that Wheeler recalled hearing, <em>\"Old Mr. Child…say that when one soldier was shot he leaped right up his full length out of ranks and fell dead…\"</em></p>   <p>According to another prominent account published in 1896 by Abram Brown, in <em>\"Beneath Old Roof Trees,\"</em> Mary Hartwell, wife of Sergeant Samuel Hartwell, witnessed the burial of the British soldiers killed around her home following the battle. According to family lore, Mary told her grandson;</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"I could not sleep that night, for I knew there were British soldiers laying dead by the roadside; and when, on the following morning, we were somewhat calmed and rested, we gave attention to the burial of those whom their comrades had failed to take away. The men hitched the oxen to the cart and went down below the house, and gathered up the dead. As they returned with the team and the dead soldiers my thoughts went out for the wives, parents, and children away across the Atlantic, who would never again see their loved ones; and I left the house and taking my little children by the hand I followed the rude hearse to the grave hastily made in the burial ground. I remember how cruel it seemed to put them into one large trench without any coffins. There was one in a brilliant uniform, whom I supposed to have been an officer. His hair was tied up in a cue.\"</em></p> </blockquote> <p>During the early 20th century, over 150 years after the burial, variations of this story stated that Mary's father-in-law, Ephraim Hartwell and another neighbor (possibly Edmund Wheeler), picked up the British soldiers and transported them to the Lincoln burial ground.<br /> <br /> Although it is difficult to say with absolute certainty that Mr. Wheeler or the Hartwell Family helped bury the slain soldiers in Lincoln's burial ground, the grave exists there today. In 1850, Henry David Thoreau also recorded an incredible controversy when local phrenologist, Walton Felch, supposedly disinterred the graves and removed the skulls of two British soldiers for a traveling exhibit. One attendee at a lecture in Worcester, MA later recalled, interested students <em>\"had sat at the feet of the old pensioners still living as they 'shouldered their crutches and showed how fields were won,' and a sight of these ghastly mementoes of their prowess made an impression that was never effaced.\" </em>Although evidence of the traveling British skulls is scarce, there is some indication that when Felch died at least one skull was secretly reburied at the North Bridge gravesite in 1891.</p>   <p>Today, a small grave marker along the battle road stands in memory of the soldiers buried near the Bloody Angle and a larger tombstone erected by the town of Lincoln in 1884 marks the five soldiers in Lincoln's Burying ground.</p>   <h4>Learn More</h4> To learn more about the area between Elm Brook Hill and Hartwell Tavern follow the links below <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/elm-brook-hill.htm\">The Fighting on Elm Brook Hill and \"The Bloody Angle.\"</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hartwell-tavern-1733.htm\">Hartwell Tavern, 1733</a></li> </ul> <h4>Sources</h4> <ul> <li>Brown, Abram E. <em>Beneath Old Roof Trees</em> (Boston, MA: Lee and Shepard, 1896).</li> <li>Drake, Samuel Adams. <em>History of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, Containing Carefully Prepared Historians of Every City and Town in the Country by Well Known Writers; and A General History of the County From the Earliest to the Present Time,</em> (Boston, MA: Estes And Lauriat, Publishers, 1880).</li> <li>Hurd, D.

After bloodshed earlier that morning on the Lexington Green and again at Concord's North Bridge, the threat of conflict loomed large. Near Meriam's corner the British column condensed to cross a small wooden bridge in full view of gathering colonial militia. In a slow methodical order the last companies of British light infantry crossed the bridge when the sudden crackle of musketry cut through the air. Although out of effective musket range the surrounding Colonial forces opened fire and started an eight hour running battle back to Boston.</div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1674058090388\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1674058090388\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674058090388\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674058090388\">Casualties And Burial</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1674058090388\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1674058090388\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\"> <p>While the fighting at Meriam's corner lasted only a few minutes, numerous eyewitnesses recounted casualties left in the wake.

        "notes": "British Grave on Fiske Hill\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/british-grave-on-fiske-hill.htm\n\n<p>On April 19, 1775 fighting between Colonial Militia and British Regulars spilled over the crest of Fiske Hill. As the column of weary Redcoats navigated the winding hillside road, Colonial Militia set a deadly trap. Edmund Foster, a Reading Minute Man recalled, <em>\"A number of Americans behind a pile of rails raised their guns and fired with deadly effect.\"</em> The heavy crackle of musketry echoed through the trees, meadows, and pastures before sweeping past the recently abandoned home of Ebenezer Fiske. Combatants from both sides darted across the property utilizing tree lots, boulders, and stonewalls for cover. Rebecca Fiske, Ebenezer's daughter-in-law, recalled the fighting soon passed eastward toward Lexington and she resolved to return home;</p>   <blockquote>\"what an altered scene began to present itself, as I approached the house - garden walls thrown down - my flowers trampled upon - earth and herbage covered with the marks of hurried footsteps. The house had been broken open, and on the doorstep - awful spectacle - there lay a British soldier dead, on his face, though yet warm, in his blood, which was still trickling from a bullet-hole though his vitals. His bosom and his pockets were stuffed with my effects, which he had been pillaging, having broken into the house through a window. On entering my front room, I was horror-struck. Three mangled soldiers lay groaning on the floor and weltering in their blood, which had gathered in large puddles about them. 'Beat out my brains, I beg of you,' cried one of them, a young Briton, who was dreadfully pierced with bullets, through almost every part of his body, 'and relieve me from this agony.' \" ~Rebecca Fiske</blockquote> <p>For Rebecca Fiske the horrific scene presented in her family's front room ushered in a clear view of the harsh reality 18th century warfare embodied. She continued, </p> <blockquote>\"A grim Irishman, shot through the jaws, lay beside him, who mingled his groans of desperation with curses on the villain who had so horridly wounded him. The third was a young American, employing his dying breath in prayer. A bullet had passed through his body, taking off in its course the lower part of his powder-horn. The name of this youthful patriot was J. Haywood, of Acton. His father came and carried his body home; it now lies in Acton graveyard. These were the circumstances of his death: being ardent and close in the pursuit, he stopped a moment at our well to slake his thirst. Turning from the well, his eye unexpectedly caught that of the Briton, whom I saw lying dead on the door-step, just coming from the house with his plunder. They were about a rod from each other. The Briton knew it was death for him to turn, and the American scorned to shrink. A moment of awful suspense ensued-- when both simultaneously leveled their muskets at each other's heart, fired, and fell on their faces together.\" ~Rebecca Fiske</blockquote> <p>Relief for the wounded at the Fiske house came from Dr. Joseph Fiske, a local surgeon,and cousin of Ebeneezer,. Although a patriot participant in the day's events, Dr Fiske traversed the battle road afterward to care for the wounded. On April 20, 1775, Dr. Fiske stopped at his cousin's home to <i>\"dress three o the King's troops.\"</i> Although Dr. Fiske bandaged and assessed the wounds of those men, not all survived. Colonial Militiaman James Hayward perished from his wounds, as did the British Soldier pierced by multiple shot. According to Rebecca,</p> <blockquote>\"My husband drew the two Britons off on a sled, and buried them in one of our pastures, where they now lie, beneath a pine tree which has grown up out of their grave. The Irishman was the only one of the three that survived.\" ~Rebecca Fiske</blockquote> <p>Over 100 years later, local residents reported the existence of a large \"upright\" tree stump in a meadow atop Fiske Hill that marked the grave of British Soldiers. Unfortunately, that stump and the exact resting place of those men are now lost to time.</p> <p>In the early 20th Century local historian Frank Coburn also claimed two additional British soldiers perished in the home of Thaddeus Reed and were interred a short distance away; near present day Wood Street.</p>",

Built circa 1692, the house has been restored by the National Park Service to its general appearance on April 19, 1775, when Captain Smith was the commanding officer of the Lincoln Minute Men.<br /> <br /> On April 19, 1775, having been made aware of the march of British Regulars from Boston on the Province’s store of military supplies in Concord, Captain Smith sounded the general alarm that called his fellow townsmen to arms. He and the Lincoln Minute Men participated in the first offensive action of the American Revolution at Concord’s North Bridge and again engaged the British regulars on their return to Boston.<br /> <br /> The running battle back to Boston passed by Smith’s house around 1:30 p.m. and a British regular who was wounded nearby was left in the care of Catherine Louisa, Captain Smith’s wife. Despite her best efforts and those of Lexington physician Joseph Fiske, the soldier died of his wounds two or three days later, and he was buried near the farmhouse.<br /> <br /> The household also included a young black man named <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/cato-smith-enlisted-and-enslaved.htm\">Cato.</a> Cato was in his 20s and enslaved to the Smith family. There's no evidence he fought on April 19, 1775 but five days later he enlisted in the Massachusetts Army. He enlisted again in the summer of 1776 and died in camp at New Castle, New York in January of 1777. <br /> <br /> William Smith married Catharine Louisa Salmon in 1771 and settled with her in Lincoln by 1774. He was the only son of Rev. William Smith of Weymouth and the brother of Abigail Adams, wife of the prominent patriot John Adams. This family connection might explain why William Smith was elected to lead Lincoln’s Minute Company despite being a relative newcomer to the town.<br /> <br /> His leadership on April 19, 1775 was the height of Captain Smith’s military career. In the years following the outbreak of the war, it appears that his life became increasingly troubled by indebtedness and other factors (possibly including alcoholism or mental health issues).<br /> <br /> Ownership of the property in Lincoln, which Captain Smith had purchased from his wife’s step-father in 1774, was assumed by his father in 1780. When Rev. Smith died in 1783, he left the property to Catherine Louisa. About this same time it is believed that Captain Smith abandoned his wife and six children. His name disappeared from Lincoln town records in 1784 and it is believed that he died in Pennsylvania in 1787.<br /> <br /> Catherine Louisa Smith left Lincoln in 1795 and the house then passed through the hands of a series of descendants until 1875. Ownership then passed to a series of others until the structure was added to Minute Man National Historical Park in 1975.<br /> <br /> Despite cosmetic alterations and additions over the course of a century and a half, much of the original house has remained including the most distinctive architectural feature, its cove cornice found below the roofline of the front façade. This architectural feature is one of only three surviving examples remaining in Massachusetts (the others are in Danvers and Marblehead).<br /> <br /> Between 1983 and 1985, the structure was painstakingly restored by the National Park Service. The exterior restoration included reconstruction of the seventeenth-century chimney stack, mid-eighteenth century Georgian doorway, windows, and clapboarding. Additions added in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were removed and the 1730 lean-to was rebuilt. Interior features include the original mid-eighteenth century staircase, some original paneling and floors, as well as nearly the entire house frame and weatherboarding. Interior restoration included rebuilding the kitchen and fireplaces throughout the house, a corner cupboard in the east parlor, plaster walls and a portion of the paneling upon which period paint colors have been faithfully reproduced.",

        "notes": "Colonel James Barrett House, 1705\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/colonel-james-barrett-house-1705.htm\n\nAbout two miles from the North Bridge, a centuries-old wooden farmhouse stands that was once the home of Colonel James Barrett and his family. Built in 1705 by Benjamin Barrett, James' father, the farm has been continuously productive. In 2003 the house was purchased by <strong><a href=\"http://www.saveourheritage.com/\">Save Our Heritage</a> </strong>who began a mult-year project to restore the house to its 1775 appearance. It became part of Minute Man National Historical Park in 2012.<br /> <br /> On April 19, 1775 British Regulars searched this home looking for stores of artillery and ammunition. Though they found nothing there, Colonel Barrett and members of his family played significant roles in the first battle of the American Revolutionary War.<br /> <br /> James Barrett was born July 31, 1710. In his adulthood he became one of the most respected political figures in Concord. He served as captain during the French and Indian War. He then became one of Concord’s legislators, first representing the town in 1768 in Boston and honored by re-election on each succeeding year until 1777. He also served as Concord’s delegate to the Provincial Congress in 1774 and was commssioned as a colonel, in command of a Middlesex Militia Regiment.<br /> <br /> In 1775, James Barrett’s household included two unmarried sons and a daughter, and his enslaved boy, 14-year-old Phillip. In 1779 Phillip joined the Continental Army and gained his freedom.<br /> <br /> Col. James Barrett was tasked by the Provincial Congress to secure much of the colony’s military supplies in Concord. These stores were distributed to some 30 homes for safekeeping. Among the military supplies were four brass cannons belonging to the Boston Artillery Company, which provincials secreted out of Boston from under British guard. Tory spies reported to Gen. Thomas Gage that these guns were hidden at Colonel Barrett’s farm.<br /> <br /> On April 19th, a contingent of about 120, of the total 700 British troops in Concord, marched the additional two miles from the North Bridge to Barrett’s farm in search of arms and supplies. Fortunately, colonists, including members of the Barrett family, removed all the military supplies from the house and the cannons were safely relocated to Groton, Massachusetts.<br /> <br /> When the British soldiers arrived at the house Barrett’s 57-year-old wife, Rebeckah, was at home. She gave them permission to search, warning them they would find nothing. Several of the tired and hungry officers asked for breakfast. She gave them food and drink, saying coldly, “We are commanded to feed our enemy if he hunger.” When Mrs. Barrett refused their offer of pay, the officers tossed shillings into her lap she responded “This is the price of blood.\"<br /> <br /> Though James Barrett saw the beginning of the war, he did not live to see its end, dying on April 11, 1779. His old house still stands, and with it the stories of a Patriot family who risked everything, including their lives and property, for American Liberty. <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/james-chandler.htm\">The Grave of James Chandler</a></h4> Included on the property, in the woods behind the house at the base of a high ridge is the solitary grave of James Chandler who died in the smalpox epidemic of 1792.

His orders to Lt. Col. Smith, the British officer who was to lead the expedition, were as follows:<br /> <br /> <em>Sir:<br /> Having received intelligence, that a quantity of Ammunition, Provision, Artillery, Tents and small arms, have been collected at Concord, for the Avowed Purpose of raising and supporting a Rebellion against His Majesty, you will march with the Corps of Grenadiers and Light Infantry, put under your command, with the utmost expedition and secrecy to Concord, where you will seize and destroy all Artillery, Ammunition, Provision, Tents, Small Arms, and all military stores whatever.

Also, Lt. Colonel Smith sent seven companies of light infantry (about 220 men) across the North Bridge with orders to search for supplies and artillery known to be hidden at Barrett's farm, about a mile west of the bridge.<br /> <br /> At that time, the colonists occupied the high ground overlooking the bridge. If they were to swoop down and take the bridge, the British soldiers at Barrett's farm would be cut off. Therefore, three companies, 96 men, under Captain Walter Laurie remained to guard North Bridge (LI companies from the 4th, 10th and 43rd regiments). Four companies, (about 125 men) under Captain Lawrence Parsons continued west to search the Barrett farm. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"panel panel-default collapsible-item\" id=\"Collapsible1673888023809\"> <div class=\"panel-heading collapsible-item-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1673888023809\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"panel-title collapsible-item-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673888023809\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673888023809\"><strong>Where were the British and Colonial soldiers standing when shots were exchanged across the river?</strong></a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1673888023809\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse collapsible-item-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1673888023809\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"panel-body collapsible-item-body\"> <p>When the British first deployed at the North Bridge, they were positioned on the west side of the river.

According to one British officer, they did so \"in a very military manner.\" Colonel James Barrett, in overall command of the minute men and militia, ordered his combined force \"to march to said bridge and pass the same, but not to fire on the King's troops unless they were first fired upon.\" The colonial soldiers then formed with the minute men at the head of the column (Davis' Company from Acton was first) followed by the militia. The towns represented in strength were Concord, Acton, Lincoln and Bedford.<br /> <br /> According to veterrans from Acton, upon taking his place at the head of his company, Captain Isaac Davis said \"I haven't a man who is afraid to go!\" Thus the column of 400 men began to march off \"in double file\" towards the British soldiers waiting for them at North Bridge.</p> <p>Hopelessly outnumbered by the advancing militia, the British soldiers pulled back to the east side of the bridge, where the 1836 Obelisk now stands, and hastily organized for defense.

        "notes": "Ebenezer Fiske House Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/ebenezer-fiske-house-site.htm\n\nAt the eastern base of Fiske Hill, a jagged stone foundation marks the location of the historic Ebenezer Fiske house site. This home constructed in the later portion of the 17th century, formed the nucleus of the prosperous Fiske family farm and included over 70 acres of ground in April 1775. When the sounds of battle echoed through the rolling landscape, the Fiske family fled to a safer location while their home bore witness to the brutality of 18th century warfare. <h4>Early Fiske House History</h4> <p>Although indigenous peoples inhabited the ancient forests covering Fiske hill for thousands of years, European settlers arrived in the region around 1635. Within ten years, one settler, David Fiske II, claimed this elevated landscape as his own and began constructing a farm. The early days of farming on Fiske Hill required intensive amounts of work but within a decade David Fiske II developed a flourishing farm and started a family of his own. Of the children, David Fiske III remained nearby his parents’ farmstead, constructing his own home a short distance away in 1674. The foundation of the younger David Fiske III house remains today, marking the end of the battle road trail.</p> <p>Archaeological investigation has unveiled the David Fiske III house as that of a typical New England farmstead in the late 17th and 18th centuries. A large central fireplace heated what was likely a two story- symmetrically designed home with two large front rooms and a kitchen in the back. In this house, David Fiske III and his wife, Lydia (Cooper) Fiske, raised eight children, including their youngest son Ebenezer Fiske.</p> <p>When David Fiske III died in 1729, the family farm passed to Ebenezer, and a new generation inhabited the site. Eventually, Ebenezer married Bethiah Muzzy and their family expanded to over ten children, including their youngest son, Benjamin Fiske. When Bethiah passed away in 1774, Benjamin Fiske moved into his father’s home with his wife Rebekah to care for the ill Ebenezer.</p> <h4>The Fighting On April 19, 1775</h4> <p>On the morning of April 19, 1775, Benjamin Fiske was exempt from militia service on account of a painful leg injury, but this would not keep the family out of harms’ way. Years after the fateful day, Rebekah Fiske recorded her eye witness account of what transpired.</p> <blockquote><em>“’I heard the guns,’ says she, ‘at about day-break, but being unapprehensive of the danger, did not, like most of our neighbors move off for fear of the enemy; especially as my father was confined to his bed of a severe sickness, so that in fleeing from the house we must leave him behind, which I could not consent to. Our domestics had already absconded, we knew not whither. I, therefore, and my husband, who, on account of a certain indisposition, was incapacitated for military service, remained in the house with our father, while the enemy passed; which they did without offering us any injury. I remember well, their exact order, red coats, glittering arms, and appalling numbers.”</em></blockquote> <p>Those Regular soldiers passing the Fiske house had just fired into a group of Lexington, Militia gathered on the village green nearly two miles away. Rebekah continued,</p> <blockquote><em>“Some time after, on their arrival at Concord, a report of musketry was once more heard, and in broken and incessant volleys. It was a sound of death to us. All now was trepidation, fever, and rushing to arms; women and children bewildered and souring across the fields. With much ado, we succeeded in yoking our oxen and getting father on his bed into an ox-cart, and thus moving him off as carefully as we could to a neighbor’s house, I secured some of the most valuable of my effects, putting my large looking-glass between two featherbeds, and fastening all the windows and doors. The house we carried father to, had been already vacated, and here I was left alone with him. The dreadful sound of approaching guns was still ringing in my ears. Bewildered and affraighted, I betook myself into the house-cellar there to await my fate. Occasionally, I ventured to peep out to discover the approach of the enemy. After remaining some time in this dreadful state of fear and suspense, I at last discovered the enemy coming down a long hill on the highway, partly upon a run and in some confusion, being closely beset by ‘our men’ in flank and rear. The terrific array of war soon came fully into view, and as soon passed off again from before my eyes, like a horrid vision, leaving only a cloud of smoke behind and the groans of the dying, who were strewed in its wake.”</em></blockquote> <blockquote><em>“After the rattle of musketry had grown somewhat weaker from distance, and my heart became more relieved of its apprehensions, I resolved to return home. But what and altered scene began to present itself, as I approached the house—garden walls thrown down—my flowers trampled upon—earth and herbage covered with the marks of hurried footsteps. The house had been broken open, and on the doorstep—awful spectacle—there lay a British soldier dead, on his face, though yet war, in his blood, which was still trickling from a bullet-hole [through] his vitals. His bosom and his pockets were stuffed with my effects, which he had been pillaging, having broken into the house through a window. On entering my front room, I was horror-struck. Three mangled soldiers lay groaning on the flood weltering in their blood, which had gathered in large puddles about them. ‘Beat out my brains, I beg of you.’ Cried one of them, a young Briton, who was dreadfully pierced with bullets, though almost every part of his body, ‘and relieve me from this agony.” You will die soon enough, said I, with a revengeful pique. A grim Irishman, shot through the jaws, lay beside him, who mingled his groans of desperation with curses on the villain who had so horridly wounded him. The third was a young American, employing his dying breath in prayer. A bullet had passed through his body, taking off in its course the lower part of his powder-horn. The name of this youthful patriot was J. Haywood, of Acton. His father came and carried his body home; It now lies in Acton graveyard. These were the circumstances of his death: being ardent and close in the pursuit, he stopped a moment at our well to slake his thirst. Turning from the well, his eye unexpectedly caught that of the Briton, whom I saw lying dead on the door-step, just coming from the house with his plunder. They were about a rod from each other. The Briton knew it was death for him to turn, and the American scorned to shrink. A moment of awful suspense ensured—when both simultaneously levelled their muskets at each other’s heart, fired, and fell on their faces together.”</em></blockquote> <h4>Care For The Wounded</h4> <p>Following the end of fighting on April 19, 1775, Dr. Joseph Fiske, cousin of Ebenezer, visited the wounded soldiers Rebekah discovered. Later, Dr. Fiske submitted a bill to colonial leaders for care provided to “two of the king’s troops.” Although Dr. Fiske attended the wounded, the injuries sustained by the soldier Rebekah recorded as “dreadfully pierced with bullets,” were too great. In her closing statements, Rebekah concluded,</p> <blockquote><em>”My husband drew the two Britons off on a sled, and buried them in one of our pastures where they now lie, beneath a pine tree which has grown up out of their grave. The Irishman was the only one of the three that survived.’”</em></blockquote> <p>Although, themes of revolutionary exaggeration may permeate Rebekah’s account, her testimony recorded for the Harvard Register in June, 1827, reveals a fascinating insight into the events of the day.</p> <h4>The Fiske House Site Today</h4> <p>After April 19, 1775, the world around Fiske Hill changed dramatically. Ebenezer Fiske died in late 1775 and did not live to see the new American Nation. Unfortunately, Benjamin Fiske similarly did not live long into this new era. When Benjamin died in 1785, Rebekah managed his estate and remarried. In her later years Rebekah rented out the old Fiske house but moved to her second husband’s home. Eventually the Fiske farmstead sold, and each new owner added additional features such as a large barn behind the house. During the 1850’s one new owner demolished portions of the original 17th century home and replaced it with modern construction. This rendition of the house remained until the mid-20th Century. After the National Park Service acquired the site in 1959, archaeological investigation revealed a low stone foundation that identified the original house location.<br />  </p> <h3>Learn More About Fiske Hill</h3> To learn more about Fiske Hill follow the links below! <ul> <li> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fiske-hill.htm\">Fiske Hill</a></h4> </li> <li> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/british-grave-on-fiske-hill.htm\">The Grave of British Soldiers on Fiske Hill </a></h4> </li> </ul>",

Exploring the Buttrick Gardens' main elements, a rich history is revealed. Beginning with the indigenous care of the area, and continuing with the Buttrick family to the historical society, the essence of the land has been changed with each new steward. Not only can we get in touch with those who came before by walking their paths, but we can viscerally relate to the past by connecting with living things. As an artist, environmentalist, and daughter of a historian, gardens to me are the ideal combination to peer into our relationship with nature and society as a whole. Drawn to the Buttrick Gardens as an oasis throughout the pandemic, I hope to share the historical mosaic of the space and bring those who walked there into focus. By forging a tangible connection between us and the past, we can visualize what we want the future to look like and what we need to preserve to make that future take shape.</p> <h3><strong>Artist Bio:</strong></h3> <p>Originally from Nevada, BARD (Barbara Ayala Rugg Diehl) currently works and lives in Massachusetts. She brings her diverse backgrounds into her art subject matter and processes, having received her BA in Theater and English from Brandeis University and her MA in Sustainable International Development from the Heller School for Social Policy and Management. Her attraction to mixed media stems from both her work as an environmental educator and a personal creative curiosity. By using found items and reusing her own objects and clothes, she both reduces waste and explores the tangibility of art. In many of her pieces she utilizes 3-D elements to redefine who can interact with visual art, adding Braille and durable interactive elements to allow blind and low-vision audience members to enjoy her work. Her art has been featured in solo and group exhibits in seven states across the country, as well as internationally in Australia.<br />  </p> <h3><strong>What is this project? : </strong></h3> <p>Inspired by the <em>En Plein Air</em> exhibition on NYC's High Line, <strong>Go Out Doors - Neighbors</strong> builds upon and extends The Umbrella Arts Center's summer 2020 installation of artfully upcycled doors originally commissioned for the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail in West Concord's Cultural District. The exhibition intended to encourage a reconnection to nature for communities then emerging from COVID-19 isolation, at-home schooling, and telecommuting. Gorgeously decorated, recycled doors crafted by regional artists became surprising waypoints of delight while traveling bike paths and walking trails. Some emphasize local wildlife and environmental themes; others are fun and whimsical, stressing exercise and companionship. In 2021, Go Out Doors - Neighbors projects have continued to spread, with new art doors installed or planned in Carlisle, Westford, Concord, Arlington, Lexington, Medford, Groton, Minute Man National Historical Park, and eight villages in Newton including Auburndale; Newton Centre; Newton Highlands, Newton Upper Falls, Newtonville, Nonantum, Waban and West Newton.Background, wayfinding, photos, information about the artists, calls for new proposals, and other news will be updated throughout the season at <a href=\"https://theumbrellaarts.org/go-out-doors-neighbors-2021\">Go Out Doors - Neighbors | The Umbrella Arts Center</a>.</p>",

        "notes": "Elisha Jones House, 1740\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/elisha-jones-house-1740.htm\n\n<h3>The Elisha Jones or “Bullet Hole” House, 1740</h3> <p>Although referred to as the Elisha Jones house, portions of the historic home on Monument Street could date as far back as the mid-seventeenth century, well before the Jones family put their name to it.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Early History</h3> <p>In 1664, Concord resident John Smedley owned the parcel of ground where the Jones House now stands. There is evidence the Smedley family constructed a home near this location, however it is unclear whether any portion of that original 17th century structure remains within the 18th century home.</p> <p>Throughout the late 17th and early 18th century the land changed hands several times before the Jones family purchased it in 1724. Over the course of fifty years the Jones family built and maintained a prosperous farm and blacksmith shop on the property. In 1740, Thomas Jones constructed the house on the east side of what is now Monument Street, which stands today. When Thomas Jones died in 1774, the property passed to his son Elisha.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Elisha Jones and the “Bullet Hole House”</h3> <p>Elisha Jones, the fourth son of Thomas and Mary Jones, inherited the land, home, and Blacksmithing business in 1774. While the dark clouds of war gathered on the horizon, the Jones family prospered on the sunny banks of the Concord River. Elisha married Elizabeth Farrar in 1770. Four years later the couple moved into the family house where they would raise their six children.</p> <p>During the pre-revolutionary period, Elisha was an active member of the colonial militia and eventually became a lieutenant in the Concord Light Infantry Company. According to early histories of Concord, Jones helped to hide provincial military supplies from British forces on April 19, 1775. On that fated April morning the Elisha Jones house also made its way into the annals of history. According to local legend, as the British army made its retreat from the fight at the North Bridge, a soldier fired his musket at Elisha Jones, who stood watching the scene unfold from near his home. The shot missed Jones, but a musket ball left its mark in the facade of the western shed, earning the home its famous nickname, “the bullet hole house.”</p> <p>It is not known why Elisha did not muster with the town militia that morning, but he did take up arms for the patriot cause later in the war. Records indicate Elisha enlisted for service with Captain Joseph Hosmer’s company in 1776, and again with Hosmer’s Light Infantry Company in 1778. After the war Jones returned to his family and home, living in Concord until his death on April 10, 1810.</p> <p>Following his father’s death, James Jones took over the beloved home. He continued in Elisha’s footsteps and maintained the family blacksmithing legacy well into the 19th century. When James died in 1838, the majority of the Jones property was sold; however, nephew Nathan Barrett did take over the family farm. By 1863 old age and neglect had ravaged the old house, and despite its history, the Barrett family saw fit to sell the property to U.S. Marshall, John Shepard Keyes.</p> <p> </p> <h3>The Keyes Era:</h3> <p>John Shepard Keyes was born in Concord on September 19, 1821 and grew up in the company of such famous individuals as Henry Thoreau. An ambitious young man Keyes operated a law office at his father’s firm in Concord after graduating Harvard Law school in 1844. Nearly a decade later, in 1853, Keyes was elected sheriff of Middlesex County. He later served as a U.S. Marshal for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from 1860-1867.</p> <p>During his time as a U.S. Marshal, a sectional crisis unfolded and the American Civil War gripped the young nation. A devout republican, Keyes supported the election of Abraham Lincoln and commanded a security detachment tasked with protecting the president at the inauguration in 1860. Keyes’ duties during the Civil War also included, “…investigating all sorts of reports of rebel spies, contraband goods, and letters and communications from southern sympathizers.” In 1863 Keyes escorted the famed Massachusetts’s orator Edward Everett to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. At the dedication of the Gettysburg Soldiers National Cemetery on November 19, 1863 Keyes led Everett to the speaker’s platform and later watched from only yards away as Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address.</p> <p>Earlier that same year Keyes bought the Elisha Jones House as a birthday gift for his wife Martha, with whom he had six children; four who survived into adulthood. Returning to Concord after the Civil War, Keyes poured his attention into renovating the dilapidated home. During the process, Keyes wrote the first history of the “Bullet hole House”, actively shaping the historical memory of what happened in Concord on April 19, 1775. In his romanticized history of the house, Keyes told of the famed bullet hole and the patriot valor at the North Bridge. Keyes also enthusiastically participated in the nation’s first centennial celebration, serving as the chairman of the Minute Man Monument Committee in 1874. Under his leadership, the committee raised money and commissioned Danial Chester French to sculpt the now iconic Minute Man Statue. On April 19, 1875 Keyes had the pleasure of unveiling the monument to a massive crowd, which included President Ulysses S. Grant. Keyes continued to participate in town politics well into his golden years.</p> <p>Upon his death in 1910, the Elisha Jones house passed to John Shepard Keyes’ daughters Alicia M. Keyes, and Annie Emerson. Unfortunately, the sisters did not hold onto their father’s beloved house for very long. When Alicia Keyes died in 1924, Annie sold the home to World War I veteran Henry Fray. Mr. Fray lived in the home until 1963 at which time the National Park Service purchased the historic structure.</p> <p> </p> <h3>The National Park Era:</h3> <p>In 1963, the National Park Service purchased the Elisha Jones property and began restoring elements of the structure to its 1775 appearance. Today, the Elisha Jones house still stands just yards from the North Bridge. A small piece of glass also protects the famed bullet hole on the home’s western facade.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Sources:</h3> <p> </p> <ul> <li>James J.

As they did so, militia and minute man companies continued to pour into the area to engage the British. At Meriam’s Corner companies from Reading, Chelmsford and Billerica arrived in time to attack the rear of the column. Those men then cut across the fields to engage the British further east while other companies from Framingham and Sudbury arrived from the south. Companies from Concord, Lincoln, Bedford and Acton, who had fought at North Bridge earlier that morning ,were also in pursuit. Meanwhile, 3 companies from the town of Woburn had just arrived and was soon to make their presence felt. </p> <h4 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{12bc47fa-0b70-456e-a745-9b7c294ecb0a}{236}\" paraid=\"1905460829\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The Road and Landscape </h4> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{12bc47fa-0b70-456e-a745-9b7c294ecb0a}{236}\" paraid=\"1905460829\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The road, as it continued east, descended Brooks Hill about a mile from Meriam’s Corner. At the bottom of the hill the road crossed “Tanner Brook” at “Lincoln Bridge.” Now crossing the border into Lincoln the road climbed into a wooded upland. It then turned sharply to the northeast (left) cutting through the hillside. It then continued northeast for about a quarter of a mile until it made another sharp turn continuing east. <br />  <br /> The land on the east side of the first (southern) turn in the road featured a stone wall and an orchard. Moving northeast it became pasture and then a woodlot just south of the second (northern) turn. The land on the west of the road was a meadow which rose up to what was later described as a “wood pasture” or simply pastureland with large trees for shade. There was also a series of stone walls crisscrossing the area. As British officer, Lt. John Barker, would write <em>“The country was an amazing strong one, full of hills, woods, stone walls etc. which the rebels did not fail to take advantage of…” </em></p> <h4 aria-level=\"4\" lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d4335379-94c4-4fd4-9d6e-7dba3b1ce665}{26}\" paraid=\"26256961\" role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Woburn Attacks </h4> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d4335379-94c4-4fd4-9d6e-7dba3b1ce665}{39}\" paraid=\"767051707\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">As the British column descended the east side of Brooks Hill, they came to “Lincoln Bridge.” The Woburn companies of Captains Belknap, Fox and Walker, led by Major Loammi Baldwin (Col. Green’s Regiment, 2nd Middlesex), took a position on the high ground east of Lincoln Bridge. They had somewhere between 180 – 200 men and may have also been joined by companies from Framingham as well. According to the account of Major Baldwin… <br />  <br /> <em>“We proceeded to Concord by way of Lincoln meeting house… ascended the hill and pitched and refreshed ourselves a little…. The people under my command and also some others came running off the east end of the hill while I was at a house… and we proceeded down the road and could see behind us the Regulars following. We came to Tanner Brook, at Lincoln Bridge, and concluded to scatter and make use of the trees and walls for to defend us and attack them. We pursued on flanking them… I had several good shots. The enemy left many dead and wounded and a few tired…”  </em> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/images/Lincoln-Bridge.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\">View image of the southern turn of the road looking west toward the location of Lincoln Bridge.</a></p> <h4 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d4335379-94c4-4fd4-9d6e-7dba3b1ce665}{39}\" paraid=\"767051707\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Between Two Fires </h4> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d4335379-94c4-4fd4-9d6e-7dba3b1ce665}{145}\" paraid=\"357582785\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The Woburn companies opened a brisk fire then fell back toward the second turn in the road, firing from new positions as opportunity allowed. As the British column plunged ahead past the southern turn they were soon met by a heavy fire from their left (west side of the road). Militia volunteer Edmond Foster, who came into the fight at Meriam’s Corner, describes this best… </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d4335379-94c4-4fd4-9d6e-7dba3b1ce665}{181}\" paraid=\"997441247\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"> “<em>We saw a wood at a distance, which appeared to be in or near the road the enemy must pass. Many leaped over the wall and made for that wood. We arrived in time to meet the enemy. There was then, on the opposite side of the road, a young growth of wood well filled with Americans. The enemy was completely between two fires, renewed and briskly kept up. They ordered out a flank guard on the left to dislodge the Americans from their posts behind large trees but they only became a better mark to be shot at. A short but sharp contest ensued, at which the enemy received more deadly injury, than at any one place from Concord to Charlestown. Eight or more of their number were killed on the spot, and no doubt, many wounded.”</em>  <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/images/Wood-pasture.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\">View image of the Battle Road looking northeast.

Baldwin states that when the British approached, his men scattered and opened fire. Foster’s account mentions that the British column was being shot at from both sides of the road, <em>“between two fires…” </em>The account of British officer, Lieutenant William Sutherland ties them together by indicating the rebels dispersed prior to opening fire, then the column began taking fire from the left as well as the right. <br />  <br /> <em>“Upon a height to my right hand a vast number of armed men drawn out in battalia order, I dare say near 1000 who on our coming nearer dispersed into the wood, & came as close to the road on our flanking parties as they possibly could, upon our ascending the height to the road gave us a very heavy fire, but some shot from the left hand drew my attention that way when I saw a much larger body drawn up to the left…” </em> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/images/Road-cut.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\">View image of the Battle Road looking northeast just after the southern turn in the road where it cuts through the hillside.</a></p> <h4 aria-level=\"4\" lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{239285b5-667b-4dfd-b563-c5e06adf4f73}{1}\" paraid=\"1184099411\" role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Conclusion </h4> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{239285b5-667b-4dfd-b563-c5e06adf4f73}{14}\" paraid=\"1082869754\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">This area of Minute Man NHP known currently as “Bloody Angle,” while still the subject of inquiry and investigation, is one of the few places on the April 19, 1775 where first-hand accounts corroborate each other and are supported by the landscape. Here we see militia officers thinking carefully about where and how to deploy their soldiers to the best advantage, as opposed to a chaotic running fight. It is also interesting to note that, like the fight at Meriam’s Corner, a bridge appears in the tactical landscape and likely played a role in slowing and constricting the progress of the British column. <br />  <br /> Here we also see the courage of the British soldiers, who according to Foster, deployed into the wood pasture where they <em>“only became a better mark to be shot at…”</em> They suffered heavily. Foster estimates “8 or more” were killed. There were likely two to three times more wounded. The militia did not, for their part, escape without loss. Further east near the Hartwell Tavern, Woburn lost Daniel Thompson. Billerica lost Nathaniel Wyman, and the town of Bedford lost its Captain, Jonathan Wilson. </p> <h4 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{239285b5-667b-4dfd-b563-c5e06adf4f73}{70}\" paraid=\"110841939\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Sources </h4> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{12bc47fa-0b70-456e-a745-9b7c294ecb0a}{30}\" paraid=\"738692707\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Sabin, Douglas “April 19, 1775: A Historiographical Study, Part V, Meriam’s Corner through Lincoln” pg 8-11, Minute Man National Historical Park, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, Concord MA, 1985 </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{12bc47fa-0b70-456e-a745-9b7c294ecb0a}{72}\" paraid=\"944010757\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Dietrich-Smith, Deborah, “Cultural Landscape Report for Battle Road Unit, Minute Man National Historical Park” National Park Service, Olmstead Center for Landscape Preservation, Brookline MA 2005 </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{12bc47fa-0b70-456e-a745-9b7c294ecb0a}{112}\" paraid=\"1921381713\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Ripley, Ezra, “A History of the Fight at Concord, on the 19th of April, 1775” pg 30, Allen & Atwill, Concord MA 1827 </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{12bc47fa-0b70-456e-a745-9b7c294ecb0a}{154}\" paraid=\"29285335\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Kehoe, Vincent, “We Were There!

Human inhabitation of this region dates back over twelve thousand years. By the early seventeenth century, Algonquian people had been living along the Musketequid River, today known as the Concord River, for about a thousand years. Before contact with European settlers, these indigenous peoples hunted large game in the surrounding forests which included modern-day Fiske Hill.</p> <p>When Puritan families ventured inland around 1635, they claimed the prosperous land along the Musketequid River as their own. In a short time, European settlers cleared large tracts of forest to established Concord Plantation, now Concord, Massachusetts. One settler, David Fiske II arrived at Concord Plantation around 1647 and claimed the elevated terrain now called Fiske Hill.</p> <p>During the latter half of the 17th Century, David Fiske II and his wife Lydia established a homestead on the eastern slope of Fiske Hill at the western border of Cambridge, now known as Lexington. There the couple raised seven children including David Fiske III. Eventually the younger David built a farm near his father and together the Fiske's farmed the land until the end of their lives. When David Fiske III died in 1729 the farm passed to his son Ebenezer, who owned the land during the Revolutionary Period.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1674052654330\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1674052654330\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674052654330\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674052654330\"><span>The Battle Road On April 19, 1775</span></a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1674052654330\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1674052654330\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\"> <p>On April 19, 1775, the Bay Road cut through the Fiske property just yards north of the home. Unfortunately, illness incapacitated Ebenezer Fiske and posed a difficult problem for his son Benjamin and daughter-in-law Rebecca. As the sound of battle grew nearer the family decided they needed to find a safer location to shelter. Rebecca and Benjamin loaded Ebenezer into an oxcart and resolved to move the family away from the battle.</p> <p>Shortly after the Fiske family fled, the running fight between colonial militia and British Regulars reached the farmstead. Utilizing scattered tree lots, stone walls, piles of rail fence, and boulders, colonial Militia staged themselves around the Bay Road. In the distance the long column of weary and battered redcoats struggled toward Lexington; their ammunition nearly exhausted and ranks on the verge of collapse. As they climbed the winding road on Fiske Hill, Reading Minuteman Edmond Foster recalled;</p> <p><em>\"The enemy were then rising and passing over Fiske's Hill. An officer, mounted on an elegant horse, and with a drawn sword in his hand, was riding backwards and forwards, commanding and urging on the British troops. A number of Americans behind a pile of rails raised their guns and fired with deadly effect. The officer fell, and the horse took fright, leaped the wall, and ran directly towards those who had killed his rider. The enemy discharged their musketry in that direction, but their fire took no effect.\"</em>- Edmund Foster</p> <p>To avoid complete disaster the Regulars rushed onward, leaving their dead and wounded strewn across the landscape. Near the Fiske House, some individuals stopped either to enter the home or retrieve water from the well. In one intense moment, Acton militiaman James Hayward came face to face with a British Regular exiting the house. According to a local legend recorded fifty years later, the British soldier cried out, <em>“You are a dead man,”</em> and Hayward replied, <em>“and so are you!”. </em> Both fired and fell. The British soldier was dead, and Hayward was mortally wounded. Shortly after the fighting passed, Rebecca Fiske and her family ventured home only to find it in disaster. A dead Redcoat lay across the front step, while three horribly wounded men weltered in pools of blood just inside their front door.</p> <p>After the battle, the story of Fiske Hill and the bravery of James Hayward became critical aspects of the April 19, 1775 narrative.

During the 19th century the town of Lexington straightened and widened the original Bay Road, permanently altering the battlefield landscape. In an era of increasing technological advancement, new methods of farming, and the addition of buildings developed the landscape further. In the early 20th century, a large turkey farm encompassed the western side of the hill.  By 1947 the original Fiske House fell into disrepair. In 1955, the property owners demolished the remaining structure.</div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1674052654327\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1674052654327\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674052654327\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674052654327\"><span>Minute Man National Historic Park</span></a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1674052654327\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1674052654327\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\">When Minute Man National Historical Park was established in 1959, the landscape of Fiske Hill offered many opportunities for restoration. The park acted quickly and acquired nearly forty acres of Fiske Hill land. During the early phases of Park planning, NPS leadership looked to develop visitor services on Fiske Hill, given its close proximity to Route 128, and 2A. During this formative period, historic resources were restored, parking lots added, and an information shelter constructed in 1967. Eventually Fiske Hill connected to larger sections of the preserved battle road trail and the park uncovered the 1775 trace of the Bay Road. As Minute Man NHP acquired additional land, visitor services shifted elsewhere. Eventually the information shelter on Fiske Hill was replaced with a newer Visitors Center a mile west along the battle road. Today Fiske Hill remains a beautifully curated natural and historic landscape. Miles of trail web across the hillside, while the remains of the Ebenezer Fiske farm are preserved for generations to come.</div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1674052654325\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1674052654325\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674052654325\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674052654325\"><span>Learn More About Fiske Hill</span></a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1674052654325\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1674052654325\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\">To learn more about Fiske Hill follow the links below!<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/british-grave-on-fiske-hill.htm\">The Grave of British Soldiers on Fiske Hill</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ebenezer-fiske-house-site.htm\">Ebenezer Fiske House Site</a></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>  ",

The combination of words and pictures on paper had a special quality that cannot be replaced by the computer screen or tablet. When I saw the call for artists to design a door for the Minuteman National Park, I immediately thought of combining words and images to make a poetry door, a portal that would have a quality of whimsy and magic. The door is my tribute to my parents and all the wonderful hours they spent reading to me, and the joy those memories still bring. <h3><b>Artist Bio:</b></h3> I love story-telling, and my artistic work often contains a narrative quality and implied story. For thirty-five years my inspiration was my home town of Lynn, Massachusetts, where I documented scenes of everyday life in the tradition of the Ash Can School. Other series include scenes of commuters on the subway, grooms at Suffolk Downs, and performers I knew when I worked for the Big Apple Circus. These images are created in a variety of media, including watercolor, oil, and pastel.<br /> <br /> My public artwork includes murals for the children’s departments of nine public libraries, and murals and mosaics for communities and organizations. My sculptural work has been displayed in numerous locations in New England. These include bronzes and sculptural mosaics. <h3><strong>What is this project? : </strong></h3> <p>Inspired by the <em>En Plein Air</em> exhibition on NYC's High Line, <strong>Go Out Doors - Neighbors</strong> builds upon and extends The Umbrella Arts Center's summer 2020 installation of artfully upcycled doors originally commissioned for the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail in West Concord's Cultural District. The exhibition intended to encourage a reconnection to nature for communities then emerging from COVID-19 isolation, at-home schooling, and telecommuting. Gorgeously decorated, recycled doors crafted by regional artists became surprising waypoints of delight while traveling bike paths and walking trails. Some emphasize local wildlife and environmental themes; others are fun and whimsical, stressing exercise and companionship. In 2021, Go Out Doors - Neighbors projects have continued to spread, with new art doors installed or planned in Carlisle, Westford, Concord, Arlington, Lexington, Medford, Groton, Minute Man National Historical Park, and eight villages in Newton including Auburndale; Newton Centre; Newton Highlands, Newton Upper Falls, Newtonville, Nonantum, Waban and West Newton.Background, wayfinding, photos, information about the artists, calls for new proposals, and other news will be updated throughout the season at <a href=\"https://theumbrellaarts.org/go-out-doors-neighbors-2021\">Go Out Doors - Neighbors | The Umbrella Arts Center</a>.<br />  </p>",

Edmund Foster as <em>“Benjamin’s Tavern.”</em> While the lead elements of the British column pushed onward toward the crest of Fiske hill, the rear-guard skirmished with encroaching militia. Foster recalled;</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“ a man rode up on horse back unarmed. The enemy were then passing round the hill just below the tavern. They had posted a small body of their troops on the north side of the hill, which fired upon us. The horse and his rider fell instantly to the ground; the horse died immediately, but the man received no injury. We were quick at the spot, from which we returned the fire.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p><br /> In the low area between the Bluff and Fiske Hill the British rear-guard ran a gauntlet of <em>“plaguy fire,” </em>from more arriving militia. During the late-19<sup>th</sup> century, local historian Frank Coburn recounted,<em> “Many British were wounded, and many killed, along this part of Battle Road.

At this narrow river crossing the soldiers guarded access to the town while their comrades searched for illegal weapons and supplies hidden in the surrounding farms. Only yards away, nearly 400 colonial militia gathered on a hilltop to observe the regulars. When a plume of dark smoke appeared from the center of Concord those militia decided to advance for fear the regulars were burning their homes. As one British officer recalled, <em>\"We had not been long in this situation when we saw a large body of men drawn up with the greatest regularity and approach'd us seemingly with an intent to attack…\"</em> Outnumbered, the regulars retreated back across the river, some attempting to rip boards from the bridge before the militia could cross.</p> <p>In panicked ranks the British light infantry fired two warning shots before deliberately aiming into the oncoming militia. The ragged volley killed Militia Captain Isaac Davis and private Abner Hosmer instantly. Major. John Buttrick, leading the advance, called out to the militia, \"Fire, fellow soldiers, for god's sake fire!\" In the hail of musketry that followed two British regulars fell dead, a third mortally wounded, and nine additional men injured. Shortly thereafter the light infantry retreated in confusion back toward Concord, leaving their dead where they fell.</p> <p>Research of muster rolls from the 4th Regiment of Foot indicates Thomas Smith, Patrick Gray, and James Hall, as those possibly killed near the North Bridge. Unfortunately, records of the day are scarce, and it is difficult to know for certain. In recent years, historical scholarship indicates James Hall may have survived the ordeal at the Bridge.</p> <h3>Controversy at the bridge</h3> <p>Minutes after fighting erupted at the North Bridge, additional British soldiers returning from searching Col. Barret's farm marched down the causeway and crossed the river unopposed. As they approached the opposite bank they saw two of their fellow soldiers laying dead and least five men attested they saw one of their comrades with \"the skin over his Eye's cut and also the top part of his ears cut off…\"<br /> <br /> Upon returning to the main column in town, those witnesses spread word that the Militia were scalping the wounded. This rumor later grew into one highlighting the \"cruelty and barbarity of the rebels,\" and eventually claimed, the wounded soldiers were \"…afterwards scalp'd their Eyes goug'd their Noses and Ears cut off...\" <br /> <br /> With emotions running high after the fight, both British Regulars and Colonial Militia delivered sworn testimony about the events at the bridge. From this we learn that shortly after the fight two men, Zerchariah Brown and Thomas Davis, \"buried the dead bodies of the King's troops that were killed at the North-Bridge in Concord, on the nineteenth day of April, 1775, where the action first began, and that neither of those persons were scalped, nor their ears cut off, as has been represented.\" <br /> <br /> For decades, interested parties argued the facts of the engagement. Eventually, local sources claimed that a young militia solider named Ami White had dispatched the wounded soldier with a hatchet blow to the skull.  </p> <h3>The Grave Markers</h3> <p>In <i>Mosses from the Old Manse,</i> famed author Nathanial Hawthorne wrote, \"A humbler token of the fight, yet a more interesting one than the granite obelisk, may be seen close under the stone-wall, which separates the battle-ground from the precincts of the parsonage. It is the grave-marked by a small, moss-grown fragment of stone at the head, and another at the foot- the grave of two British soldiers, who were slain in the skirmish. \" Today the remains of those small grave markers rest on the northern side of the stonewall.</p> <p>In 1870, Concord's superintendent of public grounds erected \"a small stone slab, with a suitable inscription,\" in preparation for the centennial anniversary, as the two small stones marking the grave were \"neither seen nor understood by strangers.\" The stone slab inscribed \"Grave of British Soldiers\" cost the town $25. In 1877, the town placed additional granite post and chain fencing around the gravesite and in 1910 added an additional marker adorned with a section of James Russel Lowell's poem \"Lines.\" Lowell wrote the poem after visiting the gravesite with Nathanial Hawthorne in 1849.</p> <p>The grave site today is cared for by the National Park Service in partnership with the Town of Concord. Every April, on the annual commemoration of the battle, the grave is newly decorated in a moving ceremony by British reenactors.<br />  </p> <div class=\"accordion-list\"> <div aria-multiselectable=\"true\" class=\"panel-group accordion-list-group accordion-list-items\" id=\"accordion1605824756009\" role=\"tablist\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1673887353241\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1673887353241\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673887353241\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673887353241\">Historical Sources</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1673887353241\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1673887353241\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\">Dietrich-Smith D. 2004.

Unfortunately, his name remains a mystery consumed by the passage of time and the scattered evidence of his death did not appear in historical records until nearly 125 years afterward.<br /> <br /> According to local legend, this soldier was mortally wounded during the British retreat on April 19, 1775, and left to the mercy of his pursuers. Around the year 1900, a local Newspaper published an article claiming that a British Grenadier, mortally wounded during the retreat, was left in the care of Catherine Smith, wife of Captain William Smith. This article likely written by Frank Hersey, was repeated in his later work titled, \"The Hero's of the battle road.\" According to Hersey, the children of Mary Hartwell, related:</p> <blockquote>\"Near Captain Smith's house another grenadier was shot. His companions, seeing the wound was mortal, left him by the roadside. This soldier was later carried into Captain Smith's house and his wounds were dressed. Here he lingered alive three or four days. During this time he felt he caused the Smiths so much trouble, and he was suffering with such pain, that he begged them again and again to dispatch him. Finally, when dying, he told the maid that she would find a gold sovereign sewed in the lining of his coat. She could not find it, but he reiterated with his last words that it was there. After he was dead, Mrs. Smith herself found it. He is buried in a field on the southernly side of the road a little west of Folly Pond.\"</blockquote> <p>Again, little evidence of this encounter is present in the historical record today. Recent scholarship indicates a payment claim submitted by local Doctor Joseph Fiske may hold the truth of the matter. According to the claim, Fiske cared for two wounded soldiers in the town of Lincoln following the fighting, but the locations of those wounded are unlisted.</p>   <p>In the last decades of the 19th century, another historian, Frank Coburn traversed the battle road interviewing local farmers. While Coburn makes no mention of a soldier being cared for by Catherine Smith, he does relate: <i>\"…an American bullet terminated the life of one Briton at least. The remains were uncovered a few years ago when the road builders were widening and grading anew the highway. He was re-interred over the bordering wall in the field…a short distance… from Folly Pond.\"</i> According to Coburn, <i>\"Mr. George Nelson, near-by resident… saw the remains and pointed out to me in 1890 the locations of the old and new graves.\"</i></p>   <p>Today a rough cut stone marks the approximate vicinity of this soldier's grave along the battle road trail. Although his name is forgotten and the circumstances of his burial are conflicted, the consequences of his passing likely rippled through the community of people who knew him. Today, we remember the fallen who never left this hallowed ground within Minute Man National Historical Park.</p>   <h4>Sources:</h4> <ul> <li>Jonas and Samuel Hartwell as cited by Frank Hersey in Hero's of the Battle Road, 1775, (Boston: Perry Walton, 1930), 27.</li> <li>Frank Hersey, \"The British Regulars' Rout,\" Boston Evening Transcript, April 18, 1900, 16.</li> <li>Dr. Joseph Fiske's Bill of June 6, 1775, Lexington Historical Society Collection, Cary Memorial Library, microfilm roll 2.</li> <li>Frank Coburn, The Battle of April 19, 1775 in Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, Arlington, Cambridge, Somerville and Charlestown, Massachusetts (Lexington, Ma: Author, 1912), 103.</li> <li>Donald L.

Although later referred to as Hartwell Tavern, the house originally acted as a family residence and farmhouse until Ephraim applied for an innkeeper license in 1756. For over thirty years the Hartwell's ran an \"ordinary\" tavern out of their home until 1787.<br /> <br /> During the late 18th century, the Hartwell's became one of the wealthiest families in the town of Lincoln. In total Ephraim and Elizabeth had 14 children, nine of which survived to adulthood.<br /> <br /> The Hartwell family also enslaved one woman named Violet, however little information is yet known about Violet's story. It is presumed Violet experienced the events of April 19, 1775 however little information currently documents her narrative.<br /> <br /> The house continued to be a residence until it was purchased by the National Park Service in 1967.</p> <h3>Hartwell Tavern On April 19, 1775</h3> <p>In 1775 Hartwell Tavern sat on the main road, the \"Bay Road,\" running from Boston through western Massachusetts to Crown Point, N.Y. This was the road that British troops used on their way to find and destroy colonial military stockpiles in Concord. <br /> <br /> On the night of April 18th, 1775 an advance guard of British soldiers captured colonial alarm rider Paul Revere just down the road from the tavern. Dr. Samuel Prescott of Concord, who was riding with Paul Revere and William Dawes, escaped by leaping his horse over a stone wall and fleeing through pasture and swamp. Prescott re-entered the main road near Hartwell Tavern and alerted the family who in turn spread the alarm of the British military expedition to their neighbors, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/captain-william-smith-house-1692.htm\">William Smith</a>, Captain of the Lincoln minute man company.<br /> <br /> Three of Ephraim and Elizabeth Hartwell's sons answered the alarm as Minute Men that morning. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/samuel-hartwell-house-circa-1695.htm\">Samuel (age 33)</a> and John (age 28) were both sergeants, and Isaac (23) was a private: All three went on to later military service in the Revolutionary War. -- <u>Massachusetts</u> <u>Soldiers & Sailors of the Revolutionary War,</u> <u>Boston</u>, 1900, pp.393-396.<br /> <br /> Later in the morning, the British column passed by the tavern on their way to Concord. Mary Hartwell, daughter-in-law to Ephraim and Elizabeth recalled the massive column of soldiers, bayonets fixed, marching through the area. It is believed after the soldiers passed, the remaining Hartwell's fled to a safer location away from the road.<br /> <br /> The Lincoln Minute Men fought the British column at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/concord-s-north-bridge.htm\">Concord's North Bridge</a> that morning and then again along <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/planyourvisit/the-battle-road-trail.htm\">the battle road</a> that afternoon. When the British soldiers exited Concord around 12:30 p.m. Capt. Smith's company engaged. With thousand's of militia soldiers pouring into the fight from surrounding towns, combat spread along the Bay Road from Concord and eventually into the fields surrounding Hartwell Tavern. As the British soldiers attempted to escape, militia fired on the column from behind every boulder, stone wall, and tree. Near Hartwell Tavern, British soldiers killed three colonial militia behind a barn, however many British regulars were also wounded or killed in the surrounding area.<br /> <br /> There are no records or stories about soldiers entering the tavern for any reason, but still, the Hartwell family returned home late on April 19, 1775 to a horrific landscape. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/mary-hartwell-and-the-alarm-on-april-19-1775.htm\">Mary Hartwell</a> recalled she could scarcely sleep that night knowing dead men lay strewn along the road. According to local tradition, the next morning Ephraim Hartwell hitched his team of oxen to a cart and scoured his property collecting the dead British soldiers left behind. In total the Hartwell family helped collect <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/british-grave-near-bloody-angle.htm\">five British soldiers</a> killed near their home and buried them in the Lincoln town burial ground.<br /> <br /> At the end of April 19, 1775, the siege of Boston and the American Revolution had begun. All Hartwell sons survived their experience as Minute Men and entered service in the Massachusettus army thereafter. </p>   <h3>Restoration</h3> <p>During it's long history, Hartwell Tavern was modified and modernized. In the 1980's, the Park Service restored the structure to its 1775 appearance, however keeping its 1783 and 1830 additions. <strong> </strong> The main structure, the foundation, most of the walls, and some of the flooring are original.</p> <p>Preservationists removed the modern exterior clapboarding and replaced it with clapboarding made in the same way that 18th c. clapboarding was made.</p> <p>Many of the windows have original 18<sup>th</sup> c. glass salvaged from other houses being demolished, and pieced into reproduction window frames. The nails are hand wrought by modern blacksmiths using traditional techniques, as were the iron latches, hinges, etc. made by the blacksmith at Saugus Ironworks NHS.</p> <p>During restoration, workers found the remains of original 18th century plastering in every room except the tavern room. In addition, 18th century paint found underneath modern layers of paint and wallpaper informed workers of original colors. Using these discoveries the teams restored the rooms as they originally looked in the 18th century.</p> <p>In all, about 60 - 70 % of the \"original\" structure remains within the restored house.</p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/tour-hartwell-tavern.htm\">Tour Hartwell Tavern</a></h3>",

        "notes": "Job Brooks House, 1740\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/job-brooks-house-1740.htm\n\nOn April 19, 1775, Job Brooks (1717-1794) and his family lived in the house he built in 1740, just east of his second cousin Samuel Brooks’s house on the Bay Road in Concord. His house was located on the border of the town of Lincoln in an area that had been owned by members of his family since the mid-17th century. By the time of the Revolution, this area was known as Brooks Hill, and the cluster of houses on it Brooks Village.<br /> <br /> In 1740, Hugh Brooks gave land to his son Job, possibly as a wedding present on his marriage to Anna Bridge of Lexington. The present house was built by Job at that time, and quickly filled as their children Mathew, Asa, and Anna were born. Job’s widowed mother joined the household in 1747, and lived with them until her death in 1761. Mathew married and moved to Littleton in 1766. By 1775, the household consisted of Job and Anna, both in their fifties, their daughter Anna (age 25), who married about a week after the events on April 19; and their son Asa and his wife Ruth, both 29. Job died in 1794, leaving the farm to Asa, who finally began to have children at the age of 52 with his third wife, Mary Lawrence. The farm remained in the Brooks family until 1850. Subsequent owners continued to farm the land until 1959, when it was purchased by Minute Man National Historical Park.<br /> <br /> The farm that Job Brooks owned was 24 acres, slightly below the average size for his<br /> neighborhood. According to local tax records, the farm produced corn, hay, flax (for making linen), oats, and apples. Livestock included oxen, horses, pigs, and occasionally sheep, but the largest amount of livestock were cattle, as many as sixteen in the 1770s, when Job and Asa were running the farm together. Farming in New England involved periods of intense activity. There was plowing and planting in the spring, harvesting in the fall, and times when there was little else to do than feed the livestock. Most farming families also had an occupation to earn extra money during the slower months. For Job and many of his neighbors, the tannery run by his cousin Joshua provided employment. Job was a currier for the tannery. This was a skilled occupation. Curriers finished the tanned<br /> leather by stretching, oiling, and polishing it with a stone.<br /> <br /> When the regulars were sent out from Boston on the morning of April 19, 1775, they followed the Bay Road to Concord. This route took them through the center of Brooks Village. If any of the families were still in their houses when the regulars marched by at about 6:00 AM, they would have seen the soldiers “marching in fine order,” their bayonets “glistening in the sunlight like a field of waving grain,” as one witness later described it. By 1:00 that afternoon, the regulars were passing by again on their way back to Boston after the engagement at Meriam’s Corner. Loammi Baldwin of the Woburn Militia later reported<br /> Woburn rested upon Brooks Hill until they saw the regulars approaching. Baldwin then moved his men into a wooded area just east of Job Brooks’ house where the Bay Road took a sharp turn. As the regulars reached what is now known as Bloody Angle, they were caught in a heavy crossfire from Baldwin’s men on the east, and troops from several other towns who had crossed Joshua Brooks’ tannery field on the west. Eight British soldiers and three Americans died, and many others were wounded at the edge of Brooks Village that day.<br /> <br /> At the age of 58 in 1775, Job Brooks was almost too old to be required to join the militia, but his 30-year-old son Asa would have still been drilling regularly. Unfortunately, the records of the Concord militia companies are incomplete for April 19, so we do not know if Job or his son turned out that day. Asa, however, does appear in the records as a sergeant in Captain George Minot’s Militia Company in 1776 and 1778.<br /> <br /> Today, the Job Brooks House serves as a storage facility for Minute Man National Historical Park’s archaeological collection of more than a quarter-million artifacts from the early Archaic period (about 10,000 years ago) through the 20th century.",

His great-grandfather, William Buttrick, was born in England about 1617. William was among the dozen families who established the English settlement at the former Pennacook Indian villiage of Musketaquid (now Concord) in 1635. In the records of 1635, twelve lots totaling 215 acres are credited to William Buttrick.<br /> <br /> Jonathan Buttrick, Maj. John Buttrick’s father, built the house on family property on the north side of the Groton Road between 1710 and 1717. It was a two story house, rectangular in shape with an ell on the northwest side. Like most Colonial era homes, it has seen many alterations over the years.<br /> <br /> In 1760 (June 24) John Buttrick married Abigail Jones, and over a 20 year period had ten children: John, Levi, Jonas, Abigail, Esther, Anna, Stephen, Phebe, Horatio Gates, and Silas. Always listed as a “Gentleman” in town records, John held a number of civilian jobs in town.<br /> <br /> At the time of the battle in 1775, the 44 year-old John Buttrick was a well respected farmer in Concord and was active in town government. Up to 1775 he held several town posts: fence viewer, field driver, surveyor, tythingman, and had been constable for three years.<br /> During the Revolution Major Buttrick worked actively on various committees. He served on the committee of Correspondence, Inspection, and Safety which coordinated the policies and activities between the towns and colonies, and subsequently the young republic. He was also in charge of raising troops from Concord.<br /> <br /> During the summer of 1775, John served as major in the regiment of Col. John Nixon at the siege of Boston. He was commissioned lieutenant-colonel of Col. John Robinson’s regiment, August 1, 1775, and was colonel of volunteers, acting as captain in Colonel Reed’s regiment at the taking of Burgoyne at Saratoga, serving from September 28 to November 7, 1777. In the Rhode Island campaign in 1778, his regiment was called to reinforce the Continental Army.<br /> <br /> From 1779 to 1785 John served as a town selectman, and in 1785, Concord voted that the “Thanks of the Town” be returned to Col. John Buttrick for his good services.<br /> <br /> In 1790 Buttrick held his last post as fish officer, a calm job. A man of Concord, Buttrick lived out his years in the house that now bears his name.",

They had been sent to Concord to seize and destroy colonial stockpiles of arms and military supplies. The day had so far been a disappointment. Many of the stockpiles had been removed from Concord before the British regulars arrived. Worse, there had been fighting in Lexington and later that morning in Concord. The alarm was raised throughout the countryside and minute man and militia companies were mobilizing and marching toward the area in great numbers.<br /> <br /> When the column of regulars reached Meriam's Corner, about a mile east of Concord's center, newly arrived companies from Reading, Chelmsford and Billerica arrived and took cover behind the Meriam houses and barns. First to arrive was a company of Reading minute men under the command of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/governor-john-brooks-at-the-fight-at-meriam-s-corner.htm\">Captain Brooks</a>. They had separated from their regiment a few miles up the Bedford Road and pushed ahead towards Concord. When they arrived they saw the British light infantry descending Meriam Hill and pulling back towards the road to cross a small bridge over Elm Brook. Thus temporarily without the protection of its flank guard, the British column was vulnerable to attack. Captain Brooks ordered his men to open fire. </p> <div class=\"panel panel-default collapsible-item\" id=\"Collapsible1673990467288\"> <div class=\"panel-heading collapsible-item-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1673990467288\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"panel-title collapsible-item-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673990467288\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673990467288\"><span>Account of Reverend Edmund Foster</span></a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1673990467288\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse collapsible-item-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1673990467288\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <p class=\"panel-body collapsible-item-body\"><em>\"We rendezvoused near the middle of the town of Bedford, left horses, and marched forward in pursuit of the enemy.

The British troops and the Americans, at that time, were equally distant from Merriam's corner. About twenty rods short of that place, the Americans made a halt. The British marched down the hill with very slow, but steady step, without music, or a word being spoken that could be heard. Silence reigned on both sides. As soon as the British had gained the main road, and passed a small bridge near that corner, they faced about suddenly, and fired a volley of musketry upon us.

First of all, Captain Brooks' company from Reading, pressing ahead of their regiment, arrived in time to engage the rear of the British column. Second, the column had to pull in their flank guards to cross a bridge over Elm Brook. This slowed their progress and allowed the militiamen to take up positions behind the Meriam houses and outbuildings within range of the bridge and the road.<br /> <br /> It's also interesting that Captain Brooks did not wait to see who was going to fire first. According to his account once they realized the red-coated soldiers descending Meriam hill were British regulars, they opened fire. This would make the fight at Meriam's Corner the first offensive action taken by the colonists in the war. </p>",

Not far from the house, Lexington Road narrowed to cross a small brook. In the early afternoon of April 19, 1775, the retreating British column was attacked here by militiamen from the towns of Reading, Chelmsford and Billerica who had just arrived on the Bedford Road. In order to cross the brook, the British column pulled in their flank guard. This allowed the militiamen to get close enough to fire upon them and inflict casualties. From this point on, the fire would not cease until the British regulars arrived at Charlestown,16 miles away! <br /> <br /> Joseph and Sarah Meriam came to Concord from Kent, England in 1638 with six children. The youngest son, John was the first to be born in North America. It is John and his wife Mary who built the first dwelling on the land now known as Meriam's Corner in 1663. A generation later in 1691 their son, also named John, and his wife Sarah, built a second dwelling at the corner. In 1705 another son, Joseph and his wife Dorothy Brooks built a third dwelling.<br /> <br /> By the spring of 1775, John and Sarah had sold their 1691 house and moved to Littleton. John’s brother, Ebenezer (who was married several times and is presumed to have moved away from Concord) passed the 1663 house on to younger brother, Joseph, who passed the house to his son, Josiah. Joseph and Dorothy’s 1705 house was passed on to their son Nathan and his wife Abigail. It is this 1705 Meriam home in which Nathan and Abigail lived in 1775 that still stands today.<br /> <br /> The family members living at Meriam’s Corner included Nathan and Abigail, in their fifties, in one house with seven children between the ages of 11 and 29. A yeoman farmer, Nathan served as town selectman. In the other house Josiah and his wife Lydia, both 49, lived with ten children between the ages of 7 and 27. Josiah was a Sergeant in Capt. Joseph Hosmer’s Minute Company in Concord and his 19 year-old son, also named Josiah, was a private in the same company.<br /> <br /> Meriam family oral tradition holds that on that morning, <em>“when the alarm was given in Concord that the British soldiers were coming, Josiah Meriam, with his sons, Josiah, Jr., and Timothy, went to the village, and later were among the forces at the North Bridge, and probably crossed the meadows and appeared again at the encounter near the house. Joseph, Josiah’s youngest son, then seven years old, remained at home, as he always said, ‘to take care of the women’ and soon went with them to a place of refuge behind the hill. The British soldiers entered the house, helped themselves to whatever breakfast they could find, taking the unbaked pies from the oven…”</em>",

        "notes": "Parker's Revenge\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/parker-s-revenge.htm\n\nOn the morning of April 19, 1775, Lexington’s militia company under the command of Captain John Parker was confronted with a terrible dilemma. Several hundred British soldiers had been spotted on the road barely half a mile away. Should the militiamen stay in their homes and hope the soldiers pass by peacefully, or do they unite and confront them? They chose to stand their ground. According to Captain John Parker <em>“We gathered on the green in said Lexington to consult what to do, and concluded not to be discovered nor meddle nor make with the soldiers unless they should insult us. Upon their sudden approach I immediately ordered my company to disperse and not to fire.”</em><br /> <br /> The first shots of the American Revolution occurred at roughly 5:30 in the morning, April 19, 1775. In the space of no more than a few minutes, life for the people of Lexington had changed forever. Eight of their neighbors and relatives were dead and ten were wounded. What they did next is a testimony to their courage and the leadership of Captain Parker.<br /> <br /> Nathan Munroe, veteran of the April 19 battle, remembered fifty years later, <em>“About the middle of the forenoon Captain Parker having collected part of his company, I being with them, determined to meet the regulars on their retreat from Concord. We met the regulars in the bounds of Lincoln. We fired on them and continued so to do until they met their reinforcement in Lexington.”</em><br /> <br /> <br /> Where did this second encounter occur? Following a multi-year historical and archaeological investigation funded by the Friends of Minute Man National Park, under the direction of project archaeologist Margaret (Meg) Wilkes (Watters), and with the help of several dedicated volunteers, we can now say with near certainty that we have an answer.<br /> <br /> Just yards from the border of Lincoln and Lexington there is a prominent rocky outcrop that for decades had been identified as the site of the battle. However there was virtually no physical or historical evidence to support this claim. The investigative team began looking in the woods just north of the outcrop in the hopes of finding evidence of the British “flankers”. The flankers would have operated in the fields and woods along the road to protect the marching column and keep it moving. To everyone’s surprise, not only did they find evidence of the flankers, they also found evidence of the militia in the woods as well.<br /> <br /> The land in that area rises gently from the road up to a wooded, boulder-strewn ridge. There is room in that position for at least 70-100 troops to find cover. From there they can direct their fire upon the road, and upon a small bridge that crossed a stream. Unlike the rocky outcrop, the position in the woods also allows for an easy withdrawal and cannot be outflanked.<br /> <br /> From the data collected during the investigation it appears that militiamen on the ridge fired toward British soldiers as they deployed into the woods to the left of the road as they crossed the bridge. The British soldiers, once deployed, returned the fire and the militia withdrew northeast towards Lexington. The soldiers then likely moved up and held the high ground as the rest of the column moved through.<br /> <br /> And so with this discovery, a centuries-long mystery was solved. Historians also learned a great deal about the conduct of the fighting on the Battle Road. While this was a running fight with little by way of proper 18th century tactics, here at least there is tactical thinking evident. Having left Lexington center before noon, Captain Parker and his militiamen had time to think about how to use the landscape to their advantage. Perhaps still questioning the decision to make a stand on the town green, Captain Parker was not going to be careless with the lives of his neighbors, relatives and friends. If the stand on the Green was meant as a show of resolve more than an invitation to battle, the fight on the town border in the afternoon was the real thing.<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"Aerial photo showing a wooded landscape with a historic road cutting through it.

It was here that Paul Revere, William Dawes, and Dr. Samuel Prescott ran into a patrol of British officers who were out on the road to stop any express riders from Boston. They captured Revere (and let him go a few hours later without his horse). Dawes turned around and escaped; and Samuel Prescott made it through the ambush and delivered the alarm to Concord.<br /> <br /> In Longfellow’s famous poem, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” Revere is the sole rider spreading the alarm to “every Middlesex village and farm.” In reality Paul Revere was part of a larger system established by Patriot leaders to alarm the countryside and muster the minute men and militia. This was the work of the Committee of Safety, a part of the Provincial Congress.<br /> <br /> In March of 1775 they established “watches” to be kept at Roxbury, Cambridge and Charlestown in order to give early warning of any British movement. Couriers were designated to carry the alarm to the towns where the magazines were located.<span style=\"font-size: 7.875px;\"> </span>Designated men in those towns, like Col. James Barrett, were likewise instructed to send riders out when they received the news of a British march.</p> <br />  ",

How could they find joy in one of the most traumatic times for the descendants of Africa? Children are resilient in imagination and play. To depict the black experience in joy needs to be a constant in my work. I am free to create my own image of a hero, whom we have no visual references to copy. I choose to show him as a young boy who chose to fight along with his owner as a young man. I choose to focus on this black boy's joy. Joy used to psychologically prepare him for a life of servitude and war. I imagine he was great friends with African American poet, Phyllis Wheatley, the first black artist/advocate I read about as a child. Both accomplished black Americans, who earned their freedom with weapons of battle and art. Thank you ancestors, for your service to my freedom and my Black Joy. <i>Ase' & Ayibobo. </i><br /> <br /> <b>On the back of the door:</b> A history and silhouette of black soldier Prince Estabrook.<br /> <b>On the front of the door:</b> Vignettes with restored materials, acrylic paint, exterior paint.</p> <h3><b>Artist Bio:</b></h3> <p>Cassandre Charles was born in Boston, MA at Boston City Hospital, in 1971. Her parents migrated from Haiti so her father’s band, Volo Volo, could pursue international opportunities. Both her paternal grandfathers were multi-media artists. One an eccentric free spirit she never met. The other sweet doting grandpa ,who was a too stern disciplinary dad. He gave her Herhey’s kisses on the sly and called her Ti Pingi (Little Twig).<br /> <br /> As an Interdisciplinary/Embodiment artist with fiery Haitian artistic blood and revolutionist’s fire, she’s developed a style of story-telling filled with beautiful rage and cryptic symbols, bended text and cultural, ritualistic, embodiment Her obsession with anatomy seeps through all her mediums in a range of displays that drive the intention of supporting social justice and human rights advocacy endeavors. There are streaks of pop-culture and music references confirming her ownership to the label, “mature African-Haitian-American artist”. Her self portraits reflect her social cultural upbringing and educational career at Hampton University, a historically black college in the 90s.<br /> <br /> Her choreography shows her physicality and natural understanding of the human body. Her thirst for information and training shows appropriate representation of movements of dances of the world and her true love movement, classical ballet<br /> <br /> This summer Cassandre starts as a member of somatic expert Joshua Elbaum’s Somatic Artistry Cohort and the ArtsAssembly Creative Cohort. She will continue as Artist Collaborator with Monkeyhouse and the Boston Dance Alliance Dance & Disabilities Cohort on developing accessible resources for people with visible and invisible disabilities. Her fall residency “works in process” show will take place at Rocco Ricci Studio in Allston MA, where she is Studio Resident Artist.  <br /> <br /> Cassandre holds a BA in Speech, Interpersonal & Organizational Communication from Hampton University. She will begin the low residency MFA program at Mass College of Art in the summer of 2022.<br /> <br />  </p> <h3><b>What is this project?:</b></h3> <p>Inspired by the <em>En Plein Air</em> exhibition on NYC's High Line, <strong>Go Out Doors - Neighbors</strong> builds upon and extends The Umbrella Arts Center's summer 2020 installation of artfully upcycled doors originally commissioned for the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail in West Concord's Cultural District. The exhibition intended to encourage a reconnection to nature for communities then emerging from COVID-19 isolation, at-home schooling, and telecommuting. Gorgeously decorated, recycled doors crafted by regional artists became surprising waypoints of delight while traveling bike paths and walking trails. Some emphasize local wildlife and environmental themes; others are fun and whimsical, stressing exercise and companionship. In 2021, Go Out Doors - Neighbors projects have continued to spread, with new art doors installed or planned in Carlisle, Westford, Concord, Arlington, Lexington, Medford, Groton, Minute Man National Historical Park, and eight villages in Newton including Auburndale; Newton Centre; Newton Highlands, Newton Upper Falls, Newtonville, Nonantum, Waban and West Newton.Background, wayfinding, photos, information about the artists, calls for new proposals, and other news will be updated throughout the season at <a href=\"https://theumbrellaarts.org/go-out-doors-neighbors-2021\">Go Out Doors - Neighbors | The Umbrella Arts Center</a>.</p> <p> </p>",

        "name": "Samuel Brooks House, 1692",
        "notes": "Samuel Brooks House, 1692\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/samuel-brooks-house-1692.htm\n\nOn April 19, 1775, Samuel Brooks (1739-1811) was living on the Bay Road in Concord, with his widowed mother on land first settled in 1692 by his grandfather Daniel. His house was located on the border of the town of Lincoln in an area that had been owned by members of his family since the mid-17th century. By the time of the Revolution this area was known as Brooks Hill and the cluster of houses on it, Brooks Village.<br /> <br /> Samuel Brooks’ father Samuel inherited the property in 1729. The elder Samuel built significant additions onto the original 1692 one-story house, adding a second story and an ell on the northeast side of the house. Today, the house includes the east porch that was added in 1750. The elder Samuel died in 1758. As his father’s first-born son, Samuel received significant landholdings to pass on to potential heirs but never had children of his own. When Brooks married Mary Bateman Flint in 1781, however, he became a stepfather to seven children. Though it is unclear whether any of the children followed Mary to the home of Samuel Brooks, when he died in 1811 Brooks left is property to Mary’s youngest son, Nehemiah.<br /> <br /> Nehemiah Flint experienced what was a common difficulty of post war Concord, as the youngest of the many Flint sons, there was too little land to divide in inheritance. Because he was able to inherit land from Samuel Brooks, who refers to Nehemiah as his “son-in-law,” an eighteenth century term for “stepson,” he was fortunate. Nehemiah Flint and his wife Hannah remained in the house until 1836.The house changed hands several times thereafter, including a long period in the Hartwell family. Despite the property’s turnover, all the owners were related to the Brooks family in some way, until its purchase by the National Park Service in 1963.<br /> <br /> The Samuel Brooks farm included roughly sixty acres, twice the size of the average farm in the area, and included some tillage, hayfields, pasture, and orchard. Brooks also grew corn, barley, and rye, and undoubtedly had a kitchen garden. The farm also had livestock. In 1749, the family owned a horse, four oxen, eight cows, and three pigs.<br /> <br /> When the regulars were sent out from Boston on the morning of April 19, 1775, they followed the Bay Road to Concord. This route took them through the center of Brooks Village. If any of the families were still in their houses when the regulars marched by at about 6:00 AM, they would have seen the soldiers <em>“marching in fine order,”</em> their bayonets <em>“glistening in the sunlight like a field of waving grain,”</em> as one witness later described it. By 1:00 that afternoon, the regulars were passing by again on their way back to Boston after the engagement at Meriam’s Corner. Loammi Baldwin of the Woburn Militia later reported that Woburn rested upon Brooks Hill until they saw the regulars approaching. Baldwin then moved his men into a wooded area just east of Brooks Village where the Bay Road took a sharp turn. As the regulars reached what is now known as Bloody Angle, they were caught in a heavy crossfire from Baldwin’s men on the east, and troops from several other towns that had crossed Joshua Brooks’ tannery field on the west. Eight British soldiers and three Americans died, and many others were wounded at the edge of Brooks Village that day.<br /> <br /> In 1775, at the age of 36, Samuel Brooks would have been drilling regularly with the Concord militia. Unfortunately, the records of the Concord militia companies are incomplete for April 19, but it is more than likely that Samuel joined his family and neigbors that day. In 1777, however, Samuel was drafted into a militia company to support the Continental Army, but he was allowed to pay ten pounds “in lieu of service.” This was common at that time for men like Samuel, who was the sole caretaker for his widowed mother.",

Samuel Hartwell served as a sergeant in the Lincoln Minute Men and was thus part of the fighting in Concord and along the Bay Road on April 19, 1775. Mary Hartwell remained in their home on April 19th and later provided vivid firsthand descriptions of the day’s events along the Bay Road, from the British troops marching towards Concord in the early morning hours, to burying the British regulars who died in the area in the afternoon. The house was destroyed in an electrical fire in 1968 after being used as a restaurant for nearly forty years.

Around that time, two volcanic chains formed off the north coast of ancient Gondwana. Within these volcanic chains were distinct magma chambers, deep below the earth’s surface.<br /> <br /> When this magma solidified it formed vast stretches of underground rock at the heart of the two island chains; the older Avalon terrane, and the younger Nashoba terrane. Eventually the younger Nashoba terrane separated from the continent of Gondwana and moved towards the continent of Laurasia, the ancient North American coast. When the Nashoba terrane collided, it sutured with ancient North America. About 20 million years later, the Avalon terrane also followed suit and collided with the Nashoba Terrane rocks. This caused the continent to grow larger, and mountains to rise. This is a process called terrane accretion, where island terranes smash into the edge of continents.<br /> <br /> The “Bloody Bluff,” a rock outcrop within Minute Man NHP shows the contact point between the Nashoba terrane and the Avalon terrane—the point where two worlds collided millions of years ago. By examining evidence such as this outcrop, scientists can reconstruct ancient conditions of the landscape. It is now thought that at one point the crust was nine miles thicker than it is today—meaning that there were once grand mountains within the park long ago.<br /> <br />  </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1673992517044\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1673992517044\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517044\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517044\">Early History</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1673992517044\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1673992517044\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\">The Bluff has historical significance starting much earlier than April 19, 1775. Human inhabitation of this region dates back over twelve thousand years and by the early seventeenth century Algonquian people had been living along the Musketequid River (Concord River) for about a thousand years. Before contact with Europeans these indigenous peoples hunted large game in the surrounding forests including those that covered the modern-day bluff.<br /> <br /> When puritan families ventured inland around 1635, they claimed the prosperous land along the Musketequid River as their own. In a short time, Europeans cleared large tracts of forest to establish Concord Plantation, now Concord, Massachusetts. In the area of the Bluff, the colonists worked to replace forests with farm fields and animal pastures. While most rocky outcrops became farm walls, the scale of the bluff hindered any significant restructuring during the early colonial period.<br /> <br /> By the mid-18th century the bluff was likely a wooded outcrop owned by the Whittemore family. While the steep cliff face posed a challenge for agricultural endeavors, the Whittemore’s allowed the striking hilltop to grow a thick coverage of trees. During the early colonial period, the local community constructed a road running through the region and took special care to wrap it around the base of the bluff as opposed to going over it. Eventually the road to Concord Plantation became the Bay Road</div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1673992517043\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1673992517043\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517043\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517043\">April 19, 1775</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1673992517043\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1673992517043\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\">On the morning of April 19, 1775, seven-hundred British soldiers passed the bluff on their march to raid military stockpiles in Concord. Later that day the same British column, excluding scores of casualties, fought a short rear-guard action on the bluff to cover their hasty retreat to Boston.<br /> <br /> After rushing through a hail of musketry along the Bay Road, the weary British soldiers crossed a small bridge near the home of Tabitha Nelson; six hundred yards west of the bluff. In the blink of an eye concealed militia from Captain Parker’s Lexington company poured a heavy volley into the British ranks before retiring to better ground. When flanking companies of British light infantry engaged Parker’s men at the small wooded rise, the lead elements of the British column continued down the road and passed the Whittemore Farm.<br /> <br /> With over a thousand Colonial militia quickly closing on the column, the British rear-guard passed the Whittemore house and the Bull Tavern before ascending the sloped sides of the bluff. From this commanding viewpoint covered by trees, the Regulars watched Colonial militia advance to the tavern, a building that Reading militia man Rev. Edmund Foster knew as “Benjamin’s Tavern.” The British rear-guard then opened fire from the high ground at the bluff and covered the lead elements of their column now ascending Fiske hill. Rev. Edmund Foster with the Reading militia near the Tavern recalled, <em>“a man rode up on horse back unarmed. The enemy were then passing round the hill just below the tavern. They had posted a small body of their troops on the north side of the hill, which fired upon us. The horse and his rider fell instantly to the ground; the horse died immediately, but the man received no injury. We were quick at the spot, from which we returned the fire.”</em><br /> <br /> Dramatically outnumbered and outflanked the British detachment atop the bluff withdrew. As the regulars descended the rocky hillside into the low area behind, more colonial militia hidden behind trees, rocks and fence rails on Fiske Hill opened fire. Desperately attempting to protect the column and cover the retreat, a mounted British officer galloped to the front. Edmund Foster continued, <em>“An officer, mounted on an elegant horse, and with drawn sword in his hand, was riding backwards and forwards, commanding and urging on the British troops. A number of Americans behind a pile of rails, raised their guns and fired with deadly effect. The officer fell, and the horse took fright, leaped the wall, and ran directly towards those who had killed his rider. The enemy discharged their musketry in that direction, but their fire took no effect.”</em><br /> <br /> Colonial militia quickly stripped the horse of the officers effects, finding a beautiful brace of engraved pistols. At the time, the militia claimed their prize belonged to Col. Pitcairn commanding the detachment of British Marines, however recent scholarship indicates the pistols instead belonged to another British officer, Captain William Crosbie of the 38th Regiment’s grenadier company, wounded on April 19, 1775.<br /> <br /> After abandoning their position near the bluff and descending into the low ground before Fiske Hill the British rear-guard ran a gauntlet of <em>“plaguy fire,”</em> from the concealed militia.  In this area, Concord Historian Frank Coburn stated, <em>“many British were wounded, and many killed, along this part of Battle Road.”</em> At some point between Parker’s Revenge and Lexington, colonial militia also wounded Lt. Col Smith, commanding the entire British column. Exhausted from continuous skirmishing and missing numerous officers, the British ranks quickly devolved into a general route one mile from Lexington center. Fortunately for the exhausted British soldiers, a relief column of 1000 reinforcements and two artillery pieces arrived in Lexington.<br /> <br /> When the fighting passed from the bluff and Fiske Hill, the injured lay scattered through the fields and homes all around. In the area of the bluff, historians recorded the burial of at least two British soldiers.. The fighting in this area had been short yet fierce.  </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1673992517041\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1673992517041\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517041\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517041\">The Changing Landscape</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1673992517041\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1673992517041\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\">During the 19th and 20th centuries the bluff and surrounding landscape underwent many changes. In the New Republic era additional farmhouses dotted the landscape and new businesses appeared driving up local travel. In 1802 and 1806 portions of the Battle Road were straightened and some new segments by-passed historic sites. In the area of the bluff, a newly constructed road by-passed areas such as the Nelson farms and accommodated increased traffic. Directly at the base of the bluff the new road intersected with the historic Bay Road, now called Massachusetts avenue. In addition, the landscape evolved when a larger tavern replaced the historic Bull’s Tavern. Construction workers also quarried rocks from the hillside east of the bluff throughout the 19th century for various  projects. Although altered, the bluff remained a source of local legend concerning April 19, 1775. In 1885 residents erected a small monument at the base of the bluff to commemorate the revolutionary history of the site.<br /> <br /> In the century following, construction work continuously cut into the historic cliff face. In 1938, workers even blasted into the rock to widen the road for automobiles, altering the bluff’s appearance dramatically. In the later 20th century, a corridor of power lines arced over the bluff, dramatically altering the battlefield viewshed yet again.</div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1673992517039\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1673992517039\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517039\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517039\">Minute Man National Historical Park</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1673992517039\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1673992517039\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\">On September 21, 1959, Public Law 86-321 established Minute Man National Historical Park, incorporating the area surrounding the bluff. The mission of the new park was to “approximate the cultural environment that existed in 1775 and preserve and interpret individual resources that contribute to understanding the events of the Battle of Lexington and Concord.” As part of this preservation and interpretation initiative, the National Park Service constructed a Visitors Center a short distance west of the bluff and reestablished pedestrian walking spaces throughout the area. In 1996 the Battle Road Trail connected major historical sections of the park following the original bay road. Today, the National Park Service preserves and interprets the bluff as a core historic site within Minute Man National Historical Park.</div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1673992517038\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1673992517038\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517038\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1673992517038\">Sources</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1673992517038\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1673992517038\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\">Coburn, Frank Warren, 1853-1923.

In 1644, just 9 years after the English town of Concord was founded, Thomas Brown, David Brown’s great grandfather, purchased the homestead from Reverend Peter Bulkeley.<br /> <br /> The purchase included “the house…on the west side of the Great River together with four acres of ground which it stands on” plus ten acres of meadow. Shortly after this, the town laid out a road from the center village, north along what is now Monument Street, then west across the river via a bridge.The road continued west from the bridge along a causeway beside the river. It then branched east and west. The west branch ran close by the Brown homestead.<br /> <br /> David Brown, born in 1732, inherited the property in 1750 after the death of his father. Sometime between 1752 and 1768 he tore down the old house and built a new one, “49 ft southwest of where the old house stood.” It was nicely situated just under the crest of the hill and beside the gently-flowing Concord River. In 1756 David married Abigail Munro. By 1776 the couple had ten children: Purchase (b. 1757); Sarah (b. 1761); Abigail (b. 1762); David (b. 1764); Ephraim (b. 1765); Elizabeth (b. 1767); William (b. 1768); Thomas (b. 1771); Reuben (Reuben, b. 1773); Joseph (b. 1776).<br /> <br /> <a href=\"#_edn6\"><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem;\">Appearance</span></a><br /> Not much is known about the appearance of the house David, Abigail and their family lived in. Middlesex County records indicate it was a two-story house with four rooms and a cellar. The homestead also contained two adjoined barns that were close to the road. In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, Concord resident John Shepard Keyes wrote that David and Abigail “seemed to have lived happily together for many years in the old red house on the bank of the river, near the battleground…” The house also appears in the famous engraving of the North Bridge fight by Amos Doolittle. However, as far as history can tell, it was a modest four-room house that was, at some point, painted red.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">April 19, 1775</span><br /> In early 1775 David Brown, who had already been active in Concord’s response to the Revolutionary crisis, was elected to command one of the town’s newly formed minute man companies and was commissioned as a captain. On April 19, 1775 Captain Brown and his company were formed up with several other companies from Concord and surrounding towns in a field on high ground overlooking <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/concord-s-north-bridge.htm\">Concord’s Bridge.</a> The place where they formed, now known as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-muster-field.htm\">Muster Field,</a> was a piece of pastureland owned by Captain Brown himself. From there he could see his home. His oldest son, Purchase, was serving as a minute man that day in his father’s company.<br /> <br /> Prior to the battle, British soldiers were posted near the Brown family house as they guarded the west branch of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-groton-road.htm\">Groton Road </a>which led to the farm of Colonel James Barrett. There is strong evidence that the house was entered by British soldiers. Brown family tradition states that a mirror belonging to the family was smashed by the soldiers. It resides today at Concord Museum. In the Doolittle engraving, the house stands just yards from the road and the colonial firing line during the fight.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">During and After the Revolution</span><br /> During the war Captain Brown remained active in the town though his military service was largely confined to his experiences on April 19, 1775. After the Revolution David Brown represented Concord in the Massachusetts Great and General Court and held many other town offices.In 1793 the old Groton road which crossed North Bridge and ran along the river close by David and Abigail’s home, was abandoned. The new road crossed the river further north. Another road, today known as Liberty St., turned west just beyond the new bridge then curved southwest running behind the Brown home.<br /> <br /> David Brown died of a fever in 1802 at age 72. The house then passed to his youngest son, Joseph. Joseph died in 1821. By that time the house had become run down. It was sold in 1822 to provide for Abigail’s support. In 1865 the property was sold to John Shepard Keyes who had it torn down. He then sold the land to Edwin Barrett who built a large mansion near the site. And so the “old red house on the bank of the river” where David and Abigail lived happily for so many years, and stood witness to the events of April 19, 1775, was lost forever. <h4>Sources</h4>   <p><a href=\"https://concordlibrary.org/special-collections/fin_aids/D_Brown\">Captain David Brown Letters, 1792-1800 | Special Collections | Concord Free Public Library (concordlibrary.org)</a><br /> <br /> Dietrich-Smith, D.

        "notes": "The Groton Road\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-groton-road.htm\n\nToday, when you walk from North Bridge Visitor Center down the wide, dirt path to the North Bridge battle site you are actually walking on a colonial road that is over three centuries old! This is the same route taken by the minute man and militia companies when they advanced upon a party of British soldiers at North Bridge on April 19, 1775.<br /> <br /> The area today occupied by the North Bridge unit of Minute Man National Historical Park was once an Indigenous settlement known as Musketaquid. In 1635 the land was purchased by the English from the indigenous inhabitants and incorporated into the town of Concord. The area beyond the river became known as the North Quarter.<br /> <br /> By 1654 the town laid out a road from the main village out to the North Quarter and constructed a bridge across Concord River. The route of this road follows much of modern-day Monument Street until you get to the entrance to the North Bridge site. At this point Monument Street continues straight north while the old road (now closed to vehicles) turns west to the North Bridge.<br /> <br /> At this same time the town constructed a one-rod (16.5’) wide elevated gravel and stone causeway which led west from the bridge about 400 feet through a meadow. The purpose of the causeway was to improve passage across the low, wet land along the riverbank. <br /> <br /> In 1699 the farm road beyond the causeway was extended and improved. The new road followed the causeway west of the bridge then turned north and east “up ye hill” (towards the current-day North Bridge Visitor Center) then turned westerly and continued to the town of Groton. This westerly turn is located at the top of the hill as you approach North Bridge Visitor Center.<br /> <br /> There was also a west branch that split off at the western end of the causeway just before the east branched made the turn “up ye hill.\" The west branch, little more than a narrow bridleway (horse path) followed the river past the Brown family house lot. Around 1750 the town widened this bridleway into a road. Both the east and west branch rejoined further west and continued passed the Barrett Farm to Groton.<br /> <br /> The causeway itself was also improved. It was originally located just south of the present-day walking path west of the North Bridge along the muddy riverbank. A 1748 petition from John Hunt and others claimed the causeway was “very long and low and narrow” and “very uncomfortable in the winter season...by reason of the drifts of snow which crowdeth people on to this river.” Two years later, Captain Jonathan Buttrick sold a strip of his land on his southern boundary to the town to build a new causeway. The town also paid for the construction of a low stone wall along the northern edge of the new causeway to separate it off from Buttrick’s property and protect his land from traffic. The new causeway ran for 400 feet west from the bridge then turned to the north under the ridge overlooking the river.<br /> <br /> In 1770 the town hired David Brown, whose home was at the western end of the causeway, to construct a wooden handrail to allow people to walk along it in times of flooding, which would remain an issue for the next two decades. The bridge was rebuilt in 1760. It was the one in use at the time of the battle on April 19, 1775.<br /> <br /> On April 19, 1775, David Brown commanded one of Concord’s two minute man companies. Key events of that momentous day would be taking place on his property within yards of his own house.<br /> <br /> Soon after arriving in Concord around 7:30 a.m. approximately 125 British soldiers crossed the North Bridge. They left 96 men behind to guard the bridge and the road. The rest continued along the west branch of the Groton Road, passed David Brown’s house, to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/colonel-james-barrett-house-1705.htm\">Colonel Barrett’s farm</a> to search for arms and supplies. The colonial soldiers, whose numbers grew to over 400 men from Acton, Concord, Bedford and Lincoln, watched and waited on high ground northwest of the bridge at a place now known as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-muster-field.htm\">Muster Field</a>, which at the time was a pasture that belonged to Captain David Brown.<br /> <br /> Sometime around 9:30 a.m. the colonial soldiers noticed smoke rising from Concord center and the decision was made to march. Captain Isaac Davis, commander of the Acton minute man company, posted himself at the head of his command which was chosen to lead the advance, drew his sword and declared “I haven’t a man who’s afraid to go!” Colonel Barrett issued the order to march but not to fire first.<br /> <br /> The colonial soldiers marched “in very good order and in double file.” Their route of march was down the east branch of the Groton Road, then onto the causeway leading to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/concord-s-north-bridge.htm\">North Bridge</a>. As they approached, the British soldiers retreated across the bridge and prepared for action.<br /> <br /> In the ensuing fight the minute men and militia were constrained by the narrowness of the old causeway. Their column was hemmed in by the river on their right and a stone wall topped with a rail on their left, beyond which was a wet meadow. A veteran of Captain David Brown’s Company, Amos Barrett, wrote that “we then was all ordered to fire and not kill our own men.” Thus constrained they could not form a proper line of battle. They remained in column, elevated their muskets and fired over each other’s heads and shoulders. It turns out the old causeway was no better suited for fighting than it was for travel!<br /> <br /> In 1793, after years of petitioning from local residents, the town of Concord finally relented and moved the river crossing to its present location, further north on current-day Monument Street. At this same time a new road was constructed which is today Liberty Street. The old Groton Road, river crossing and causeway, which played such a key role in the battle on April 19, 1775 were abandoned after the 1793 realignment and reverted to pasture and meadow.<br /> <br /> In 1836 a granite obelisk was erected at the battle site, on the east bank where the British soldiers stood. In 1874 a bridge was built on the site of the old North Bridge. In 1875, marking the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the battle, the Minute Man statue by Daniel Chester French was unveiled and dedicated. However, the land west of the North Bridge beyond the Minute Man statue remained privately owned. Visitors were prevented from exploring further by an iron fence.<br /> <br /> In 1959 the old Concord battleground became part of Minute Man National Historical Park. Eventually, the land west of the North Bridge, which had been closed off, was reopened. Historical research and archaeology were done to determine the route of the long-vanished roads. Parts of the causeway were excavated and the route of the eastern branch of the Groton Road was also uncovered. The route of the western branch was also studied. The eastern branch was then reopened as a walking trail from North Bridge Visitor Center to the North Bridge. Reopening the Groton Road allows you to more fully explore the North Bridge battle site and better understand its context within the historic landscape. As you do you are walking in the footsteps of history! <h4>Sources</h4> <p>Adams, J.

It is set near the spot where the first colonial militia men were killed in Concord on that fateful day in 1775.</p> <p>The 7 foot tall bronze statue was cast from old Civil War cannons by the Ames Foundry of Chicopee Massachusetts. The pedestal base measures 7 ½ feet tall and 4 ½ feet on each side. Inscribed on the front facing is the first stanza of the poem “The Concord Hymn” by Ralph Waldo Emerson:</p> <i></i> <p>By the rude bridge that arched the flood.<br /> Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,<br /> Here once the embattled farmers stood,<br /> And fired the shot heard round the world.</p> <p>The Minute Man has come to mean many things to many people. He stands as a reminder that sometimes our freedoms must be fought for, and to never take them for granted. He has adorned the uniforms and flags of our nation’s National Guard as they serve around the globe. This “embattled farmer” has been on postage stamps, U.S. Savings and War Bonds, coins, likenesses of the statue are on corporate logos, as well as used as mascot by local schools.<br /> <br /> Secured under the base of the stature are two time capsules. The first one placed there in 1875 includes: Lemuel Shattuck’s book History of Concord, the Account of the Fight from the Diary of Rev. William Emerson; a 1874 Town Report; Photographs of Daniel Chester French and The Minute Man; Map of the Village in 1775; Map of Center of Concord in 1874; coins, stamps, newspapers of the time and invitations to the 1875 celebration.<br /> <br /> In January of 1975 the Minute Man was removed from its base so that a mold could be made of the statue in case it were ever damaged. At that time it was suggested that a second time capsule be created for the upcoming Bicentennial of the Battle. Girl Scout troops from the Town of Concord were selected to run this project. Contents of this second time capsule are: microfilm containing images of letters, photographs and scrapbooks made by the Girl Scouts; a cassette tape with “The Sounds of Concord”; an American flag; a Bicentennial flag; military patches; Girl Scout pins; and money.<br /> <br /> The time capsules was installed on March 29, 1975, when the statue was returned to its pedestal, during a ceremony which included the Girl Scout troops and dignitaries from the town, the Girls Scouts of America, and the National Park Service.</p>",

        "notes": "The Muster Field\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-muster-field.htm\n\n<h3><strong>April 19, 1775 </strong></h3> <p>In the early morning hours of April 19, 1775 alarm riders spread news across the New England countryside that a British column numbering roughly 800 men were marching toward Concord with the intent to destroy stockpiles of colonial military supplies gathered there. Throughout the morning, thousands of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/the-militia-and-minute-men-of-1775.htm\">militia soldiers</a> gathered at predetermined meeting locations before marching onward to Concord. This act of <strong><em>“mustering”</em></strong> the companies ensured all men were present and prepared for confrontation with the British soldiers.</p> <p>By 8:00 a.m. nearly 200 colonial militia gathered in Concord and advanced to an elevated ridge above the Meriam's Corner road junction just east of town. From that position the militia observed the British column marching along the Bay Road. </p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Some were for making a stand,\"</em> remembered Concord Reverend William Emmerson,<em>\"notwithstanding the superiority of their [The British] numbers, but others more prudent thought best to retreat till our strength should be equal to the Enemy's, by Recruits from neighboring towns that were continually coming to our assistance\" </em></p> </blockquote> <p>Dramatically outnumbered the militia determined to retire across the Concord River to another hilltop position of observation. Minute man Amos Barrett recalled, </p> <blockquote> <p><em>“ [we marched] before them with our drums and fifes agoing and also the British. We had grand musick. We marched into town and then over the North Bridge a little more than half a mile and then on a hill not far from the bridge where we could see and hear what was agoing on.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>After crossing over the North Bridge, the militia retired northward to an elevated position known locally as Punkataset Hill. From this hillside the colonists observed the regulars disperse throughout Concord looking for the hidden stockpiles of military goods.   </p> <p><br /> Shortly after the militia crossed the Concord River, a detachment of British soldiers also marched out of town and crossed the North Bridge. At the river the British left 96 soldiers to guard the important access point, while roughly 120 additional men continued two miles westward to the farm of militia Col. James Barrett.  For the British soldiers stationed at the North Bridge the exposed position created discomfort. To cover the bridge and the road to Barrett’s farm, two companies of British Light Infantry advanced forward a short distance to higher ground above the bridge. The light company from the 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Foot advanced up onto the farm of militia Captain David Brown. From this position near Brown’s cow-pasture, the British soldiers guarded the westward Groton Road to Barrett’s farm and observed the militia force continually growing on Punkatasett hill farther to the northeast. At the same time another company of light infantry from the 10<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Foot advanced a short distance north to a hill where the Buttrick family homes stood.<br /> <br /> At the North Bridge, Captain W.S. Laurie of the 43<sup>rd</sup> Regiment of Foot recalled his frustration when, </p> <blockquote> <p><em>“…a Country man on horse back, rode past me, with whom I spoke, demanding where he was going, he told me, he was a Doctor going to See a patient…in a short time after, this same Doctor returned, and passing us, was Observed to go towards the Wood where those (militia) men in Arms were drawn up; In a very short time after I saw there whole body Moving towards me, as they came nearer the Light Compy of the 4<sup>th</sup>. Regt. Posted on a height immediately retreated to me at the Bridge, as did likewise the Lt. Compy of the 10<sup>th</sup>. Regt. who also had been at no great distance.” </em></p> </blockquote> <h4><strong>The Muster Field </strong></h4> <p>After gathering additional men near Punkatasset Hill, the colonial militia decided to advance toward the North Bridge for a better view into Concord. When the British light infantry screening this hilltop near and the Groton Road retreated, the militia filed across the high ground and into Captain Brown’s pasture. Lt. Jospeh Hosmer, acting as adjutant, formed the units as they arrived so that they faced the town with the minute men on the right and militia on the left. While the men waited in ranks facing the town, a group of their officers and leading citizens debated their next move. Apparently, they were still uncertain as to the events in Lexington earlier that morning. As the leaders continued their discussions, men from the neighboring town of Acton, including Captain Isaac Davis’s company of minute men arrived. Earlier in the morning, the thirty-year-old Davis and some of his men, made cartridges in his home. His four children were at that time ill, and his last words to his wife Hannah were <strong><em>“Take good care of the children.”</em></strong> After arriving and filing into line, Captain Davis joined the group of officers that were consulting a few rods away.  In the meantime, the regulars in Concord had lit fires to destroy such combustible items stockpiled for military use. As seventy-one-year-old Martha Moulton later attested,</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“…they had set fire to the great gun-carriages just by the [town] house, and while they were in flames your petitioner saw smoke arise out of the Town House… then your petitioner did put her life, as it were, in her hand, and ventured to beg of the (British) officers to send some of their men to put out the fire…”</em></p> </blockquote> <p><br /> It was about 9 o’clock when the militia forming in Captain Brown’s pasture first noticed smoke rising from the town. Concern quickly spread through the ranks, especially by those who had left their families to the mercy of the British soldiers in Concord. According to Concord tradition, Lt. Joseph Hosmer was so moved by the sight of smoke that he went to the gathering of officers and asked, <strong><em>“Will you let them burn the town down?”</em></strong> In the same moment, Captain William Smith of Lincoln volunteered his company to dislodge the British from the bridge, as did Captain Davis from Acton. <br /> <br /> With only moments to spare, the militia officers made the decision to advance against the British soldiers guarding the Bridge. Following the impromptu officer’s conference, Captain Davis returned to face his company where Acton minute man Solomon Smith recalled, Captain Davis drew his sword and said to his company, <strong><em>“I haven’t a man that is afraid to go, and gave the word ‘march.'\"</em></strong> The Acton company then took its position at the head of the column.  <br /> <br /> Stretched across this <strong><em>“Muster Field,”</em></strong> the companies of minute men and militia prepared themselves for combat. Orders were given to load their guns and many men paused to change the flints needed to ignite their gunpowder. A sharp, fresh flint ensured the musket would fire if necessary. This act demonstrated the resolve of the colonial soldiers. After replacing their flints, the men discarded the small squares on the ground at their feet, where they remained for at least 150 years until a local citizen in the 1930's discovered the artifacts laying in two perfectly straight lines where the men had formed. <br /> <br /> After preparing for action, militia Colonel James Barret took one last moment to caution his men not to fire unless fired upon first. The order to march was given, and the Acton company, formed in double file, stepped off first, followed by the Concord minute companies, the Lincoln company, and finally the Bedford companies. At the head of the column was Concord Major John Buttrick, Action Captain Isaac Davis, and Westford’s Lt. Col. John Robinson. The soldiers then filed out of Captain Brown’s pasture, now known as the Muster Field. They marched onto the Groton Road, and forward toward bloodshed at the North Bridge.   </p> <h4>Commemoration </h4> <p>In the two centuries that have passed since the battle at the North Bridge, locals, and historians have called Captain Brown’s cow-pasture many things. The term Muster Field likely comes from late-19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century telling of the events of April 19.  Although covered with a dense layer of trees, much of the field remains intact in the present day. In 1885 local citizens George and Mary Keyes dedicated a stone monument set into the wall along Liberty Street to immortalize this hilltop.   </p> <h4><br /> Sources:</h4> <p>Dietrich-Smith D. 2004.

Like many graves scattered throughout Minute Man National Historical Park, the identity of the soldiers buried in this location remains a mystery. While it is difficult to know exactly what happened in this stretch of road during the fight, 100 years after the battle historians collected family lore and local legends about the soldiers and their graves.</p> <h3>Under A Constant Fire</h3> <p>As the British column retreated from Concord to Boston on April 19, 1775, the Colonial militiamen swarmed the farmfields, woodlots, and buildings along the road. Concealed behind stone walls and trees the Militia poured deadly musket fire into the British ranks. From Concord to Boston the British column left a trail of blood and death in their wake. Near the farms of Josiah and Thomas Nelson in the town of Lincoln, local legend tells of one young militia man firing on the British soldiers at close range. After discharging his musket into enemy ranks, the boy, identified later as William Throning, retreated to a woodlot where he met a detachment of British Flankers. When the detachment opened fire, Thorning dove into a farm field ditch to avoid the hail of musketry that zipped overheard. After the soldiers moved on, Thorning continued eastward to a second field and took up position behind a large boulder. Using the rock as a gun rest Thorning fired into the British column again with deadly effect. Today, that boulder is referred to as the \"Minute Man\" boulder and remains the namesake for Minute Man National Historical Park. Although Thorning's story did not appear in the written record until the late 19th century, local legend holds that he killed two British soldiers along this stretch of the battle road. In 1890, local historian Frank Coburn walked the ground with George Nelson, a descendant of the original farm owner. During their walk, George indicated,</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Across the road from the [Josiah Nelson] house is a little knoll which is called \"The Soldiers' Graves,\" even to this day, for therein sleep two British soldiers whose summons undoubtedly came from behind the Nelson bowlders.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>While many historians question the accuracy of Thorning's story, it is difficult to definitively know the true events.</p> <p>In the late 19th century, historians counted upwards of three British soldiers killed near the Nelson homes. Frank Coburn also recorded that the descendants of Samuel Hastings, a militia man that purchased Thomas Nelson Jr.'s home in 1779, recalled a British soldier mortally wounded on the doorstep of Nelson's house. According to family legend;</p> <blockquote> <p> \"As the British column swept along, one of the soldiers left the ranks and entered the house for plunder, unmindful of the dangers lurking in the adjoining woods and fields. As he emerged and stood on the door-stone, an American bullet met him, and he sank seriously wounded. There he lay, until the family returned later in the afternoon, and found him. Tenderly they carried him into the house, and ministered to his wants as best they could, but his wound was fatal. After his death they found some of their silver spoons in his pocket. He was buried a short distance westerly from the house.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Although the stories of those British soldiers killed along this section of the battle road do not appear in written records until well over 100 years later, their place in local legend remains critical to the narrative of April 19, 1775. Today a small gravestone marks the approximate area George Nelson identified as \"The Soldiers' Graves,\" in the late 19th century.<br />  </p> <div class=\"accordion-list\"> <div aria-multiselectable=\"true\" class=\"panel-group accordion-list-group accordion-list-items\" id=\"accordion1607119590796\" role=\"tablist\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1674154333618\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1674154333618\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674154333618\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674154333618\">Learn More</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1674154333618\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1674154333618\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\"><a>Click here to mearn more about graves in Minute Man National Historical Park</a></div> </div> </div> <div class=\"collapsible-item panel panel-default\" id=\"Collapsible1674154333617\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-heading panel-heading\" id=\"headingCollapsible1674154333617\" role=\"tab\"> <h4 class=\"collapsible-item-title panel-title\"><a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674154333617\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down\"> </span></a> <a href=\"#collapseCollapsible1674154333617\">Sources</a></h4> </div> <div aria-labelledby=\"headingCollapsible1674154333617\" class=\"collapse collapsible-item-collapse panel-collapse\" id=\"collapseCollapsible1674154333617\" role=\"tabpanel\"> <div class=\"collapsible-item-body panel-body\"> <p>Douglas Sabin,<em> April 19, 1775: A Historiographical Study,</em>(Minute Man National Historical Park, Concord, 1987).<br />  </p> <p>Ellen Chase, <em>The Beginnings of the American Revolution, </em>Vol III, (Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons, Ltd.

Early occupants of the house included Samuel Whitney, member of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in 1775 and muster master for Concord's minute man companies. On April 19, 1775 the house was directly mentioned by General Thomas Gage as a place to be searched for arms and supplies. Despite British soldiers marching right passed the house as they entered Concord there is no evidence they stopped and searched it.

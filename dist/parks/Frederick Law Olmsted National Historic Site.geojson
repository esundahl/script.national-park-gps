Olmsted Brothers partner James Frederick Dawson recommended a preservation and enhancement plan for the native vegetation, as well as a practice golf course and pools, but Anderson never requested the firm to draw any plans.<br /> <br /> While little was done at Anderson’s estate, it shows how much Olmsted Brothers, particularly John Charles Olmsted, appreciated the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. In 1909, Anderson did consult with Olmsted Brothers on landscape improvements, with Dawson making a visit that summer. Dawson wrote that “Mr. Anderson’s house is beautifully located, nestled into the edge of the timber land and commanding fine views looking out across the sea.”<br /> <br /> Respecting the natural setting Dawson recommended “development in a modest way, such as properly arranging drives, court yards and walks, together with planting…of the native sort such as the Dogwood, wild roses and syringas [mock orange]…to strengthen the character of the present growth.” Known today as Graysmarsh Farm, it is used as a commercial berry farm and private hunting retreat, far more rustic than Anderson ever envisioned.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=2192,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157677334762037/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/03723\">Olmsted Online </a><br />  ",

Eliot worked to secure the land donations to honor his late son.<br /> <br /> In 1916, the year Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.’s Organic Act would be signed into law, land in Mount Desert Island was acquired by the federal government. From 1908 until this point, automobiles were banned on the island due to a disagreement between permanent residents and summer visitors.<br /> <br /> Summer resident John D. Rockefeller, seeing the inevitability of automobile use in the park with increased visitors, would help finance a loop road that would keep automobiles off the carriage roads and away from the park’s interior.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers joined the park in 1929 to recommend routes, locate scenic overlooks, and prepare engineering details for the loop road, with Olmsted Jr. taking the lead on this project.

In October 1906, the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition Company hired John Charles Olmsted to design the grounds, believing he would create a breathtaking design like his father had at the World’s Columbian Exposition.<br /> <br /> John Charles faced two major constraints in his work for the exposition. The first was that the budget, which would cover the clearing of 200 acres, grading slopes, and planting grounds was only $350,000, which was a tough deal considering his father Olmsted had gotten over triple that amount to design his world’s fair sixteen years earlier. The second constraint was that once the fair was finished, the buildings and grounds would be given to the University of Washington.<br /> <br /> John Charles developed a plan that would serve both the needs of the fair and of the university. As opposed to other world’s fairs of the time, the design of the A-Y-P relied on the natural scenery, including nearby Mount Rainier, Lake Washington, and Lake Union, as focal points to lay out buildings, roads, and paths around.<br /> <br /> Incorporating the surrounding landscape, adapting to the topography of a site, using native vegetation and water features are all characteristic of Olmsted designs. John Charles' design of the A-Y-P would be dubbed the “Rainier Vista” and is the central core of the University of Washington campus, still cherished today.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=4459,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157647001708047/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/02739\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/\">University of Washington</a>",

During this time John Charles also collaborated with the architecture firm McKim, Mead, and White for the location of a new science building. By 1906 it was time for Olmsted Jr. to take over work at Amherst, with the college’s trustees creating the Commission for Improvements to Amherst College, with Olmsted Jr., McKim, Mead, Daniel Burnham and sculptor Augusts Saint-Gaudens all being appointed.<br /> <br /> That year the group submitted a report, making recommendations to acquire more land for the growing student population, while still following Olmsted Sr.’s original plan.

However, at Aspinwall Hill, Olmsted never made it past the study stage. There was a disagreement between landowners and Olmsted, leading to his services being suspended.

Olmsted’s preliminary plan conformed to the topography, grading and drainage of the site.<br /> <br /> Like his father, Olmsted ensured any architecture in the park wouldn’t dominate, and expressed the idea that any structures in the park be built to conform to the history and traditions of the city. Work on Audubon park echoed the earlier work done at the Back Bay Fens: unifying a site and solving drainage problems by developing a varied watercourse.<br /> <br /> In the northern section of Audubon Park, Olmsted used fill from the stream bed to grade the flat site into a rolling meadow, which became part of a golf course.

Olmsted accepted the challenge, for he saw an opportunity to create <em>“scenery of a winding, brackish creek within wooded banks...numerous points and coves softened in their outlines by thickets with much delicate variety in tone and color...picturesque elements emphasized by a few necessary structures, strong but unobtrusive”.</em> The Back Bay Fens we enjoy today are thanks to Olmsted’s ability to combine sanitary engineering and landscape architecture to provide for the needs of a dense community.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=2792,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157645484755902/\">Flickr </a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/00916\">Olmsted Online</a> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/back-bay-fens\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.emeraldnecklace.org/park-overview/back-bay-fens/\">Emerald Necklace Conservancy </a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmsted.org/olmsteds-explanation-of-the-back-bay-fens/\">Olmsted Network</a>",

The final straws that broke the brothers’ back was the recommendation that, not only should the entire location of the site be changed, but that a railroad should cut directly through it.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b10bb24f-7d00-4a89-a2ed-7d2c48a8f148}{173}\" paraid=\"746366132\">Olmsted Brothers were unwaveringly opposed to both changes, especially the addition of a railroad, because this would eliminate all possibilities of creating a semi-rural respite from a city. The brothers had learned well from their father, as Olmsted Sr. believed that was the main function of a large urban park.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b10bb24f-7d00-4a89-a2ed-7d2c48a8f148}{177}\" paraid=\"1559987098\">On September 2nd, 1911, a telegram arrived in San Diego from Olmsted Brothers in Brookline, stating that “our professional responsibility as park designers will not permit us to assist in ruining Balboa Park.” Ouch. It appears San Diego’s leaders were so focused on the Exposition and the potential real estate development that would follow, that they couldn’t envision a time when people would desperately need open space.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b10bb24f-7d00-4a89-a2ed-7d2c48a8f148}{185}\" paraid=\"1412068363\">Despite Olmsted Brothers’ self-removal from the Exposition and Balboa Park, years after the project’s completion, people still flock to Balboa Park seeking the same things Olmsted Brothers wanted to prioritize: open green space, fresh air, respite in nature, relaxation.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=2076,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157662633564074/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/04051\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/balboa-park\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.sandiego.org/\">San Diego</a></p>",

On February 18<sup>th</sup> of that year, ten days after the fire ended, Olmsted Jr. conducted a five-day study outlining recommendations for the post-fire rebuild.<br /> <br /> In addition to physical improvements, Olmsted Jr. also wanted to use this opportunity to work with architects, creating harmonious streetscapes.

Discussions arose about what should be developed on the land; with nearby steep ravines, it would be unsuitable for agricultural use.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers were solicited to study the land and determine what should be developed on it. Firm member George Gibbs Jr. visited the site in 1915, submitting his concept for a suburban development months later. Commanding views of the nearby lake helped guide the plan, with more valuable lots being sited at higher points on the hill. Plantings were carefully curated to frame picturesque views.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers continued to improve their design over several years, with John Charles and Frederick Jr. weighing in on various aspects. The firm designed Barton Shore Drive, parallel to Barton North Drive, which would \"undoubtedly prove the most attractive when built as it will follow com­paratively near the water and will command an uninterrupted view over the pool.\"<br /> <br /> Much of the development of Barton Hills was realized in the mid-1920s, when the first holes of the local golf course and country club were opened.

Olmsted Brothers took over at Baxter Square and proposed a planting plan to the city.

In 1886, Brookline Park Commissioners asked Olmsted to draw plans for widening Beacon Street to a two-hundred-foot avenue.<br /> <br /> As the fashionable Back Bay residential district expanded, widening Beacon Street was a logical extension.

Holding a variety of bear species, purchased from Germany and Yellowstone National Park, as well as a badger held in a nearby cage, the bear dens attracted thousands of people to the zoo everyday.<br /> <br /> On October 3, 1912, at least 10,000 people came to the zoo and visited the bear dens, bringing in a total of $10,000, a very large amount in the early 1900s. The dens became so popular that when funding became scarce, Boston schoolchildren started a campaign to collect pennies to keep them open.<br /> <br /> In 1954, due to the growing popularity of many other local and national zoos and attractions, the lack of safety, and the large distance between the bear dens and the rest of the zoo, Schurcliff suggested closing the bear dens. The zoo officially closed in 1960 but has since been reopened as a new attraction for future generations. Over the years of abandonment, the Old Bear Dens have become overgrown and vandalized. In 2014, part of the rusting iron work went missing from the dens and was presumed to have been stolen for scrap metal use.<br />  ",

Frederick Law Olmsted and John Charles Olmsted assessed the scenic advantages of the large trees, hilltop views, boulder outcroppings, and sloping meadows of the site, and suggested that even more land should be donated.<br /> <br /> In their 1884 report, the two Olmsted’s suggested thinning woodlands into open glades for a parklike character, while also encouraging native shrub growth. Also suggested in the report was enhancing hillside areas for distant views while utilizing natural boulders to create a vine-covered courtyard for carriages. Aware that not everyone had a carriage, the plan for Beardsley Park included a railroad station for public access.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s vision for Beardsley Park is remarkably similar to what you would see today, despite the transformation of many meadows into ball fields and other athletic facilities, as well as the addition of a zoo in 1922. Looking at Beardsley Park, the Olmsted’s believed that \"It is just the place for a day's outing.

Initially, Olmsted wasn’t too happy with the site selected, stating “conditions could not be more favorable to the breeding and nursing of mosquitoes…[In] the pools…I found discolored, and covered by bubbles and a green scum; and there was a putrescent organic matter on their borders…”<br /> <br /> Olmsted was contracted by the Detroit for three years, being paid $7,000 for his design. The challenge at Belle Isle was creating a design that would allow for public gathering and recreation while maintaining the natural state of the island. The solution was to place a ferry dock at one end, concentrating all the public facilities at the end. This allowed Olmsted to leave the rest of the island in as natural a state as possible.<br /> <br /> To remedy the marshy land forming on the low-lying island, Olmsted proposed a system of underground pipes that would lead into canals, which had a dual purpose of being used for pleasure boating. From the start, Olmsted put more investment into Belle Isle than many Detroiters, even waving his normal visitation fees. He hoped to capitalize on the island’s existing wooded area to serve as the park’s central attraction.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Olmsted’s design was deemed too elaborate and, due to disagreements on funds with Detroit’s Park Board, Olmsted resigned from the project and Belle Isle was never carried out to its full extent. Elements of Olmsted’s plan were carried out, like wooded areas and the ferry landing.<br /> <br /> All of Olmsted’s park designs include three zones- a formal zone, and active zone, and a natural zone, present in Belle Isle Park. The formal zone includes Scott Fountain and Sunset Point, the active zone encompasses cultural attractions and athletic fields, while the natural zone is dominated by the wetland forest.",

My advice would be to make a small park in which you look from your house, make a small pleasure ground and gardens; farm your river bottoms chiefly and…keep and fatten livestock with a view to manure and…make the rest a forest”</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{33}\" paraid=\"1046770178\">-Frederick Law Olmsted in his letter of recommendation to George Washington Vanderbilt</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{37}\" paraid=\"1982123716\">Olmsted was able to convince Vanderbilt that the land would be better suited with a grand garden area close to the house and turn the remaining acres into a forest, providing the home with spectacular views.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{41}\" paraid=\"44035524\">In Olmsted’s final project, he built a nine-mile arboretum that went from the house, to the French Broad River, and back up to the house again. He also planned the entry way to the Biltmore as a pleasure drive, passing through a “natural forest”. That natural forest contained clusters of trees that purposely blocked the view so that visitors would be shocked when the curtain of the forest was pulled back and you could finally see the house.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{45}\" paraid=\"800903396\">Despite ill health and the pressure of the Chicago World’s Fair, Olmsted traveled by rail several times to Asheville, ensuring his designs were being followed. He felt the transitions between formal and natural gardens were important to differentiate, as was the use of native plants, and a balance of small trees and large shrubs.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{49}\" paraid=\"854138470\">Following Olmsted’s suggestions, Vanderbilt hired trained forester Gifford Pinchot to develop a management plan for his land.

Published a year later, the report called for parks within easy walking distance for all residents, regardless of socio-economic or racial group, that would serve both active and passive recreation.<br /> <br /> From his father, Olmsted Jr. learned how important parks were to the spiritual refreshment and physical welfare of stressed city dwellers. Prior to Olmsted Brothers involvement at Birmingham, the city had only 600 acres of park to serve 200,000 citizens, a wholly inadequate number.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers’ report recommended the creation of beauty spots and athletic fields, and the reservation of vast lands in undeveloped areas critical for the protection of the area’s domestic water supply. The plan also included building parkways along ridge tops to offer the community impressive outlooks, as well as offering recreational amenities for the thriving industrial center Birmingham had become.<br /> <br /> Wanting immediate park improvements, from 1924 to 1926, Olmsted Brothers would design plans for three parks as well as reviewing plans for others.

John Charles and Frederick Jr. worked closely with C. Stuart Gager, Brooklyn Botanic Garden’s first director. Gager, stationed in Missouri before making the trip to Brooklyn, was in constant communication not only with Olmsted Brothers, but also McKim, Mead, and White, who were commissioned to design the gardens laboratory and plant houses.<br /> <br /> Though Brooklyn Botanic Garden is largely the product of Harold Caparn, the landscape architect chosen to when construction on the Garden was commenced, Olmsted Brothers original design still seeps through in every corner.

Olmsted’s one-time partner, Calvert Vaux, had developed the campus’ original plan 11 years earlier, but Thomas saw it as outdated, with populations and buildings growing in the years since.<br /> <br /> In association with the campus architects, Olmsted began working out a general plan for the campus. The focus of Olmsted’s plan would be to place buildings around the perimeter of the property, allowing for open space in the center intended for outdoor activities and attractive, unobstructed views.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s ability to work closely with architects on the placement of larger buildings, such as the library, ensured his landscapes would compliment those structures. One of Olmsted’s final additions to the campus was a quarter mile oval bike path, lined with trees and looking in on that open recreational space.<br /> <br /> After Olmsted’s death, the firm would be inactive at Bryn Mawr until April of 1908, when Thomas again called on an Olmsted to help update an outdated plan. John Charles Olmsted would take over work at Bryn Mawr after his fathers’ death, and during his time working on the project, he received many letters from Thomas.<br /> <br /> While John Charles gets much of the credit for continuing the Olmsted work at Bryn Mawr, it was Martha Carey Thomas who was the driving force behind their involvement. In a letter to John Charles in November of 1908, she writes “of course we cannot afford to do much in any one year, but what we do ought to be done right”. Spoken like someone who has spent a good amount of time around the Olmsted’s.<br /> <br /> Thomas was involved in every detail of planning and execution for Bryn Mawr, a place she truly cared about and wanted to see succeeded. She even sketched a version of Olmsted’s 1897 plan that could be reproduced inexpensively, raising funds to complete the project.",

In November of that year the Council voted unanimously to spend $105,000 to buy the land that would become Bushnell Park. When Hartford voters approved the spending, it was the first time in the United States that a municipal park was to be conceived, built, and paid for by citizens through a popular vote.<br /> <br /> Frederick Law Olmsted would have been a logical choice on who to lead this project, with his local roots and a lifelong friendship with Bushnell. Olmsted would recommend Jacob Weidenmann, a Swiss-born landscape architect and botanist, to design and build the park. Weidenmann’s 1861 plan had a distinctive natural style, featuring smoothly sculpted contours and graceful paths, as well as informal clusters of evergreen and deciduous trees.<br /> <br /> After Weidenmann’s death, John Charles Olmsted took over advising at Bushnell Park, where he improved drives, terrace alignment, plantings, and various monument placement. After John Charles’ death, Olmsted Brothers continued working on Bushnell Park, with Edward Whiting and James Dawson taking over.

John Charles also noted that Black “does not want to be secluded by hedges or plantations or walls or parapets and wants everyone to enjoy views over the place”, so he recommended street trees that wouldn’t grow too tall.<br /> <br /> John Charles faced very little challenges while working on the estate, because he and Black had similar ideas in keeping the landscape open but informal.

A vine covered terrace and concert grove complemented the refectory, providing outlooks to the lawn beyond.<br /> <br /> Park progress continued to follow the broad outlines put in place by Olmsted’s plan, however, monuments and zoo enclosures were placed into the pastoral landscape against the firm’s recommendations.

Gallagher also transformed a natural ravine into a picturesque pond, adding a shrub lined path leading to the water.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/genb.idc\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157663353585763/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://parks.ny.gov/parks/caumsett\">Caumsett State Historic Park Preserve</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmsted.org/job-7359-olmsteds-influence-on-caumsett-state-historic-park-preserve/\">Olmsted Network</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/caumsett-historic-state-park-preserve\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation </a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/07359\">Olmsted Online </a>",

Olmsted & Co. to recreate the success the firm had in the northern park system and continue developing parks in the southern part of the city. While Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. suggested a single lakefront park, Buffalo Park Commissioners instead purchased two inland sites in 1891, one of which would become Cazenovia Park.<br /> <br /> In April of 1892, Olmsted submitted his design of Cazenovia Park. 76 acres of low, fertile land that had previously housed a village of Seneca Tribe’s Buffalo Creek Reservation would now become parkland. Handling the problematic seasonal flooding of the area, Olmsted, who developed plans for Cazenovia Park from 1892 to 1896, proposed damming the creek to create a 20-acre lake with three islands and a boathouse overlooking the water from the north.<br /> <br /> By August of 1892, construction on Cazenovia Park had begun. The principal features Olmsted designed for the park was a large play area, a winding drive that would cross a stream, and pass through the park overlooking the playground. Additionally, there was a grove of trees for concerts and a large shelter house.",

Thankfully the city had begun acquiring land, about 843 acres of it, removed from the built-up areas of New York, and in 1853, New York State Legislature approved the establishment of Central Park.<br /> <br /> In 1857 the Central Park Commission was founded, and Olmsted was encouraged to apply for the position of superintendent of the park, which he was appointed to that same year. To address the rapidly expanding city, the Commission held a design competition for the park. Olmsted teamed up with Calvert Vaux, who he would rely on heavily to the sketch plan.<br /> <br /> Of the 33 submissions being considered, Olmsted and Vaux’s Greensward plan won over the Commission for its notable combination of formal and natural settings, mixed with architectural details like bridges. The most revolutionary of their design elements was the transverse roads, allowing vehicular traffic and pedestrians to cut through the park simultaneously, without anything detracting from their park experience.<br /> <br /> After the Greensward Plan was adopted, Olmsted was appointed Chief Architect of Central Park, which he served from 1858 to 1861, allowing him to supervise construction. Unfortunately, from the start, there was a lot of political infighting at Central Park, with Tammany Hall politicians wanting their voters and friends to get jobs at the park, instead of those qualified. There was also Andrew Green, leader of the Commission, whom Olmsted butted heads with over Green keeping the purse strings tight.<br /> <br /> Central Park was Olmsted’s first great project as a landscape architect, though it certainly wouldn’t be his last, but with every new park or estate you see bits of Central Park in it, for it’s where Olmsted got many of his trademark designs. Besides inspiring Olmsted, Central Park would go on to influence the development of urban parks nationwide, as well as serve as the set for many films.",

A waterside park, Charlesbank acted as the Beacon Street entrance to Olmsted’s Back Bay Fens.<br /> <br /> Working with fitness pioneer Dudley A. Sargent, Olmsted created a linear park with features like a promenade, boat landings, running track, trapezes, swinging rings, jumping and pole vaulting, shot putting, and more, separated by gender and age. Olmsted requested that Boston Park Commissioners provide equipment, maintenance, and instruction to the community, free of charge.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted supported facilities for exercise, he favored parks that encouraged individual sports, not team ones. That is why Charlesbank didn’t include a baseball diamond or football field. Opening in 1889, Olmsted’s original plan would get a redesign in 1910 after the construction of the dam, by Olmsted firm member Arthur Shurcliff. Due to increased vehicular traffic, most of Olmsted's design was removed in the 1930s.",

After Olmsted Sr.’s tenure at the firm was over, Olmsted Brothers worked on Cherokee Gardens, Seneca Gardens, and the Alta Vista subdivision, which benefited from borrowing the scenery Cherokee Park offered.<br /> <br /> In 1974, a tornado struck Louisville and resulted in the loss of thousands of mature trees at Cherokee Park. A massive replanting effort was undertaken, however, to qualify for federal funding, the park had to be restored to its pre-tornado design.

Between 1887 and 1890, Winsor acquired more property in the area.<br /> <br /> Beginning in 1910, Winsor began thinking of the possibilities of building a subdivision on his property. That year, Winsor hired Olmsted Brothers to make a general plan for his property. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. took the lead at Chestnut Farm, stating that Winsor “wants to keep place quiet and natural; but wants to build some woods-roads and gradually improve the place with the idea in mind of subdividing it as time goes on…into smaller places of (say) ten acres and upwards”.<br /> <br /> Winsor asked Olmsted to create a road system not only convenient for his personal use but would also be useful when the property was subdivided. Olmsted Brothers made sure to place those roadways based on topographical and geological features, taking advantage of the natural landscape.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers also designed a four-acre pond at Chestnut Farm, with seventy-five workers arriving to the swampy site, removing unneeded land to make the pond deep enough for swimming.

After the completion of Commonwealth Avenue, and a redesign of Beacon Street, Olmsted believed the Loop leading to the pleasure grounds at the Reservoir should be part of Boston’s municipal park system.<br /> <br /> After Olmsted Sr.’s death, Olmsted Brothers took over all his work. Olmsted Brothers produced plans for a courtyard in front of the Chestnut Hill Reservoir Pumping Station. Additionally, Olmsted Brothers performed the layout and grading for the proposed pipe yard site adjacent to the pumping station.<br /> <br /> The Chestnut Hill Driveway was one of the most popular pleasure drives in the Greater Boston area in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

In that report, John Charles proposed acquiring the entire length of steep slope for park purposes, warning against using the land for subdivision development because “Houses will probably continue to be moved gradually on to adjoining land owned by someone else, and there will be no end to the trouble, expense and inconvenience due to the continuation of the slide if it is allowed to become occupied by houses… On the other hand, the movement of the land would be of small consequence if the ground is turned into a public park.”<br /> <br /> Additionally, Olmsted proposed a parkway that would run along the top of Colman Park’s slope, providing views to Lake Washington and the mountains further in the distance. Due to the ambitiousness of the plan, the parkway was never realized. However, some parcels within the area that would have been the parkway were either donated or purchased for parkland for Seattle.<br /> <br /> Within Colman Park, four bridges allow pedestrians to move, removed from vehicular traffic. Located at the North edge of the Mount Baker neighborhood, the forested hillside park features paths, community gardens, forests and lawns.

By May 1867, Cornell and White were disagreeing on what their campus should look like, and so White contacted Frederick Law Olmsted to consult on the appearance for a new campus.<br /> <br /> Cornell pushed for a design around a quadrangle, which Olmsted recommended they abandon. Olmsted urged the University to lean towards a freer disposition with the buildings. Olmsted didn’t want to fight with the rugged topography of the site but rather worked it into his plan.<br /> <br /> As with many of his designs, Olmsted predicted that Cornell University would continue to grow, and that the campus they made today needed to handle the unforeseeable demands of later generations. As is sometimes the case, Olmsted’s recommendations came in too late, as planning was already underway with Ezra Cornell’s plan around a quadrangle.<br /> <br /> After learning the building site he recommended wasn’t chosen, Olmsted wrote to White stating “The site of your second building having been determined against my judgement, it seems to me to be very important that nothing should be done which shall make the suggestion which I offered to you in regard to a terrace impracticable”.",

Because of prior commitments, neither John Charles nor Frederick Jr. was able to work at the site, so work was left to firm member Percival Gallagher.<br /> <br /> After his first visit to Birmingham, Gallagher wrote that ““We are building a church and rectory in the Bloomfield Hills district. We have laid out a complete plan showing roads, walks, walls, etc. but we are anxious to get some idea of what planting would be suitable for this locality. We wonder if you would care to act as a consultant on this problem and perhaps furnish us with a planting plan and let us know what your fee would be for such service”.<br /> <br /> From 1926 to 1927, Gallagher worked through his site plan so that grading work on the foundation of the church could begin. At the end of 1927, Gallagher was working on the adjustment of plantings, needed after it was decided to widen the road leading to the Church.<br /> <br /> Limited to selecting and ordering plants, and supervising the execution of their plans, Olmsted Brothers’ role at Cranbrook ended over a fee dispute. Another reason behind the limited scope of the Olmsted involvement is because the Church was, and remains to this day, a separate entity, physically separated by roads, from the rest of Cranbrook.",

Crane, Jr. was also a man of exorbitant wealth, though he didn’t move to Ipswich to stir up anything. Crane inherited the top post in his family’s manufacturing company and expanded it into modern bathroom fixtures. Crane even had an exhibit at the Chicago World’s Fair, where he displayed “the world’s largest shower”.<br /> <br /> Crane purchased the 165-acre plot of land and knew exactly what he wanted: a bowling green, tennis court, maze, log-cabin playhouse, golf course and deer preserve. Crane and his family also ran a self-sustaining farm with livestock, an orchard, and dense vegetable and rose gardens, which space needed to be made for.<br /> <br /> Crane was building his summer getaway during the country place era, a period of landscape architecture design where wealthy Americans commissioned extensive gardens at their country estates, emulating European gardens. To this day, Crane Estate is one of the last surviving, intact American estates from this era.<br /> <br /> Crane brought on the most prominent landscape architects of his time: Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and John Charles Olmsted, of the Olmsted Brothers firm, and Arthur Shurcliff, who had left the Olmsted firm in 1904 to start his own. Shurcliff was mentored by Charles Eliot, who like himself, left the Olmsted firm to open his own.<br /> <br /> Though the Olmsted Brothers started work on the Grande Allée, they were dismissed by Crane and work was handed over to Arthur Shurcliff. From 1913 to 1915, Shurcliff worked on the half-mile long formal mall leading from the Crane Mansion to the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> <br /> In 1949, the Crane family donated the land to the Trustees of Reservations, which was founded by former Olmsted firm employee and mentor to Arthur Shurcliff, Charles Eliot.<br /> <br />  ",

One year later, in his second report, he recommended the acquisition of 41,320 acres of land.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. 's work on the Denver Parks was an early example of sensitive and scenic road building techniques that would soon be used all over the National Parks.

Olmsted Jr. was known for integrating structures into a landscape, never wanting those structures to dominate a landscape, instead perfectly fitting in.<br /> <br /> The open green expanse of the tree lined El Prado was laid out at an angle, leading a spectator’s eyes towards the towering mountains in the distance. El Prado reflects Olmsted Jr.’s deliberate attempt to work green space and natural beauty into his urban designs.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s plan for Torrance was creative, dividing the town into three distinct districts: the business district at the city’s core (now known as Old Torrance), the industrial district to the North and East of the city’s core, and the residential district to the West.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. chose modern architect Irving J. Gill to design Torrance’s original buildings, including the city’s railroad bridge. Olmsted Brothers likely suggested Gill as architect because they had already worked together on the Panama-California Exposition.<br /> <br /> As is often the case with Olmsted designed landscapes, the plan for Torrance came out of a different plan, one for a park on the other side of the country.

Duke promised his university to be a beautiful, elite Southern campus to rival the colleges of the Northeast. While Duke had to whittle down a lengthy list of architects to one, Horace Trumbauer, there was only one landscape architecture firm he wanted designing his campus: Olmsted Brothers. Corresponding constantly with Trumbauer, Olmsted Brothers worked with the architect on the layout of buildings.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ccb64d08-aacf-4a91-ad23-b36c14f394dd}{32}\" paraid=\"2062849730\">Olmsted Brother’s plan was heavily influenced by Beaux Arts style design, with long vistas and strict axial designs. A part of their axial design would be Campus Drive, a forested thoroughfare serving as the spine of the campus, centering everything together.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ccb64d08-aacf-4a91-ad23-b36c14f394dd}{36}\" paraid=\"20204458\">At Duke University, Olmsted Brothers were responsible for grading the land, establishing patterns of canopy trees, designing, and planting both quads, as well as the paths and roadways for the rest of the campus. Olmsted Brothers left Duke with a commitment to excellence in design and planning that still exists today, with the campus retaining a parklike setting of two thousand acres of open space along with six thousand acres of forest.</p>",

Any plan that deliberately stops short of such provision…. Is in so far illogical, unjust, undemocratic and unwise.”<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr., as his father taught him, was committed to provide refuge and recreation away from city life.

Only after this step could rich black soil be brought into the area through thousands of loads. Olmsted Jr. spent the next five years working diligently with his team to plant a mix of native and exotic plants that would thrive in a humid climate, lending a tropical feel to the native oak hill.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. carefully selected plants that would provide a hearty supply of food and shelter for migrating birds and other wildlife in the area.

Zack also suggested that one path go along the edge of a nearby pond, just below the house to the East. Over time the paths were cut, though it is unknown if the edge of the pond was as densely packed with vegetation as Zack suggested. Except for the minimal staking of the paths, nothing of Olmsted Brothers’ plan was executed.",

Their design approach at Fort Greene called for a park of rural character, consisting of “a series of shady walks that will have an outlook of open grassy spaces at intervals”.<br /> <br /> In addition to winding pathways and open lawns, there was a designated area for social gatherings, two playgrounds, an observatory, and room for a monument to the prison ship martyrs. While some of these design elements weren’t included at Central or Prospect Park, Olmsted and Vaux included them here, seeing them as appropriate to the site and neighborhood.<br /> <br /> Though Olmsted and Vaux always intended for a formal monument to the prison ship martyrs, a lack of funding would interrupt its realization. After Olmsted and Vaux had both passed, the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White were brought in to complete it.<br /> <br /> Today, the park retains much of Olmsted and Vaux’s original characteristics, with winding pathways, sloping lawns, and mature trees, including on 135-year old English elm.",

Divided by the Genesee River, Olmsted chose the 543-acre site for its ability to naturally incorporate water with wooded, rolling terrain. Despite five years of public opposition to the park, the Board of Park Commissioners exerted considerable pressure on Olmsted to make recommendations and begin his landscaping work.<br /> <br /> Olmsted wrote that any advice on how to utilize the land was dependent on the topography of the site. He deliberated over designs, preferring to study topography and other aspects of the land before making a final decision. In the end, Olmsted’s design included land bordering both sides of the Genesee River.<br /> <br /> On the West side of the river, recreational facilities were placed while on the opposite bank, there was a pastoral setting that included a meadow, deer park, and picnic groves encircled by carriage routes. Between 1889 and 1898, 62,500 trees were planted, while shrubs and willows were rooted along the riverbanks and within the woods.<br /> <br /> John Charles Olmsted would assist his father at Genesee Valley Park, overseeing the placement of additional recreational facilities, including a golf course. In 1908, a donation of 120-acres expanded the park, though when it was divided by the Erie Canal in 1908. Olmsted Brothers mitigated the damage to the site by creating a bridge that reunited the landscape.",

With John Charles taking the lead on the design, his plan emphasized the island’s natural topography while incorporating the native vegetation of the area.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted Brothers was responsible for the landscape, they also had ideas about the architecture of the community and called for a separation of areas depending on the style of the home, so that no styles mixed poorly, causing a dilution of the intended effect. Homes around Gibson Island are built in numerous differing styles: French and Spanish Eclectic, Gothic, Colonial, Tudor Revivals, Mission, and Art Deco.<br /> <br /> Around Gibson Island, roads take the form of paved, meandering paths, accommodating the 423 residential plots and two eighteen-hole golf courses Olmsted Brothers called for. However, financial constraint left the idea of the second golf course abandoned and trees were cut to increase views of the water, all to Olmsted's objections.<br /> <br /> While the Great Depression would alter the size of the development, to this day Gibson Island remains true to Olmsted Brothers’ vision for a recreational community, and their design provides a showcase for the Island’s 190 residences.",

A pair of landowners wrote to Olmsted in February 1884 stating they were combining their properties, and requested Olmsted create a plan for the land. As always, Olmsted referenced the topographical survey to ensure his curving roads would fit into the natural scenery.<br /> <br /> Despite curved lines not being a popular choice at the time, Olmsted did have a reason to include them. Fisher Hill lies between two major streets, Beacon, and Boylston, however, only one road connects the two within Fisher Hill, and it lies on the border of the subdivision. This means that those curving residential streets aren’t shortcuts to anywhere. They only travel within Fisher Hill, which discourages outside traffic from cutting through the neighborhood, leaving Fisher Hill a peaceful, quiet area.<br /> <br /> The neighborhood has remained, for the most part, unchanged, making it Olmsted’s most intact subdivision in the country. That cohesiveness of the plan is partly to do with Olmsted’s sensitive layout, as well as the fact that most homes were built under a short time, and under deed restrictions.",

As partners in Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot, John Charles Olmsted and Charles Eliot created their design for Goodwin Park, part of the Hartford Park System.<br /> <br /> Initially named South Park, it was renamed in 1900 to honor Hartford Park Commissioner Revered Francis Goodwin, a critical player in getting Hartford its parks. The 200-acre park consists of woodlands and meadows, with Great Meadow being its most prominent feature, a 90-acre, gently sloping lawn surrounded by native tree groves. Recreational elements like children’s play area, outdoor gymnasium, and a wading pool were placed along wooded edges, providing privacy.<br /> <br /> Despite the addition of a golf course and the park being used as an airfield throughout the 1920s and during WWII, Goodwin Park retains much of its original design.

The city was in possession of the land, however after seeing the success of the South Park Commission at the World’s Columbian Exposition, the city transferred the land to them. After the transfer, the commission changed the name of the proposed park from Lake to Grant, honoring former president Ulysses S. Grant.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{96}\" paraid=\"861420569\">In 1903, the South Park Commission hired the Olmsted Brothers to assist Burnham. By 1907, the Olmsted Brothers had developed an entirely new plan, calling for a more formalized park structure based off French landscaping principles. This would include symmetrical spaces, along with well-defined paths and plantings.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{100}\" paraid=\"351601788\">There was a debate over what the centerpiece of Grant Park should be. Burnham had already been chosen as the architect for a new natural history museum, thanks to a $1 million donation from department store owner Marshall Field, and he felt the museum would be a perfect centerpiece. Though Field wanted the museum in the Sr. Olmsted’s Jackson Park, the younger Olmsted sons agreed with Burnham, and the Field Museum was forever placed in Grant Park.</p>",

John Charles placed trees and shrubbery along the boulevard’s outer edge, many of which survive today.<br /> <br /> Additionally, John Charles included a graceful parkland meandering along the shores of Green Lake. By covering this area with grass, John Charles predicted that it would “be one of the most attractive places for crowds to ramble and sit under the trees.” John Charles also recommended “sufficient space be provided for field sports, and also for a formal garden.” An earlier movement stressing the importance of outdoor recreation for children prompted John Charles to include a playground in his plan.",

Olmsted Brothers also included a street hierarchy, where broad boulevards ran through the neighborhood, serving as gateways, with smaller streets insulating residents from the city’s noise and traffic.<br /> <br /> Lining the streets were sidewalks and large canopy trees, with hoses set back to create ample front lawns. Additionally, parcels were set aside for community uses such as parks, schools, and churches. In combination with careful street planning, Homeland also had underground conduits for telephone and electric cables, streetlights, and separated sewers from stormwater and sanitary water.",

Hubbard also knew the importance of bringing in a professional, so he enlisted Olmsted Brothers to help plan the park that would be his namesake.<br /> <br /> Hubbard worked specifically with John Charles Olmsted, inviting him to visit the land and make recommendations on its design and layout. After visiting, Hubbard and Olmsted would exchange several letters between 1898 and 1899, and it’s clear that Hubbard seriously considered Olmsted’s recommendations, evidenced by the fact that letters describe in detail the present situation of the park.<br /> <br /> In their correspondences, the two discussed numerous details like water flow, tree placement, ravines, and ridges, as well as the best areas to take in the views, and settle in for a picnic. Hubbard relied heavily on Olmsted to give the park its rustic style, the trademark of the park.<br /> <br /> At times, Olmsted and Hubbard butt heads on the design of the park. While both propose a shelter at the east end of the park, Hubbard believes it should be made like a Greek temple, while Olmsted protested that it should be built roughly, with local stones. In the end, Olmsted prevailed in convincing Hubbard of the design.<br /> <br /> Though Hubbard never worked with Olmsted Sr., he was certainly inspired by the creation of Central Park. When Hubbard gifted the land to Meriden, he specified that everything connected with the park was to remain free of charge. Unlike Olmsted, Hubbard had difficulty planning a park that would have permanent effects.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted Brothers may have never prepared any plans for Hubbard Park, their suggestions for road and walkway designs live on.",

Bernheim Arboretum and Herbarium is a rags to riches story. In 1867, eighteen-year-old Isaac W. Bernheim immigrated to the United States from Germany with only $4 in his pocket. After several years struggling to make a living as a peddler, jumping from New York, to Pennsylvania and New Jersey, finally moving to Kentucky to go into the distilling business.<br /> <br /> Over the years he achieved great wealth and success through his Bernheim Brothers Distilling Company and their famous bourbon. His love of sculptures and the community in which he made his fortune manifested in several gifts: a statue of Abraham Lincoln for the Louisville Free Public Library and Thomas Jefferson in front of the Jefferson County Courthouse.<br /> <br /> In 1929, Bernheim bought and endowed the land that would become the I.W. Bernheim Arboretum and Herbarium, which now stretches over 16,000 acres, as a gift to the people of his new homeland. Bernheim’s goal was to provide a place where the bond between people and nature could be renewed and restored. His vision included an arboretum and natural forested areas infused with the arts, providing a unique site to experience nature.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers would begin work on a site plan for the Arboretum and Herbarium in 1931, and their original landscape design was adopted in 1935. Work continued until 1950, as the land was prepared to Bernheim’s intentions. Following the Olmsted Brothers plan, three small lakes and a road traversing the land were built before any of the collection was planted.",

Olmsted Brothers believed the University could seriously benefit from studying the model, particularly regarding the future development of the campus.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers wanted the University’s trustees to understand how much easier it would be to experiment with models when deciding sites for new buildings, specifically its size, form, and character. Models allowed everyone to visualize the problem, leading to conclusions with clearer understanding.<br /> <br /> After having already placed some buildings on campus, Olmsted Brothers noted that had a model been available, they likely would have chosen a different site, one less crowded. Olmsted Brothers also encouraged the University to place a potential model in a highly trafficked part of campus, so people would frequently see it, and get enthusiastic about the new design.<br /> <br /> Though Olmsted Brothers warned Indiana University that purchasing a model may seem like a large expenditure, one could reasonably call it insurance for the development of a well-organized and efficient plan.",

As a result of this meeting, the Louisville Park Commission was formed to create a network of parks and boulevards, the last major park system of Olmsted Sr.’s career.<br /> <br /> Three large parks would anchor the system along the city’s perimeter, with Iroquois Park, laying at the Southern edge. Louisville’s mayor Charles Jacob personally purchased the property that Iroquois Park would sit on. For Iroquois Park, Olmsted envisioned a scenic reservation on a rugged, steep, heavily wooded hillside.<br /> <br /> Built on 739-acres, Iroquois Park is the largest in Olmsted’s Louisville Park System. The hillside Iroquois Park sits on is covered with an old-growth forests, prompting Olmsted to call it “Louisville’s Yellowstone”.

One year later in July, Marquette, Michigan resident John Longyear wrote to Olmsted, asking him to come to Marquette at his earliest convenience to create plans for his estate.<br /> <br /> Longyear was anxious to have the grounds landscaped. After his first visit in 1891, Olmsted agreed the following year to create a model of the plantings he envisioned at the estate. The uneven terrain of the area presented a challenge for Olmsted, which he chose to fix by covering the grounds with creeping plants, shrubs, and vines. Olmsted wrote that “We believe that in general it is not advisable to keep such steep banks in turf, as it is very difficult to mow…and almost impossible to keep the turf in perfect condition…”, though with bushes, vines and trees, the area would be more picturesque and interesting.<br /> <br /> With the Chicago World’s Fair occupying much of his time, Olmsted sent firm member Warren Manning to supervise plantings at the site. To begin, Olmsted believed that the three acres to be planted should first be dug up and prepared with muck and stable manure.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the severe winter climate presented a challenge to the plantings. After the first Winter, Longyear wrote Olmsted reporting that some plants had not survived the cold months. Olmsted and Manning recommended replanting some of the area with wild roses and huckleberries. In 1897, Longyear and Olmsted began wrapping up their correspondences, with suggestions to expand the gardens to include tulips, crocuses, daffodils, and many species of fruit trees.",

Chicagoans were already familiar with the pairs work, since they had designed Riverside village. Olmsted always made sure his designs incorporated natural features of the site, and Jackson Park was no different. Water was meant to be the unifying feature of Chicago’s parks, and was a big reason why Olmsted chose Jackson Park as the site of the World’s Fair: the view of Lake Michigan.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{164}\" paraid=\"544569347\">When writing about where both the park and fair should be, Olmsted said “There is but one object of scenery near Chicago of special grandeur or sublimity, and that, the lake, can be made by artificial means no more grand or sublime. The lake, may, indeed, be accepted as fully compensating for the absence of sublime or picturesque elevations of land”</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{168}\" paraid=\"19870530\">Olmsted was able to begin designing the inland portion of the park before The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 hit, which put all developments on hold as Chicago worked to rebuild itself. Construction on Jackson Park wouldn’t begin again until 1890, at which point Olmsted began splitting his time between Chicago, and the Biltmore in North Carolina.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{172}\" paraid=\"1708335305\">Before Olmsted arrived in Chicago, the site of Jackson Park was a marshy, uninviting, wind-swept dune. However, out of this environment Olmsted was able create a series of basins and lagoons along the shore, protecting visitors and creating a more peaceful environment. Olmsted’s objective in the environment he created was to elicit the intense emotion that nature and beauty cause.</p>",

Olmsted urged the Boston Park Commission to incorporate the pond and surrounding area into the Emerald Necklace, believing he could save this “<em>natural sheet of water, with quiet, graceful shores, rear banks of varied elevation and contour, for the most part shaded by a fine natural forest growth</em>”. Olmsted’s work at Jamaica Pond can be described as a minimalist design, adding vegetation to compliment the natural scenery he so admired.

Opening in 1896, the Olmsted design didn’t truly take place until the 1920s.<br /> <br /> Keney Park would get an additional 160-acres in 1924 after the Keney Trustees transferred ownership to Hartford. Now Olmsted Brothers, John Charles Olmsted based his plan for Keney Park off Charles Eliot’s originals. They intended for the park to have a series of regional landscapes like meadows and forests.<br /> <br /> Firm associate Percival Gallagher was tasked with overseeing the construction of the park’s pastoral scenery, supervising the transportation of over half a million yards of earth, and planting native foliage.

Olmsted’s goal for Baltimore was to achieve a “roughly equitable distribution” or park amenities for everyone.<br /> <br /> The star of Olmsted Jr.’s report, Development of Public Grounds for Baltimore, was the concept of the stream valley park, which according to Olmsted Jr., had several advantages. Those advantages included the fact that the scenery along the streams was one of the city’s greatest assets, lowlands could be purchased for a modest price, and in Olmsted Jr.’s own words, a stream valley “cannot be built on, it cannot be left in irresponsive private hands, but it can be used to great advantage for park purposes.”<br /> <br /> In 1939, Olmsted Jr. reported to Baltimore that he had examined the roughly hundred sites the city had put as the next park and had chosen Leakin Park. He reminded Baltimore officials that Leakin Park must be in a neighborhood where recreational space was lacking, and that the park should provide diverse activities for people of differing ages and social classes.<br /> <br /> In addition to supporting Leakin Park, Olmsted Jr. explained why certain parts of the city shouldn’t be considered for a new park. Acquiring land in the inner city would be too costly, and while the eastern portion of the city needed a park, declining population was the reason Olmsted didn’t believe a park could work there. In the end, Olmsted Jr. was correct in picking Leakin Park, which became Baltimore’s largest park, and one of the largest wilderness woodland parks on the East Coast.<br /> <br />  ",

A “once bucolic campus found itself an island in an industrial wasteland.” Unsure where to relocate, the Board of Trustees hired Frederick Law Olmsted to choose their new site.<br /> <br /> Evaluating various properties with an eye towards their atmospheric, structural, and moral conditions, in 1872 Olmsted landed on 107-acres of land in nearby Belmont. In a report to the Trustees, Olmsted wrote that “the wooded land of Belmont, judiciously thinned to groups and glades, opened by walks of long curves and easy slopes, would, by the time your buildings were ready for occupancy, afford what is chiefly wanted in this respect better than it would be possible to provide it, with the most generous use of all available means, in many years, either at the Arlington, Waltham or any other locality with which I am acquainted in the suburbs of Boston.\"<br /> <br /> Olmsted saw a clear advantage of the site, with the large numbers of well-grown trees that would spark a picturesque interest in the landscape. At McLean, Olmsted argued for villagelike groupings of cottages as opposed to a centralized hospital, as popularized by Dr. Thomas Kirkbride at the Pennsylvania Hospital in the 1850s. Olmsted thought this would make the landscape look more like a college campus, and less like a hospital.<br /> <br /> While the Trustees endorsed Olmsted’s plan, he was not hired to lay out the grounds. He would return to McLean at the end of his life, not for work, but to be institutionalized, as his family felt they could no longer care for him. Arriving in Belmont, Olmsted looks around and says “they didn’t follow my plans. Confound them.”",

Not only did Olmsted assist on the siting of buildings and roads, he also made recommendations for parks. To honor his commitment to D.C., McMillan Park was created and named in 1906 to honor the man so instrumental in shaping D.C.<br /> <br /> A result of the McMillan Plan and City Beautification Movement, McMillan Park was a collaboration between Olmsted Jr and architect Charles Platt.

Olmsted’s concept for what would become Memorial Park emerges from his sketch studies. With the library sitting high on the site providing a commanding view of the city below, walking paths connect it to the area below. Olmsted wanted existing knolls and depressions excavated to accentuate grading changes and emphasize the upper lawn and terrace area.<br /> <br /> To connect paths, Olmsted planned for sequences of stairs, with low plants and vines covering the slope. On May 9<sup>th</sup>, 1885, Olmsted wrote to the New London Park Commission that “The outlook towards the Sound is not to be improved by producing superficially any suggestion of the 'natural' or existing conditions. (It would be very greatly improved by the purely artificial arrangements that have been suggested.) I can think of nothing better and nothing less costly to be done with the quarry district than to handle it as I have proposed, making a defile by excavating a considerable amount of rock; building the terraces so as to increase the effect of depth and abruptness or declivity in this defile; establishing pockets and making deposits of soil from which to grow vines and rock plants by which to tie the rock in place artificially to the rock set up, and soften the asperity, hardness, and coldness of the material, and by opening a convenient circuit of communication through the defile by which this otherwise intractable part of the property would be utilized and seem by contrast to give value to the other part in which there is a possibility of obtaining gracefulness of surface and more tranquility of character.”",

Regarding the topography of the area, Olmsted advised to “take it as it stands, develop to the utmost its natural characteristics, and make a true retreat not only from town but from suburban conditions” and that “every inducement should be offered visitors to ramble and wander about.”<br /> <br /> After retiring in 1885, Olmsted would stop work on Middlesex Fells.

At the time, Montreal was 200 years old, with a population of 120,000, situated at the foot of a looming pile of rocks a mile long and a half mile wide. Calling it a mountain was generous, as it was only 735 feet high, but some of its sides could get incredibly steep, and surrounded by a countryside with a flat valley, it loomed over Montreal.<br /> <br /> In his first report to the Montreal Park Commission, Olmsted stressed “the power of scenery to eliminate conditions which tend to cause nervous depression or irritability”. He claimed that a charming natural scenery “acts in a more directly remedial way to enable men to better resist the harmful influences of ordinary town life”.<br /> <br /> Olmsted truly believed his parks would have a therapeutic effect on all who entered them, where people could enter a cheerfully musing state where the mind is left unoccupied. At Mount Royal Park, Olmsted thought that the mystical effect of this natural landscape would provide city dwellers with a therapeutic release.",

Flowing north, it connects Jamaica Pond, Willow Pond, and finally Leverett Pond. At this point is a narrow channel that flows between Brookline and Boston eventually passing through the Back Bay Fens towards the Charles River. Before Olmsted, the river was a narrow, winding, and tidal and it was the tide that helped keep the stream relatively clean. By 1800 though, the pressures of an increasing population were changing the Muddy River from an inoffensive little stream into a source of disease, and its surroundings from a pleasant valley into a potential slum. Roads, railroad tracks and a tidal basin (built to generate power) all helped to interfere with the natural tidal action that twice a day, flushed the area out. The filling of the Back Bay at mid-century also helped to make sure that the 100 acres of marshland the river flowed through would be \"the filthiest marsh and mud flats to be found anywhere in the State of Massachusetts\" unless a pollution solution was found.<br /> <br /> Frederick Law Olmsted took the challenge of cleaning the Muddy River and redesigning it starting at the Back Bay Fens and continuing up to Jamaica Pond. He successfully cleaned out the dirty water and did away with the horrifying and putrid smell. Bridges played a critical role in his design. Not wanting to stop the flow of people across the city, multiple bridges were provided. Some were designed by Olmsted firm members, others by local architects including H.H. Richardson, and along this stretch of the Muddy River his successor firm, Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge. The Longwood Avenue Bridge is the largest of these bridges.<br /> <br /> Since the fall of 1996, the Muddy River has flooded three times, damaging local neighborhoods. This flooding called the city and state into action with the assistance of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Muddy River Restoration Project aims to improve flood control, water quality, wildlife habitat, and historic landscape treatments. The project is currently focusing on flood control and water quality to both recover from past damage and prevent future damage. The Army Corps of Engineers is leading this part of the project.",

To celebrate the connection to the Museum, tree-lined streets were named for artists, curving around the natural topography, designed with minimal access to the highway to avoid cut-through traffic.<br /> <br /> Within the Munsey Subdivision, five parks, a school, and three businesses were incorporated. By 1930, 162 homes were completed in the Colonial Revival style and work on a shopping center was underway.

It was decided that a suitable memorial should be erected for Nancy.<br /> <br /> From 1922 to 1938, the State of Indiana hired Olmsted Brothers to design a memorial site. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr ensured the landscape retained a strong North/South axis, allowing for processional and contemplative experiences. This axis would connect the gravesite of Nancy Hanks to a visitor center and open court.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. took the lead in developing a plan to simplify the area around Nancy Hanks’ gravesite, whose landscape had been through many design changes over the years. A cruciform arrangement combining a main allée with plant beds was established, providing a “strong spiritual imagery”.<br /> <br /> Before briefly leaving, Olmsted Jr. proposed reforesting part of the site to provide a backdrop for the design.

The Industrial Revolution of the early 19th century had taken the natural beauty of Niagara Falls and abused it, with buildings going up along the river to harness its power.<br /> <br /> Olmsted took his first trip to Niagara Falls in August 1869, while working on the Buffalo parks and parkway system. He was accompanied by William Dorsheimer, the district attorney for northern New York and the man who headed the Buffalo parkways commission as well as H.H. Richardson, a friend of Olmsted’s who was working on Dorsheimer’s estate. All three men were appalled with this marvelous view of nature being obscured.<br /> <br /> In the late 1860s, a small band of early environmentalists who were concerned over the river’s decreasing flow, founded the Free Niagara movement. Intellectuals like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Charles Darwin joined Olmsted in the Free Niagara movement. The movement believed that the natural beauty of the land surrounding Niagara Falls should be protected from commercial exploitations and remain free to the public.<br /> <br /> The breakthrough at Niagara Falls came in 1883 when Dorsheimer’s close friend, Grover Cleveland, became governor of New York, and signed a bill calling for the establishment of a state park at Niagara. The Niagara Appropriations Bill was signed into law in 1885, creating the Niagara Reservation. Park commissioners first began by clearing out structures that had blocked views along the upper rapids, limiting the number of factories in the areas downstream.<br /> <br /> Olmsted and Vaux began the landscaping that gives the American side of Niagara Falls its distinct character— ambling walkways and idyllic glades for visitors to contemplate the beauty of nature. Though the view looking into Canada has changed over time, if you’re willing to work for it, you can find certain spots where you’d see the same view Olmsted first did.",

Two years after the breakup with Vaux, Olmsted presented a report to the Buffalo Park Commission, rejecting their idea of transforming the square into a public garden. Instead, Olmsted suggested planting trees and providing seating along the square, as well as a fountain at the square’s center.<br /> <br /> Buffalo’s Board of Park Commissioners hired Henry Hobson Richardson to design an arch at the square, serving as a memorial to soldiers of the Civil War. For the placing, Olmsted requested the arch be “on one side of the Square and so as to span one of the wheel-ways…In this position it would be seen in its best aspect…The best light will then fall upon it; its inscriptions will therefore be more legible and its sculpture will have the best effect.” While Olmsted’s plan was approved, construction never commenced due to lack of funding, and today, the McKinley monument stands at the center of Niagara Square in memory of the President.",

Unfortunately, Olmsted had created such an elaborate design for the barns, that when the Reid’s opened their grand estate in 1892, the barns were still not completed.<br /> <br /> Reid had already acquired the professional help of architects McKim, Mead & White, who he wrote to at the end of 1892, stating that his “fear is that under the inspiration of Mr. Olmsted and with general tendencies of architects, he may be giving me a much finer thing than I want or rather much finer than I want to pay for”.<br /> <br /> Six years after Reid had asked Olmsted to choose a site and sketch plans for the farm building, construction of the barn began. Through 1895 the work proceeded without any delays, in part because Mead took over as chief architect when Olmsted fell ill. Today, remnants of Olmsted’s grand barn still exist.",

During the late 1880s and early 1890s, this land was the venue for numerous fairs and expositions.<br /> <br /> In 1895, the site was chosen for the Cotton States and International Exposition, at which point Olmsted Sr. was consulted on the layout of the exposition, influencing elements of the plan. After the extravagant exposition, Atlanta was unsure of what to do with the 187 acres of forest.<br /> <br /> The City of Atlanta was hesitant about buying the land, believing the park was too far away from the city. However, in 1904 Atlanta purchased the land that would become Piedmont Park, and even extended its city limits to encompass the park acreage.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{162}\" paraid=\"76405201\">In 1909, Atlanta elected to transform the decaying fairgrounds into a park.

So, Atlanta got the next best thing; they hired the Olmsted Brothers to develop its master plan.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{166}\" paraid=\"1404630820\">The Olmsted Brothers plan would utilize already present stone stairways as access paths between the different levels of the park’s grounds. Despite the City agreeing to pay $1,800 for the plan, Olmsted Brothers were concerned Atlanta may not have enough money to make necessary improvements as they came up.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{170}\" paraid=\"822705061\">As the Olmsted Brothers worked on Piedmont Park from 1909 to 1912, the design they implemented reflected the picturesque style and design principles they had learned from their father. The Piedmont Park the Olmsted Brothers designed featured broad grassy lawns and playing field, shaded woodland with over 15 miles of walks, drives, and bridal paths.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{174}\" paraid=\"837028613\">Due to budget constraints, some, but not all, of the Olmsted Brothers’ plan was realized. Nevertheless, the Olmsted Brothers plan greatly influenced the development of Piedmont Park. Much of the landscape and vistas remain today, providing green space for the urbanized neighborhoods surrounding the park.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{178}\" paraid=\"1382105481\">Though the Olmsted Brothers plan wasn’t fully realized, the current master plan for Piedmont Park, adopted in 1995, honors the brothers’ original vision for the park.</p>",

It was at Jamaica Park that the real landscape architect was Mother Earth. Crafted not so much with shovels and surveying equipment but rather by the slow drag of glaciers, Jamaica Pond's natural perfection brought out a side of Olmsted that people are not as familiar with: Olmsted the conservationist. Here, standing under the overhand of pine and hemlock that, \"darkening the water's edge\", brought \"beauty in reflections and flickering half-lights,\" stood not the man who moved earth and blasted rock to create Central Park, but instead the philosopher who have words to the belief that the government had an obligation to protect the untouched beauty of America in the future national parks such as Yosemite. With this philosophy in mind, Frederick Law Olmsted left Jamaica Pond the lease changed of all the parks in the Emerald Necklace.<br /> <br /> Prior to it becoming part of the Emerald Necklace, Jamaica Pond was used in a variety of ways. First as a water source, eventually becoming an economic tool used in the production of ice- a process that contaminated the pond's water. It also was used for recreation in a variety of ways: fishing, swimming, and especially skating in the winter, saw people from across the city come to visit the pond. Bostonians from all backgrounds could gather and enjoy the water. Over time however, the accessibility for all Bostonians to get to Jamaica Pond was curtailed as the rich began buying the property around the pond for summer homes. This caused the value of the surrounding land to skyrocket. In fact, the land outside of Jamaica Pond has become so expensive that when the Park Commissioners were looking to buy land for the modern Jamaica Park (Jamaica Pond taking up about half the area of the park), they were only able to buy a small ring around the water, along with the property of the Perkins family.<br /> <br /> Overlooking the pond, this estate, known as Pinebank, saw three generations of the family build three separate houses, each constructed upon the wreck or the burnt-out ruins of the last. After incorporation into the park, the Pinebank mansion served multiple purposes: from a restaurant, to Boston's first children's museum, to a location to exhibit the works of the city's new and emerging artists.

Olmsted taught all who entered his office to preserve and enhance the existing natural features of the site they’re working at, and at Revere, Eliot’s design called for restoration of the natural contours of the beach.<br /> <br /> Rail accesses introduced in 1875 allowed for easy access to an already popular coastline, though Eliot removed all railroads and buildings that impeded the view of the sea. To remedy the removal, Eliot’s design included a boulevard along the length of the shore for several new structures.<br /> <br /> An already popular coastline began developing as quickly as Eliot could design, with new dance and music halls, hotels, cinemas, and amusement parks popping up. America’s oldest beach, and the first in the United States acquired for the purposes of public recreation officially opened its 4.5-mile crescent-shaped stretch in 1896, with 45,000 people gathering to celebrate.",

Olmsted prescribed well-built, well-drained roads with carefully curved lines and generous plantings in the hopes of creating an attractive and highly functional public grounds for rest and recreation.<br /> <br /> Respecting family privacy, Olmsted’s design facilitated interaction between neighbors by providing informal parks and playgrounds, as well as areas for strolling, boating, and other recreational activities. Unfortunately, the combination of the Chicago Fire of 1871 and a financial panic in 1873 ended the flow of funds and led to bankruptcy of the Riverside Improvement Company.

After 2 years of gathering information, Olmsted Sr. submitted his report, proposing a combined park and parkway adhering to the curves of the landscape.<br /> <br /> In his report, Olmsted Sr. wrote that Riverside Park “presented great advantages as a park because the river bank had been for a century occupied as the lawns and ornamental gardens in front of the country seats along its banks. Its foliage was fine, and its views magnificent”.<br /> <br /> Alongside that river Olmsted Sr. planned Riverside Drive, a treelined roadway winding through the rocky landscape.

In his design, Olmsted Jr. created streets differentiated by function. Olmsted Jr designed main roadways “for direct, ample, and convenient transportation,” while local, narrow streets were carved out of “quiet, self-contained and garden-like neighborhoods.” This helped to establish an arrangement of varied architecture and views.<br /> <br /> Also in Olmsted Jr.’s plan for Forest Hills were a variety of public green spaces. A central town Green provides a sharp contrast to the Queens landscape across the railroad tracks. Olmsted Jr also designed two smaller community parks for walking, relaxing, and festivals. In partnership with Atterbury, Olmsted Jr. were able to harmoniously mix landscape and architecture.",

Because of this, many cemetery designs began to emulate a park-like setting.<br /> <br /> In the early 1900s, brothers William and Henry DeForest purchased 10 acres of land in the hopes to create their own cemetery in Cold Spring Harbor, NY. The land of their proposed cemetery sat right next to St. John's Church, which already operated its own burial grounds. Both DeForest brothers wanted St. Johns to administer their property but still have it in their name, which St. Johns refused.<br /> <br /> In the end, the DeForest brothers sold 7 acres back to St. Johns, keeping the remainder for personal use. After already hiring Olmsted Brothers to design each of their estates, the DeForest brothers again reached out to Olmsted Brothers.<br /> <br /> While the Olmsted Brothers were hired to design the DeForest brothers’ 3-acre plot, St. Johns realized that the esteemed landscape architecture firm was already in the area, so why not retain them to design their 7 acres of land.<br /> <br /> In the end, Olmsted Brothers continued working on new sections of the cemetery from 1918 to 1958. While these new layouts were much smaller and less park-like compared to the original designs of 1918, some prominent plot owners did like to go over the top with their design.",

While there was some correspondence in the years between, it wasn’t until 1925 that the park board formally hired Olmsted Brothers to review park development projects for the area. With John Charles involved in several projects across the country, it was firm member and architect Percival Gallagher who traveled to St. Joseph’s for several days.<br /> <br /> By April of 1925, Gallagher had sent a detailed report of his recommendations for St. Joseph, as well as a proposal for Olmsted Brothers to provide working drawings and supervise construction. Almost immediately after receiving this proposal, it was rejected, and another architect was hired to supervise the improvement of the park system.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers were turned down because of their cost of construction; Olmsted and Gallagher calculated that they would need $30,000, while their competition only asked for $11,500. When it came to designing park systems, John Charles believed “A quiet drive or stroll in a large park, or in the country, with perhaps a family picnic under the trees, would be far more restful and therefore more rational than to rush off by train to some Coney Island pleasure resort, with its various artificial attractions.”",

One proposal that Olmsted ardently promoted was that the estate include an arboretum of all the trees and shrubs native to Vermont.<br /> <br /> A great deal of planting was done according to Olmsted’s recommendation, but the arboretum was never completed.

They brought in Frederick Law Olmsted to turn the entire campus into an arboretum.<br /> <br /> Smith College was only twenty years old when Olmsted delivered his first set of plans the following January. Olmsted formed the upper campus in an irregular circle of buildings, which he approvingly characterized as “informal and unpretentious…irregular [and] homelike”.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s views were formed by the New England village setting he grew up in, and when laying out any college campus, he proposed a “domestically scaled suburban community, in a park-like setting”. The founders of Smith shared these views, wanting curved lines, open spaces, and diverse plantings.<br /> <br /> There were several arguments on what would be included in the final design, and after going behind his back and hiring a young botanist to procure all the plantings, correspondence between Olmsted and Smith College stopped.<br /> <br /> In 1897, when the need for expansion became too pressing a matter to ignore, Smith College again reached out to Olmsted, this time, John Charles, and Frederick Jr. Olmsted Brothers was now faced with the difficult task of putting more buildings on a college campus that had grown in every way but acreage. In one of their final correspondences with Smith College, Olmsted Brothers warned against clipping shrubby, instead encouraging it to grow wild.",

Under Olmsted's careful guidance, most of the trees and the old driveway were removed, the barn relocated, and underground drainage systems lain. Finally, inspired by the \"green, dripping. glistening, gorgeous\" scenery of the English countryside, Olmsted graded, reshaped, and replanted the space.</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">In many ways, the South Lawn at Fairsted is like the Long Meadow that Olmsted designed in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. Both employ the Beautiful, or Pastoral, style to soothe the soul and restore the spirit. Though the area here is fairly small, there is an appearance of spaciousness due to varied values of green, indefinite boundaries, and the delicate interplay of light and color.<br /> <br /> Olmsted's pastoral landscapes often feature elms as a focal point for the contemplation of scenery. Olmsted kept this elm when he redesigned the property in 1883. In 2011, the National Park Service removed the elm when it showed advanced symptoms of decline and structural instability. Today, cuttings taken from the tree are being propagated with the hope that a genetic match can be replanted for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

Stanford wanted the best, so for the grounds of his campus, he hired Frederick Law Olmsted.<br /> <br /> From his arrival in the Fall of 1886, Olmsted’s relationship with Stanford would be a tumultuous one. From the selection of the site to determining the orientation of the main quadrangle, Stanford was involved in every major decision on the campus.<br /> <br /> Stanford wanted his school to rival those of New England’s Ivy League campuses, however Olmsted proposed a campus uniquely suited to California’s climate. Stanford dictated much of Olmsted’s design work on the project, envisioning a campus monumental in scale and formal in design, while Olmsted proposed a campus nestled into the hills around the property. However, Stanford insisted the campus be built on flat land, with a grand axial approach in the center of campus.<br /> <br /> As a strong-willed client, and putting in $30 million to the design, many of Stanford’s ideas were largely implemented. Nevertheless, Olmsted won a key disagreement when he proposed the main campus quadrangle be paved and contain plantings of native trees and shrubs.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted’s vision of open, interlocking quadrangles was gradually lost due to campus development, the quad design illustrates a key Olmsted principle-sustainability. Olmsted's recommendation of paved space and native plants over lawns showed an understanding of the resources needed to maintain a landscape.",

The Olmsted design also included triangles of open green spaces at intersections, intended for gatherings of residents, which it is still used for.<br /> <br /> The approach road to Sudbrook took the community through a distinct entranceway: a narrow bridge, after which five roads fanned out into the community. Additionally, hardwood trees and lush vegetation lined the roads of Sudbrook.<br /> <br /> At Sudbrook Olmsted included sixteen deed restrictions, the most he had ever done, to protect the visual quality of his plan, and preserve the residential character of the neighborhood.

The most formal of the three parks linked by parkways, Olmsted saw The Front as a spot with “a character of magnificence admirably adapted to be associated with stately ceremonies, the entertainment of public guests, and other occasions of civic display.”<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s design for The Front included a playground, grassy fields for baseball and cricket, and an amphitheater, the last of which was proposed by Vaux. Next to the playground is a formal gravel space referred to as “The Terrace”, and a steep slope leads down to the Erie Canal and railroad lines. To avoid park users from seeing these, Olmsted screened them with thick plantations, and benefited from the natural difference in elevation.<br /> <br /> As with many Olmsted designed landscapes, The Front was artfully constructed to enhance nature. Extensive pathways and carriage drives provide accommodation to those walking and driving. When viewing The Front, an early Buffalo Parks Commissioner noted that “In the summer and autumn months it is fanned by a cool westerly breeze, almost constantly blowing from the lake….”",

Though young at the time, Olmsted chose Parker to lead the project, in part because he was a talented landscape architect, but most of all because he was a member of the Masonic Fraternity.<br /> <br /> Like Olmsted Sr. at Biltmore, who had recommended the orientation of the home to provide the most dramatic views, Parker also gave a recommended orientation for the Memorial: east, for ritualistic purposes. Parker created a dramatic entry to the Memorial, including a curvilinear drive and axial stairway, both ending at a grand plaza.<br /> <br /> While some of Parker’s plan, specifically the planting, wasn’t implemented, features that were executed are vital to experiencing the Memorial.

This design would emphasize the importance of the view between the U.S. Capitol Building and the Washington Monument.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. made radical planting changes during his work on the National Mall, removing nearly every tree and replacing them with rows of American elms, following what was described in the 1901 McMillan Plan.

They asked Frederick Law Olmsted to begin his first work in California and design the 209-acre hillside property.<br /> <br /> Olmsted created his initial plan in 1864, though he would refine it over the next two years. He carefully selected drought-resistant plants that would line curving uphill paths, allowing for expansive views of the Bay Area, while also screening the cemetery from heavy winds.<br /> <br /> For his design, Olmsted drew on the philosophy of American Transcendentalism, which was popular at the time. As open space began disappearing in cities, people began flocking to cemeteries, which they saw as a replacement for the forests and fields taken up for development. Mountain View Cemetery stands out from the other cemeteries of its time because of Olmsted’s vision to look at man and nature and their relationship to one another.<br /> <br /> To compliment his winding paths, Olmsted brought in trees simple in form and color, though distinctive in shape, which helped create a setting of beauty and peace. He designed Mountain View Cemetery to serve as an example of a civilized life, where one both lives and dies in harmony with the environment.<br /> <br /> As families began buying up plots in the cemetery, it appeared the resting place would serve the affluent of the Bay Area, with many monuments being erected on the grounds. When Olmsted began work on Mountain View Cemetery, the land was 209-acres. Since then, it has expanded to over 226 acres, though with every new addition, there is sensitive treatment to Olmsted’s original design.",

Photos were often the first step in a landscape design project, because they were used as reference for engineers. Photography was used not only to show the evolution of a project, but also could be manipulated to show how certain placements of trees could affect views of the area. The drawers were used to hold not single photographs but albums, all relating to a certain landscape’s design process. The typewriter on the desk was used to label photographs as they were pasted onto album sheets. The numbers on each box represented cities, with 900 representing Boston, and 500 representing NYC.

There was a key at the top of the plan, and throughout the plan numbers scattered, correlating to the key and what species could be planted.

The Olmsted firm had two different methods for printing. The first was that an image on trace paper was placed on top of another paper filled with chemicals that would react in the light. The two papers were then rolled outside of the window on platforms, where they would print and dry in the sun, a form of sun printing. Being New England, you can’t always count on it to be sunny. And you may have experienced, even when it is the season for the sun to be glaring down, weather can get in the way, so another form of printing had to be brought in. What they brought in was a machine called the Wagenhorst, and it worked the same way sun printing does, only staff could operate this year-round. A carbon lightbulb would be lowered into the tube, and just like with the window, trace paper would be placed on top of a chemical-reacting paper and pushed up against the tube. This screen would come out and cover the entire tube, ensuring no light got in. The light caused a chemical reaction where it would pass through the paper, creating a blue coloring, with white lines showing where the light hadn’t touched. The Olmsted’s wouldn’t leave the chemicals on the paper, so it was brought to the next room and fully developed in a bath. The wet plans were then placed on drying frames, then rolled into the closet, where a heater would speed along the process. There were many different sizes of plans coming out, so several drying frames of different sizes had to be created. For Blue Hills Parkway, Olmsted needed three, twenty-five foot sections of plans to encompass all of it. ",

Starting as a two story vault, a third was added when it was realized just how much materials needed proper storing. In the photographic records room, there was a fear about keeping such valuable materials stored in wooded boxes, in a wooded home. Part of Fairsted is not the wooded house, but a brick area. This brick area is the vault, which would prove a better defense against fire. Harry Perkins was tasked with overseeing the complex organization and distribution of the firm’s plans. The office cartoons those in the Olmsted firm were so fond of making includes a take on Perkins role in the vault. He was meticulous about his organization method, refusing anyone access to get materials from the vault, because one plan put back out of order could mean it’s lost for years. When the NPS arrived at Fairsted in 1979, what they saw was stacks of rolled up tubes of paper pilled on oneanother. That was Perkins organizational method.

Within days of Shackelford’s request, Olmsted Brothers responded expressing interest in working at Troy, estimating their cost between $1000 and $2000, however a lack of funding stopped Olmsted Brothers from beginning work in 1922.<br /> <br /> Thankfully, five years later, the Alabama State Legislature approved $5.4 million dollars for buildings throughout the State, and at the same time the Alabama Board of Education signed a deal with Olmsted Brothers to make plans for higher education institutions in the state. For several years, Olmsted Brothers studied and surveyed the landscape at Troy, eventually calling for a large, open pedestrian quad to anchor the campus.<br /> <br /> In a June 1930 letter, Olmsted Brothers wrote to Shackelford that Troy was “by far the largest of any of the schools” the firm was working on at the time. Olmsted Brothers worked with Troy for decades, with the Brookline firm sending a floral engineer to arrange plantings around the campus.

Prominent Boston landscape architect Charles Eliot, not yet with the Olmsted firm, was hired to design the park. Shortly after beginning work, he partnered with the Olmsted’s, forming Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot.<br /> <br /> Tyler Park, which would become an important selling point for house lots in the area, was designed to take advantage of the area’s natural features. Eliot’s design included paths, a central fountain, and a play area for children. After Eliot’s untimely death in 1897, John Charles Olmsted continued to supervise work on the park.<br /> <br /> At Tyler Park, John Charles was disappointed in the construction, particularly the stonework of the central fountain, which would be dismantled in 1906 to make way for a rockery. Despite Eliot’s vision never fully being realized, much of his original design is still evident; the topography, trees and rocks, as well as original paths were all incorporated into the restoration work in the late 1990s.",

Describing his plan for the Capitol, Olmsted said that “the ground is in design part of the U.S. Capitol, but in all respects subsidiary to the central structure.”<br /> <br /> To not detract attention away from the Capitol Building, Olmsted was careful not to group any trees or other landscape features together. He also strongly believed that the use of sculptures and other ornamentations should be kept to a minimum.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted was determined to have the grounds compliment the building, he also felt the need to address architectural problems that had persisted for years. Washington, D.C. was expanding west, and the terraces of the Capitol Building did not seem to support that notion. Olmsted proposed marble terraces on the sides of the building to “gain greatly in the supreme qualities of stability, endurance, and repose.”<br /> <br /> Work accelerated in 1877, both on the building and the grounds. Olmsted employed over 100 varieties of trees and bushes at the Capitol, with thousands of flowers used in seasonal displays. In 1878, after hundreds of flowers had been destroyed or stolen by vandals, watchmen were appointed to patrol the grounds and proved quite effective, allowing the lawns to be completed.<br /> <br /> In 1885 Olmsted retired as superintended of the terrace project, though he continued to direct work on the grounds until 1889. His goal in working on the Capitol was not to detract from the building but compliment it with the grounds. He did so by contrasting the buildings straight lines with the curved walkways of the grounds, the same grounds a bill must walk in the hopes to become a law.",

After forming the Union County Park Commission, Percival Gallagher of Olmsted Brothers was quickly hired to perform a countywide reconnaissance, evaluating the area’s potential for an expansive network of parks and riverside corridors, linked through cross-country parkways.<br /> <br /> Just as Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. would have done, Gallagher proposed setting aside land for both passive and active recreation. The Olmsted firm’s plan was to create several large park units that would serve the entire country, as well as smaller parks to serve local communities. In their 1921 proposal, Olmsted Brothers wrote that “The attractiveness of much of the County, therefore, is to be found in its pleasantly undulating topography and the quiet pastoral character of the countryside, in which the chief details of lively interest are the many streams of water and ponds along their way. These streams and ponds, under the circumstances, become particularly important in any consideration of the natural physical features of the country.”<br /> <br /> Despite passing away in 1934, Gallagher shaped a remarkably varied park system consisting of both urban and suburban parks, a mountain reservation, and parkways. Upon Gallagher’s passing, the Union County Park System paid tribute to his “wide vision, far-flung experience and high knowledge of the beautiful and the practical.” Olmsted Brothers, and later Olmsted Associates, continued advising the Union County Park Commission well into the 1960s.",

After visiting the site in the foothills of San Francisco Bay, Olmsted proposed a plan where students live in cottages arranged in a picturesque style, with meandering roads and paths around them.<br /> <br /> Olmsted envisioned a divided roadway curving through the base of surrounding hills, lined with private residences with landscaped grounds. The 1886 “campus park” plan established an east-west axis and characterized by the sloping terrain of the area. By integrating the campus into the surrounding community, Olmsted believed students would benefit from a balance between “a suitable degree of seclusion and a suitable degree of association” with the rest of the world.<br /> <br /> One of Olmsted’s first campus plans, it was not implemented by Berkeley’s founders, though it would form the basis for Olmsted’s ideas on campus planning.

On his return, he partnered with entrepreneur J.J. Vandergrift, as McMurty had plans of expanding his factory to nearby hilly farmland along the Kiskiminetas River. The dream was that factory workers would buy, not rent, their homes to ensure a committed labor force.<br /> <br /> In 1895, McMurty requested Frederick Law Olmsted to develop the plans for his factory village, but with Olmsted Sr. already retired, John Charles Olmsted took the lead at Vandergrift. John Charles wanted the factory life separate from town, so he located railroad and factory buildings on flatland by the river, while placing residential areas and main businesses on high ground, above the sound and smoke pollution.<br /> <br /> At Vandergrift, John Charles envisioned wide, paved streets that could drain easily, many single-family lots and small parklets, all curving around the hillside, following the river. John Charles’ plan was implemented so quickly that lot sizes were reduced to maximize house sites, and roads were narrowed.",

Two years later, the historic dam was reconstructed along with a 36-foot footbridge.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers submitted their final planting plan in 1932, which included lining commercial avenues with trees allowing for a separation of the park from more commercial zones.

The original shallow bay became a foul salt marsh after the filling in the Back Bay in the mid-19th century. Then, Frederick Law Olmsted, working with the city engineer, converted the smelly grounds into a \"park\" with a stream running through it that Olmsted described as a \"sanitary improvement\". Later, the park changed again when the Charles River Dam was built in 1910, changing the water flow patterns throughout the Fens. Olmsted's original design became obsolete.<br /> <br /> In the 1940s the park changed yet again. Here, like across the nation, Victory Gardens sprang up- gardens in which to grow produce for the home front, allowing more food to be available for the soldiers fighting in World War II. The program was successful; Victory Gardens grew over half of the produce used during the war. But in the Back Bay Fens, the Victory Gardens were sustained and over 70 years later they are the nation's only continuously operating WWII Victory Gardens and they remain a beautiful landmark in the park. Many of the gardens are now filled with flowers instead of vegetables, but the spirit of the gardens has stayed the same.<br /> <br /> Olmsted believed that parks should aim to emulate a natural environment as closely as possible. Yet, he was a firm supporter of our nation and believed that practicality should trump aesthetics in public parks. ",

Olmsted, of Brookline Mass., the designer of the city’s projected park, is now in Chicago, looking after some landscape work there of which he has charge. On leaving there he will come directly to this city to make such changes in his designs as he deems advisable after inspecting the park as preliminary staked out. He is expected here the last of the week or the first of the next, and will probably remain several days. He will visit here frequently during the progress of the work.”<br /> <br /> John Charles started by acquiring more than 700 acres of woods and fields that would provide scenic vistas over the growing city, leading towards Lake Ontario. An addition to part of the park plan was contiguous land for a residential development. John Charles produced his first plan for Watertown Park in 1901 and would spend the next two decades supervising construction at the challenging, rocky site.<br /> <br /> The plan for Watertown Park included a formal tree-lined boulevard as the primary entrance, which would connect roads and paths curving through the park towards its summit. To mitigate the steepness, John Charles designed walls, overlooks, shelters, and steps that ascended the slopes, all accompanied by textured plantings.

For ten years Olmsted Brothers worked at West Point, expanding the campus into newly acquired land.<br /> <br /> Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. took lead on this design, with assistance from Edward Clark Whiting. They felt that variety in trees and greenery should be introduced to the site. Olmsted Jr. felt this would “add interest and pleasure to places which are now rather monotonous or even disagreeable. My idea is that for this purpose much native shrubbery, to be collected in the reservation, should be used.” In addition to an extensive planting plan, Olmsted Brothers also drew plans for staff headquarters, Lieutenant’s quarters, a gymnasium, and several academic buildings.",

This collaboration between the two men would help launch the “City Beautiful” movement, promoting the inclusion of green space in urban centers to improve the community’s morale and quality of life.<br /> <br /> Twenty years before the exposition, Olmsted and Calvert Vaux had conceived of lushly planted lagoons for this area of Chicago, which would finally come to fruition. Olmsted would dredge the swamp in the area, leaving an island at the center of the lagoon, dubbed The Wooded Island, which was meant to be the central piece of landscape architecture at the fair.<br /> <br /> As Olmsted would explain it, his goal in the design at the Chicago World’s Fair was ““to establish a considerable extent of broad and apparently natural scenery, in contemplation of which a degree of quieting influence will be had, counteractive to the effect of artificial grandeur and the crowds, pomp, splendor and bustle of the rest of the Exposition.”",

World's End is home to one of the highest points in the harbor and offers excellent views of Boston and the south shore.  </p> <p>Similar to other islands in the harbor, the Indigenous community used World's End seasonally for thousands of years before European colonization. According to European sources, the town of Hingham deeded the land from the Wompatuck, Squmuck, and Ahahden in 1662 in return for a \"valuable consideration.\" Colonists used the island for farming and grazing animals. Around that same time, colonists created a causeway, called \"the bar,\" which connected two of the outermost drumlins to the mainland.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>In 1855, John R. Brewer purchased a 10-acre parcel of land. Brewer began construction on the land immediately, erecting a caretaker's cottage the same year. The following year, construction on the main house began. In 1859, Brewer hired a \"landscape gardener\" who cut down many of the cedar trees and replaced them with ornamental trees and flowers.   </p> <p>Brewer purchased both <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/langlee-island.htm\">Langlee</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-sara.htm\">Sarah Islands</a>, and he continued to purchase land on World's End until he owned all but two parcels of land. He established a family farm with plenty of space for crops and pasturage. In 1886, Brewer hired <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-law-olmsted.htm\">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> to subdivide the plots into a redevelopment that would be called \"World's End.\" Olmsted mapped out roads, and created 163 lots. Although Brewer followed Olmstead's plans of tree-lined roads and groves, he never subdivided the lots. Brewer died in 1893, and left the estate to his children. By 1900, the estate included a creamery, a blacksmith shop, lodging for workers, greenhouses, and windmills. </p> <p>In 1936, Brewer's youngest daughter, Fanny Brewer, died. Farming operations ceased, though employees continued to care for the land. In the 1940s the military put a searchlight on one of the drumlins.<sup>2</sup> The Trustees of Reservation purchased the peninsula in 1967 and eventually the peninsula became a part of the Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park.

The hillside in the middle of the site, along with vegetation along the edges, separated the formal, symmetrical design at the top of the hill from the casual character of the lower area’s meadow. This subtle design technique keeps with the Olmstedian belief that potentially conflicting uses should be separated.<br /> <br /> According to Olmsted Brothers’ original plans, an eight-foot path was to encircle the entire site. A grass pathway once encircled the site, but no longer exists due to the loss of shrubs that defined the path’s edge. Wright Brothers Hill exhibits several characteristics of Olmsted’s design philosophies and practices.<br /> <br /> The diverse planting design combined with 100 different plant species at Wright Brothers Hill reflects the emphasis Olmsted placed on the liberal use of planting as a fundamental component of landscape design. A 1939 stock list specifies 8,181 plants for the site. Expansive lawns throughout the site, a large open meadow in the eastern portion of the site, and the dense tree and shrub plantings along the periphery and in specific other locations both define the spatial organization of the site and frame vistas into the larger landscape beyond.<br /> <br /> The site’s balance of formal and informal areas follows Olmsted’s idea that “formal design was generally limited to…special gathering areas.” Today, the site retains its original Olmsted Brothers plan.",

When viewing the grounds, Olmsted Jr. described them as “diversified and picturesquely undulating”, possessing “intricacy and mystery”.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. was asked to render his professional opinion about the plantation’s suitability “as an admirable winter resort development”. For nearly ten years, Olmsted Brothers worked with fellow professionals to bring to fruition their collective vision of all the property could be. Olmsted was particularly impressed with the area’s natural beauty, ability to extend golfing season, proximity to Charleston, and accessibility by rail.<br /> <br /> The collaborative professional team was composed of Olmsted Jr. Seth Raynor and James Gamble Rogers, course architects, to create an “admirable winter resort” first described by Olmsted Jr. in 1915.",

Many thought he was crazy to leave behind his landscape architecture work, and his father made sure Frederick knew his displeasure over the move. However, at the time no one could have known that this move would set the stage for the creation of parks from the natural domain.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{30}\" paraid=\"1014588677\">A year after his move to California, the state had secured a grant deeming Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove inalienable parkland. A commission was formed to oversee the creation of the public preserve, with Olmsted serving as Superintendent and Chairman.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{34}\" paraid=\"1912661631\">Another year would pass before Olmsted wrote his report on Yosemite Valley and Mariposa, stressing the uniqueness of the valley, not because of the towering cliffs, but because of the union of the entire landscape, and the experience of taking it all in, uninterrupted.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{38}\" paraid=\"1710684116\">Olmsted wrote his report for Yosemite and Mariposa with a distinct eye for the times; the Civil War was over and he was expanding upon Lincoln’s vision for a broader, more inclusive interpretation of democracy as he wrote the foundation for our national park system.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{42}\" paraid=\"242410202\">Like father, like son, Olmsted Jr. would join in on his father’s fight 50 years later when asked to refine his father’s work and address the need for a new bureau to manage scattered parks and monuments. This would start a 6-year correspondence, culminating in Jr.’s writing of the Organic Act, which would help solidify the creation of the NPS, keeping great natural wonders in the hands of the people.</p>",

Focusing attention on the Huron River, Olmsted Brothers were blunt in their criticism of the area.<br /> <br /> In their report, Olmsted Brothers noted that “Huron River with its large natural reservoirs and its steep channel, was long ago claimed for economic uses, by water power development in a small unsystematic way. Many mills were built but most of them have since fallen into disuse and decay, and the river is now largely in a picturesque state of neglect. Its shores now overgrown in many places”.<br /> <br /> While hired to landscape Ypsilanti for its then six thousand residents, they were also able to design the area's parks as well. Olmsted Brothers called for green space along the river, a park entrance off of Michigan Avenue, and pathways along the perimeter of green space, all of which was implemented.",

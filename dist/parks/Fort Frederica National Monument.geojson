As the son of former slaves, the advocacy of rights became his life's work. Trained as a printer and lawyer, he turned to journalism to confront the prejudices of the day and founded <em>The Chicago Defender </em>in 1905. This would become the largest Black-owned daily newspaper in the world and the first to circulate over 100,000 copies. <em>The </em><em>Defender </em>denounced atrocities that affected Black Americans, was outlawed in many southern communities, and had to be smuggled to reach its audience. By praising life in the north, listing jobs, train schedules, and housing opportunities, the newspaper gave the hope and inspirations that launched the Great Migration. Eventually over one million rural black southerners would move north.<br /> <br /> In 1929, Robert Abbott placed a monument on St. Simons Island, at what is now Fort Frederica National Monument, in memory of his aunt and father. At a time when Black history was largely ignored, the monument ensured that his family was not forgotten.",

They brought their cultural customs, languages, and belief systems with them. Enslavement on isolated island and coastal plantations in the lower Atlantic coast created a unique culture with deep African retentions. Descendants of these enslaved people and their traditions are known as Gullah Geechee.<br /> <br /> Following the Revolutionary War, fourteen plantations were established on St. Simons Island, including the land that is now Fort Frederica National Monument. Owners used enslaved people to work the land. Burial sites were typically located on land unsuitable for farming or other commercial pursuits. The burials at Fort Frederica were discovered in the summer of 2019. Research is ongoing to discover more details about the lives of the individuals found here.<br /> <br /> The use of seashells, while not unique to Gullah Geechee culture, has been described as a connection to the water that transported them and would hopefully take them back to Africa after death.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

On July 7, 1742, decisive British victories at Gully Hole Creek and Bloody Marsh ended these claims. <br /> <br /> In June of 1742, a Spanish armada sailed north from Saint Augustine to invade the English colonies in hopes of taking lands that they considered theirs. Spanish commander Manuel de Montiano, the governor of Florida, hoped to destroy Frederica and lay waste to the coast as far north as South Carolina. On the morning of July 7, 1742 the Spanish suffered a defeat near Fort Frederica at Gully Hole Creek. That afternoon, Spanish reinforcements hoped to approach along the Military Road toward the fort but were met with an ambush. Scottish Highlanders (British) hidden in the woods along the marsh opened fire. The battle was decisive and short-lived. Legend has it that the marsh ran red with blood as the British muskets routed the Spanish force.<br /> <br /> The dual disasters proved fatal to the Spanish invasion of St. Simons Island and any hopes of controlling territory in Georgia.<br /> <br /> <strong>Bloody Marsh is located on St. Simon's Island, on 11806 Old Demere Road.

Oglethorpe led the chase for two miles and then as he raced back to Frederica for reinforcements the armies re-engaged. When Oglethorpe returned down the Military Road: <br /> <br /> OGLETHORPE: <i>“I found the Spaniards entirely routed by one Platoon of the Regiment under the command of Lieut. Sutherland and the Highland Company under the Command of Lieut. Charles Mackay.” </i><br /> <br /> Rain ended the battle. The marsh around the battlefield was stained red with blood. The day’s action would be known as the Battle of Bloody Marsh, July 7, 1742. Manuel de Montiano was now in the position that Oglethorpe had been in at St. Augustine; in hostile country facing unknown odds. Montiano sent ships to scout the river. These were repelled by Frederica’s cannon, which at last fulfilled their destiny. After several days of indecision, Montiano sailed for home. Frederica had prevailed. Oglethorpe declared a day of Thanksgiving, thanking God:<br /> <br /> OGLETHORPE: <i>“For his great deliverance and the end it has put to the Spanish Invasion.”</i><br /> <br /> <i></i>Oglethorpe was vindicated.

To succeed, he had to block Spanish supply lines and bombard the Castillo until Montiano surrendered. For three weeks, he kept up his cannonade. But his troops were scattered, and Montiano showed no sign of weakening. With no end in sight, Oglethorpe gave up. He had squandered men and money and had failed. Disgraced, exhausted and ill, Oglethorpe returned to Frederica to take up a different battle—a verbal skirmish with South Carolina over blame for the disaster.<br /> <br /> The first house after you pass Cross Street belonged to Daniel Cannon, a carpenter who built many of the houses at Frederica. The odd zigzagging shape of these foundations may result from additions to the original structure. Like Samuel Perkins, Cannon left Frederica, seeking wider opportunities in Charleston.<br /> <br /> CANNON: <i>“Look around you in any direction—a dozen houses I built, but why build a town for Florida to burn? In Charleston they say General Oglethorpe is dangerous!</i><br /> <br /> <i></i>Continue along Broad Street. The next house labeled, “A New House,” probably was built later in Frederica’s history, when the war with Spain had faded into memory. Keep walking past it to the next exhibit titled “Tavernkeepers”.<br /> <br /> Oglethorpe’s experiment was on the verge of crumbling. Settlers were leaving for better economic opportunities, Oglethorpe’s military strategy was questioned, the trustees halved his civil authority dividing Georgia into two counties. But Frederica’s greatest challenge was yet to come.<br /> <br /> Georgia’s spies reported that Manuel de Montiano was preparing to invade Georgia. Oglethorpe sent warnings to Savanah, Carolina, and England that unless help came soon, Fort Frederica could not survive. After months of futile petitions for aid, Oglethorpe wrote to the Duke of Newcastle: <br /> <br /> OGLETHORPE: <i>“…it is too late now to ask succors: before they can arrive the matter will be over. I hope I shall behave as well as one with so few men and so little artillery can.”</i></p>",

The remaining tabby foundation marks the home of Mary Musgrove Matthews Bosomworth, who lived on the lot in the 1740s. Half-Creek Indian and half-British, Musgrove was a frontier trader and Oglethorpe’s interpreter and liaison to the Indians. Her diplomacy bridged the gap between the two cultures and aided Oglethorpe’s desire for humane and peaceful relations with the Indians. She also helped secure Indian alliances against the Spanish. <br /> <br /> Archeological evidence shows that a living area was located on the left and a cooking area with a fireplace on the right. Sleeping quarters occupied a second floor or loft. Today it may be hard to imagine that entire families lived together in houses as small as this. Frederica’s settlers followed the same rural house-building traditions as their counterparts in England. James Oglethorpe chose settlers accustomed to hard work and plain living. Much of colonial life was spent outdoors working and gathering food. </p>",

Military Road extended from Fort St. Simons on the south tip of the island to the gates of Frederica. Francis Moore, Oglethorpe’s secretary, described St. Simons Island: <br /> <br /> MOORE (pp. 45, 46):<i> “The island abounds with deer and rabbits; there are no buffaloes on it, though there are large herds upon the main.… The woods on the island are chiefly live-oak, water-oak, laurel, bay, cedar, gum and sassafras, and some pines. There are also abundance of vines growing wild in the woods; one called the fox grape, from a kind of muscadine taste...”.</i><br /> <br /> Woody muscadine grape vines still thread the trees overhead. The low footbridge you are approaching was built to protect the enormous vine on the left, stretching to the ground as thick as a tree trunk. This vine may be 100 years old. As you pass it, you will see a second bridge ahead.",

James Oglethorpe likewise had his counterpart in Florida, Manuel de Montiano, Governor of Florida and commander of the Castillo de San Marcos at St. Augustine. Oglethorpe and Montiano fought a war of wits while they prepared for battle. Florida offered English slaves their freedom if they would fight for Spain. In turn, Oglethorpe captured slaves who tried to escape through Georgia. Both sides fought to secure the alliance of the Indians. Tomochichi warned that the Lower Creek tribes near Florida might side with Spain. Though sick with fever, Oglethorpe rode ten days to a tribal summit at Coweta. Impressed by his determination, the Lower Creeks promised to defend him. Creek warriors began regular raids on Florida. Oglethorpe denied any part in this, but suggested that the raids would cease if Spain retreated from the Georgia territories.<br /> <br /> At the start of the war, the town’s first settlers had lived at Frederica for three years. Many now longed for the wealth and comfort available in plantation colonies and resented Oglethorpe’s restrictions on their lives and livelihoods. On the foundations to the left stood the home of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Perkins, original settlers who would leave in frustration after five years in Frederica.<br /> <br /> MRS. PERKINS:<i> “I and my husband here are uses as beggars. In England, he was a coach maker, and prospered. But when he offered to improve our fortunes here by returning to that trade, Mr. Oglethorpe said he’s burn Sam’s first coach if he tried! And we work only as he permits—keeping store for the regiment while he plays at soldiers. Where’s the profit in this fools’ war? And now he commands us to provision him to take St. Augustine!” </i><br /> <br /> <i></i>Continue to the next house.</p>",

        "notes": "Town Model in the Museum\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/town-model-in-the-museum.htm\n\n<p>Frederica was the name of both a fort and its associated town. James Oglethorpe founded Frederica in 1736 to defend the three-year-old colony of Georgia. This model shows Frederica as she might have looked when her defenses were complete. A palisade wall surrounded the town. Inside the palisade lay well ordered streets and houses, where settlers plied their trades and raised their families; their lives intermingled with the soldiers of the garrison. To them all, this fortress on the Georgia frontier was home.<br /> <br /> At the top of the model a small fort guards the river. Look in the mirror at the back of the case for a view of Frederica from the water’s edge.<br /> <br /> Georgia, the 13<sup>th</sup> English colony in North America, filled the gap between South Carolina and the Spanish colony of Florida. This buffer region, claimed by both Spain and England, was known as the “debatable lands.” Frederica was British Georgia’s first line of defense against invasion by the Spaniards.<br /> <br /> Look up from the model through the window for a view of what remains of Frederica today. At first glance, you may see only a clearing in the woods, the trees festooned with Spanish moss. If you look closer at the ground however you see foundations of a house and traces of the town’s earthen palisade. The National Park Service is preserving Frederica’s ruins and archeological resources as they have survived through time. Most of Frederica’s buildings were abandoned or destroyed by fire in 1758, leaving the ruins as an archeological time capsule of life on the colonial frontier.<br /> <br /> Against the wall to your left, photos and artifacts highlight the role of archaeology at Frederica. Excavation of the site began prior to 1950. Archaeologists are still at work today piecing together fragments of the town. Exposed foundations, broken tools and pottery, along with journals, letters, maps, and inventories tell all we know today of Frederica.<b> </b></p>",

In his early years at Frederica he slept in a tent, even as he urged others to build fine houses. He finally built a home just outside the town—a modest estate known simply as “The Farm.”<br /> <br /> Today Oglethorpe’s fort still proudly flies the British King's Colors (1603-1801). For six years, Oglethorpe improved his defenses, convinced that the battle for the debatable lands would be decided here. There were higher, more comfortable sites for a fortress, but few better suited to a tactical defense.<br /> <br /> Fort Frederica did not face the ocean, where an entire Spanish fleet could surround it. A lookout post, Fort St. Simons, at the south end of the island watched for approaching vessels. Before hostile forces reached Frederica, they would have to sail past the guns of Fort St. Simons, then continue up the river on the inland side of the island. Fort Frederica stood at a sharp bend in the river, her guns facing south and west, though Oglethorpe knew Spanish strategy would bring an assault from the south.<br /> <br /> On the wayside a drawing of the fortification, circa 1742, shows that the island once extended farther into the river. Storms and erosion have washed away the shoreline where the spur was built.</p>",

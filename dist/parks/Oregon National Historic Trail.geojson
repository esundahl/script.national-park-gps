A Nebraska State Historical Society interpretive marker provides more information about these raids. There is also a granite marker a half mile to the mile north across the Little Blue River. From the state marker, look east toward the hillside to see a series of parallel wagon ruts heading toward your location. These wagon ruts, which are on private property, are remnants of the Oregon Trail. <br /> <br /> The sign reads, \"1864 Indian Raids. During the Civil War, many regular troops were withdrawn from Plains military posts to fight in the east. The Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho, seizing this opportunity, attempted to drive white settlers from their land.<br /> <br /> Beginning on August 7, 1864, the Indians made concerted attacks on stage stations and ranches along the Oregon Trail, hitting nearly every settlement for 400 miles from Julesburg to Big Sandy. Travel ceased for two months.<br /> <br /> The most severe attacks were along the upper Little Blue River where about 100 people were killed. Several died at Oak Grove, but others escaped and Pawnee Ranch was successfully defended. At 'the Narrows' the Eubanks families were attacked and seven killed. Mrs. Eubanks, two children and Miss Laura Roper were taken prisoner and held captive for months. Teamsters were killed, wagon trains burned and ranches were smashed or burned. Settlers fled east to Beatrice and Marysville or northwest to Fort Kearny on the Platte for protection. Troops and local militia companies attacked and drove back the Indians in the battle of the Little Blue on August 17, 1864. Major raids ceased but skirmishes continued through the fall.\"</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(State Highway 14 near Nelson, Nebraska)</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/1864_indian_raids.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Often, emigrants would spend several days here, waiting for the swollen waters of the river to drop to levels that were safe for fording. They found the area picturesque, with the spring originating in an unusual rock formation and falling over a rock ledge into a pool below.<br /> <br /> Emigrants carved their names in the rocks surrounding the spring, and many of these carvings are still visible. The ill-fated Donner Party camped here in 1846 and gave the spring its name. It was also the location of the Donner Party's first recorded death, Sarah H. Keyes, who died from consumption.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>Edwin Bryant, traveling with the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party, wrote a detailed description of the spring on May 27, 1846:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We found a large spring of water, as cold and pure as if it had just been melted from ice. It gushed from a ledge of rocks, which composes the bank of the stream, and falling some ten feet, its waters are received into a basin. . . . A shelving rock projects over this basin, from which falls a beautiful cascade of water, some ten or twelve feet. The whole is buried in a variety of shrubbery of the richest verdure. . . . Altogether it is one of the most romantic spots I ever saw. . . . We named this the 'Alcove Spring' and future travelers will find the name graven on the rocks, and on the trunks of the trees surrounding it.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(6 miles South of Marysville on the East River Road)</p> <p>Today, the spring is part of a 300 acre park.

Heavy wagons being pulled forward by livestock dug into the ground, creating ruts. These ruts were deepened and lengthen by wagons wet from river crossings, which made the ground muddy. The ruts were maintained, and grew, by the thousands of wagons that traveled through this area. When the Oregon Trail stopped being used, grasses and other plants slowly covered over the ruts, turning them into smooth depressions in the ground called swales. These trail swales cans still be seen today.

Russell and William B. Waddell who joined Majors in an attempt to gain a government contract to supply western forts.<a href=\"#2\">[2]</a> Already an experienced Santa Fe Trail dealer, Majors had the knowledge and equipment, while Russell and Waddell had the capital, to secure the government contract. For a short time, the company had a “virtual monopoly of the army freighting business in the west and southwest.”<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a> <br /> <br /> The 300-acre farmstead was dissected by the westernmost US border, making part of the property outside US jurisdiction and, thus, untaxable. The company’s barns, mule sheds, grazing lands, wagon and blacksmith shops, and other business-related entities were located on the portion of property located in the Kansas Territory.<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a> A caravan camp was used to load the heavy freight wagons which would travel the trails.<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a> <br /> <br /> The home was built in 1856, most likely using the labor of enslaved people.<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>  The “T” shaped floorplan with recessed front porch makes it a unique iteration of the Greek revival style in Kansas City.<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>  Today, it is one of the oldest buildings in Kansas City, as one of only 4 pre-Civil War buildings left standing.<a href=\"#8\">[8]</a> Though the house remains, many of the other original structures are gone and the land has been divided into distinct plots. Among the lost structures were living quarters for the 16-17 people enslaved by the Majors’.<a href=\"#9\">[9] </a><br /> <br /> In 1930 Louisa P. Johnston, Majors’s great grand-daughter, travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the house abandoned. She bought the house in 1932 and, for the next forty years, worked to preserve the property. In 1984 the Alexanders Majors House Museum was opened to the public for tours and events. In 2010 the house partnered with the John Wornall House and Museum to create one nonprofit dedicated to preserving both properties.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(8201 State Line Road (east side of road near 85th Street), Kansas City)<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.wornallmajors.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <br /> <br />   <div> <p id=\"ftn1\"><em><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Marc Simmons, Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers (Santa Fe, NM: Ancient City Press, 1984), p. 61.</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Martha Kusiak, “Alexander Majors House,” National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form.

Also, in a letter to his sister, William Glasgow, a Santa Fe trader, stayed overnight with the Barnes in 1846. A few days later a Susan Magoffin and her maid also stayed overnight with the Barnes Family.

From Alkali Springs, called by many pioneers Sulphur Springs, the emigrants traveled on to Birch Creek, which offered much needed water and grass of their livestock. First named 'Riviere aux Bouleaux' by French-Canadian fur trappers, here travelers found willows not birch. Continuing from Birch Creek, the parade of iron-rimmed wagon wheels inscribed ruts upon the landscape as they churned to the Snake River, only four miles distant. This was the origin of the gentle swale before you, a lasting signature of that vast emigration.\"</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Drove from the Sulphur Springs to Birch Creek, eleven miles distant.

It was also an important camping and staging area. In order to leave Grande Ronde Valley and continue on the Trail, emigrants faced a nearly 1000 ft. climb up steep valley walls. Teams of oxen had to be combined in order to pull the wagons up this rise. The area now known as Birnie Park provided a perfect location to do this.<br /> <br /> From the interpretive sign at the park:</p> <p>\"Having endured miles of alkali and sage, the Oregon Trail Pioneers paused at the summit near Ladd Canyon to admire the breathtaking oasis of the Grande Ronde Valley. The trail down the hill was also breathtaking. With chains, the emigrants rough-locked the rear wheels of their wagons, then skidded and bounced wide-eyed to the valley floor.<br /> <br /> On this site, many emigrants pulled off the Oregon Trail (present-day B Avenue) for a night of well-earned rest. They often found Indians from the Nez Perce of Cayuse tribes awaiting their arrival; not in ambush, as many feared, but with friendly greetings and an eagerness to trade. The farmers cast appraising eye at the waving stand of head-high grass and were tempted to linger. But provisions were short, the season was late. Still ahead lay the Blue Mountains and the chance of early snows. Daybreak found the oxen yoked for the grueling climb out of the valley.<br /> <br /> Many of the Oregon Trail emigrants carried fond memories of this lush valley. By the late 1850s, the good land in the Willamette had been claimed and a reverse migration began. Autumn of 1861 saw a small a group of families and single men building cabins in the Mt. Glen area of the valley. The following spring, Ben and Frances Brown, S.M. Black and William Chaffin staked out claims along the trail. Brown's cabin stood a few blocks west of here, near the southeast corner of C and Cedar streets. The village that grew around it, first called Brown's Town, was later renamed La Grande.\"</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (on C Avenue near Sixth Street, La Grande, Oregon)</p> <p>The 2.2 acre park currently contains a trail-themed playground, interpretive exhibits, and a small paved path with eight glazed ceramic columns.

The Lander Cutoff, a government wagon road explored and developed in 1857-1860 by topographical engineer Frederick W. Lander, diverged from the primary route of the California Trail at present-day Burnt Ranch, following older paths used by American Indians and trappers of the fur trade. Western historian Will Bagley estimates that more than 100,000 overland emigrants crossed this region by way of the Lander Cutoff. The graves of two known overland emigrants (Joseph Barnett, d. 1844, and Charles H. Miller, d. 1859) and as many as six unidentified burials of the trails era are located on the ranch. Many more emigrant graves are believed to exist at and around the site.<br /> <br /> During the 1800s, this location was the site of extensive Shoshone Indian villages; trading post, stagecoach, mail, and telegraph operations; a military outpost; emigrant and military encampments; and armed conflicts between the US Army and the Sioux and Cheyenne. In fact, Burnt Ranch takes its name from the burning of a stage station at Ninth Crossing during the Utah War in 1857, and by Sioux warriors in 1866 and 1868. It has been the headquarters of cattle ranching operations since the 1880s and remains so today.<br /> <br /> Trail remnants and historical remains of the developments and activities at Burnt Ranch have been determined to be nationally significant and eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Located approximately 8 miles SE South Pass City, Wyoming)<br /> <strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> No cell service.  Poor roads.  Prior Planning with an organized group is a must.<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Several crossing sites were used, but the Upper Crossing was the most important because it led to the best approach to the North Platte. However, this meant traveling over California Hill, which necessitated a steep climb of 240 feet in 1<sup>½ </sup>miles.

Over time, wind and water erosion slowly sculpted the rocks into their current courthouse or castle appearance. The rocks were first noted by Robert Stuart in 1812 and quickly became guiding landmarks for fur traders and emigrants. Travelers on the south side of the Platte river had a close-up view of these celebrated landmarks, which made them a popular item for emigrants to write about and sketch in their diaries.<br /> <br /> Today, the rocks are open to the public. Reaching them requires traveling on an unpaved road that is suitable for most vehicles when dry. At the end of the road is a hiking trail that leads to Courthouse Rock. Note, this trail used to lead to the top of the rock, but large sections of the trail have since eroded away. Use extreme caution when hiking. Open year-round, daylight hours. No tourist facilities at the site nor staff presence. </p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>In November of 1841, Rufus B. Sage recorded,</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A singular natural formation, known as the Court House, or McFarlan's Castle . . . rises in an abrupt quadrilangular form, to a height of three or four hundred feet, and covers an area of two hundred yards in length by one hundred and fifty broad. Occupying a perfectly level site in an open prairie, it stands as the proud palace of Solitude, amid here boundless domains.

In 1852, John Jeffrey began promoting a spur trail which traced traditional Shoshone migration routes. He wanted to generate business for his ferry at the mouth of the Blackfoot River. Although the cutoff received some use from 1852-1854, it was not until a decade later that a large percentage of Oregon Trail traffic chose the route.</p> <p>In 1862, an emigrant party asked guide Tim Goodale to lead them west from Fort Hall on the cutoff pioneered by Jeffrey. They hoped the alternate trail would enable them to reach the Salmon River gold fields more directly. Goodale succeeded in leading a group of 1,095 people, 338 wagons, and 2,900 head of stock safely from Fort Hall to Boise. It took this enormous wagon train -- the largest to travel any section of the Oregon Trail -- over 3 hours to get into or out of camp.</p> <p>By 1862, the Northern Shoshone and Bannock tribes were beginning to resist the intrusion of emigrants into their homeland. Skirmishes occurred between the Shoshone and emigrants near <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/massacre-rocks-state-park.htm\">Massacre Rocks State Park</a>. The growing hostility along the trail resulted in increased demand for a safe alternative. In 1863, seven out of every ten wagons en route from Fort Hall to Boise took Goodale's Cutoff instead of the main Oregon Trail.</p> <h3>Skirting the Lava Flows</h3> <p><br /> The 230-mile spur headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte, a conspicuous landmark on the Snake River Plain. From there it passed near the present-day town of Arco, wound through the northern part of Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, went southwest to Camas Prairie, and ended at Fort Boise. This journey typically took two to three weeks.</p> <p>Goodale's Cutoff took its toll on the travelers and their wagons. The rugged lava restricted travel to one lane, so progress was slow.</p> <p>The path along the edge of the lava flows was circuitous. The emigrants typically passed through in late July, the hottest part of the summer. Wood dried out in the desert air and shrank, causing wheels and boxes to come apart. Pioneers wrote of finding pieces of broken wagons littering the trail.</p> <p>For nearly 50 years, westward-bound pioneers used Goodale's Cutoff. Later, miners moving ore to railroad depots and stagecoaches carrying passengers to the towns of southern Idaho took the route. But the advent of the railroad and automobile led to the demise of Goodale's Cutoff as a wagon route. Today those driving US-20, which follows sections of the route, need not concern themselves with survival and can take time to appreciate the unique beauty of the harsh landscape.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location: </strong>Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along Highway 20/26/93 between Arco and Carey.</p>   <ul> <li>The route winds through the northern end of the monument out of sight of the road and intersects the highway 3.5 miles west of the visitor center. From that point on, watch for the dirt road as it follows the edge of the lava flows north of the highway.</li> <li>The cutoff is particularly easy to pick out 5.7 miles west of the visitor center, where the road drops down a steep incline. Look to the slope north of the road, where several earlier routes through this notch are visible. The highest road is Goodale's Cutoff.</li> <li>At Lava Lake, 11.3 miles west of the visitor center, there is a historical marker which describes Goodale's Cutoff.</li> </ul> <p>Goodale's Cutoff is not accessible by car within Craters of the Moon. Check at the visitor center for more information on where to see the trail.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/crmo/index.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

They frequently camped at the mouth of this large tributary of the Columbia River before crossing. In order to cross, some emigrant parties used the rocky islands near the river's mouth as stepping stones, while wagons were floated across and stock animals swam. Others forded the river using rafts. The lure of the nearby rich and fertile Willamette valley drove them ahead.<br /> <br /> Today, this area is managed as a state park. The original river crossing is now submerged beneath Lake Celilo, but wagon ruts are still visible on the hill on the opposite side of the Deschutes River. Exhibits at the Oregon Trail interpretive kiosk tell the emigrant story.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>Joel Palmer wrote a detailed description of the crossing on September 28, 1845:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The river is about one hundred yards wide, and the current very rapid; the stream is enclosed by lofty cliffs of basaltic rock. Four hundred yards from the Columbia is a rapid or cascade. Within the distance of thirty yards its descent is from fifteen to twenty feet. The current of this stream was so rapid and violet, and withal of such depth, as to require us to ferry it. Some of the companies behind us, however, drove over at its mouth by crossing on a bar.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Highway 206, 4.5 miles west of Biggs Junction)</p> <p>The park contains campsites, drinking water, public showers and restrooms.

Fort Kearny was also a place where emigrants could resupply and a Pony Express station.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>J. Goldsborough Bruff recorded his impressions on June 17, 1849,</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I visited the Fort . . . . This place is as yet merely the site of an intended fort; it has some adobe embankments, quarters of adobe & frame, and a number of tents & sheds. Is on the bank of the Platte, where Grand Island makes a narrow branch of the river between it and the shore.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Southeast of Kearney, Nebraska)</p> <p>Today, the park offers an interpretive center with trail-era artifacts, exhibits on the fort's history, uses over the years, and its residents. In addition, there are 40 acres of grounds with walking paths and reconstructed sod and adobe buildings. Modest admission is charged; Nebraska state park passes can be purchased at the interpretive center. </p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://outdoornebraska.gov/fortkearny/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <p> </p>",

        "notes": "Fort Mitchell Site\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/fort-mitchell-site.htm\n\nA grouping of historical markers commemorate Fort Mitchell, which was constructed in 1864 to protect emigrants traveling along the Oregon/California Trails from attacks by Native American groups. The actual fort was located south of the markers on private property along the North Platte River. Please respect private property by viewing the site from the pullout.   <h3>Forgotten Outpost</h3> <p>During America’s westward expansion, the United States Army established hundreds of small outposts throughout the frontier to protect settlers, maintain communication with the West Coast, and serve as staging areas for military campaigns. Some of these posts have become an integral part of American history, such as Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley in Kansas and Fort Laramie in Wyoming. Most served less conspicuously and then faded into obscurity. One such outpost was Nebraska Territory’s Fort Mitchell.</p> <h3>Protecting the West</h3> <p>The American Civil War brought a new significance to the western territories. The great overland roads such as Santa Fe, Oregon and California Trails continued to carry vast numbers of emigrants and tons of freight. Western gold fields were producing ore that helped finance the Federal government’s war effort, and the newly erected transcontinental telegraph lines helped bind westerners to the Union. But eastern battlefields drained regular Army soldiers from the frontier and left vital western territories unprotected.To provide a military presence in the West, the Federal government sent a few state raised volunteer cavalry regiments to garrison forts that had been vacated by the regulars. Among these volunteers were the 11th Ohio Cavalry, under the command of Colonel William O. Collins, who arrived in Nebraska territory in 1862. After marching west to Fort Laramie, they were immediately assigned the task of patrolling, escorting freight wagons and stage coaches, and maintaining the telegraph lines along the Oregon Trail in central Wyoming. Eventually, other units from Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas joined the Ohioans on the frontier.</p> <h3>Fight to Control the Plains</h3> <p>Traffic over the roads continued unabated until early August 1864, when the plains erupted in an Indian war that pitted the volunteer soldiers against Sioux, Arapaho, and Southern Cheyenne warriors. Determined to drive the Americans from their lands, plains warriors swept out of Kansas and attacked homesteaders, stage stations and freight caravans all along the Platte River. For several weeks, all traffic and communications over the Oregon Trail came to a halt. In response to these depredations, several military expeditions sought out the warring tribes, but failed to bring them into battle. This led Brigadier General Robert Mitchell to work to assure that the overland roads would never again be at the mercy of a hostile enemy.</p> <h3>A New Strategy</h3> <p>The general planned to fortify each stage station along the Oregon Trail and detail troops to protect them. He also decided to build two new forts at strategic sites along the Platte River. To help defend the road that branched off the Oregon Trail and followed the South Platte to Denver, the first post was built near Julesburg, Colorado. For the first year of its existence, this post was known as Fort Rankin, and had a garrison of soldiers from the 7th Iowa Cavalry. It proved its value by withstanding two Indian assaults in the early weeks of 1865, and later served to protect workers during the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. The second post was placed along the North Platte River near Scotts Bluff. Official records documenting Fort Mitchell’s history are meager, but construction had begun by September 1, 1864, the date General Mitchell visited the site. The general’s aide-de-camp noted that the men of the 11th Ohio’s Company F were hard at work building the sod structure. Captain Jacob Shuman, the first commander of the as yet unnamed post, gave General Mitchell a tour of the site and described his plans for a sod stockade he hoped to have finished before winter set in. By the end of October, most of the work had been completed and the post was named for the general who had ordered its construction.</p> <h3>Conflict Grows</h3> <p>Hostilities on the plains intensified after November 29, 1864, when Colorado volunteer soldiers killed several hundred Cheyenne and Arapahos at Sand Creek, Colorado. Rather than bringing an end to the conflict, the massacre at Sand Creek resulted in renewed warfare and bloodshed. Convinced that the southern plains were no longer safe, several Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho bands began to move north to spend the winter in the remote Powder River region of Wyoming. However, enroute they encountered military forces stationed along the overland roads. First, they crossed paths with the 7th Iowa Cavalry at Fort Rankin. On February 2, 1865, the Indians stripped the post of anything useful. Two days later, they attacked a fortified telegraph station at Mud Springs, Nebraska. The Indians failed to cut the telegraph wires, allowing the 11 desperate soldiers at the tiny outpost to signal Fort Laramie for help. The first cavalrymen to respond came from Fort Mitchell. The siege continued until February 5th, when additional support arrived from Fort Laramie. After some additional skirmishing, the Indian bands crossed the frozen North Platte River and continued northwest.</p> <h3>Seeking Peace</h3> <p>The spring of 1865 saw a short-lived attempt at peace on the frontier. Tired of warfare, the Brule Sioux came in to Fort Laramie and asked to be allowed to live in peace near that post. The Army welcomed the gesture, but was unwilling to support the Indians with rations this far west, and decided to move the band to Fort Kearny in central Nebraska. The wary Sioux were allowed to keep their weapons for the journey, while the cavalry escort was not issued ammunition in hopes of avoiding confrontation. Distrust and fear of being moved near their enemies, the Pawnee, led the Brules to flee just three days into the journey. While trying to prompt the Indians into striking camp, the commander of the escort was shot. A skirmish ensued, and reinforcements were sent for from Fort Mitchell. Before relief arrived, the Sioux escaped by crossing the North Platte River and the outnumbered soldiers did not pursue.</p> <h3>Life at the Fort</h3> <p>For the next two years, Fort Mitchell continued to serve as a reassuring force to travelers on the Oregon Trail. Hundreds of freight wagons, emigrant trains and stage coaches passed Fort Mitchell. Detachments from the fort safely escorted them all, despite the fact that the post’s garrison never exceeded 100 men. Conditions at Fort Mitchell were crude and demanding. Endless hours of patrol and escort duty were interrupted only by the constant maintenance of the fort’s sod walls and corrals. Poor sanitary conditions and a monotonous diet of hardtack and salt pork added to the soldier’s hardships. Despite the poor living conditions, only one man is known to have died at Fort Mitchell. Following the end of the Civil War, regular army soldiers returned to the West, and one company of the 18th Infantry was stationed at Fort Mitchell. These foot soldiers were helpless against highly mobile Indian warriors, and once suffered the indignity of having 112 mules stolen from a freight train camped within sight of the fort.</p> <h3>Fading into Obscurity</h3> <p>No official record of the post’s abandonment exists, but Margaret Carrington, wife of Col Henry Carrington, made one of the last accounts of Fort Mitchell as an active military post. The Carringtons stopped at the site in June 1866, and described it as follows: “This is a sub-post of Fort Laramie of peculiar style and compactness. The walls of the quarters are also the outlines of the fort itself, and the four sides of the rectangle are respectively the quarters of offices, soldiers, horses and the warehouse of supplies”. Soon after, Fort Mitchell faded into obscurity. The sod walls quickly deteriorated, and wind and rain removed all signs that the post ever existed. Today, plows turn up occasional reminders of Fort Mitchell in the form of rusted metal artifacts. Although no physical indications of the post remain, nearby Mitchell Pass preserves the name and serves as a reminder that for three years, Fort Mitchell stood guard along the Oregon Trail during an important period in American history.</p>",

A grassroots network of willing partners, volunteers, and locations serve as the Freedom’s Frontier Board of Trustees, the coordinating entity for the heritage area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{245}\" paraid=\"8\">Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area has a distinct landscape of rivers, hills, valleys, soils, and vegetation. In the 1800s, before the nation expanded across the continent, the western border of Missouri was the American frontier. To its west, Kansas was known as a permanent Indian Territory for both the Plains Indians and other tribes who were forcibly sent to the region following decades of land disputes. Since river travel ended at the Kansas border, this area became a major jumping-off point for pioneers heading west on extensive networks of trails. Traders, miners, and emigrants secured necessities and purchased provisions, and prepared for long overland treks.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{251}\" paraid=\"9\">In 1854, political tensions between Missouri and Kansas resulted in a violent border war as the Kansas territory sought statehood and debated the legality of slavery. At the time, Missouri was a slave state, and the issue of Kansas entering the Union as a potential “free state” ignited years of turmoil. The violent conflict between slavery proponents and abolitionists in the war known as “Bleeding Kansas” (or “Border War”) focused national attention on Kansas sovereignty and territorial law. This was one of the nation's most widely debated political crises in the years leading up to the Civil War. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed in 1854 left the territory's future status in the hands of settlers. The struggle for freedom was at the forefront of the Border War, and in the Civil War that followed. Although the Fugitive Slave Law made assisting runaway slaves a hanging offense in Kansas Territory, abolitionists continued to help slaves escaping from Missouri by the Underground Railroad.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{16}\" paraid=\"10\">After the Civil War, hundreds of African Americans came to settle in Kansas as part of the \"Exoduster Movement\" in the 1870s. Through the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, African Americans in both states continued the struggle for freedom from inequality and segregation during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights eras. One of the heritage area’s most well-known civil rights stories is found in the landmark Supreme Court case known as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas which ended legal racial segregation in public schools in 1954. Today, Freedom’s Frontier National Heritage Area continues to advocate for equal freedoms for all Americans.  Visit, explore and learn about the nation’s enduring legacy and struggle for freedom through the shared stories of courage, conflict, and hope for reconciliation as told across their broad landscape.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{69}\"

The rock derived its name from a party of fur trappers who camped and celebrated Independence Day near the rock on July 4, 1830. Eventually, thousands of emigrants camped at the foot of this 1,900 feet long by 850 feet wide granite outcrop. They carved their names and messages into the granite, using Independence Rock as a bulletin board for Oregon Trail travelers. In 1961, it was designated a national historic landmark managed by the State of Wyoming.<br /> <br /> Today, the site contains a footpath that goes around the base of the rock, interpretive exhibits that tell the trail story, visible trail ruts (a deep wagon swale passes beneath the path's footbridge), and emigrant inscriptions.

The Indians were then informed...the presents that they were to receive were given them because they had been friendly to the white men, and recommended that their friendship should continue. Col Landers then addressed the emigrants, telling them to treat the Indians kindly, and live in peace together.\"<br /> -Albert Bierstadt, July 5, 1859</p> </blockquote> <p> <br /> The end of the Lander Road's construction between Burnt Ranch, Wyoming, and Fort Hall, Idaho did not mean the end of the project. One item still had to be done- negotiate with the Native American Tribes whose land it was built on for the right of way. In 1859, Lander brought wagon loads of goods to give to the Shoshone, Bannock, and other Tribes in exchange for the privilege of crossing their land peacefully. On July 3, at the Green River crossing in what is today Wyoming, a celebration was held to disperse gifts to the Shoshone and to celebrate the 4th of July. The peaceful, festive celebration was attended by about 800 Shoshone, 300 emigrants (who happened to be in the area), and the soldiers and cavalrymen of Lander's command that were traveling with him.<br />  <br /> A feast was had, gifts were handed out, and speeches were made. Lander spoke directly to the Shoshone and then to the emigrants (partially quoted above). Contrary to the expected views at that time, Lander instructed the emigrants to have their interactions with the local Native Americans be cautious. They should treat the Native Americans kindly and to live in peace with them. The celebration extended into the night and concluded the following day.<br />  <br /> Several Additional celebrations and gatherings were held throughout the year with the same purpose of distributing gifts to Native Americans and negotiating with them to cross their land peacefully. In terms of Lander obtaining the needed right-of-way agreements, the negotiations were successful, concluding the first US government-sponsored trail section for the Oregon and the California Trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image Credit</strong><br /> 1.

        "notes": "Lander Road Cutoff- Lane's Grave\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/lander-road-cutoff-lane-s-grave.htm\n\n<p>In the mid-1800s, over 250,000 people followed the California Trail to California's gold mines and croplands. Most had to walk the entire 2,000-mile trip. Would you do this? More than once? Travelers in the 1800s said “yes” to both! The California Trail was their version of today's interstate highway -- a route that could be traveled repeatedly and in both directions.<br />  <br /> Similar to interstate highways, new parts of the California Trail were created to help travelers. The first US government sponsored section was the Lander Road in 1858. John Lane used this road for the first time in 1859, during his fifth(!) trip on the Oregon and the California Trails. He was the captain of a wagon train that departed Iowa for Oregon. Sadly, he did not complete the trip. On July 18, on a nearby ridge off of the Lander Road, Lane died from a cholera-like illness.<br />  <br /> With limited supplies, and limited time before winter's arrival, most trailside burials were quick- simply prayers said over a hastily dug grave. However, the beloved Lane received a unique honor -- a funeral! There was a customary viewing of the body, hymns, prayers, and a funeral procession. Finally, a headstone made by a wagon train member was placed at the grave. After the day-long event was over, the wagon train returned to the Trail and its journey to Oregon.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Lane's Grave, Caribou County, Idaho, 17 miles west of Freedom, Wyoming)</p> <p> Today, little has changed at the grave of John Lane since he was buried. The headstone and footstone still remain, it is only accessible by a dirt and gravel road, there are no public services, and very few structures or homes are visible from the grave. The site is a rare opportunity to experience, as close a possible, what traveling the California Trail in the 1850s was like.<br /> <br /> <strong>NOTE:</strong> if you go, it is important to know that, currently, there are no directional signs to the site, nor are there any signs marking/ identifying the parking area for the site.<br /> <br /> <strong>The grave itself is on private land.</strong> Visitors are welcome to view it; however, it does require calling the land owner when you arrive as there is a locked gate across the road to Lane's Grave.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Laurel Hill Chute descends off the southern slopes of Mount Hood and the hill was a series of three steep declines. <br /> <br /> For the descent of Laurel Hill, immigrants locked their wagon wheels and dragged huge logs under their wagons to slow their slide down the 60-percent grade. The repeated scraping of wheels and logs down the mountainside created a rocky “chute” that gradually grew impassable with use, forcing immigrants to find another place to lower their wagons. Several chutes were created in this area.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Highway 26, near Government Camp, Oregon)<br /> <br /> Begin your visit at the large wooden informational sign at the north end of the pullout. A path (<strong>Laurel Hill Chute Trail 795A</strong>) climbs about 60 stone steps through the woods and up the hill to another segment of the historic Old Mt. Hood Loop Highway. At the top of the steps, turn right and walk along the macadam about 100 yards to the interpretive sign on your left. Here you are standing at the midpoint of a possible wagon descent chute. Above you the chute is heavily eroded. Now turn and look below the road. The original chute continued down to the flat area at the tree line. <br /> <br /> From the edge of the road, the descent is about as steep as any other route down the face of Laurel Hill would have been in covered-wagon days. (Visitors are advised against using the narrow, steep trail next to the chute.) About another 100 yards past the chute, a footpath (<strong>Laurel Hill Chute Trail 795A</strong>) climbs 150 feet up a series of switchbacks to the top of the wagon chute, where visitors will find another interpretive sign and an impressive view of the descent.

His wagons became the best known on the western trails. <br /> <br /> Murphy’s wagons consisted of wheels, running gear, a box and a cover. They were usually nine feet high with a twelve foot long bed. The bed of a Murphy wagon had a straight box, unlike its more famous counterpart, the Conestoga, which had a curved box. A Murphy could comfortably haul between 1,800 to 2,200 pounds. Straying too far from these specifications risked serious problems.<br /> <br /> Oxen were most often used for pulling this type of wagon. It required two yoke of oxen, a yoke consisting of two oxen. A spare yoke often trailed behind so the livestock could be rotated and rested. <br /> <br /> For those who preferred mules, an equivalent number of yoke could have been used in place of oxen.  Horses were rarely if ever used. They lacked the strength and endurance needed to pull a wagon 2,000 miles.

        "notes": "New Santa Fe Cemetery Trail Ruts\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/new-santa-fe-cemetery-trail-ruts.htm\n\n<p>When William Becknell and his party made their consequential first trip on the Santa Fe Trail, it is likely that they passed through the New Santa Fe area, and perhaps crossed the ruts that are still visible in the New Santa Fe Cemetery. Located at the westernmost border of the US, New Santa Fe (now part of Kansas City, MO) was a gateway to the adventure and challenges of trail travel.Thus, the area was a significant transition point on the trail. It was a place for outfitting and loading for travel west. It was also a place where goods and silver from Santa Fe could be unloaded and distributed. <br /> <br /> When emigrant traffic began to grow in the 1840’s, trails to Oregon and California shared this path with the Santa Fe Trail. Thus, these trail swales saw not only heavy commercial traffic, but significant emigration traffic. Because it was, for several years, the last stop in the US, it was an important milestone for those leaving behind what they knew for a chance at a new life. After the discovery of gold in 1848, many “49ers” also used this path on their way to find wealth in the gold fields. <br /> <br /> By the late 1840’s, a stage stop on this route called “New Santa Fe” offered several amenities: a post office, two general stores, an inn, a shoe shop, drugstore, blacksmith, and saloon. Seeing the success of the area, Dabney Lipscomb platted the town of New Santa Fe in 1851. Conflict on the Missouri-Kansas border in 1860 prior to the Civil War disrupted traffic on the trail and led to a decline in the town. <br /> <br /> By the time the New Santa Fe Cemetery was designated as a burial ground in 1880, trail traffic had dissipated, but the ruts may have still served as a road for cemetery visitors. Though the cemetery post-dates significant trail traffic, it helped protect the ruts from the fate faced by most in the area. As Kansas City grew, the town of New Santa Fe was dismantled and replaced by modern development. The swales in the cemetery are a unique historical remnant amongst the surrounding urban environment.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (122nd Street and State Line Road, Kansas City, MO)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> The New Santa Fe Cemetery now sits in the heart of a residential neighborhood developed in the 1980’s. Spanning the cemetery’s entrance is a delicate metal sign that reads “New Santa Fe.” A historical marker and an informational exhibit sit on either side of the entrance and explain the history and importance of New Santa Fe and the trail ruts. The ruts are met on both sides by burial plots intentionally spaced to leave the ruts undisturbed. The ruts are visible as depressions in the grassy land. The cemetery also features mature trees, and weathered gravestones from the late 1800’s.  </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.newsantafe.org/\">More site information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail </a></h2> <p> </p>",

Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 the country nearly doubled in size and pushed its western edge past the Rocky Mountains. Yet the wilderness known as Oregon Country (which included present-day Oregon, Washington and part of Idaho) still belonged to the British, a fact that made many Americans eager to settle the region and claim it for the United States.</p> <p>American Indians had traversed this country for many years, but for European Americans it was unknown territory. Lewis and Clark's secretly funded expedition in 1803 was part of a U.S. Government plan to open Oregon Country to settlement. However, the hazardous route blazed by this party was not feasible for families traveling by wagon. An easier trail was needed.</p>   <p>Robert Stuart of the Astorians (a group of fur traders who established Fort Astoria on the Columbia River in western Oregon) became the first white man to use what later became known as the Oregon Trail. Stuart's 2,000-mile journey from Fort Astoria to St. Louis in 1810 took 10 months to complete; still, it was a much less rugged trail than Lewis and Clark's route.</p> <p>It wasn't until 1836 that the first wagons were used on the trek from Missouri to Oregon. A missionary party headed by Marcus and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/learn/historyculture/narcissa-whitman.htm\">Narcissa Whitman</a> bravely set out to reach the Willamette Valley. Though the Whitmans were forced to abandon their wagons 200 miles short of Oregon, they proved that families could go west by wheeled travel.</p> <p>In the spring of 1843, a wagon train of nearly 1,000 people organized at Independence, Missouri with plans to reach Oregon Country. Amidst an overwhelming chorus of naysayers who doubted their success, the so-called \"Great Migration\" made it safely to Oregon. Crucial to their success was the use of South Pass, a 12-mile wide valley that was virtually the sole place between the plains and Oregon where wagons could cross the formidable Rocky Mountains.</p> <p>By 1846, thousands of emigrants who were drawn west by cheap land, patriotism or the promise of a better life found their way to Oregon Country. With so many Americans settling the region, it became obvious to the British that Oregon was no longer theirs. They ceded Oregon Country to the United States that year.</p> <p><br /> <strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

Before 1851, pioneers used Robidoux Pass since the badlands between the river and the bluff made travel impossible. Nine miles south of Scotts Bluff, the pass offered a spring and a trading post operated by the Robidoux brothers.</p>   <p>In 1851, Mitchell Pass was opened and became the main route for the emigrants (pioneers heading west).<br /> <br /> In 1851, William Lobenstine wrote in his journal:</p> <p><em>\"The rock itself is separated nearly at it's middle, having a pass here fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending at both sides perpendicular to a height of three to four hundred feet.</em></p> <p><em>The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is now preferred by nearly all emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight miles from the old road.\"</em></p> <p>Mitchell Pass, known during the 1850's as \"Devil's Gap\" became the principle route of the military, pony express and the telegraph. Mitchell Pass was named after United States Brigadier General Robert B. Mitchell.</p> <p>The covered wagons in front of the Scotts Bluff National Monument administrative building mark the start of the Oregon Trail Pathway. The smaller Studebaker and Murphy wagons were the mode of transportation for families. The larger Conestoga wagon was not often used on the Oregon Trail, but was used to haul freight. Living history demonstrations occur at the Murphy wagon during the summer.</p> <p>When the trail surface changes from asphalt to dirt, you are walking \"on\" the actual Oregon Trail. Today, after over 150 years of erosion of the soft rocks, individual wheel ruts are not visible. What is visible is called a \"swale,\" which is a deep roadbed that was created by wagons traveling single file through Mitchell Pass.</p> <p>After crossing Mitchell Pass, the trail becomes paved again, and the Oregon Trail's path is marked by wooden posts in the trail's center. Near the end of the hiking trail is the site where William Henry Jackson camped and sketched while working as a bullwhacker on a wagon train in 1866.</p>",

The story of early day trail travel is told in this modern-day bedroom community’s museum, situated directly on the historic Santa Fe Trail.<br /> <br /> Next to mills and general mercantile stores that offered westward travelers their last chance at provisions, the blacksmith was a vital link for 19th century travelers. Ray’s blacksmith shop fashioned the accessories they needed to walk 800 miles southwest to Santa Fe or 2,000 miles west to Oregon or California: horseshoes; wagon wheels and other hammered and forged parts; even cookware and yokes for oxen. <br /> <br /> The Raytown Historical Society Museum interprets both of these vital supply outlets with a re-created general store and blacksmith shop complete with original artifacts that help tell this aspect of overland travel. From here, the meandering trail (Blue Ridge Boulevard), will take you to the next stop that 19th century travelers would have passed—and possibly stopped for a respite—the Archibald and Sallie Rice Home.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (9705 E. 63rd Street Raytown, MO)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.raytownhistoricalsociety.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

        "name": "Robidoux Pass",
        "notes": "Robidoux Pass\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/robidoux-pass.htm\n\n<h2>History of Robidoux Pass</h2> <p>The earliest travelers to use Robidoux Pass were probably trappers, traders and missionaries who took their pack trains up the North Platte River to the Rocky Mountains in the 1820’s. In 1830, wagons of fur trading cavavans were the first to use the pass and reach the Rocky Mountains, showing the way for the thousands of emigrant wagons to follow. The first wagon train through the pass was the Bidwell-Bartleson Party in 1841. Despite its water and wood, overland travelers were never satisfied with Robidoux Pass because it took them so far away from the North Platte River. A second gap in the bluffs, today called “Mitchell Pass”, skirted the base of the highest promontory and lay closer to the river. Historian Merrill Mathes noted, <em>“Up to and including 1850, the Robidoux Pass route was used almost exclusively by the successive waves of fur traders, missionary parties, soldiers and emigrants. In the year 1851, travel was about equally divided between the two routes. From 1852 onward, Mitchell Pass was heavily favored, although Robidoux Pass was occasionally used.”</em></p> <h3>Who was Robidoux?</h3> <p>Although all the facts are not fully established, it appears that he was Joseph E. Robidoux, oldest son of the Joseph Robidoux who founded St. Joseph, MO. The other “Frenchman” seen there was his uncle, Antoine Robidoux, who earlier achieved pioneering fame in Utah and California. The younger Joseph may well have been the Robidoux who led the first American Fur Company contingent by Scotts Bluff in 1830.</p> <h3>Old Robidoux Pass</h3> <p>Robidoux Pass is a gap passing through the Wildcat Hills about 9 miles west of Gering, Nebraska. The Pass was the route of the Oregon/California Trail from 1841 through 1850. After 1850, the route passed through Mitchell Pass at Scotts Bluff National Monument. Robidoux Pass has an elevation of 4,554 feet.To use Robidoux Pass, travelers had to swing south away from the North Platte River and proceed nearly 30 miles before they rejoined the river near Horse Creek. Fortunately, springs and nearby cedar trees in the pass provided water and wood for their journey.</p> <h3>Robidoux Trading Posts</h3> <p>The trading post at Robidoux Pass was established by either Joseph or Antoine Robidoux. Traders at this post exchanged goods with Indians for beaver skins and buffalo hides. The post also held a temporary monopoly in providing provisions and services to overland travelers and had a blacksmith shop on site that offered emigrants an opportunity to make repairs to trail-damaged wagons and tend footsore oxen and mules. <br /> <br /> There was a second Robidoux Trading Post located in Carter Canyon. It was inhabited by Antonie Robidoux, his Native American wife, and their 5 children. Other trading posts are known to have existed near the pass at the same time as the Robidoux Trading Post. One such trading post was owned by the American Fur Company. Following the opening of Mitchell Pass in 1851, which provided a shorter trail, Robidoux Pass and the trading posts fell into disuse.</p> <h3>What became of Joseph Robidoux?</h3> <p>Joseph E. Robidoux was reported to have died accidentally at Scotts Bluff, but no grave has been identified. There is evidence that he returned to the Great Nemaha Indian Agency in northern Kansas in the late 1850’s and died in obscurity. It is also thought that Antoine Robidoux died in 1860 in St. Louis, Missouri.</p> <h3>Robidoux Pass Today</h3> <p>Today, none of the historic buildings remain at Robidoux Pass. White posts mark the original route of the emigrant trail. Early accounts of the trip through this area note several burials at the site, two of which can still be seen today, including the “Dunn” grave, one of only 7 marked burial sites along the Oregon Trail. Tools, wagon implements, bullets, and other materials have also been found in this area. After the Mitchell Pass route was improved, the Robidoux Pass route faded into obscurity; it was too far out of the way and too far from the water source of the North Platte River.</p> <h3>How To Get There</h3> <p>Today, Robidoux Pass lies on private property, but is still accessible by the general public who are encouraged to respect the wishes and rights of the owners. A gravel road one mile south of the intersection of Five Rocks Road and Old Oregon Trail leads to the site of the old trading post described by a historical marker.</p>",

At first, emigrants had to take a detour south and use Robidoux Pass, a natural gateway, to get through the bluffs. This mostly stopped in 1850 when a new route was opened at Mitchell Pass. Located close to the North Platte River, this route saved emigrants nearly 15 miles of travel. The route, though, was narrow, due to the land's geography. As such, more than 300,000 emigrants, and their wagons and livestock, had to travel on the same strip of land. Eventually, deep ruts formed as a result of this traffic. These ruts are still visible today and are now a part of Scotts Bluff National Monument.

It opened the West to settlement by providing a route over the Continental Divide that wagons could negotiate. Everyone who followed the Oregon Trail through Wyoming used this sagebrush and grass covered saddle. A wide and deep path was created as thousands of wagon wheels and livestock hooves steadily eroded the ground.

Turn right (west) onto the two-track road that begins near the curve and drive 0.8 miles.)</p> <p>South Pass National Historic Landmark, which is managed by the Bureau of Land Management, preserves these still visible ruts.

Hail of Lafayette County, Missouri Who died June 2, 1852 Age 34 Yrs. 5 months 12 days. That marker, since destroyed, was of polished workmanship, unlike most trail gravestones.

Emigrants would then attempt to ford the river, a risky undertaking that not all of them survived.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"Wednesday [August] 6 This morning we hired an Indian to show us the ford. After we saw him cross we determined to try it ourselves. We accordingly commenced making preparations. We crossed two slews to the second island. Here we put ox yokes under the wagon loads to raise them, and put four yoke of our best oxen to each of the four first wagons that crossed. These four got over safely. We then sent the teams back to fech the other three wagons... Suffice it to say we all got over, our cattle and all safely.\" Robert Haldane Renshaw, 1851</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Glenns Ferry, Idaho)</p> <p>Today, the overlook is managed by the State of Idaho. Numerous trail ruts and swales can be seen on the high mesa surrounding the overlook. Amenities include a small gravel path, interpretive wayside exhibits, and parking. The three islands from which the crossing gets its name are visible from the overlook. Parts of the road to the overlook are unpaved but suitable for most vehicles in dry weather. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://parksandrecreation.idaho.gov/parks/three-island-crossing\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <p> </p>",

Crossing the Snake River was always dangerous, but when the water was low enough to negotiate, everyone who could, forded the river here. This allowed emigrants to take the more favorable northern route to Fort Boise. If they were unable to cross, emigrants were forced to travel along the alternate south route into Oregon- a dry, sandy, dusty, and hot trail that wore out man and beast. Three Island crossing remained active until 1869 when a ferry was built across the river. The crossing is now part of Three Island Crossing State Park.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>On September 11, 1843, William T. Newby \". . . crossed Snake Rive[r]. First we drove over a part of the river one hundred yards wide on to a island, the[n] over a northern branch 75 yards wide on a second island; then we tide a string of wagons together by a chane in the ring of the lead cattles yoak & made fast to the wagon of all a horse & before & him led.

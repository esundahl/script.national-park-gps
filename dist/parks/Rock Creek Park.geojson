        "notes": "African American cemetery\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/african-american-cemetery.htm\n\nThe land that became Walter Pierce Park was once the location of two cemeteries. One, The Friends' Burying Ground, was a Quaker cemetery which operated between 1807 and 1890. The other was much larger and was known as the Mt. Pleasant Plains Cemetery. This cemetery was owned and operated between 1870 and 1890 by the Colored Union Benevolent Association.<br /> <br /> After 1890 some of the land was purchased and folded into what would become the Smithsonian Zoological Park and Rock Creek Park. In the 1950s the remaining acreage was slated for high-rise apartment buildings by developers. Though the land was graded and prepared for the construction, the project was abandoned. Residents of the Adams Morgan neighborhood petitioned the city to have the remaining acres turned into a park in the 1980s.<br /> <br /> Though residents had been told that all of the graves had been relocated and removed from the land, there was evidence that this was not the case. In 2005, more intense assessments were done on the park land and intact burials were discovered. Non-invasive means--like ground penetrating radar studies--were conducted to locate the graves. Documentary research revealed the names of those buried at the site. <br /> <br /> Additional information can be found from the grassroots group conducting the research: <a href=\"https://walterpierceparkcemeteries.org/\">The Walter Pierce Park Cemeteries | Commemorating the African American and Quaker Cemeteries at Walter Pierce Park in Washington, DC</a>",

With a combined total casualty figure of over 900 killed or wounded during the engagement, 40 of the Union soldiers who fought and died bravely in defense of the capital. Four civilians related to the cemetery's first caretaker were buried after the Civil War. A veteran of the battle was interred in 1936, closing the cemetery to future burials. </p> <p>Battleground National Cemetery, located one-half mile north of Fort Stevens, is one acre in size, and one of our nation's smallest national cemeteries.

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. </p>",

She was a popular teacher and seven months after her appointment to the school, her students led a campaign to try and help her win the Sunday Herald's free European vacation for the city's most popular teacher. In June her students submitted almost 1200 votes to put her in the lead compared to other city teachers. Unfortunately, by July she had fallen into fourth place.<br /> <br /> The school was built with 1860s education standards in mind and had few amenities. In 1907, the school was blasted for not having a water supply. A female African-American \"janitress\" brought water for the children when she reported for duty in the mornings.<br /> <br /> Sometime between 1907 and 1928 a pump was installed, but the school was still far behind the quality of other area schools.<br /> <br /> By 1917 the school was openly called antiquated and considered an unacceptable facility for students. Suffering from over-crowding, Conduit Road School had four grade levels that were being taught in the one room.<br /> <br /> A 1920 article in the Evening Star was headlined \"D.C. School, Relic of Bygone Days, Menace to Pupils.\" <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"<em>One-Room Shack poorly lighted and heated by ancient stoves.<br /> <br /> Within two miles of the thickly populated section of Washington there stands a picturesque old rural schoolhouse. which the youth of the are required to attend under the laws of the District. It is only one of the several old-fashioned types of buildings in the public school system. which were erected soon after the civil war and still are called I upon to accommodate the children of the nation's capital. When built, in 1874. a sign bearing the inscription. \"Public School.\" was placed on the front. Today the same sign remains on the building, but it is known to residents of the the children, and school as \"The Conduit Road School.\"<br /> <br /> The building is located on a government reservation on the heavily traveled Conduit road about a mile and a half from Georgetown. Despite its prominent situation, its existence is virtually unknown to a majority, of the residents of Washington.<br /> <br /> This school was considered a model in its day. but that was forty-seven years ago. It is a small, one-room frame structure, which boasts a single modern convenience, a telephone. The school has no lighting system. Its heating facilities consist of two old stoves, which are said to have been condemned years ago and referred to by the children as \"hard coal burners.\" The only time the stoves throw out sufficient heat to warm the small room, it is said, is on a warm day. The cold days of winter find the pupils shivering, and their teeth chattering.<br /> <br /> Unlike the more modern schools in the city limits, the Conduit Road School has no running water. When the pupils want a drink they are forced to go behind the schoolhouse and draw it from a pump. The pump, however, is a more recent innovation at the school. The children attending there about a decade ago were to depend on an old colored janitoress for their water supply. The colored woman brought the water to school with her each morning. Another quaint sign which greets a visitor at the school is a wash basin and soap in the cloakroom of the building. (The wash basin is clearly discernible in the accompanying Conforming with the old-fashioned ideas of school construction, the cloakroom of the school was built at the entrance. It has not been changed, except it is piled high with discarded schoolroom furniture, making it dangerous for the children to pass through to hang up hats and coats.<br /> <br /> In the building's lone room there are four classes, under one teacher, as in the days of yore. They consist of the first, second, third and fourth grades. Children promoted to higher grades are forced to attend the Reservoir School, about a mile from the Conduit Road School. The enrollment at this school today totals thirty-one, the smallest, in any school in the city. There are thirty-six seats in the school, making five vacant. It was pointed out, however, that if the school was larger and had facilities for pupils in higher grades its enrollment would increase. Children attending this school come from a radius of a mile and a half. <br /> <br /> When the school was built In 1874 It cost school officials $1,200. Since its erection there have been but few improvements. One of the improvements in recent years was the of the single room. This was done two years ago and was chronicled as one of the events in the school's history.\"</em></div> <br /> By 1927, plans were in the works to close the school. For a time, it was used as a branch of the public library.<br /> <br /> It was the last one-room school to be used in the district.<br /> <br /> <br /> The Palisades branch of the DC Library operated out of the former school until 1965 when the larger branch nearby opened. The structure had the potential to be demolished but it was saved by the Palisades Citizens Association. For the next 24 years, it was used as the Children's Museum of Washington.<br /> <br /> In 1989 it was used as a children's library and rented out by the Discovery Creek Children's Museum.<br /> <br /> Recently, plans have been made for the Palisades History Museum to use the space for exhibits, though extensive restoration work is needed.<br /> <br /> The facility remains closed to the public.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

After this, the structure was rehabilitated into a tea house or refreshment stand.  <br /> <br /> Park managers wanted to provide patrons of the Peirce Mill Tea House a pleasing sound and view scape, which they thought was best done through a cascade of water.<br /> <br /> The dam near Peirce Mill proved very popular with picnickers and visitors to the tea house. Unfortunately, the dam blocked the creek and prevented fish from spawning further upstream. <br /> <br /> After 100 years, the situation was remedied. A fish ladder was built on the East side of the dam to allow Herring, Shad and Alewife to get over the dam and access their traditional spawning grounds.  <br /> <br /> The dam is visible from the parking area at Picnic Grove #2 South along Beach Drive, as well as from the paved multi-use trail behind Peirce Mill.  <br />  ",

Prior to this first organization, another man named Collins Williams held religious meetings in various private homes along 27th Street. On Reverend Alexander’s arrival in Georgetown, he found only two Baptists but quickly found converts and with a donation of land from Collins Williams, the congregation built a small frame structure and called it “The Ark” at 29th and O Streets.<br /> The church quickly outgrew it’s first building and in 1882 the present site was selected. Work on the church foundation was done at night by male members of the congregation while the women cooked hot dinners. Unfortunately, the work for the foundation exceeded the money they had raised for construction and the church sat incomplete for some time until Reverend Alexander took responsibility for seeing it completed and took out a loan. When the first payment for the loan for the church was paid, the receipt was written  out to \"First African Baptist Church.\" One of the Trustees refused the receipt and demanded it be written out to \"First Baptist Church.\" Trustee William Brown didn't want to see the congregation robbed of the honor of being the first church of the Baptist faith in Georgetown.   <br /> <br /> The church continues to serve the Georgetown community and is still an active church.",

DeRussy. Fort DeRussy was sited upon high ground on the west bank of Rock Creek to control movement along and across the valley. The fort coordinated its fire with Fort Stevens on the east and Fort Kearny on the west.

Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard, Col. of Engineers, U.S. Army, was in charge of construction of the defenses around Washington. Barnard chose the location of Fort Reno for its strategic importance in guarding the Rockville Pike (present day Wisconsin Avenue). Being the highest elevation in the city (429 feet above sea level), Fort Reno also served as a forward outpost and signal station for detecting enemy movement near the northern part of the city.</p> <p>Constructed by the 119th Pennsylvania Regiment, the fort's name was later changed to Fort Reno in 1863 in memory of Major General Jesse Lee Reno, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of South Mountain, September 14, 1862. <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Originally rather small, Fort Reno was enlarged and strengthened with an advanced battery 300 yards north from the highest ridge, across from what is now Fessenden Street and along 39th Street. This advanced battery had eight 12-pounder guns and a magazine, a covered walkway connected it to the main fort to the south. A double line of rifle trenches was added to strengthen the position.</span></p> <p>Eventually, the fort was the largest and strongest of those defending the capital with a dozen heavy guns, three Parrott siege guns and nine 27-pounder barbette guns. A strength of three thousand men of the First Brigade made Fort Reno the stronghold of the northern defenses of the capital.</p> <p>In July 1864, due to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's insistence that troops be moved from the defenses to reinforce his army at Petersburg, Fort Reno was under-manned, as were all of the defenses around the city. Hearing from spies that the capital was poorly defended, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Gen. Jubal A. Early to attack from the north. Around noon Monday, July 11, 1864 (before the Battle of Fort Stevens), Fort Reno was the first of the defenses to view Early's advance near Rockville, Maryland. The lookouts from the signal tower at Fort Reno saw clouds of dust, and then Confederate army wagons moving toward the city.</p> <p>During Early's assault of Fort Stevens on July 11th and 12th, 1864, the heavy guns of Fort Reno lent little support value, as there was a fear the long range guns would hit the Union Army's advanced pickets. One of the shells that was fired from Fort Reno by a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle traveled 3.5 miles north of the fort, killing four Confederates where the present day Bethesda Naval Hospital is located in Bethesda, Maryland. Due to Fort Stevens being reinforced on July 12, 1864, it was never taken by the Confederate army, nor was the capital city ever reached.</p> <p>During the fighting of July 10-12, 1864, small squadrons of soldiers from Forts Reno and Stevens had advanced into the countryside north of the city to fend off the invaders. A few Confederates were taken prisoner and brought back to camps where they were held until transfer to a central prison. Early's army retreated back across the Potomac River near Leesburg, Virginia, and Washington breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>After the close of the war, the forts (Reno included) were slowly dismantled and abandoned. Most of Fort Reno could be seen as late as 1892, but the fort and battery at the north end were eventually graded down for the construction of a water reservoir. Today the site is bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Fessenden Street, Belt Road, and Chesapeake Street, NW.</p>",

        "notes": "Fort Stevens\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/fort-stevens.htm\n\n<p>Fort Stevens, now partially restored, was built to defend the approaches to Washington from the 7th Street Pike (now Georgia Avenue) which was then the main thoroughfare from the north into Washington. Originally called Fort Massachusetts by the soldiers from that state who constructed the fort, it was later named after Brig. Gen. Isaac Ingalls Stevens, who was killed at the Battle of Chantilly (Ox Hill), Virginia, September 1, 1862.<br /> <br /> By the summer of 1864, the great bulk of Union troops in the east were engaged in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/index.htm\">siege operations around Petersburg, Virginia</a>. In fact, when Ulysses S. Grant moved south in the Spring of 1864, he stripped Washington, DC, of many well trained troops to add weight to his offensive. As a result, in July of 1864, there were only 9,000 troops to defend the city, down from over 23,000 the year before. Those that were left were primarily poorly trained reserves. Robert E. Lee was desperate to reduce the pressure on his forces around Petersburg, and so decided to send General Jubal A. Early and about 20,000 troops to strike at Washington which spies had reported was poorly defended.<br /> <br /> On June 12, Early began his march north from Petersburg and by July 9, was at Frederick, Maryland, where he demanded and received $200,000 to spare the city. On the same day, Early <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/index.htm\">defeated Union Gen. Lew Wallace at the Monocacy River</a>. In the light of later events, Wallace's defeat after a stubborn fight became a victory for the Union because he was able to delay Early's advance for a day. On July 10, Early encamped at Rockville, Maryland, only 10 miles from Fort Stevens.<br /> <br /> Reacting to this threat to Washington, Grant ordering the 1st and d 2nd Divisions of the 6th Corps and part of 19th Corps to the capital on July 7. The veteran units reached Fort Stevens arrived off the Potomac River around noon on July 11 as Jubal Early's lead elements advanced toward the capital.<br /> <br /> Over the following several days, Early probed Fort Stevens and its environs but never mounted a full-scale attack. Union reinforcements had reached Washington and Fort Stevens just in time.<br /> <br /> Located atop the parapet of Fort Stevens is a commemorative stone dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>. On July 12, 1864, the President stood atop the parapet to observe the fighting and came under fire from Confederate sharpshooters. It is the only time in American history in which a sitting president came under direct fire from an enemy combatant.<br /> <br /> In the years to come, many individuals would claim the honor of advising the President Lincoln to come down from the parapet. The most notable was a young officer named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. His remarks to the president were short and straightforward: \"Get down, you damn fool!\" Holmes would eventually serve as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902-1932.<br /> <br /> Each year, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cwdw/planyourvisit/anniversary-of-the-battle-of-fort-stevens.htm\">anniversary of the Battle of Fort Stevens</a> is commemorated with special programs, living history, and more.</p>",

The earthen citadels that encircled the capital had long been abandoned by Federal soldiers. Peace, posterity, and the ploughshare returned much of the landscape to its pre-war condition, including Fort Stevens, site of the famed battle in July 1864. Early preservation efforts included the installation of a sign marking the spot where President Abraham Lincoln was under fire on July 12, 1864.<br /> <br /> Fort Stevens' eroding earthworks were a lasting testament to the Defenses of Washington as the Brightwood neighborhood developed around it. <br /> <br /> As part of the McMillan Plan, a comprehensive planning document for the development of the monumental core and the park system of Washington, D.C (first written in 1902 by the Senate Park Commission), the proposed Fort Drive Parkway consisted of \"a new drive-way through the suburbs of Washington to be called 'Fort Drive,' and include in its winding ways some of the most important of the fortifications which served as the Defenses of Washington during the rebellion . . .\"<br /> <br /> Rapid urban expansion and budget restraints, including the First World War and Great Depression, affected the full development of the parkway; however the Federal government was able to acquire most of the Fort Drive right-of-way between 1929 and 1932, and the forts/batteries managed by the National Park Service today.<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) accomplished a great deal of work on the fort parks. The CCC established nine camps in the Washington D.C. area, including one, established on October 23, 1933, at Fort Dupont Park. The CCC activities at Fort Dupont included erecting buildings for workers to live and eat in, cleaning up foot and horse trails, performing minor road construction, putting in a sewer, and constructing a two-car garage, carpenter shop, and toilet room. The CCC also performed \"forest protection,\" including cleaning up dead and fallen lumber, burning brush, grubbing stumps, cleaning up the dump, and disposing of trash at forts Stanton, Bunker Hill and Mahan, and doing general cleanup at forts Totten and Foote. At Fort Stevens, the CCC undertook a restoration, reconstruction, and landscape project; costing $25,000. The workers rebuilt the western portion of the fort parapet, using cement \"falsies,\" as one author called them, \"instead of logs and planks,\" because they would last longer.<br /> <br /> The work at Fort Stevens was completed in 1938. It was the only fortification restoration project. Today, Fort Stevens Park is managed by the National Park Service (Rock Creek Park).</p>",

The circle, totaling thirty-thousand square feet, is centered around a statue of Major General Artemas Ward. This memorial to General Ward is a bronze standing figure and shows the General in a Continental Army uniform. It is on a granite pedestal. This location is very difficult to access, with no walkways and constant busy traffic around the circle. <p><br /> <em>Inscriptions</em><br /> ARTEMAS WARD / 1727-1800 / SON OF MASSACHUSETTS / GRADUATE OF HARVARD COLLEGE / JUDGE AND LEGISLATOR / DELEGATE 1780-1781 TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS / SOLDIER OF THREE WARS / FIRST COMMANDER OF THE PATRIOT FORCES</p>",

        "notes": "Georgetown Waterfront Park\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/georgetown-waterfront-park.htm\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Georgetown Waterfront Park, stretching along the banks of the Potomac River from 31st Street, NW to the Key Bridge, was completed in the fall of 2011. The park links 225 miles of parkland along the Potomac River stretching from Cumberland, Maryland, to Mount Vernon, Virginia. The park is beloved by many due to its notable design elements like the labyrinth, beautiful fountain (seasonal, open \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/rocr/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">Alerts</a>\" at top of page for status), and charming rain gardens. Visitors come to the park to enjoy quiet contemplation or to take advantage of the large accessible pathways to exercise and recreate. Cyclists, skaters, and pedestrians have a designated pathway (free of cars) allowing them to enjoy views of individual boaters, kayakers, and competitive crews, as well as of Theodore Roosevelt Island, Key Bridge, and the Potomac River. The park has many unique design features including:  </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/waterfront-park-labyrinth.htm\">Labyrinth</a></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Looking for peace of mind? You might find it in the labyrinth at the western end of the park. Labyrinths date back to ancient times. Geometric turns are meant to encourage contemplation as you slowly travel from the outer edge into the center. To get the most out of the walk, focus on quieting your mind and disconnecting with the chaos of the outside world.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/waterfront-park-and-percy-plaza.htm\">Fountain</a><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> </strong>(seasonal, open \"Alerts\" at top of page for status)</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The centerpiece of the park is the fountain found at the waterfront intersection of Wisconsin Avenue, NW, and K Street. People of all ages enjoy splashing and playing in the water on hot summer days.</p> <p><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">River Steps and Pergola</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">These steps were originally created with rowing regattas in mind. In addition to providing finish line seating for rowing events, the steps are a popular year-round place to picnic while viewing the river, birds, other wildlife, and boaters. More seating can be found beneath the tall steel and cable pergola, designed as a call back to the waterfront’s more industrial past.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The waterfront was once a dynamic center of commerce and trade, especially for tobacco. But by the 1820s, larger ships could no longer access the river due to the build-up of silt. Factories like the American Ice Company and the Brennan Construction Company transformed the waterfront port into an industrial landscape. The area became a transportation route when the construction was completed for nearby Key Bridge and the Whitehurst Freeway. As a result of this new shift,  the once booming factories began to relocate or close, and much of the waterfront was converted into parking lots.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Today, the Georgetown Waterfront Park preserves public open space and the waterfront’s history.</span></p> <p><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Rain Gardens</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The rain gardens are located at the intersection of the paths that cross the park. Rain gardens collect and hold rainwater and storm water runoff, so it can soak into the ground instead of flowing into storm drains or along the surface of the land. Rain gardens help prevent erosion, water pollution, and flooding.</p> <p><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Bio-Edge</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Looking at the edge of the waterfront, you will see a living bank where a crumbling concrete retaining wall used to be. Instead of simply repairing the beat-up bulkhead from the industrial era, the National Park Service added soil and native plants. This greener solution was engineered to stabilize the bank, create a habitat for wildlife, and filter rainwater as it flows from the park to the river.</p> <p><strong>Pollinator Gardens</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Can you imagine a world without flowers? Over 75% of the Earth’s flowering plants depend on pollinators for reproduction. Despite their importance, studies show that pollinator populations are declining due to loss of habitat. Pollinator gardens, big or small, help keep pollinators strong by providing a place to eat, rest, and reproduce.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">At this park, you can find pollinator gardens with native plants along the pathways at both Potomac Street and 33rd Street. Funding for these two gardens was provided by the <a href=\"https://georgetownwaterfrontpark.org/\">Friends of Georgetown Waterfront Park</a>.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> </span></p> <p><span> </span></p>",

From 1941 to 1944, Washingtonians lined the cascades and reflecting pool on summer evenings to hear classical and popular music, including a performance by the Von Trapp Family Singers.<br /> <br /> When Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in April 1968, Washington, D.C. erupted in riots. Both the 14th Street business corridor north and east of the park and the U Street corridor south of the park were devastated. To help heal and unify the city, the \"Summer in the Parks\" concert series was created. The inaugural performance was held at Meridian Hill Park, featuring Broadway and film star Pearl Bailey. Twenty-thousand people attended.<br /> <br /> Since 1969, the park has unofficially been called \"Malcolm X Park\" by the local community. As the site of the memorial to President Buchanan, Meridian Hill Park cannot officially be named for another person.</p> <h4><b>James Buchanan</b></h4> <p>Diplomat, Statesman, and Fifteenth President of the United States<br /> Buchanan was our only bachelor president and relied upon his orphaned niece, Harriet Lane, to act as his First Lady during his years in the White House (1857 to 1861). In her estate, Harriet Lane Johnson made a bequest to fund a memorial to her uncle. Designed by architect William Gordon Beecher and sculpted by Maryland artist Hans Schuler, the memorial was dedicated on June 26, 1930. It features a bronze statue of Buchanan with stone figures of Law and Diplomacy at each end, representing Buchanan's career in public service.<br /> <br /> Before becoming president, Buchanan served in the House of Representatives for nearly 18 years. He was Minister to Russia from 1832 to 1834, then a Senator until 1845. He declined an appointment to the Supreme Court by President Polk in 1844, serving instead as Polk's Secretary of State. In that post, he helped to negotiate the 1846 Oregon Treaty, which established the 49th parallel as the northern boundary of the western United States.<br /> <br /> Hostilities in Congress over slavery, abolition, and secession made Buchanan's presidency difficult. His was plagued by financial panic and then a revolt of Mormons in 1857, which the press called the Utah War. On Buchanan's final day as president, March 4, 1861, he remarked to the incoming Lincoln, \"If you are as happy entering the White House as I shall feel returning to Wheatland you are a happy man.\"<br /> <br /> Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/meridian-hill-park.htm\">Meridian Hill Park</a> website for more information.</p>",

From this knoll, Porter had a direct line of sight to the President's mansion. Though no match for the grand buildings it looked down upon, Porter's manor house was a handsome brick and stucco structure with a large front portico. Years later, while in use as an Army hospital, Porter's mansion burned to the ground. It was never rebuilt. <br /> <br /> The grand vistas of Meridian Hill would later attract another colorful character. Joaquin Miller, lawyer, poet, and by some accounts, horse thief, built a log cabin on this site. The \"finest view in Washington\" did not satisfy Miller for long, however. He wandered frequently, taking his poetry to Europe, Alaska, and California before settling on Oregon. In a seeming reflection of this restless tenant, the cabin was moved to a new location in 1912. Today it rests on a serene bank of Rock Creek, a setting that would surely have appealed to Miller's poetic nature.",

This reference line, Longitude 0 0, would aid navigation, mapmaking, and the development of property boundaries, all key to settling the capital and new western territories. But most of all, Jefferson wanted to reinforce America's independence from Britain, where the Prime Meridian was established to service the Royal Navy's global navigation. Today, while there are many meridian lines running through many continents, the internationally recognized Prime Meridian passes through Greenwich, England, not Washington, D.C.<br /> <br /> In the lower left corner is a three by four-inch black and white photograph of the upper portion of a spiked iron gate. In the center is a wrought iron sphere with a point on top. Text to the right of the image reads: Andrew Ellicott, the surveyor who worked with George Washington and designer Pierre L'Enfant to lay out the District of Columbia, established the American meridian along the center of 16th Street. At right is Ellicott's 1792 drawing of the District of Columbia based on L'Enfant's plan. Today, this American meridian is commemorated in the park by finials on the Euclid Street fence posts and plaque at the 16th Street entrance. This plaque was presented by the Daughters of the American Revolution to memorialize the location of the original marker.",

So many sculptures were authorized that Horace Peaslee, the park's architect, called for a moratorium on installations. He told the Commission of Fine Arts that the park's master plan was in jeopardy unless future memorials were restricted to decorative urns in niches designed for that purpose. Nature, vandals, and thieves have long threatened the park's public art. For years, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/joan-of-arc-statue.htm\">Joan of Arc</a> did not wield her sword. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/serenity-statue.htm\">Serenity </a>lost her nose, a toe, and a hand. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/noyes-armillary-sphere.htm\">Armillary Sphere</a>, which was once located south of the reflecting pool beyond the cascades, was removed after it was vandalized.<br /> <br /> The right two-thirds of the sign shows a black and white photograph of a man digging amongst a large area of dirt and debris. To the right is a statue of Joan of Arc, with a sword in her right hand and riding atop a horse. A four-story building with towers that rise an additional level is across the street in the background. Text in the upper left corner of the image reads: On January 6, 1922, the bronze state of Joan of Arc, sculpted by Paul Dubois, was dedicated in the center of the Great Terrace. This gift from the French people celebrated both the history of the alliance between the United States and France and the suffrage of American women, who won the right to vote in 1920. Along the bottom of the sign is a seven by five-inch color picture of a statue with a wreathed crown and wearing a long flowing robe. Text in the bottom left corner reads: On December 1, 1921, a statue of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/dante-memorial-statue.htm\">Dante </a>Alighieri, author of the epic poem, \"The Divine Comedy\", was dedicated in the park's Italian hillside garden area on the 600th anniversary of the poet's birth. The statue was a gift of Carlo Barsotti, editor if an Italian American newspaper, in the name of all immigrants from Italy. The bronze figure is a replica of the original, unveiled in New York City that same year and sculpted by Ettore Ximens of Rome. Further right along the bottom of the sign is a three by two-inch black and white picture of a white marble statue of a woman with long hair and wearing a robe. She sits and arms outstretched across the back of the statue. Text to her left reads: Jose Clara's marble figure, Serenity, was dedicated in the Grotto on March 12, 1925. Charles Deering, a graduate of the United States Naval Academy, donated the sculpture to honor the career of his friend and classmate, Lieutenant Commander William Henry Schuetze. Schuetze is remembered for his part in the 1882 expedition to Russia to retrieve the bodies of arctic explorers from the ill-fated USS Jeannette, and later for his service aboard the USS Iowa in the Spanish-American War.",

The Army built camps there with names like Cameron, Relief, Carver, and Barclay. As the war continued, numerous hospitals, including Columbian and Mount Pleasant, were established in the same area. After the Civil War, Meridian Hill became a middle-class African American neighborhood. Wayland Seminary, which had opened in Foggy Bottom to train young African American men and women as preachers and teachers for the South, moved to a building at Chapin and 15th Streets in 1875. The school operated there until merging with Richmond Theological Seminary in 1899 to form Virginia Union University in Richmond. Booker T. Washington, noted African American political leader, educator, orator, and author, was one of Wayland's distinguished alumni.<br /> <br />  ",

It later became an industrial site. Now it is a national park. How does an old port and industrial site become a national park?<br /> <br /> In the 1960s, the Georgetown waterfront was condemned for an interstate highway, which was never built. Planning began then to convert the waterfront into a park.<br /> <br /> Progress slowed until, in 1985, the District of Columbia transferred the waterfront land to the National Park Service (NPS). Ten more years passed. Then, in the late 1990s, a surge in interest brought a partnership that would highlight the Potomac's signature sport: rowing. The Georgetown Waterfront Park Commission, a volunteer organization, galvanized local residents, the rowing community, regional leaders, and the NPS in an effort which would bring the park to fruition.<br /> <br /> A green column lines the right third of the sign, and on top is a photograph of ten people standing in a field flanked by uniformed park rangers on either end. A post holds up a line in front of them and the man in the center is cutting the ribbon. Text above reads: Dignitaries cut the ribbon to dedicate the park in 2008.<br /> <br /> Just below in an oval picture is a smiling man in suit and tie with white hair. Text beside him reads: Senator Charles H. Percy. Text beneath him reads: Senator Charles H. Percy was pivotal in the creation of the Georgetown Waterfront Park. Senator Percy - a Georgetown resident, lover of the waterfront, and supporter of local high school rowing - chaired the Georgetown Waterfront Park Commission that was instrumental in the park's creation.<br /> <br /> The Commission and its successor organization, the Friends of Georgetown Waterfront Park, helped redesign plans and raise funds to build the park. With the generous support of the Friends of the District of Columbia, coupled with an NPS Centennial Initiative grant and the tireless dedication of citizens and public officials, the Georgetown Waterfront Park is now a national park for all to enjoy.<br /> <br /> In the bottom right corner of the sign is a black and white photograph set at an angle. It shows an industrial riverfront, with a raised highway running a block off the river's edge, a large industrial building set to the left, a set of buildings with smokestacks towards the center, and smoke billowing from a set of buildings on the left along the river. ",

Two large boulders sit along the river's edge at the tree line, and a kayaker paddles in the river below. Text beneath the kayaker reads:Learn more about the USGS at www.usgs.govGeorgetown Waterfront Park is managed by Rock Creek Park (National Park Service). For more information, visit www.nps.gov/rocr and www.georgetownwaterfrontpark.org.<br /> <br /> The sign is titled across the top left corner in white lettering: How High is the River?Text below reads:How High is the River? The structures to your right contains a streamgage that records water levels in the Potomac River. The hydrograph below shows the Potomac River reached flood levels in Jun 2018. Water levels at this site are measured by sensing the air pressure required to force air bubbles into the river. The water in the river at this location is affected by the same tides that affect the ocean and the Chesapeake Bay, but the water here is fresh, not salty or even brackish.The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) monitors water quantity and quality. USGS data is used for studying, managing, and/or forecasting: <ul> <li>Water resources and water supply</li> <li>Floods and droughts</li> <li>Climate change</li> <li>Bridge and infrastructure design</li> <li>Reservior operations</li> <li>Water quality</li> <li>Stormwater and stream restoration</li> <li>In-stream flows for habitats</li> <li>Recreational safety</li> </ul> A column of text on the lower left side titled Streamgages describes the gray box that sits to the right of the wayside:StreamgagesThis is USGS Streamgage 01647600, Potomac River at Wisconsin Avenue, Washington, D.C. Check out waterdata.usgs.gov to find out how high the river is or learn other facts about water.The USGS operates this streamgage in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Park Service. The USGS has measured water levels on the Potomac River in Georgetown since 1935. The USGS operates more than 100 streamgages along the Potomac River and its tributaries and over 8,200 stremgages across the Nation.Above the kayaker in the center of the sign, is text that reads:The streamgages on the Potomac River are crucial to Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts. The only way to determine the amount of pollution flowing to the Bay is to know the concentration of the pollution and the amount of water flowing to the Bay.To the right of the kayaker is a two by four-inch white box with green border along the top that reads: Measuring the Water Level. A graph on the right side is titled: 01647600 Potomac River at Wisconsin Avenue, Washington, DC. The graph shows how water levels during an eight-day period spiked over flood stage levels to eight feet for two days during the timespan.Text to the left reads:Measuring the Water Level. The streamgage measures the height of the river as it rises and falls with the tides. In the hydrograph (right), the height of water is shown over eight days in June 2018. Between June 4 and 6, 2018, the river rose more than 3 feet due to high river flows caused by heavy rains across the Potomac River watershed. During those days, the river was above the flood level.The far right column of the sign features a white box with blue top border that reads: Monitoring the Potomac River Watershed. Below, a map is displayed of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, DC. The Chesapeake Bay is shown on the far right. Text beneath details the nature of watersheds:Monitoring the Potomac WatershedA \"watershed\" is an area of land from which water drains into a particular body of water. The Potomac River receives its water from an area that covers nearly 15,000 square miles in four states and the District of Columbia. The Potomac River empties into the Chesapeake Bay 112 miles downstream from this site.If you live or work in the area, you may be one of the nearly 5 million people who receive drinking water from the Potomac River watershed.

Water turned the wheel, which spun a shaft that drove gears, belts, a grain elevator, and a variety of machines.

Below is text that reads: The stone mill was an important part of the Peirce family's business. Like most farms in the 1800s, this was also a diversified and constantly evolving operation. The family managed hundreds of acres devoted to fields, pastures, and orchards. A sawmill, a nursery, barns, and bee hives dotted their landscape. The Peirce estate also contained housing for the large family, enslaved people, and tenants who made the business a success.<br /> <br />  ",

In her groundbreaking book, <em>Siling Spring</em> (1962), Carson warned citizens that the widespread use of pesticides posed a risk to the natural world and to their own health. Her writing helped lead to the foundign of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.<br /> <br /> <em>Silent Spring</em> also led to the banning of many persistent pesticides, including DDT. The ban resulted in the resurgence of the bald eagle population, which had previously been on the verge of extinction due to unrestrected pesticide use. The iconic eagle has since returned to the nearby Potomac River Valley and other natural areas throughout the Washington, DC region.<br /> <br /> Carson encouraged children and their parents to share \"joy, excitement, and mystery\" in anture. She found beauty, healing, and \"reserves of strength that...endure as long as life lasts\" there herself.<br /> <br /> It is easy to imagine Carson, who lived in nearby Silver Spring, Maryland, discovering inspiration in the region's many parks. Soon after the publication of <em>Silent Spring</em>, these photos of Rachel Carson bird watching were taken here in Glover Archbold Park. <h2>A Capital City Oasis</h2> <br /> Rachel Carson would never have been able to wander this forest without the preservation work of Charles Glover (1846-1936) and Anne Archbold (1873-1968). These visionaries wanted to preserve scenic and recreational opportunities within Washington, DC. In a city that was expanding quickly at the turn of the century, Glover managed to successfully advocate for the creation of Rock Creek Park, Potomac Park, and Fort Dupont Park. In addition, he created Glover Archbold Park by donating nearly 80 acres of his own land as a gift to the United States and its people. To complete the project, Anne Archbold, a landowner and philanthropist, donated an additional 23 acres with the instruction that the land \"remain and be enjoyed by all as a natural sanctuary.\" <h2> </h2> <h2> </h2>",

        "notes": "Information Panels: Creating Meridian Hill\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/information-panel-meridian-hill.htm\n\n<p> </p> <h3>Visionary and Park Champion</h3> <br /> Meridian Hill Park might never have been built had it not been for the determination of Mary Foote Henderson (1846-1931). For 22 years, she lobbied Congress for funds to buy the land and build the park. Congress's 1910 vote to authorize construction of Meridian Hill Park is a testimony to her resolve.<br /> Henderson's efforts in urban development weren't limited to promoting Meridian Hill Park. She engaged the services of some of the country's foremost architects for her grand schemes, including an enormous new presidential mansion and two Lincoln memorials, none of which were ever built.<br /> Henderson had nearly a dozen elaborate residences built on 15th and 16th Streets for use as embassies and other diplomatic missions. She then planned to line 16th Street with the busts of former presidents and change the name of the street to \"Avenue of the Presidents.\" Although she succeeded in getting the street renamed for a short time, her grand vision for 16th Street was never realized. <h3>Creating the \"City Beautiful\"</h3> <br /> At the beginning of its second century, the nation's capital was changing dramatically. In 1902, the United States Senate adopted a number of recommendations from the Senate Park Commission, popularly known as the McMillan Commission. By 1910, a federally appointed group of architects and designers, the Commission of Fine Arts, was directing the rehabilitation of the National Mall. Under their supervision, construction began on several new buildings near the Capitol, including the monuments to Lincoln and Jefferson, and on a series of new parks.<br /> Two principles guided both commissions. The first was Pierre L'Enfant's 1792 plan of the city, which had never been fully realized and had nearly been lost during the 19th century. The second was creation and maintenance of grand public spaces, as endorsed by the proponents of the City Beautiful movement of the 1890s, and exemplified by the Beaux Arts designs of the French and Italian Renaissance revivals. Serving as a \"monumental entrance to Washington,\" Meridian Hill Park demonstrates both principles.<br /> According to Meridian Hill Park's National Historic Landmark nomination (1994), \"the creation of a Renaissance villa landscape in the midst of an American city to serve as a public park has no true parallel.\" <h3>Design Challenges</h3> <br /> Limited funds and the dramatic change in elevation at the Meridian Hill Park site - falling 75 feet from north to south - challenged the Commission of Fine Arts and their designers. The 16th Street edge required massive retaining walls to transition from the upper park to the sidewalk at street level.<br /> Budget constraints meant the designers could not specify natural stone for the desired Renaissance forms. To find a solution, the park's architect in charge, Horace Peaslee, turned to the Earley Studio in Arlington, Virginia, renowned for its artistry and craftsmanship.<br /> \"For John Earley, Meridian Hill Park was the beginning of an involvement with concrete that was to last nearly thirty years. Eventually, he became the world's foremost expert on the practical aspects of concrete making, and under his direction the Earley Studio executed works of such unusual complexity and beauty that they have never been equaled,\"<br /> Frederick Cron, historian <h3>Park Designers</h3> <br /> Noted landscape architects George Burnap and Horace Peaslee, who worked in the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds, designed Meridian Hill Park under the guidance of the Commission of Fine Arts. By 1914, Burnap had completed his basic design: a linear series of elements that included the Mall, the Great Terrace, the Hillside Gardens with Cascades, and the Lower Plaza with memorial to President Buchanan.<br /> After Burnap returned to private practice in 1917, Peaslee submitted revision that greatly simplified the Mall. As automobiles were rapidly replacing horse-drawn carriages in the city, he eliminated vehicular access into the park. He added a pedestrian entrance on 15th Street and shifted the Buchanan Memorial off the main axis to the east side of the Lower Plaza.<br /> When park construction began in 1918, landscape designer Ferruccio Vitale was hired to develop a planting plan for Meridian Hill Park. Following Peaselee's lead, Vitale greatly simplified the lower park. He eliminated the 16th Street entrance to the Great Terrace, the bridge over the Cascades and the oval amphitheater, and simplified the pathways of the Hillside Gardens. <p> </p>",

He was born in Pennsylvania and served in the War of 1812. Before he was elected to the office of President of the United States, he served as a Representative in Congress, U.S. Minister to Russia and to Great Britain, Senator and Secretary of State. His presidency (1857-1861) came at the brink of the Civil War, and some have faulted Buchanan for his failure to avert the sectional crisis that finally boiled over as he left office. Buchanan's niece, Mrs. Harriet Lane Johnston, who had served as the unmarried president's hostess, left a bequest to build this memorial upon her death in 1903. Many opposed the memorial's construction, finding it improper to honor Buchanan ahead of presidents such as Adams or Jefferson. After many years in limbo, the memorial was finally approved by Congress on June 27, 1918 (40 Stat. 632). <br /> <br /> <strong>Cost:</strong> Harriet Lane Johnston left $115,000 for the memorial to be built.<br /> <br /> <strong>Dedicated: </strong>June 26, 1930<br /> <br /> <strong>Sculptor:</strong> Hans Schuler</p> <h4>Memorial Description</h4> <p>The memorial consists of a bronze seated statue of President Buchanan.

Joan of Arc was a heroic French figure who claimed to receive religious visions telling her to fight for France and overthrow the English during the Hundred Years' War. Upon her capture and trial at the hands of the English, she was burned at the stake, leading the Catholic church to recognize her as a martyr in 1456. She was beatified in 1909 and canonized in 1920. This statue, a copy of the original at the Rheims Cathedral, was erected in 1922. The statue was a gift from the Society of French Women in Exile in New York.

In 1911, when the area was being developed into Meridian Hill Park, the cabin was almost demolished. Fans and supporters of Miller petitioned to have the cabin saved and it was painstakingly taken apart and re-built in Rock Creek Park.<br /> <br /> The Board of Control, who was managing Rock Creek Park at the time were against the move. California Senators intervened and had the cabin moved to Rock Creek Park. It was dedicated in 1912. The cabin was used for a time as a shelter and then as a concession stand for visitors to the park. Pherne Miller, Joaquin Miller's neice rented the cabin for over twenty years between 1931 and the 1950s. She not only sold candy and soda to park visitors, she taught art on the grounds surrounding int. In the 1970s, the Joaquin Miller Cabin poetry series began. The group originally held their meetings inside the cabin but crowds eventually exceeded the space avilable and the series was moved outside.

Church. The church’s congregation at that time was 50% black and was a mix of both freed and enslaved individuals. By 1816, black members of the church separated and created Mount Zion Methodist church. They took over the burying ground from Dumbarton Street M.E in 1879.<br /> <br /> In 1842 a group of free black women created a society—the Female Union Band Society—that pledged to care for one another “in sickness and in death”. They had an adjoining plot of land to the Old Methodist Burying ground.<br /> <br /> The two cemetery plots have collectively known as Mount Zion Cemetery.<br /> <br /> In the beginning at the twentieth century, many of the families with connections to the burial were forced from the area. Headstones toppled over. Grass grew tall and wild. Trash littered the grounds. In the 1960’s developers saw an opportunity to build town homes and apartments here. While some people saw an opportunity to profit from the sale of the land, others saw a painful loss of their collective community history. They saw the loss of a vital chapter---the path to freedom. Just beneath the hill, there is a vault that has long been believed to be a stop on the Underground Railroad. In 1976 volunteers from the Afro-American Bicentennial Corporation cleared away the tall grass, the garbage and cleaned up the cemetery. They petitioned for it to be protected—and won. <br /> <br /> Today the cemetery is managed by The Mt. Zion / Female Union Band Historic Memorial Park, Inc.

The sphere was vandalized in the 1960s and later disappeared after it had been removed from Meridian Hill Park for repair. The National Park Service is designing and building a replacement armillary sphere thanks to a generous donation.<br /> <br /> An armillary sphere is a map of astronomical objects first used in China approximately 200 B.C.E. Similar spheres were used frequently in Europe during the 7th century to illustrate the Ptolemaic theory of the earth-centered universe. The metal rings of the sphere represent the great circles of the heavens arranged in degrees for angular measurement. An armillary sphere appears on Portugal's flag, referencing the importance of maritime navigation in the nation's history.<br /> <br /> Cast in bronze, the Armillary Sphere was designed to be 6 feet 6 inches high, 5 feet 8 inches in diameter and 17.79 feet in circumference, and rested on a pedestal of green Conway granite 3 feet 4 inches high designed by the park architect, Horace Peaslee. To this day, the pedestal exists in its original location within Meridian Hill Park.<br /> <br /> The sphere contained the signs of the zodiac in bas-relief on the outside of the circle, along with the hours of the day marked in Roman numerals. A bronze arrow formed the axis of the sphere, and in the center was the figure of the winged \"Child Greeting the Sun.\"<br /> <br /> The original sphere was laid out in two equal circles that crossed each other at right angles and bisected one another. One circle represented the Meridian and the other the Equator. The meridian was divided into four 90° areas and the equator into 360°. A third circle, the Ecliptic, passed obliquely through the meridian and equator and intersected the equator at an angle of 23 1/4° at two points known as the equinoxes. Two smaller circles at either end represented the Arctic and Antarctic regions and were placed at a position 23 1/4° from their respective poles. A circle representing the line of longitude was placed at right angles to the meridian but bisecting the sphere east and west and thus passing through the north and south poles. A bronze gnomon shows the Axis of the earth and casts a shadow upon the equatorial band. On the inside of this band are represented the minutes of the day in 5 minute increments and there are star symbols that represent the hours of the night.<br /> <br /> If you're an armillary sphere enthusiast, check out the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/sarah-rittenhouse-armillary-sphere.htm\">Sarah Rittenhouse Armillary Sphere</a> in Montrose Park.</p>",

Although it is preserved for its architecture today, it was originally preserved through a case of mistaken identity and a desire to remember George Washington.</p> <p>In 1791, George Washington and city planner Pierre L'Enfant were surveying the newly established District of Columbia. L'Enfant's ambitious plan for the city's layout depended on negotiating with local landowners for right of way. During one of these meetings, Washington and L'Enfant stayed in Georgetown's Fountain Inn at 31st and K Streets. The inn was better known to locals as Suter's Tavern, after its owner John Suter. </p> <p>Over on Bridge Street (now M Street), John Suter's son, John, Jr., ran a clock shop in today's Old Stone House. As the years passed, local memory conflated the two buildings associated with the two John Suters. Thus, the desire to honor and remember George Washington's 1791 visit combined with a fuzzy memory led to the Old Stone House's preservation while so much changed around it.</p> <p>The house was the site of a car dealership when the federal government purchased the property in 1953. The National Park Service opened the house to the public in 1960. Today, the house is a rare example of pre-Revolutionary architecture. Among the House's furnishings, you may find a clock built by one-time owner John Suter, Jr.</p> <h4>Hours:</h4> Open daily (ground floor only), with holiday hours from 11:00 a.m.-7:00 p.m.",

Using the moving water as a power source, the mill ground corn, wheat, and rye. Succeeding generations further developed the mill, sawmill, orchard, and tree nursery. In 1890, an act of Congress incorporated the mill and 350 acres of the property into Rock Creek Park. The mill operated until the turbine's shaft broke in 1897. At the turn of the century, park managers went to work improving the site, improving roads and bridges and adding a new dam that provided a nice aesthetic for picnickers. In the 1920s, the mill was converted into a tea room complete with electric lights. In 1933, New Deal legislation transferred Rock Creek Park to the National Park Service. The National Park Service restored the mill and grounds to their historic layout by 1936. <br /> <br /> The mill is open seasonally.

While some were rough around the edges, others were vibrant, loving spaces. The Alley Dwelling Act forced change. What was on the surface a way to ‘clean up’ the more worse for wear areas of Georgetown (and the City of Washington), in reality was a way to force African Americans from their homes.<br /> Many of these structures were built in the early 1800s by affluent Georgetown residents for their enslaved African American and poor white staff members. Eventually, families were able to purchase the homes. Many owned several structures and would rent rooms out. The Alley Dwelling Act put an end to leasing rooms and demanded that these become single family homes. Property values were assessed and though a family may have owned a home for generations, the current generation could not afford the property taxes that were newly increased and levied against them. Many of the homes, without electricity, heat, or indoor plumbing were deemed “unsafe for human habitation” and were set to be demolished. However, instead of demolishing these homes, many of them were upgraded, flipped, and then sold to “New Dealers” coming to town to work for the newly expanded government. The Alley Dwelling Act was the final nail in the coffin of Herring Hill.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Poplar Alley is lined with privately owned residences.

Throughout his career, Olmsted fought hard to warn anyone who would listen of the dangers that lay in keeping such beautiful land private.<br /> <br /> It wasn’t until Olmsted Jr. was chosen to be part of the McMillan commission, in charge of developing both the core and park system of Washington, D.C., that Rock Creek Park would get its deserved attention.<br /> <br /> Once on the commission, Olmsted Jr. encouraged his colleagues to endorse the acquisition of land for new public parks and scenic drives throughout the city, including the preservation of Rock Creek Valley in its entirety.<br /> <br /> By 1918, Olmsted Jr. and his brother John were busy on the plan for Rock Creek Park. They proposed dividing the landscape into six distinct areas that remain today. The topographical and psychological backbone of the park, their report stated, would be the area along the banks of the creek and its tributaries. This “Valley Section”, as it was described, would be preserved in its natural state, with only the addition of scattered picnic spots.<br /> <br /> Rock Creek Park’s “woodland” would consist of the western hills and plateaus, contained in the South by Military Road. Olmsted Brothers saw the “woodland” area as a spot for intensive use; their report recommended the installation of hiking paths and numerous picnic groves. Olmsted Brothers even saw an area beyond their “woodland”, designated “wilder woodland”, and it was to be preserved to the highest degree.",

He was also the founder of Chevy Chase, Maryland. The memorial has been a source of controversy as Newlands also argued for the restriction of immigration and voting rights for African-Americans.<br /> <br /> The fountain is in the center of Chevy Chase Circle, which sits on the border between the District of Columbia and Maryland.

At the left side is a one by two-foot image of a bridge with water flowing out of its side in five places into the river below. Wavy horizontal lines are etched below the image. To the right is a four-foot tall etching of the corner of a bridge archway as it sits in the water. A shiny reflection of the bridge appears in the calm water below. On the right is a photograph representation of eight men facing the camera as they row in a crew shell on a river.<br /> <br /> The area provides a pleasant view of the Key Bridge to the north and Theodore Roosevelt Island across the river to the south.",

The left slab is in the shape of a triangle. It features an etching in the left corner of a sailboat, approaching the viewer as it floats under a current of calm, etched wavy, horizontal lines. The center of the slab features an image of a Native American man standing at the front end of a canoe and rowing right to left down the river. Two people sit behind him and a fourth person stands and rows from the back of the canoe.<br /> <br /> The right granite slab is also raised from the backside and has a rectangular shape. A gray granite slab bench runs ten feet along the right and fifteen feet along back side of the formation. A large etching is on the top half of the slab, about nine feet across. It features an image of old sail ships docked along the riverside in front of a row of buildings. A series of wavy line etchings separate this image from three smaller ones below, each about three by two inches. The faded left image appears to be a map of Washington, DC and the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers at its south end. The middle image is poorly faded, and only appears as light gray on the top half and darker gray below. The third image is also badly faded. Georgetown is visible written in the lower left corner, and a sketch of a two-story house in the lower right that is labeled Dumbarton House.",

It sits along a riverbank and a canal boat can be seen floating by in the foreground. To the right is a very faded image that appears to show about ten men with horses standing along a riverbank under trees. Further right is another faded image. This one appears to show canal boats lined up end-to-end sitting in a canal way. Another image to the right is also badly faded. Buildings with smokestacks can be seen in the top right corner. One last image is on the far-right side but can barely be seen. A series of horizontal, wavy lines are etched beneath all four images across the bottom of the granite slab.",

Often referred to as the \"High\" bridge, it stood 54 feet above the creek, 450 feet long, 32 feet wide and was supported by two red sandstone abutments. In 1897, the bridge was dismantled while the new, larger Taft Bridge was being constructed. The span provided access to \"Woodley,\" President Grover Cleveland's summer estate [which is] still standing today, located northwest of the bridge. The name \"Woodley\" is believed to have been derived from the large stand of immense oak and chestnut trees found upon the grounds.<br /> <br /> The information panel sits near the US Park Police Edgewater Police Stable parking area and is accessible to the public. The bridge abutments might be visible in the winter and autumn when vegetation is sparse.",

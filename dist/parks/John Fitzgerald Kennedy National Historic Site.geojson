Rose Kennedy was very regimented and methodical. She had a lot of rules in her house and believed in something called “Scientific Mothering”. She read many books on how to properly raise children and bought into many of these ideas whole-heartedly.</p>",

Kennedy attended his local public school, the Edward Devotion School, officially renamed the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/florida-ruffin-ridley.htm\">Florida Ruffin Ridley</a> School in 2021.</p> <p>This school had a promising reputation of academic excellence. By sending her children to this school, Mrs. Kennedy was allowing to become friends with all of the children in the neighborhood. As a young student here, Jack was a diligent reader and avidly read books, but would be known to zone out of focus, often staring off into space during class. His teachers hardly approved. One day, after school, Jack knew he was in trouble. His teacher was planning to walk to his house to tell his mother about his daydreaming habits. Jack quickly ran ahead of her, to speak with his mother before his teacher got to her. To defend himself, he told his mother, “You know, I’m getting on all right, and if you study too much, you’re liable to go crazy.”</p> <p>At the Florida Ruffin Ridey School today, the students commemorate JFK. Each year, third graders spend time studying JFK and his legacy in Brookline and write about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jofi/learn/education/essay-and-poetry.htm\">what JFK means to them</a>.</p>",

Mrs. Kennedy also remembered that she often found her son Jack in their kitchen after meals, receiving extra food from the cook. She was very strict about mealtimes and she didn’t allow her other children to do this. However, with Jack often being sickly and underweight she didn’t mind him getting these extra bits of food as a way of keeping some weight on him.</p> <p>In this room, she remembered looking out the windows to see the children in the “warm spring sun” and “building snowmen in the winter.” She also said that she was very happy when she lived here and although the family, “did not know about the days ahead, they were enthusiastic and optimistic about the future.”</p>",

In her tour recorded after the refurnishings of the house in the 1960s, Rose Kennedy recalled:</p> <blockquote> <p>The president was born in the twin bed, near the window, on May 29th, 1917, at three o'clock in the afternoon.</p> </blockquote> <p>Children were often born at home in the early 1900s. Rose Kennedy gave birth to John's younger sisters Rosemary and Kathleen in this house in 1918 and 1920.</p> <p>Mrs. Kennedy was very religious and she often attended <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/saint-aidans-church.htm\">church </a>every day, bringing the children with her. Despite this, you see very few religious items in the home. However, above the beds you see two <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/madonna-and-child-painting.htm\">religious paintings</a>. Mrs. Kennedy said that she felt that church was a place to worship and home was a place for family, and so she didn’t want a lot of religious items in the house. In the early 1900s in Boston, many Irish Catholics faced discrimination. Years later, when JFK ran for president in 1960, the issue of his Catholic faith was his greatest challenge. He addressed voter concerns early on, identified the need for separation of church and state, and successfully became the nation’s first Irish Catholic president.</p> <p>Similar to his wife’s belief that home was a place for family, Joe Kennedy preferred not to work from home. In this room, you see a telephone between the two beds; there is another <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jofi-telephone.htm\">telephone</a> downstairs in the front hallway. It was unusual for families to have two phones. However, when Mr. Kennedy was co-managing the Fore River Shipyard, it was a facility that ran 24 hours a day and seven days a week during the war, and so, Mr. Kennedy wanted easy access to communication, if work required his attention. He would later say that he worked harder at the Fore River Shipyard than ever before in his life.</p>",

When they moved, Mrs. Kennedy was expecting her fifth child, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/eunice-kennedy-shriver.htm\">Eunice</a>, and they later had Patricia and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-f-kennedy.htm\">Robert</a> in this home. The couple wanted to stay in Brookline, as it was a developing neighborhood, in walking distance to the nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/saint-aidans-church.htm\">Catholic Church</a>, and allowed Mr. Kennedy a short commute to work. They could now afford this home because of Mr. Kennedy’s continued success at work, and wise investments. He was one of the country’s youngest bank presidents, an investor, and a leader in the motion picture producing industry. The home symbolized the family’s growth.</p> <p>Mrs. Kennedy admired the porch that still wraps around the front of the home today. The new outdoor play space gave the children the welcomed opportunity to play together outside. On this porch, Mrs. Kennedy could supervise all of her children at once, and as they became boisterous, she remembered sometimes dividing the porch so each child could have his or her own space to play. Imagine four or five children, partitioned off on the porch, playing happily as Mrs. Kennedy sat in the center, talking with the passerby and playing with the children. She took full advantage of the neighborhood, as when the mailmen, ice deliverers, milkmen, and neighbors stopped by, Mrs. Kennedy asked her children to practice their manners, and greet them politely. As the children grew older, Mrs. Kennedy placed a bulletin board near the dining room, and pinned current events newspaper clippings, and magazine articles to it. She would expect that her children would read them throughout the day, and be ready to discuss their opinions at dinnertime, encouraging them to articulate their thoughts and argue their perspectives. The family lived in this home until 1927, when Mr. Kennedy decided to move them to New York, claiming that Boston was no place to raise an Irish family.</p>",

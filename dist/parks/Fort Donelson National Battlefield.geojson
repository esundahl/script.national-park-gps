Forrest's cavalry, launched an attack on the Union line held by Brigadier General John A. McClernand near this location. This road was known at that time as Forge Road because it led to Randolph Forge.<br /> <br /> Soldiers with both the 26th Mississippi and 26th Tennessee infantries, later joined by other regiments, were successful in pushing General McClernand's Division from its position. Soldiers with the 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, 18th, 20th, 30th, and 41st Illinois Infantries fought valiantly to hold their positions, before they were exhausted and scattered, needing ammunition to continue the fight. <br /> <br /> For a brief time, Forge Road was open, which would have allowed a way of escape for Confederates.  By nightfall, after more than six hours of continuous battle, the Confederates were ordered to return to their original positions. The way of escape was now closed, as Union forces moved to reoccupy the area once more.<br /> <br /> The Texas Monument was placed in this location in 1963 to honor of the Texas troops who fought at Fort Donelson.  ",

One of the blocks is featured on the side of the Mission-66 Visitor Center within Fort Donelson NB. Many of the other 90 quilt blocks are found on businesses, churches, and private homes.  It took nearly five years for a few volunteers and history enthusiasts to create and hang these beautiful pieces of art. <br /> <br /> The quilt trail was inspired by local artist Carolyn Walter Darke, who owned her own archtectural rendering business in Atlanta, and returned to her hometown. She was inspired by her own family's story, which was intertwined in the battle of Fort Donelson. More research led Darke and fellow art lover Betsy Tumelson to highight how Americans remembered the Civil War, how quilts commemorate the veterans who served, and how art and history unite to tell a story.<br /> <br /> Quilting is one of the oldest forms of American folk art. In the 19th century, women and young girls knew how to piece quilt blocks. Quilts were not really artwork, they were utilitarian, offering comfort and warmth for families. As the war began, quilts were taken by Confederate soldiers to training camps. Quilting provided a way to support the war effort too. Groups of women made quilts to raffle off as fundraisers or sewed soldier's cot quilts to cover coffins of deceased veterans (one may be found in the historic Dover Hotel). Newspaper journalists and sketch artists recorded the stories and images of thousands of Confederate soldiers, now prisoners-of-war at Fort Donelson, who wrapped themselves in homemade quilts and blankets to await their trip to Northern prisons.<br /> <br /> This auto tour consists of four separate driving tours. Some of the tour can take you approximately 25 -miles outside of the city of Dover. Plan for at least three-four hours to view all blocks. Don't be disappointed if some quilt blocks have been moved; it's entirely a voluntary agreement to display the quilt block for the visiting public.  <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/964736f6-13de-49b9-bba1-26ea2cfbefc5?branding=NONE\">NPGallery Asset Detail (nps.gov)</a><br />  ",

These are much different than the other earthworks that surrounded the Confederate fort. This tour stop is called the Union camp, because it was captured after General Smith's counterattack earlier in the day (Tour Stop #5).<br /> <br /> Many of General Buckner's men, the soldiers with the 18th Tennessee, the 2nd Kentucky, and the 14th Mississippi infantries, struggled throughout the afternoon on February 15th to try and dislodge the Union forces from their newly-acquired position in the former Confederate rifle pits. By nightfall, soldiers on both side collapsed, cold, exhausted, and hungry. Both armies roughly ended up in the same battlefield positions from which they began fighting earlier that same morning. The Confederates had captured some pieces of artillery, weapons, and military supplies, but this wasn't what this breakout attempt had been all about.<br /> <br /> Confederates now formed a new line, their final defense on the wooded ridge, across the park road, behind you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

The upper gun battery has three guns: two 32-lb carronades and one rifled Columbiad. The lower battery features several 32-lb cannons and one smoothbore Columbiad.  <br /> <br /> Rivers were strategically important for both armies. The Confederates chose this site to protect not only the waterway, but their supply base located in Nashville, TN.  <br /> <br /> At this location, Confederate gunners exchanged fire with Union sailors aboard the <em>City Series</em> fleet of ironclad gunboats on February 14, 1862. If you walk in front of the gun battery emplacement at the Lower Gun Battery, you will find interpretive signs explaining the ironclads and a War Department plaque which describes the battle. Wayside intepretive exhibits are also located on the observation deck.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

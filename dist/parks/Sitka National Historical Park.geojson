The original pole was obtained in 1903 from George Stanley or Thomas Snuck from the now abandoned Tlingit winter village of Tuxekan, on southwest Prince of Wales Island. This pole was first recarved in 1979 by Nathan Jackson (<i>Yéilch Ya’di)</i>. The first recarve and the original pole now stand in Totem Hall in the visitor center.<br /> The pole measures 16 feet tall, 2 feet wide. Though the large single, black and red bird figure at the top of this plain column is similar to Raven in form, the feathers carved on the back of the head and wings and the length of the beak suggests it could be a cormorant. You can compare this bird to the Raven memorial pole farther along on the Totem Loop Trail.<br /> Memorial and mortuary columns were common pole types found in Southeast Alaska. <b>Memorial poles</b>, along with house posts, are among the <b>oldest</b> forms of totem poles.There is a fine distinction between memorial and mortuary poles. Both act to remember important people, but mortuary poles were used like a funerary urn, to hold a loved one’s ashes. The mortuary pole was an actual internment, while the memorial pole was a column of remembrance. In some instances, a memorial pole was raised to honor a living person. The similarities in construction and appearance of these two types of poles make it difficult to tell them apart at a glance.<br /> Before Christianity was introduced to the Alaska Native people by the missionaries, the dead were sometimes cremated. The backside of a mortuary column often had a hole used as a receptacle for the ashes of the dead. Both memorial and mortuary columns were usually topped by a single figure indicating the moiety or the clan of the person interred.</p>",

House posts are important to clan house construction. Do you notice the notches on the top of each post? Traditionally a post is located at each indoor corner of a clan house and used to support a roof beam. You may also notice there is some variation in the design of each post. Traditionally, larger, and more ornate posts are located at the back of the house, where the higher status residents and their guests gather. Each post is rendered to show Mother Eagle a little differently. Each post also illustrates her sitting atop a nest (the round figure at the bottom) and the nest has a face within. The face within the nest is reminds us that there is life in everything and therefore all things in nature should be respected.<br /> <br /> These posts are approximately 200 years old and they tell the Mother Eagle story in which an eagle brings fish to a girl and her grandmother, the sole survivors of disease. The girl convinced the eagle she was its mother. As the girl matured and married a man of the opposite moiety, the birth of Kaagwaantaan children ensured the survival of the clan.<br /> <br /> By now you may have noticed that the crest of a clan is very important. A crest is used for representation and identification of a distinct social group. Can you imagine the frustration or confusion if more than one group has the same crest?

The panel tells the story of Glacier Bay. The central figure, a large, stylized bear signifies an iceberg, while the ears represent sliding ice. The checkerboard pattern in the lower corners denotes the bay.<br /> <br /> The story tells of a young girl, Kaasteen, who was separated from others at the onset of puberty and confined to the back of her house, where she could see the glacier. While in confinement, lonely and bored, she looked out and called the glacier to her, throwing it dried fish bones and calling it like a dog. The ice began growing and moving faster as if running to the girl. The people ran from the village as the ice grew closer.  Kaasteen stayed behind to appease the glacier’s spirit. The glacier then overtook the house and slid- the ice, the house and Kaasteen, into the sea.<br /> <br /> This panel may seem out of place since it isn’t as story about Sitka, however the Native account of the Little Ice Age glacial advance is renowned amongst Tlingit nations. This story is typically referred to as “The Glacier Bay Story” and not only documents the geological history of Glacier Bay, but also reminds us of the power of Tlingit women.<br /> <br /> When the Chookaneidí speak about Kaasteen today it is with a mixture of sorrow, pride, and reverence. She symbolizes the power of a woman to move glaciers and ice, the resilience of the clans who have adapted to a changing world over and over again, and the sacrifice that current generations continue to make on behalf of those to come.<br /> <br /> This panel was carved in 1947 by Kiks.ádi Peter Neilsen (<i>Aakashook</i>), which was purchased by George Fedoroff, a local art teacher at nearby Mt. Edgecumbe boarding school, and then loaned to the park by the Fedoroff family.</p>",

It is believed the current pole standing before you is a re-carving of the original pole. <br /> The pole is 28 feet tall, 4 feet wide and 2 feet thick. Most of the pole has weathered to the wood, however some red and black staining or paint remains. The figures on this Kaigani Haida pole represent 3 Tlingit legends.

The architecture almost conveys a feeling of timelessness.<br /> <br /> This building is built on the traditional territory of the Kiks.ádi Tlingit. Multiple design elements from the local Tlingit culture are incorporated into this structure to represent a traditional Tlingit Clan House. Primary elements that reflect the Alaska Native building traditions include the orientation of the front building gable towards the water, the installation of log columns and heavy beams supporting the lobby and seaside porch, the low slope roof with deep eaves, and the incorporation of Alaska Native carvings.<br /> <br /> In keeping with common design goals for the National Park Service “Mission 66” initiative, this visitor center was designed to include local culture and architecture. The main goal of “Mission 66” was to make parks more “user friendly” by building visitor centers, utilities, restroom facilities, roads, and parking areas for a growing population of tourists visiting their national parks. The effort was to be completed in 1966, coinciding with the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the National Park Service. Visitor centers were designed to make the visitor experience more pleasant, but not to be the star attraction. Rather they were supposed to enhance or be in harmony with their surroundings.<br /> <br /> If these walls could talk, they might tell you about the celebration that occurred on the day when the doors were finally opened to the public. When the construction of this building was completed in August 1965 the Tlingit community sent representatives from all over Southeast Alaska and Canada, near and far. In this very room the Tlingit offered a dedication ceremony, filled with speeches, songs, and dances, celebrating the opportunity to share insight into the cultures of the Northwest Coast with the world at large. As is Tlingit custom, during the ceremony a Kaagwaantaan clan representative, David Howard, gifted the National Park Service building with the name<span style=\"font-size: 7.875px;\"> </span><i>Lingit’aani Hít, Aantḵeeni Hít</i> (World House, Townspeople House).

The pole was provided by Hattie Wallace of Klinkwan to John Brady in 1903.   <br /> After arriving in Sitka, the pole was brought to the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, MO and the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland, OR. After a replacement pole was recarved by Frank Kitka (Ganóosgu éesh the CCC between 1938-1941, it was loaned to the US Naval Air Station on Japonski Island across from Sitka, who turned the pole over to Mt. Edgecumbe High School, a boarding high school run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs who took over the military facilities after WWII. One of the few originally loaned to the US Navy, it was the only intact pole when, in 1961, it was arranged for its indefinite loan to the Sheldon Jackson Museum in Sitka. It remained there until 1983 when it returned to the Sitka National Historical Park. The original pole obtained from Sukkwan can be seen in the totem preservation exhibit, on the outside of the Visitor Center.<br /> This pole is 33 feet tall, three and a half feet wide and 2 feet thick. It is painted with traditional red, black and bluegreen colors.

While the abalone shell and copper inlay in the Wolf pole and posts signify wealth, it is family and the future that seem to be the central themes portrayed. The tongue of a large wolf extending to a small wolf held in its paws is symbolic of the passing of knowledge to future generations.<br /> <br /> In the early 1900s Alaska Native people experienced a time of cultural suppression. Due to constraints imposed by government and western religions, the passing of native language, traditions and craftsmanship to younger generations became increasingly difficult. In 1904 the Tlingit celebrated what they thought would be their last potlatch, a very significant ceremonial and celebratory event in Alaska Native culture.<br /> <br /> Fortunately, the secrets of language and art were whispered into the ears of the young, keeping this vibrant culture flourishing today.You can learn more about the 1904 potlatch in our museum exhibit.</p>",

It is believed it was initially carved for his wife from the Kaagwaantaan clan. The shark was once associated as a clan emblem for the Kaagwaantaan, today it is used by the Wooshketaan clan. It is unclear whether this pole was a family crest pole, or a legend pole.  This pole is 29 feet tall. The base of the pole is the figure of a bear. The inside of its ears, the area around its eyes is blue green, its lips are red. Above that is a downward facing wolf, with red nostrils and blue green around the eyes and in the ears. Above the wolf’s tail is a fish with small red round nostrils. The fish has a blue green ring around its ovoid eyes, gills and on the tail fin. The fish is long and black and has two dorsal fins and a tail fin. On top is a raven, which is black with red lips on its beak, and blue green around the eyes and around the ovoid shapes on the wings.When John Brady obtained this pole from Chief Tom Teh-Gat in 1903, he noted that “Chief Tom (Teh-gat) a leader of people at Klawock, He gave a totem pole Eagle at the top-dog fish-wolf-brown bear.” Brady brought the pole to the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition and the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition. This pole was also part of the New York World’s Fair in 1964. By 1978 the pole had seriously decayed, and a re-carving was crafted by Tommie Jimmie, Sr. (<i>Náakil.aan, Lingít Aaní Kinaa, K’eixix</i>) to stand in its place on Totem Trail. The original was exhibited at the Anchorage Museum of History and Art for more than thirty years and was returned to Sitka National Historical Park in 2017.

It was the residence of Ivan Veniaminov, a beloved Russian Orthodox leader and the first Bishop of Alaska. It served as the administrative headquarters for Russian Orthodox missionary efforts in Alaska.</p> <p>The religious and moral influence of the missionary in Sitka is alive in the large numbers of Russian Orthodox communicants living in the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands, and other Alaska coastal communities. The Russian Bishop's House National Historic Landmark is architecturally significant due to the high quality and unique construction characteristics of Russian vernacular design, such as the intricate joinery methods.</p> <h4><br /> Russian Alaska</h4> <p>The Russian period in America extending from 1732 to 1867, while primarily economically motivated, resulted in numerous cultural transitions in Alaska. In the late 18th century, the abundance of sea otters in Alaska prompted settlement by Russian fur traders. In 1799 the Russian American Company (RAC) received a charter granting it exclusive fur trading rights in the Russian territories of the Pacific Rim. From then on it served as a quasi-governmental body within the territory. New Archangel (Sitka) served as the capital of the Russian American colony from 1808 until 1867. The RAC charter compelled it to support the Russian Orthodox Church in Alaska and fund construction of church buildings. The Russian Bishop’s House was one of several buildings constructed in Sitka for the Russian Orthodox Church by the RAC.</p> <h4><br /> Current Condition</h4> <p>The Russian Bishop's House served as the house for Russian Orthodox Bishops in North America from 1843 until 1969. In 1973, the National Park Service purchased the House and began a 15 year restoration. At the time the Russian Bishop's House was in very poor condition. Weathering, foundation problems, and leakage had taken their toll. Interior finishes were falling away while exterior siding rotted and buckled. The House was restored to the 1853 time period to serve as a museum. As part of its restoration a ventilation system was installed to control humidity inside the building. It has been very well maintained and is in<br /> excellent condition.</p> <h4><strong>Accesibility</strong></h4> <p>The first floor of the Russian Bishop's House is accesible by wheel chair, and while the second floor is unaccesible, there is a video provided on the first floor that details the second floor's historical artifacts and layout. <br /> <br /> Service animals are allowed. </p> <h4><br /> <br /> Additional Information</h4> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?id=8956CE14-1DD8-B71C-079C6FCAC97BDE23\">A Photo Gallery of the Russian Bishop's House</a></h4> <h4><a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ak0270/\">Library of Congress, Historic American Buildings Survey - Photos and Drawings</a></h4> <h4><a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/66000025\">National Register of Historic Places - Official Nomination Form </a></h4> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sitk/planyourvisit/upload/nhl-sitka.pdf\">Sitka's National Historic Landmarks: A Window into Alaska's Past</a></h4> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></h4>",

By the late 1930s the original pole had seriously deteriorated, it was at this point over 100 years old, and we hadn’t yet developed the preservation techniques we have today. Today only a fragment of the original pole remains. <br /> When the second generation of this pole was carved by George Benson and Peter Jones of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1940s, the crew had to fit the design onto 2 logs pieced together.The house posts were recarved in 1981-1982 by Reggie Petersen. <br /> Although several figures are identifiable, such as a bear on the bottom, raven in the upper middle portion and two traditional village watchmen at the top, many other figures are not. Little information about the story of this intricately carved giant has survived.<br /> The house posts each display a single figure, with a large face at the top, red arms crossed over the body, and two smaller faces between the figure's red legs. The bottom face is upside down. Designs on the house posts are said to be from a legend in which Raven obtains the sun, moon and stars for the people of the earth. <br /> Be sure to visit Totem Hall inside the visitor center to see the remaining Raven's Head fragment of the original pole, and the original House Posts.</p>",

This curving, swelling line creates three-dimensional shapes using three elements: the ovoid, the “U,” and the “S.” When painted, black is used on accented areas such as pupils and eyebrows. Red is used on lips, nostrils, and bodies. Bluegreen is used in eye sockets and two-dimensional areas.</p> <h3>Figures on Poles</h3> <p>Figures on poles include Eagles with short, pointed beaks and talons; Ravens with longer flat beaks and “ears;” Bears with a short snout, round ears, and flared nostrils; Wolves with a narrow face, tall ears, and long snout; Frogs have large eyes, a wide mouth, and small nostrils. Some poles include humans, animals in human form, or a person with a tall hat on the tops of poles called a “Watchman.”<br /> Some of figures may represent clans or crests. <b>Clans </b>are powerful social units divided into two moieties or groups (the Eagle and the Raven). They play an important role in creating and raising totem poles. <b>Crests</b> are animals or objects exclusively associated with a particular clan. </p> <h3>Origins</h3> <p>The majority of the 16 historic poles come from Kagaini Haida territory, south of Sitka. They were obtained around 1903 by Alaska’s territorial governor John Brady for the 1904 St. Louis Exposition and the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition. Upon return to Alaska, they were displayed in what is now known as Sitka National Historical Park. The original locations and donors of the poles are mostly known, but their original meanings were either not documented or have been lost.</p> <h3>CCC Era</h3> <p>In the 1930’s, local Native carvers restored or re-carved the poles as a Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) project. Many of the poles along Totem Trail are CCC renditions of the original poles. What is left of the originals are in Totem Hall and the Visitor Center’s Seaside Porch. The largest of the original poles are behind the Visitor Center in an enclosure where you may view them.</p> <h3>There are several types of totem poles.</h3> <ul> <li><b>House posts</b> are carvings on the support poles of houses<b>; </b></li> <li><b>Frontal poles</b> are freestanding poles placed against or near the front of a house displaying clan crests, clan history, and/ or a legend;</li> <li><b>Mortuary or Memorial Poles</b> honor a living or dead person with a plain pole and a crest symbol on top. The family deposits ashes of the deceased person either in a box on top of the pole or in a hole in the back.</li> <li>Poles can also be a <b>History Pole</b> recording a clan’s history, a <b>Legend Pole</b> telling a real or fictional story, or a <b>Crest Pole</b> showing a particular clan’s ancestry.</li> </ul> <p>Totem poles were never considered part of a religious practice or worshipped.<br /> Enjoy the rest of the tour and feel free to ask any questions!  </p>",

The blockhouse was built out of fear of retaliation/ attack by the Tlingit. The current Sitka Blockhouse is an early 1960's replica of the Russian fortification around the town of Sitka. The structure was part of a defensive stockade built around Sitka in the early 1800s. It is located near the Orthodox Church's historic cemetery.<br /> Holy Trinity Church was located close to the blockhouse in the stockade. The church was built in 1849 and consecrated by Bishop Innokentii. This church was built expressly for the local Tlingit community where services could be conducted in the Tlingit language. The church was built right into the stockade surrounding the little Russian town of Novoarkangel’sk (Sitka). The western door of the church opened to the Tlingit village; the eastern doors inside the stockade faced the Russian village. <br /> Because relations between the Russians and the Tlingit continued to be tense for decades after their initial conflict, the Russians were in a quandary about Tlingit conversion to the Orthodox Church. On the one hand, the Russians were gratified that so many Tlingit desired to attend church. On the other hand, they were uneasy about allowing up to 200 Tlingit at a time into the stockade to go to services. Holy Trinity Church was built to solve this problem.<br /> Originally the Russians built a capital D-shaped five-sided blockhouse on this site facing up Sitka Channel. It overlooked the gate between the Russian outpost and the adjacent Tlingit village. An octagonal blockhouse stood within sight of the crest of the hill, while at the far eastern end of the wall stood a small, square blockhouse by the stream flowing out of Swan Lake.<br /> In 1855 a skirmish at the gate in the stockade led Tlingit men to break into the church and fire upon soldiers within the stockade. A number of soldiers and even more Tlingit were killed. Two years after the violence, the church was reconsecrated as ''Holy Trinity Church,\" and was used until 1875 when it was dismantled.<br /> In 1926 civic-minded citizens, including the Alaska Native Brotherhood, raised funds and built an octagonal reproduction blockhouse at Sitka National Monument. After decay attacked that structure, a second octagonal reproduction was built at this site in 1962.</p>",

It is then up to the owner whether to share the story. This “secrecy” is an example of intellectual property in a cultural perspective. Fortunately, in this case, permission has been given by the clan so we can reveal the legend before you.<br /> <br /> The two salmon at the top symbolize the <i>L’uknax.</i><i>á</i><i>di</i> (coho salmon clan). The carved legend portrays the heroic deed of Sleeping Man in his effort to save the Coho people.<br /> <br /> Accounts of the legend indicate that a giant octopus was attracted by the red color of sockeye salmon the Coho people had harvested and were drying. The octopus attacked the village, killing all the people while Sleeping Man was away hunting with his slave. He was dismayed when he returned and saw the destruction. He swore revenge and made attempts to attract the octopus. He eventually lured the giant octopus closer with red blankets. As the octopus drew near Sleeping Man paddled his canoe to meet it. With a dagger tied to his hand he stepped out onto the octopus, sealing their fate. Both the Octopus and Sleeping Man died in the struggle.<br /> <br /> Do you think there is a lesson to be learned from this legend?</p>",

This is a replica carved during the 1938-1942 Civilian Conservation Corps project using local Alaska Native carvers, including George Benson, Frank Kitka, and John Sam.<br /> The bottom figure is a beaver, recognized by the long square teeth and cross hatched tail. The next figure up is an upside-down crab, a symbol of thievery, which is being held up by another indistinguishable animal figure. Atop this figure is an animal with a shrimp in its mouth, another symbol said to represent a thief. At the top of this pole is a figure representing a white man, indicated by the depiction of curly hair and a beard. <br /> This is a <b>Ridicule Pole</b>. Traditionally, a ridicule pole served to resolve conflicts in a non-violent way via public acknowledgement of a wrongdoing. It was erected to notify everyone of an unpaid debt or of harm or injury to another.The crest of the person who owed the debt or caused the harm or injury would be carved into the pole and was raised at a potlatch.The righting of the wrong or payment of the debt was accomplished at another potlatch, again, so that there would be many witnesses. Then the pole was burned and the wrong was never mentioned again.<br /> An interesting sidenote is that this pole formerly stood near the old foot bridge across Kaasdaa Heen (Indian River) and was swept away in 1941, during the heaviest documented flood in the history of the Park. It was retrieved by the US Navy who was involved in gravel removal operations in the area. The gravel removal caused the banks to be eroded, so when there was an especially heavy rainfall, it washed the pole away.  </p>",

The original Wolf pole has been preserved and now stands in Totem Hall. This pole is 22 feet tall. The bottom figure is a salmon, facing downward. The eyes of the salmon are round with a blue green ring around them. Below that is a wolf, recognized by his pointed ears. The inside of the ears and around the eyes are painted green blue, the lips and tongue are red. The wolf and salmon may represent clan crests or may symbolize characters from a legend of a boy who was captured by the Dog Salmon people. The top figure is a man, perhaps the Village Watchman or the pole’s owner. It has a red hat with a black stripe. The original pole was acquired by Alaska territorial governor John Brady from a village near Prince of Wales. The exact location or from whom it was acquired may not have been recorded. Prior research indicated that the pole originated from the Haida village of Howkan, which is located on Long Island near Prince of Wales Island. Newer research indicates that this pole likely originates from the Tlingit village of Tuxekan on Prince of Wales Island, because its carving is more similar to other poles seen in historic photos of Tuxekan.   This is most likely a <b>crest pole</b>. The figures on this pole are very life-like and distinct as compared with the highly interconnected and overlapping design of many Haida poles. Tlingit poles typically have figures isolated from one another and present a more rounded and sculpted appearance, which can be seen on this pole. The Prince of Wales Archipelago is still occupied by both the Tlingit and Haida. Cultural interchange occurred and continues to occur through travel, trade, war, intermarriages and other means of diffusion.  </p>",

The main goal of “Mission 66” was to make parks more “user friendly” by building visitor centers, utilities, restroom facilities, roads, and parking areas for a growing population of tourists visiting their national parks. The effort was to be completed by 1966, to coincide with the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the National Park Service. Visitor centers were designed to make the visitor experience more pleasant, but not to be the star attraction. Rather they were supposed to enhance or be in harmony with their surroundings.</p> <p>Many homes have a regional design shaped to either weather the elements, take advantage of local natural resources in construction or harken to a past cultural heritage. This visitor center exists on the traditional territory of the Kiks.ádi clan. Multiple design elements from the local Lingít culture are incorporated into this structure to represent a traditional Lingít Clan House. Primary elements that reflect the Alaska Native building traditions include the orientation of the front building gable towards the water, the installation of log columns and heavy beams supporting the Lobby and Seaside Porch, the low slope roof with deep eaves, and the incorporation of Alaska Native carvings. Does your home have a regionally distinct design, like this Lingít clan house?<br /> <br /> Around the visitor center lobby are several House posts, crests, and emblems that represent events, identity, and history of the local  community. The objects are considered <i>at.</i><i>ó</i><i>ow  </i>(sacred owned item)<i> </i>in Lingít culture, and is the property of local Lingít clans. Loan agreements with the Kaagwaantaan Wolf House, Kaagwaantaan Eagle Nest House and L’uknax.ádi Farthest Out House, provide museum safekeeping for this property while it is on exhibit at the park visitor center.</p> <p>The <i>Wudzixeedi Gooch</i> “Multiplying Wolf” house screen, now seen indoors above the Seaside Porch doors was originally installed outside above the entrance, in keeping with Lingít tradition. Customarily house screens are displayed outside to identify the clan within. However, with its proximity to the sea, the elements began to take their toll rather quickly and the screen was brought inside, protecting it from further damage. This painted crest tells of a time when the Wolf Clan outgrew its clan house and had to establish a new house. Do you have significant family heirloom displayed in your home as a reminder of specific events in your family history, much like the Multiplying Wolf house screen?</p>",

On the left the fragment is approximately 7 feet tall and has a bear figure, holding a smaller upside-down bear to its mouth with its claws. The bear’s body had been painted red, the square shaped teeth were white, and the eyes and brows are black. On the right, the second fragment is approximately 12 feet tall. The bottom figure is of a sitting bear with its claws tucked under the face. On top of the bear’s head sits a Watchman. His body is painted red, he is wearing a tall blue hat with a red stripe. The aged and worn off condition of the paint and the fact that these are fragments are good clues to indicate these fragments are very old.These 2 totem fragments are from a Kaigani Haida pole from Old Kaasaan on Prince of Wales Island obtained from John Baranovich. These are original pieces of one (of the two) Yaadaas Clan crest corner poles brought to the park in 1906. This pole originally stood at 23’ and along with its twin, stood at the exterior corners of the Yaadaas clan house. Photographic evidence shows that the poles were carved before 1885. The original twin of this pole is on exhibit in Totem Hall in the visitor center. Replicas of both the 1<sup>st</sup> twin and the 2<sup>nd</sup> twin stand outside farther along the Totem Loop Trail.</p>",

The first twin, the second twin and the Yaadaas Crest Corner Pole all were brought to the park in 1906. This re-carving was created by Tommy Jimmie, Sr. (<i>Náakil.aan, Lingít Aaní Kinaa, K’eixix</i>) in 1978.This pole is 23 feet tall and 2 1/2 feet wide. The base figure appears to be a bear holding an animal in its mouth. The next figure up is a raven, with a black beak, facing downward. There area around the eyes and the tips of the tail feathers are blue green. Above this is Raven in human form. This figure also has blue green around the eyes, red nostrils and square teeth. The human figure at the top is the Village Watchman. He has a tall red hat with a blue green stripe, and this eye sockets are painted blue green. The figures below the Watchman may be crests of the clan who owned the house and could represent incidents in the real or mythical history of the clan. This pole, and its twin (or companion), served as exterior corner poles to a clan house specifically the Yaadaas clan house in Old Kasaan. These poles portray the heraldic emblems of the Yaadaas clan of the Kaigani Haida. </p>",

This recarving was completed in 1982 by Nathan Jackson (Yéilch Ya’di) and Steve Brown (Kaajísdu.áxch). Notice the difference in adzing style and carving technique between this recarving and the recarving of the first twin. Although the design is the same, each carver executes the design with an individualized touch. As with the First Twin, previously seen along Totem Trail, the crests on this pole represent the clan lineages of the family who owned the pole.<br /> Starting at the bottom is the bear which holds an animal in its mouth. Atop the bear is Raven, followed by Raven sitting in human form. On the top of the pole is the Village Watchman.<br /> A figure of the Village Watchman at the top is unique to Haida crest poles and has no significance or relationship to the crests. It is intended to let the people know that they are being watched over and will be protected. The carved hat worn by the Town Watchman is intended to represent the conical chief’s hat that is carved of wood or woven of spruce roots and topped by a series of rings carved into the wood or cylinders woven of spruce roots and attached such that the cylinders sways as the wearer of the hat dances. It is believed that in the past each cylinder or ring indicated the number of potlatches that have been given. The greater the number of potlaches that an individual had hosted, the greater the status of the clan.  A “Potlatch” among Native people of the Northwest Coast is an opulent ceremonial feast at which possessions are given away or destroyed to display wealth or enhance prestige.</p>",

This screen was commissioned by the park in commemoration of the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Battle of 1804, fought between the Tlingit Kiks.ádi and Russian forces at the mouth of Kaasdahéen (Indian River). The location of the battle lies within current park boundaries and is a monumental piece of Alaskan history.<br /> <br /> The screen combines design elements to represent both Tlingit and Russian Culture. It was dedicated in July of 2004, making it the youngest piece on display in the lobby.<br /> <br /> The 2004 ceremonies and commemorations illustrate significant changes for the Tlingit of Sitka. In 1804 they battled a Russian warship and hundreds of their allies to hold on to their homelands. By 1904, under the influence of American colonization, they grudgingly prepared to lay to rest the final vestiges of their culture with one “final” potlatch. In 1965, two decades after the American government reconsidered its viewpoint of native American art and culture as “American heritage”, the Tlingit welcomed the opportunity to share their worldview with others.  In 2004, as mourning songs were sung, poignant speeches were given and heartfelt dedications were made, the Tlingit found a way to rise above the ugly events of the past to heal and strengthen their community for a better tomorrow.</p> <p> </p>",

During the early years, in April, bands of sheep were trailed around Picture Gorge to a ranch near Dayville to be sheared. By 1946, falling wool prices together with the difficulty of locating skilled sheep herders led to many ranchers switching to cattle.<br /> <br /> By 1965, the Cants were producing about six hundred head of cattle annually and only a small flock of sheep were left. Jim Cant Jr. and his wife Freda operated the ranch until 1975 when the National Park Service purchased the ranch house and 878 acres to be incorporated into John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. Descendents of the Cants continue to ranch the 6,000 acres surrounding the National Monument land.<br /> <br /> Sheep and cattle have been replaced by sweeping lawns, trails and visitors. Dust and the tangy odors of livestock no longer hang in the air. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, the turn of the century ranch house is home to a cultural history museum open select summer days and serves as headquarters for John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.<br /> <br /> Paleontologists and geologists have visited this area for more than 150 years to collect fossils and study the geology. Recognition of the area's significance led to President Gerald Ford authorizing the new monument on October 26, 1974. Three state parks formed the core of the new monument unique for the diversity of fossils and the nearly continuous record of rocks over a broad span of time. John Day Fossil Beds National Monument was formally established in 1975 consisting of three widely separated areas: the Clarno Unit, Painted Hills Unit, and Sheep Rock Unit.<br /> <br /> Serving a mission of protection, John Day Fossil Beds National Monument preserves and provides for the scientific and public understanding of the paleontological resources of the John Day region, as well as the natural, scenic, and cultural resources within the boundaries of the National Monument.",

The Mascall landscape consisted of several broad basins with lakes and meandering streams that formed atop the last of the Picture Gorge Basalt flows.<br /> <br /> These deposits were subsequently covered by successive falls of ash from volcanoes to the west and from the much closer Strawberry volcanics to the east. Alternating between the <strong>tuffs</strong> (consolidated volcanic ash) are layers of ancient soils and stream deposits that provide evidence of a dynamic floodplain. Many of the vertebrate fossils from the Mascall formation are found in close association with a prominent layer, the 15 million-year-old “Mascall Tuff.”<br />   <h4>Changing Climates</h4> Although dramatic fluctuations in the global climate and regional volcanic activity continued, there were enough phases of moderate climate with ample rainfall and fertile soil to allow the growth of lush grasses and mixed hardwood forests.

The ditch wound in and out of draws and around foothills, so a sixteen-foot 2x4 with a level was used to maintain the necessary grade to keep the water moving to the fields.<br />   <h4>The Cants</h4> With just $25 in his pocket, James Cant immigrated to America in 1905. he worked for the Murray Ranch in the Dayville area, taking half his wages in lambs each year so he could put together his own band of sheep. By 1907, James had saved enough money to send to Scotland for his sweetheart, Elizabeth Grant.<br /> <br /> One wonders at the thoughts Lizzie must have had when she received the letter from James asking her to join him in Oregon. Lizzie's decision to come here meant leaving the only home she knew for an unknown and rugged place far away from family and friends, but also the beginning of a new life with the man she loved.<br /> <br /> James married Elizabeth Grant in 1908. Capturing that moment in time, Lizzie penned a note on the back of their wedding photo \"<em>it was the Start twords the happyest days of our Lives\".</em><br /> <br /> James purchased the 677 acre Officer Ranch, with water rights, one band of 1200 sheep, and some cattle, all for $6,900. James and Lizzie settled into the isolated two bedroom ranch house with their one-year old son and started the business of sheep ranching.

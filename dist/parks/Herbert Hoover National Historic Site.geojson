        "notes": "Birthplace Cottage\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/birthplace-cottage.htm\n\n<blockquote> <p>\"This cottage where I was born is physical proof of the unbounded opportunity of American life.\"</p> <p>Herbert Hoover</p> </blockquote> <p>In the years following his presidency, Herbert and Lou Hoover restored the president's humble birthplace, which he called, \"physical proof of the unbounded opportunity of American life.\" The small space and few material possessions reflect an ethic of thrift. The cottage was a typical starter home for a young late 19th century family. Antique furnishings represent common household items of a simply furnished two room rural home.</p> <h2>Family Of Five</h2> <p>In 1871, Jesse Hoover and his father Eli built this two-room cottage across the street from Jesse's blacksmith shop. Jesse and his wife Hulda moved in with their young son Theodore. Herbert Hoover was born here on August 10, 1874. When \"Bertie\" was two his sister Mary was born.</p> <h2>A Starter Home</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover lived here only until he was three and half years old. This was the Hoovers' first home, and although it was small it served the young family well. As Jesse prospered, the family moved to a larger, two-story house about one block south of here.</p> <h2>Two Rooms Inside</h2> <p>One room served as a bedroom for the two adults and three children, the other as a combination living room, dining room, and kitchen. In the winter, a wood-burning cook stove did double-duty inside the main room as the home's heater but during the warm months the Hoovers moved it to the back porch, which became a summer kitchen.</p> <h2>Construction</h2> <p>The home's large foundation stones came by wagon from the open prairie to the west. Timber for the board and batten cottage followed the Mississippi River from northern forests to sawmills in Muscatine, and then overland 40 miles by ox teams to West Branch. Strips of cotton fabric stuffed between the seams insulated the house. The small twelve-paned windows reduced the heat escaping the cottage.</p> <h2>After The Hoovers</h2> <p>The Hoover family lived in the cottage only until Herbert was three years old. Several families owned and occupied the cottage after the Hoovers moved out in 1878. The Scellers family, who lived there from 1890 until 1934, moved a two-story frame house onto the cottage lot. They moved and attached the cottage to the back of the two-story house, where they used it as a kitchen and dining room.</p> <h2>Tourist Attraction</h2> <p>As Hoover's fame spread people became interested in visiting his birthplace. Mrs. Scellers came to enjoy meeting visitors and showing them through her house. Her guest register showed that Herbert Hoover was especially popular with visitors from abroad. These people spoke of their great respect for the man who had done so much to alleviate suffering in their homelands during and after World War I.</p> <h2>Return Of The Hoovers</h2> <p>Even before Herbert Hoover's election to the Presidency in 1928, his wife Lou Henry Hoover tried to purchase the Birthplace Cottage to return ownership to the family. The Hoovers reacquired the cottage in 1935, the year after Mrs. Scellers died.</p> <h2>Restoration</h2> <p>Although previous owners had altered the two-room cottage, they never moved off of the property. Restoration began in the summer of 1938 with the removal of the two-story addition from 1890. Then the Birthplace Cottage was re-positioned 90 degrees to the south, so that its front door would once again face Downey Street.</p> <h2>\"Memories of a Little House\"</h2> <p>Lou Henry Hoover relied on the recollection of various family members, including Herbert's older brother, Theodore. She turned those stories into a manuscript called \"Memories of a Little House,\" which guided the restoration and furnishing of the historic house.</p> <h2>Furnishings</h2> <p>Since most of the original furnishings were unavailable, the family decorated the cottage with period pieces they felt best represented the home in which the Hoover family lived.</p>",

This became the summer kitchen. The porch and summer kitchen may have served several other purposes over time, a woodshed, store room, and spare bedroom. It was here, in the dark of night on August 10, 1874, that blacksmith shop assistant, Elwood King was awakened to go and fetch the doctor. Around midnight, Herbert Clark Hoover was born.</p> <h3>Vegetable Garden & Flower Beds</h3> <p>Hulda grew her vegetable garden behind the cottage, while flower gardens of marigolds, peonies, and snapdragons filled the front and side yards. And just like today, seeds, cuttings and bulbs, were traded with family and friends. The dark red double-petaled tulips that once grew here came from the bulbs Hulda's mother had brought with her from Canada.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>Near the southwest corner of the back porch was a wooden pump, and dangling from it a gourd dipper. Beneath the pump spout was a wooden tub. For soft water, they dipped from a rain barrel, positioned to catch the run-off from the roof. For watering the garden and washing, they filled a wooden tub with water pumped from a cistern in their backyard. Nearby was the drain into which Hulda Hoover poured her dishwater. For drinking water, the Hoovers went one block north to the town pump in the middle of the intersection of Downey and Main Streets.</p> <h3>Privy</h3> <p>The Hoovers placed their privy, probably a two-holer, in the corner of the lot away from the cistern but convenient to both the house and the blacksmith shop.</p> <h3>Cellar</h3> <p>A cellar under the cottage stored vegetables and other foods below the winter's frost. According to Lou Hoover's research, \"In such a tiny house the cellar door was a necessity outside, demanding the throwing of shawl over head and shoulders, as one ran to it from the back door of the kitchen on a freezing day.\"</p> <h3>Chicken House</h3> <p>The Hoovers kept a chicken house for fresh eggs near the rear of the lot.</p>",

The original, sold after Hulda Hoover’s death, was found in a West Branch barn sometime in the 1930s and eventually returned to the Hoover family. It is displayed at the Visitor Center.</p> <h2>Bed & Trundle</h2> <p>At night the Hoovers pulled out the trundle from underneath their parents’ four-poster bed. As a toddler young Herbert shared the trundle with his older brother Tad while his baby sister slept in the cradle. Patchwork quilts and wool bedspreads kept the family warm after the woodstove’s fire died out in the middle of the night.</p> <h2>Dresser</h2> <p>The dresser in the corner is very similar to one Hulda received as a wedding gift from her mother. Made by Herbert Hoover's great uncle, a cabinet-maker in Detroit, the drawers were once filled with household linens.</p> <h2>Sewing Machine</h2> <p>The sewing machine is not original to the Hoover family, but is a reminder of Jesse’s growing success as a businessman, and how he provided for the needs of his wife and family. A sewing basket filled with needles and thread was always within Hulda’s reach.</p> <h2>Carpet</h2> <p>Rag rugs like the one in the cottage covered the floors. The Hoovers kept old clothes and cloth scraps. They cut them into strips and wound them into balls until they accumulated enough for Herbert's grandmother to weave into rugs. Hulda sewed the sections together and tacked them to the floor.

Playing barefoot around the blacksmith shop, I stepped on a chip of hot iron and carry the brand of Iowa on my foot to this day.\"</p> <p>Herbert Hoover</p> </blockquote> <p>Herbert Hoover's father Jesse owned and operated a blacksmith shop from 1871 to 1878. Although there were other smithies in town, Jesse earned a reputation as a good-natured, fair, and industrious businessman. Skilled and ambitious, he advertised to farmers, \"Horse shoeing and plow work a specialty. Also dealer in all kinds of pumps. Prices to suit the times.\" </p> <h2>Reconstructed Shop</h2> <p>Built in 1957, this building represents the kind of blacksmith and wagon shops that were common in the 1870s. It is based on the sketches of Herbert's older brother Theodore, from his recollections of what their father's shop looked like. The re-built blacksmith shop sits west of the original shop's location just a stone's throw from the Birthplace Cottage.</p> <h2>Horseshoes & Wagon Wheels</h2> <p>Large double doors made it easy to maneuver horses around for shoeing or to bring in large wagon wheels or plows for repair. Inside the main building you'll find a working forge, along with an anvil, and a rack filled with period tools of the trade.</p> <h2>\"The Brand of Iowa\"</h2> <p>Banging iron, sparking fires, and a stream of customers, often brought Jesse's boys, \"Tad\" and \"Bertie\" across old Penn Street to investigate their father's business. Herbert Hoover wrote in his memoirs, \"My recollection of my father is of necessity dim indeed, but I retain one vivid memento from this time. Playing barefoot around the blacksmith shop, I stepped on a chip of hot iron and carry the brand of Iowa on my foot to this day.\"</p> <h2>Successful Career Cut Short</h2> <p>Success allowed Jesse to buy a larger farm implement store on Main Street in 1878. Here he sold pumps, wagons, barbed wire, and sewing machines. He operated that shop until his death in December 1880. Though he died at age 34, in his short life he had provided an excellent example of what hard work and integrity could achieve. </p>",

Each pair of tongs has a specific purpose and is used depending on the shape of the metal or the angle the blacksmith is working on.</p> <p>The bellows is another important tool. This smithy has a two-stage bellows just behind the forge. A simple pull on the handle hanging above it raises the top section of the bellows. The collapsing weight of the bellows forces air through a pipe directly into the forge and in to the fire. This adds more oxygen, allowing the fire to reach hotter temperatures.</p>",

Since then, the National Park Service has preserved and interpreted the historic structures and landscape of this 187-acre park. In the late 1930's, President Hoover and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, chose this place to celebrate the values they believed helped shape his life.</p> <h2>Commemorative Landscape</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover National Historic Site includes many features of Hoover's boyhood environment that have endured over time and give the park its unique identity as a Presidential birthplace, boyhood home, and memorial. Although much has changed here since Herbert Hoover's birth in 1874, the National Park Service, citizens of West Branch, and the Hoover family have worked to preserve key elements of the past that illuminate the life and times of America's 31st president.</p> <h2>Inspiring A Life Of Service</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover's accomplished and public-spirited life drew inspiration from his birthplace. During your visit immerse yourself in the landscape Hoover and the activities he experienced as a child. His father's craft as a blacksmith, Hoover's religious upbringing, his love of fishing, the education he received-influences Herbert Hoover carried into his adult life and that contributed to his character. You'll also read and hear eloquent accounts of the adversity that touched a Quaker family and shaped the path of a young boy from West Branch who went on to serve his country as President. We hope you will find Herbert Hoover National Historic Site to be an inspiring, accessible educational, and recreational experience for years to come.</p>",

The plainly furnished Friends Meetinghouse, built by the Society of Friends, or Quakers, in 1857, is the physical expression of those values. Now two blocks from its original location, the Herbert Hoover Birthplace Foundation relocated and restored this meetinghouse in 1964.</p> <h2>Silent Waiting</h2> <p>Quakers held two meetings for worship each week. Men sat to the right of the partition, women to the left. The Quakers did not have a paid minister. They did not use music, symbols, or sacraments in their worship. Instead, they practiced \"silent waiting,\" or worshipping in silence as they sat on the rows of long wooden benches.</p> <h2>Moved by the Inward Light</h2> <p>If moved by the \"inward light\", a man or woman could stand and share their insights or prayers. Those known for their inspired messages, like Herbert's mother Hulda, became \"recorded ministers\" and sat on the facing benches with the elders.</p> <h2>Equality Before God</h2> <p>The Quakers strongly believed all people were equal before God. During monthly business meetings the partitions were closed, allowing women a chance at leadership independent of men. Hulda, active in the West Branch meeting, helped conduct revivals, founded and led a young people's prayer meeting, and took an active role in temperance campaigns that aimed to discourage alcohol consumption.</p> <h2>\"Long Hours of Meeting\"</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover described the meetings in his memoirs, \"Those acquainted with the Quaker faith, and who know the primitive furnishings of the Quaker meeting-house, the solemnity of the long hours of meeting awaiting the spirit to move someone, will know the intense repression upon a ten-year-old boy who might not even count his toes. All this may not have been in recreation, but it was strong training in patience.\"</p> <h2>Career of Conscience</h2> <p>Like his mother, Herbert Hoover, learned to put his beliefs into practice, as he demonstrated during decades of leadership. The Quakers' stress on the equal worth of all persons is evident in Hoover's global humanitarian work, his dedication to public service, and his faith in the opportunities afforded by American life.</p>",

With the emphasis on individual worship, the meetinghouse had no pulpit or altar, no crucifixes or stained glass, nor an organ or a choir.</p> <h2>Partitions</h2> <p>Males and females sat on each side of an open partition, to encourage individual worship and full participation for women. The partitions were closed during the monthly meetings while membership business—marriages, deaths, births, new members, transfers, and disownment—was discussed. On the coal burning stoves, women heated soap stones which they used to warm their feet in cold weather.</p> <h2>Infants & Children</h2> <p>Infants and young children sat with their mothers. When infants disturbed the silence of the meeting their mothers took them to the nursery, or “cry room,” attached to the women’s side of the Meetinghouse. </p> <h2>Facing Benches</h2> <p>Recorded ministers sat with elders and other respected members on the facing benches in the front of the building. Hulda Hoover, Herbert’s mother, was a recorded minister. </p> <h2>\"Strong Training in Patience\"</h2> <p>“The long hours of meeting awaiting the spirit to move someone,” Hoover wrote, “may not have been recreation, but it was strong training in patience.” This training put to good use by a man who succeeded in business, fed millions in need, and presided over a nation in the early years of the Great Depression.</p>",

More than 100,000 people lined the funeral procession route from Cedar Rapids to West Branch on that warm fall day. </p> <p>Herbert Hoover wrote of West Branch, \"My grandparents and my parents came here in a covered wagon. In this community they toiled and worshipped God. The most formative years of my boyhood were spent here. My roots are in this soil.\"</p> <h2>Simple Design</h2> <p>Iowa architect William Wagner designed the memorial while working closely with the Hoover family to commemorate his life. The two plainly inscribed ledger stones of Vermont white marble are in keeping with the Quaker ideal of simplicity. Across the curved walkway, the American flag waves in tribute. Did you know that it was Herbert Hoover who signed the congressional resolution making The Star Spangled Banner the national anthem during his Presidency? </p> <h2>View of Simple Beginnings</h2> <p>Beyond the flagpole, on the horizon at the end of the two rows of trees, is a direct view of the white, wood-frame cottage where Herbert Hoover was born. The first President born west of the Mississippi River, Hoover believed that anyone could start from simple beginnings and achieve great things. </p> <h2>Burial of Lou Hoover</h2> <p>The second marble gravestone is for Lou Henry Hoover, the tireless and talented First Lady from Waterloo, Iowa.

When Herbert Hoover was a boy, it was just an unnamed small stream of water trickling through marshy wetlands. Young Herbert and the neighborhood kids took their willow fishing poles about a quarter mile downstream to catch sunfish and catfish in the main creek.</p> <h2>Bridge on Downey Street</h2> <p>In March 1875, the citizens of West Branch petitioned Cedar County to build \"a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-downey-street-bridge.htm\">bridge on Downey Street</a>, near Jesse Hoover's blacksmith shop\" so wagons could get across. Twice constructed out of wood, it was finally rebuilt in 1917 as a steel beam and concrete span.</p> <h2>Flooding</h2> <p>Over time, farmers plowed the rain-absorbing prairie into cultivated fields, and as urban pavement increased rainfall runoff, the creek suffered from too little water in dry seasons and too much water in wet seasons. In 1993, floodwaters nearly reached the foundation of the nearby Friends Meetinghouse where the Hoovers once worshipped.</p> <h2>Erosion</h2> <p>Studies by the National Park Service revealed that floods have cut a channel in the streambed. That means when floodwaters come, soil is carved from the stream banks. This erosion is threatening the park's historic structures, artifacts, and documents. The National Park Service is looking for ways to control the force of the stream and reduce this erosion. These efforts will help prevent the loss of vegetation that supports native wildlife and anchors this protective green space.</p> <h2>Hoover's Legacy of Water Conservation</h2> <p>As Commerce Secretary for President Warren Harding and later as President, Herbert Hoover supported several environmental conservation measures, especially in regard to water resources development and fisheries management. Perhaps these viewpoints got their start in a young boy's memories of sun-dappled streams and the joy of exploring with his childhood friends the waters of Wapsinonoc Creek.</p>",

By 1910 fourteen passenger trains passed through town daily, as did numerous freight trains.</p> <h2>Early Interest in Geology</h2> <p>The railroad tracks east of Downey Street brought something else for a curious and enterprising Bertie Hoover: a fascination with geology. He scoured the gravel of the track bed for agates and fossil corals. In his memoirs Hoover wrote, \"Their fine points came out wonderfully when wet, and you had to lick them with your tongue before each exhibit.\"</p> <h2>Train Depot</h2> <p>The West Branch depot, built in 1871 and which once stood nearby, was the scene of orphaned eleven year old \"Bert\" Hoover's departure for a new and uncertain life in Oregon in 1885, and where Hoover made his triumphant return as the newly nominated Republican candidate for president in 1928.</p> <h2>Rail to Trail</h2> <p>The rail line was abandoned shortly after the Rock Island Railroad declared bankruptcy in 1980.

The one-acre parcel, on the corner of Downey and Cedar streets, had a two-story frame house with two chimneys. Maple trees lined the front yard and a wild crabapple tree grew in back of the spacious four-room home.</p> <h2>The Upwardly Mobile Hoovers</h2> <p>Life was good for the young couple and their three children. At age thirty-three, Jesse Hoover had become a successful businessman. Ready to take on new challenges, he sold his blacksmith shop and bought a farm implement store on Main Street. Like any hard-working husband, Jesse used his improved fortunes to provide for the comforts of his family.</p> <h2>\"Rooms Big Enough to Swing A Cat In\"</h2> <p>In March of 1879, Jesse purchased the House of the Maples at auction for $140. It had, he said, \"rooms big enough to swing a cat in.\" On May 27th of that year, the family moved their belongings into their new home. Their spacious new house had an actual parlor and a modern little oil stove. A four-board whitewashed fence with a swinging picket gate framed the front yard. In the summer, the Hoover children would catch lightning bugs. In the winter, they'd sled down nearby Cook's hill as Hulda watched with her heart in her mouth. It was this house, and not the cottage that would hold the most memories for the Hoover children... both good and bad.</p> <h2>Making Ends Meet After Tragedy</h2> <p>On December 13, 1880, Jesse Hoover died in his upstairs bedroom from rheumatism of the heart. Herbert \"Bertie\" Hoover was only six years old. His mother, Hulda kept the family together by carefully managing the money from Jesse's business holdings and by taking in sewing and an occasional boarder.</p> <h2>Orphaned Children</h2> <p>But death would come to visit the House of the Maples once more. On February 24, 1884, at the age of 35, Hulda Hoover died from typhoid fever. Tad had just turned 13, Bertie was 9, and May was 7. The three children, now orphans, were separated and sent to live with relatives. It would be twelve years before they would live together again, this time in California-2,000 miles from their childhood Iowa home.</p>",

Three years later, he met and married a young woman, who had inherited 100 acres of farmland to the southwest of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/birthplace-cottage.htm\">Hoover birthplace</a>. So Miles sold his drugstore and decided to give farming a try. And as soon as the two-story frame house and barn were built, the new family moved in. Isaac's daughters, Providence and Abbie were around the same age as the Hoover children, and it's likely they played together in this rural playground filled with natural wonders.</p> <h2>Iowa Farms of the Late 1800s</h2> <p>Iowa farmsteads were laid out according to the character of the land. Rolling hills could serve as pasture or as a partial support for buildings like a barn. Where the ground was flat, crops were planted; outbuildings like chicken coops were constructed close to the home, but definitely downwind, to make for a short walk in the winter. And a road was leveled to give the farmer access to railroads and markets where he could sell his harvest.</p> <h2>1880 Census of the Miles Farm</h2> <p>An 1880 census showed that Miles had managed to get 73 acres under cultivation with corn, oats, rye, potatoes, and apples. He also raised 5 milk cows, 5 beef cattle, 55 pigs, and 20 chickens.</p> <h2>More Than Farmers</h2> <p>Farming did provide for Isaac and his family, but in 1882, Isaac became involved with his father Benjamin in the establishment of the Indian Industrial School, a Quaker-inspired school to educate Native American children in the industrial arts. It was during this time, when some of the Osage, Cheyenne, and Arapaho children lived and worked on the Miles Farm, that 8-year old Bert Hoover \"fished and hunted the countryside with them, learned the lore of the woods, and how to make bows and arrows.\" </p>",

By 1920, the well-liked country doctor and Iowa legislator decided to have a new home built for himself. The result was this white, one and a half story wood frame house with large overhanging eaves, an airy L-shaped veranda supported by four Doric columns, and a small inset balcony above the front porch that overlooks Downey Street.</p> <h2>Celebrations & Ice Cream Socials</h2> <p>However, at the turn of the century when Dr. Leech was still living in the Miles house, the empty lot where this home now sits became one of the most popular social centers in West Branch. Here during the hot Midwest summers, Dr. Leech held ice cream socials church groups and 4th of July celebrations for the whole town. His lawn parties grew in popularity when box supper socials to benefit the volunteer fire company became an annual event. The West Branch Times wrote, “All gentlemen are invited to come and buy a box and take supper with your own or someone’s best girl!”</p> <h2>\"A Long Life Of Usefulness\"</h2> <p>Although this home was built many years after <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/heho/historyculture/herbert-hoover.htm\">Herbert Hoover’s</a> childhood, there is still a connection between the physician who practiced medicine in West Branch for 55 years and the young boy who left and became the nation’s 31st President. When Dr. Leech passed away at the age of 91 in 1937, services were held at the West Branch <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/c-e-smith-house.htm\">Methodist Church</a>. Herbert Hoover, ever guided by the understanding that it takes a community to raise a child, sent a personal message of sympathy that was read at the funeral. In it, the former President remembered and praised Dr. Leech’s “long life of usefulness to the community and loyalty to his neighbors and friends.”</p>",

Now they were settling down with a family of their own.</p> <h2>Hoover & Miles Family Ties</h2> <p>There was much visiting back and forth between the Miles and Hoover homes, and the two families became close friends. The short walk on Downey Street often brought the Hoover children, Tad, Bertie, and Mary, together with their cousins for playtime or a shared pot of soup that had spent the day simmering on a wood stove. But their time together was short-lived.</p> <h2>Service as an Indian Agent</h2> <p>In the spring of 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Miles to serve as an agent responsible for the care and education of the Osage and Kaw tribes in the Oklahoma territory. When Laban, Agnes and their children left that summer, they rented their home first to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/methodist-church-site.htm\">Methodist Church</a> for a parsonage, and then to Dr. L.J. Leech, a well-known and respected physician in West Branch.</p> <h2>Adventures in Indian Country</h2> <p>But the ties between the Miles and Hoover families remained strong. Following Jesse Hoover’s death, Laban Miles asked Hulda if his nephew could come to live with them on the Osage reservation. In 1882, eight-year-old Herbert spent eight months there with his aunt, uncle and cousins. For the future President, they were memories that lasted a lifetime.</p>",

She owned the property for the next 48 years. If you’re wondering why the deed was in her name, it might have something to do with the fact that in 1870, Mary had learned some surprising news. Even though she and her husband, William “Billy” Wright had been married for thirteen years, and she’d given him six children, he had never divorced his first wife. When the first Mrs. Wright tracked down her deserting husband, Billy sent her $40 and she agreed to never trouble him again. </p> <h2>Architectural Embellishments</h2> <p>The Wright House features a clapboard-sided front porch with a pyramid-shaped hip roof that’s supported by two short, square columns painted brown like the rest of the home’s trim. This large white house also features a few other architectural embellishments. You might notice the beautiful bay window that faces the street. But can you find the triple-paned piano window? </p> <h2>A West Branch Blacksmith</h2> <p>For a time, Wright owned a blacksmith shop at the southwest corner of Main and Poplar streets. Perhaps the competition from neighbor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jesse-clark-hoover.htm\">Jesse Hoover</a>, Herbert’s dad, was what led Billy to sell his business in 1875 and open a harness and boot shop.</p>",

His father's craft as a blacksmith, Hoover's religious upbringing, his love of fishing, the education he received-influences Herbert Hoover carried into his adult life and that contributed to his character.

Hard work was a core value of the Quaker townsfolk, but so too was education-for both boys and girls. Herbert Hoover's own mother, Hulda had been a teacher in neighboring Muscatine County before she married. Because the Society of Friends raised much of the money for the construction of this one-room schoolhouse, it was also used as the town's first Quaker meetinghouse.</p> <h2>The Growing School</h2> <p>In 1869, after the town built a larger schoolhouse, this building was used as a classroom for the primary department, or youngest grades. Herbert Hoover entered public school in 1880 at age 5 and spent three years in the primary department.

The heritage area region comprises thirty-seven counties with its headquarters in Waterloo, Iowa. The Board of Trustees and SSNHA staff serve jointly as the coordinating entity.<br /> <br /> Silos & Smokestacks National Heritage Area illustrates the cultural history of American agriculture and the shift to large-scale industrialized development of American farms to feed the nation and the world. The fertile region includes a rolling landscape in the central and western portions of Iowa to the hills, bluffs, and steep valleys in the vicinity of the Mississippi River. Centuries of occupation further shaped this landscape. American Indians established villages and agricultural fields along the river corridors for hundreds of years while using fire to manage the prairie uplands for hunting. In the 1700s, European migrants settled rapidly through the region in the mid-nineteenth century. Through technological innovation, expanding capabilities, and hard work, people of diverse backgrounds established themselves upon a vast expanse of farms, turning Northeast Iowa’s fertile lands into one of the most agriculturally productive regions of the nation. Innovative from the beginning, Iowa farmers expanded agricultural production through the application of material, labor, and energy. The growth of agriculture and its impacts is shared throughout the heritage area and continues today as farms grow and diversify. As America rose to become a world leader in food production, agriculture remains deeply rooted in American culture.<br /> <br /> While agriculture has evolved immensely, the soul of Northeast Iowa has not changed. Iowans’ close ties to the land and each other, their strong work ethic, and their determination to face challenges live on in the heritage area’s communities.

Building the bridge over Hoover Creek seems to have been almost simple. The council approved the proposed bridge at a meeting on June 4, 1877. They instructed the street commissioner, Thomas Reeves (also the town marshal) to handle the project with a budget of $75.</p> <p>At the very next meeting, July 17, the Reeves reported on the completed project and what it had cost— $62.94. Fifteen dollars of this amount were credit given to men who worked on the project instead of paying their local taxes in cash. The only itemized expense associated with the bridge was $12.73 paid to Charles Leech for lumber and posts.</p> <p>The finished bridge was 22 feet long, resting on cedar piles driven deep into the creek mud. A basic pony truss along the sides of the bridge deck helped support the structure. <br /> <br /> In 1917 he town rebuilt the bridge, twice constructed out of wood, with a steel beam and concrete span. The National Park Service built a replacement bridge in 2021, part of the reconstruction of Hoover Creek to reduce flooding. The newest bridge attempts to recreate the original appearance and concrete railing of the 1917 bridge. Cedar pilings recovered from the creek during construction may have been the footings for the 1877 bridge.</p>",

It was a gift from the people of Belgium in gratitude for Hoover's famine relief efforts on their behalf during the First World War.</p> <h2>Expressions of Gratitude</h2> <p>After the war, Herbert Hoover was sent many gifts expressing the gratitude of the Belgian people for his humanitarian efforts. Some sent him beautifully embroidered flour sacks, like those on display at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum. Many Belgian children, refugees, and soldiers contributed to a fund to create this work of art.</p> <h2>Placement at the Historic Site</h2> <p>When the Belgians shipped the finished statue to California's Stanford University in 1922. It remained on campus until the President and Mrs. Hoover brought it to West Branch in 1939. They wanted it to be placed in a position where it was contemplating the house, which is why Isis sits in her throne-like chair facing the Birthplace Cottage.</p> <h2>Dedication to Children's Causes</h2> <p>The Statue of Isis represents just one of Hoover's many efforts regarding children's welfare. As President he increased the budget for children's programs. After his presidency, Hoover was chairman of the Boys' Clubs of America for 25 years. He raised money and helped open 500 new chapters. Hoover's global relief work also inspired the creation of UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, a leading advocate for children's welfare and rights around the world.</p> <h2>The Mysterious Goddess</h2> <p>Isis wears a veil, a symbol of the mysteries of life. Her right hand carries the torch of life-its three flames represent the past, present, and future. Her left hand holds the key of life. An ancient Egyptian goddess and an American President are an unlikely pairing. But it provides a powerful visual link between Hoover's childhood and his life's dedication to the welfare of others.</p>",

        "notes": "Tallgrass Prairie Observation Deck\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/000/tallgrass-prairie-observation-deck.htm\n\n<p>The 81 acres of tallgrass prairie reconstructed here offer a glimpse of an Iowa landscape that had almost vanished by the time Herbert Hoover's grandparents moved here in 1854. Prior to the settlement of West Branch, prairie covered 85 percent of Iowa. Trees were scarce until planted; the Hoovers imported lumber from farther north for construction of the president's birthplace. Tall native grasses, sprinkled with brilliantly colored wildflowers once covered these rolling hills for as far as the eye could see.</p> <h2>Valuable Farmland</h2> <p>Iowa's prairies became some of the most valuable farmland in the world. The plowed fields of the Miles Farm characterized the immediate landscape during Hoover's youth. Prairie remnants persisted along the creeks and railroad tracks where Hoover spent many boyhood hours exploring.</p> <h2>Young Bert Hoover: Sod Buster</h2> <p>Hoover enjoyed a keen interest in the natural world and often referred to boyhood experiences: \"I was taken for a summer to live with Uncle Pennington Minthorn in Sioux County, Iowa, where he was breaking in a prairie farm. We lived in a sod house and I was privileged to ride the lead horse of a team which was opening the virgin soil.\"</p> <h2>Lost Resource</h2> <p>The tradeoff is that today less than one percent of prairie land still exists in Hoover's home state. This is one reason the National Park Service restored this historic cultivated field to much of its original splendor. Because their root systems run as deep as the plants are tall, native prairie grasses are well-adapted for controlling runoff and stabilizing areas susceptible to erosion.</p> <h2>Hoover's Legacy of Public Lands Conservation</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover, an avid fisherman and proponent of outdoor recreation, saw the value in conserving natural resources. During his presidency, the size of our national forests expanded by more than two million acres, and the land designated for new national parks and monuments increased by 40 percent. In honor of his conservation achievements and his fondness for the outdoors, this prairie offers a quiet and dignified setting to commemorate the life of the 31st president.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>This prairie offers over two miles of trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and nature study. Trail maps are available from the visitor center or at the Tallgrass Prairie Observation Deck.</p>",

Trail maps are available from the visitor center or the park website.</p> <h3>Grasses</h3> <p>The most abundant prairie grass is big bluestem with some Indian grass, switchgrass, little bluestem, side-oats grama, and Canada wild rye. Botanists call these prairie grasses \"warm-season\" grasses, because they grow abundantly in hot weather. These grasses form their seed heads in late summer and fall.<br /> <br /> Small patches of Virginia wild rye and slough or cord grass may be found in wet parts of the prairie. The prairie includes about five acres of wet meadow. The remaining area is drier upland habitat.</p> <h3>Wildflowers</h3> <p>A colorful array of flowers mixes with the green, purple, and golden hues of native grasses from April until late October. Golden alexanders, Canada anemones, spiderworts, yellow and purple coneflowers, and butterfly milkweeds in spring and early summer. New England asters and numerous species of goldenrods attract monarch butterflies when they peak in late summer and early fall.</p> <h3>Nonnative Species</h3> <p>Numerous other species have appeared by natural reintroduction from outside the park. Nonnative species, including some attractive wildflowers, have escaped into the park as well.<br /> <br /> Nonnative plants and woody vegetation continue to degrade sections of the tallgrass prairie. Land uses surrounding the prairie and the proximity of ornamental plantings contribute to invasions of exotic species. Reed canary grass and shrubs have become abundant along the creek banks and rills of the prairie.<br /> <br /> In areas that are diverse and well-populated with native grasses and forbs, natural competition appears to be sustaining native plants. Treatment with prescribed fire, physical removal, and herbicides, followed by native seed collection and redistribution can help to control invasive and exotic species.</p> <h3>Birds</h3> <p>Herbert Hoover National Historic Site is on the Mississippi flyway, a major bird migration route. Many species rest and take refuge in the park's reconstructed tallgrass prairie and along its quiet stream. Their colors and songs add visible and audible vitality to the park's dignified commemorative setting.<br /> <br /> Park staff and volunteers monitor long-term changes in breeding bird populations to evaluate the quality of habitat the park provides. The presence or absence of grassland birds like sedge wrens, dickcissels, grasshopper sparrows, Henslow's sparrows, bobolinks, and eastern meadowlarks indicate the prairie's overall health. Populations of these species decline as prairies disappear from the landscape. Several species are of continental importance because of their dwindling numbers.</p>",

Since then, the National Park Service has preserved and interpreted the historic structures and landscape of this 187-acre park. In the late 1930's, President Hoover and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, chose this place to celebrate the values they believed helped shape his life.</p> <h2>Commemorative Landscape</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover National Historic Site includes many features of Hoover's boyhood environment that have endured over time and give the park its unique identity as a Presidential birthplace, boyhood home, and memorial. Although much has changed here since Herbert Hoover's birth in 1874, the National Park Service, citizens of West Branch, and the Hoover family have worked to preserve key elements of the past that illuminate the life and times of America's 31st president.</p> <h2>Inspiring A Life Of Service</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover's accomplished and public-spirited life drew inspiration from his birthplace. During your visit immerse yourself in the landscape Hoover and the activities he experienced as a child. His father's craft as a blacksmith, Hoover's religious upbringing, his love of fishing, the education he received-influences Herbert Hoover carried into his adult life and that contributed to his character. You'll also read and hear eloquent accounts of the adversity that touched a Quaker family and shaped the path of a young boy from West Branch who went on to serve his country as President. We hope you will find Herbert Hoover National Historic Site to be an inspiring, accessible educational, and recreational experience for years to come.</p>",

The trail is excellent for families and offers exciting opportunities for rock scrambling. Along the trail are educational signs about local plants and animals. Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, the valley was used by cattle rustlers looking to stay “hidden”. As you hike the trail, look for Cow Rock, a cow-shaped rock formation on a wall overlooking the valley. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9296a7fe-185c-4ce3-b578-0e633a2bc16b}{202}\" paraid=\"335400349\">The trail is considered easy but there are stairs and rock steps at the beginning and ending of the trail. This is a popular hike, and on busy days, the parking lot can fill up quickly. We recommend starting this hike by 9 am during busy weekends and holidays. Hidden Valley Trail has very little shade and no cell service. Before hiking, tell a safety buddy where you are going and when you plan on leaving the park. </p>",

This leads to the fairly regular spacing of individual plants. Two Joshua trees growing near one another are likely the same individual, connected underground through networks of thin roots. Joshua trees store water in their trunks and branches, making them quite heavy during wet years and prone to tipping over or dropping branches.

Driving the full length of the road takes approximately two hours to make the round trip. The road provides access to scenic pullouts, a few hiking trails, and some climbing access routes. In good weather, most passenger vehicles may access the first few miles of the Geology Tour Road. Watch for the sign marking the point beyond which a 4-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended, and turn around there if your vehicle is not capable of handling deep ruts and soft sand. The road is not suitable for campers, trailers, and motor homes.</p> <h3 paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{118}\" paraid=\"63426046\"><strong>Road Info  </strong></h3> <ul> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{176}\" paraid=\"1052701389\">18 miles (29 km) full round trip;</li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{176}\" paraid=\"1052701389\">5 miles (8 km) one way to Paac Kü̱vü̱hü̱’k </li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{176}\" paraid=\"1052701389\">4-wheel drive is recommended; high clearance necessary beyond Paac Kü̱vü̱hü̱’k </li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{176}\" paraid=\"1052701389\">Expect soft sand and steep grades  </li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{176}\" paraid=\"1052701389\">Off-road driving is prohibited  </li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{176}\" paraid=\"1052701389\">Drive slowly and carefully; speed limit 25 mph (40 km/hour)  </li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{176}\" paraid=\"1052701389\">One-way travel after  Paac Kü̱vü̱hü̱’k  </li> </ul> <h3 paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{232}\" paraid=\"555079465\"><strong>Safety Info </strong> </h3> <ul> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{238}\" paraid=\"1575752061\">No food, water, gas, cell phone service or restrooms beyond this point  </li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{238}\" paraid=\"1575752061\">Use caution near abandoned mines — stay out and stay alive  </li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{238}\" paraid=\"1575752061\">Leave wildlife, plants, rocks, and artifacts undisturbed  </li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{238}\" paraid=\"1575752061\">Overnight camping on road is prohibited; backcountry camping by permit only  </li> <li paraeid=\"{1612fa60-a446-4410-baf5-f9355d2d623c}{238}\" paraid=\"1575752061\">Campfires are prohibited </li> </ul>",

The mining rights were originally purchased by Johnny Lang for $1,000. Realizing for safety that he needed more people in such a remote location, Lang brought in three partners before they were ultimately bought out in 1895 by J.D. Ryan, a wealthy rancher from Montana. From 1894 to 1931 the mine produced more than 10,000 ounces of gold and 16,000 ounces of silver (worth approximately $5 million today).<br /> <br /> According to legend, the day shift was producing significantly more than the night shift so Ryan hired a private investigator to figure out what was happening. Upon discovering that Lang was pocketing half the ore for himself, Ryan forced Lang to decide between selling out or going to jail. Ultimately Lang sold his share and moved his prospecting to a nearby canyon.<br /> <br /> In 1905, miners hit a fault and lost the vein of ore forever. Over the next couple of decades the mine changed hands several times and went through long periods of inactivity before ultimately becoming a part of Joshua Tree National Monument in 1936.<br /> <br /> Today, the Lost Horse Mine can be reached on the Lost Horse Mine Loop Trail as part of a four mile out and back hike with 550 feet of elevation or as part of a longer loop for those that want a longer hike. Fences have been placed around the mine for safety, do not try to cross the fence and enter the mine as the area is unstable. Historic structures may seem safe but can easily crumble under a person's weight. Do not be fooled by appearances! Lost Horse Mine is a unique place and an important part of Joshua Tree's history.

Thick soils anchored by lush vegetation covered rolling hills and slopes and water flowed through year-round streams. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{161}\" paraid=\"1862982389\">Present Day: At the end of the Pleistocene, the climate dried out and warmed up. The vegetation that was adapted to a wetter climate died, leaving behind bare slopes that are more vulnerable to erosion. Valley floors filled with sediment, creating the flat plains you see today. These plains are preserved because there isn't enough running water to erode them away. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{177}\" paraid=\"243194751\"><strong>Changing Landscape </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{187}\" paraid=\"1917273038\">Look for the following features to see evidence of an ever-changing landscape.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{193}\" paraid=\"867655576\">Bajada: Find bajadas where alluvial fans merge to form a vast sediment slope at the mouth of canyons. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{203}\" paraid=\"234409128\">Pediment: These sloping bedrock surfaces covered by gravel can be seen along the edges of mountains.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{209}\" paraid=\"469425288\">Dry Wash: Washes transport sediment downhill. The smallest, lightest particles are carried farthest. Desert washes fill with rushing water after rain and monsoons.

A fast-running stream moving down a steep canyon can carry more sand, rocks, and pebbles, but when the water reaches the flat plains, it flows more slowly and can't carry the larger rocks and sand anymore. (Picture how fine silt settles out of a still lake, whereas a rushing river can push along sand, pebbles, and even large rocks.) These sediments accumulate in a fan shape at the mouth of canyons or washes. </p> <p paraeid=\"{c8b25ca6-7d5c-4ee3-8812-23f7bbbe8b2c}{16}\" paraid=\"1705513765\">Bajada: A bajada is where many alluvial fans meet and converge.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c8b25ca6-7d5c-4ee3-8812-23f7bbbe8b2c}{20}\" paraid=\"1585616390\">Pediment: A relatively flat or slightly concave surface of bedrock.  </p>",

Consider driving to the town of Twentynine Palms to enter the park through the North Entrance to save time. There is often a long entrance line at the West Entrance and no line at the North Entrance. This plan will work especially well for those visitors who plan to spend 1-5 hours driving through the park along Park Boulevard and then circle back the way they came making a loop with Park Boulevard and Highway 62.",

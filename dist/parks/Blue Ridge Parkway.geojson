Notable mountains include Peach Bottom Mountain, Mount Rogers, Doughton Mountain, Bald Knob, and Round Top. <br /> <br /> In the farmland below Christmas trees are grown. North Carolina is ranked 2nd in the nation for Christmas tree production. An informational wayside on site explains, \"For thousands of years Native Americans cultivated the fertile valleys of the Blue Ridge region including North Carolina. Employing techniques such as “slash and burn” to clear small areas of forested land and fertilize the soil, the Cherokee raised crops that included the “three sisters” – corn, beans, and squash.<br /> <br /> Upon settling the region, European immigrants quickly adopted many Cherokee crops and techniques alongside the agricultural practices they brought with them. This blending of farming traditions resulted in a distinctive regional agricultural heritage. <br /> <br /> From this overlook, visitors are offered a long-range view of an area of mixed agriculture in the region. Like their ancestors before them, the people of this region continue to cultivate traditional fruits and vegetables, but they have also introduced new crops such as Christmas trees, ornamentals, mushrooms, herbs, and wine grapes.”</p>",

It’s one of only a few loop trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway. At 1.3 miles long, it is the perfect length for a family hike or a leg stretcher after a long drive<br /> <br /> Get everyone out of the car and onto the trail at the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center. It's a nice 1.3-mile ramble through a mixed forest with some unique features along the way. The Visitor Center Loop Trail begins in the back corner of the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center’s parking lot, next to a small stone replica of one of the Parkway’s tunnels. It is a designated <a href=\"https://www.kidsinparks.com/\">Kids in Parks TRACK Trail</a>. Access the trail using the steps and then follow the trail to the left. Orange dots or blazes on the trees mark the trail. Follow the orange blazes and they will return you to the starting point.<br /> <br /> It’s hard not to notice the large oak trees at the start of the trail. This may mean that there was a once a home site here. These trees may have surrounded a house or lined a driveway. During the hike, the trail will lead you through a tunnel. You’ll be crossing underneath the Blue Ridge Parkway! Down the trail, the Mountains-to-Sea Trail will split off towards the Folk Art Center (it is a one way 2.5-mile hike to the Folk Art Center). Further on you’ll walk along a long ridge and then cross the Parkway to return back to the parking area. Use extreme caution as you cross the Parkway road surface. Cars sometimes travel faster than they should and there is an on-ramp intersection near the trail crossing that can cause congestion. Once across the Parkway, there’s a little moist ravine reminiscent of a tiny fern gully. Climb up and you are almost done. All in all, this is a family-friendly nature trail. <p>The Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center Loop Trail is a fairly short, easy walk that is great for people of almost any hiking skills, including families with small children. It has very little change in elevation and is mostly level throughout. It is a good hike after traveling all day.</p>",

But do you know why? The City of Asheville has some of the nation’s most pristine drinking water and it’s all thanks to the protection of the surrounding forests and the responsible actions of visitors like you. Parking only in established paved lots is one way to prevent erosion and keep greasy runoff from entering Asheville’s primary water supply.<br /> <br /> The North Fork Reservoir (historically the Burnett Reservoir), that crystal-blue body of water that can be spotted along the Parkway between Mount Mitchell and Craggy Gardens, is one of two artificial lakes that feed the city’s water system. This 5.8 billion-gallon lake serves as the primary drinking water source for nearly 125,000 customers both inside and outside of the city limits — including Asheville’s beloved food and beverage industries.<br /> <br /> According to the Conservation Trust for North Carolina, who the city designated to hold a conservation easement on the land, “the Asheville watershed hosts eleven plant species and nine animal species considered endangered, threatened, or significantly rare.” This easement not only protects the water quality and forest health of the surrounding area, it also protects the scenic vistas that make the Parkway famous!</p>",

This section of the trail is challenging. Along the hike there are some nice examples of original stonework from when George Vanderbilt constructed the trail in the 1890's to connect the Biltmore Estate to his hunting lodge at Buck Spring.<br /> <br /> This lesser visited parking area is mainly used as a rest stop, trail access, and lunch spot. The grassy area between the parking lot and the Parkway is a nice place to spread a picnic blanket and relax a while.<br /> <br /> Nearby Beaver Dam Creek flows north from the gap to the French Broad River. In early history before settlement, beavers were abundant in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Early explorers noted that beavers and their dams were prevalent. Beavers alter the landscape freely to meet their habitat needs, creating ponds and wetlands that also met the needs of other wildlife.<br /> <br /> Settlers and fur trappers came after the explorers and removed millions of beavers for their luxurious fur. The important wetlands and ponds beavers had created disappeared, as well as the wildlife that used them. Unregulated trapping caused their complete disappearance in the late 1890’s. From the 1930’s to the 1950’s beavers were reintroduced into many areas in North Carolina. In the late 1980’s they began to re-colonize rivers and streams along the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br /> <br /> Managing a major scenic motor road for practically year-round use takes unique management skills. Sharing the roadsides, creeks, culverts, and drains with beavers can be an effort. Their innate behavior is to clog culverts, block spillways, dam streams, and divert water which can cause hazards for drivers. However, they also create essential habitat for a variety of wildlife along the Parkway and beyond, which increases biological diversity. The Parkway welcomes the beaver and recognizes the balancing act required to manage this important species.<br /> <br /> Visit Beaver Dam Gap Overlook, reflect on the Blue Ridge Parkway’s ecological significance, sample the Mountains-to-Sea Trail with a quick hike, have a picnic, and enjoy a relaxing moment on the Blue Ridge Parkway.</p>",

Boasting views of Mount Pisgah and the surrounding valleys, this was the ideal location for George Vanderbilt to build his summer hunting lodge.<br /> <br /> The term “hunting lodge” conjures up images of rough-and-rustic living. Buck Spring Lodge was anything but. Designed by the same company that had just completed the Biltmore Estate, Vanderbilt’s summer getaway was a grand affair. Made of rot-resistant American chestnut, it was inspired by the Adirondack camps of the day. Not only was the Main Lodge two levels with several rooms, it had a covered walkway to the adjacent Midway Cottage and the separate Dining-Kitchen building. Staff had their own quarters near the entrance. There was an orchard, beehives, livestock, a garden, and the grounds were kept trim by an entire team. An entire team of sheep, that is!<br /> <br /> Of course, if you’re going to be entertaining guests such as the Secretary of War, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of the Interior like Vanderbilt did, then your lodge has to be comfortable as well as manicured. By 1912, comfort had come in the forms of electricity, indoor plumbing and hot water, telephone service, tennis and croquet courts, and even an ice house.<br /> <br /> Vanderbilt stocked the forests surrounding Buck Spring with deer, bear, and turkey. The streams were stocked with fish. Some of their descendants are still roaming around today! After a day’s hunting, hiking, or playing on the tennis court, guests would return to freshen up and don formal attire for dinner.<br /> <br /> There were several ways to get to the lodge, including riding horseback from the Biltmore Estate in Asheville on the Shut-In Trail. Named “Shut-In” for the enclosed feeling of the surrounding rhododendrons, it traveled roughly 16 miles from the French Broad River along the ridge line to the lodge. Today, it has been incorporated into the Mountains-to-Sea Trail. But riding horseback isn’t always the most comfortable way to travel. Starting in 1910, guests with automobiles could drive up in style, using a single lane road that later became NC 151.<br /> <br /> After George Vanderbilt’s death in 1914, his wife Edith would continue to use Buck Spring Lodge as a gathering place for family until her own passing in 1958. Soon after, the lodge was sold to the State of North Carolina. The State then transferred the land to the U.S. Department of Interior so that construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway could continue through the area.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the buildings of Buck Spring Lodge were removed or knocked down. While the National Park Service might have preferred to keep the lodge intact, there were several reasons why this was impossible, ranging from the cost of upkeep and renovations to the inability to staff the lodge. The remaining buildings were demolished in 1961.<br /> <br /> Today you can walk the grounds of the old lodge site and imagine what it would have been like to live like the Vanderbilts did. More than a hundred years later, you can still experience the fantastic views, cool summer breezes, and stunning fall colors. An information sign highlights the area's history and gives a site map. Access to the lodge is a short walk from the Buck Spring Gap Overlook or a 1.1 mile hike from the Pisgah Inn.</p>",

This canal system connected the interior of Virginia with international shipping.</p> <p>The trail begins at the James River Visitor Center and gently slopes down to the foot bridge crossing the river before descending the 39 stairs to the south river bank. From there, the trail follows the bridge to the tow path/prism then downstream to Lock #7 with its corresponding waste weir and slackwater connection to the river.<br /> <br /> Four exhibits here relate the history of the lock and how it works. The trail then follows the river back to the stairwell for your return to the visitor center. Be sure to peer upstream to view the James River Water Gap which is one of the few places that rivers are able to flow through the mountains, which is exactly what Washington saw for his proposed canal route.<br /> <br /> The James River and Kanwaha Canal was a major transportation route serving to connect the Atlantic Ocean with the interior of Virginia during the 1800s. The canal operated from 1821 to 1877 ferrying finished goods to the interior inhabitants of Virginia and carrying raw materials downstream to be sold at markets.</p>",

Chestnut Cove Overlook offers a mix of mature pines and mixed hardwoods in the forest canopy with one massive red maple tree at center stage. A variety of tall shrubs, vines, and small trees are growing down the hillside, including mountain laurel, blueberry, blackberry, sassafras, sumac, wildflowers, and hardwood sprouts (including American chestnut).<br /> <br /> This rich mix of vegetative cover makes it great wildlife habitat, especially for birds. Look and listen for eastern towhee, black-throated green warblers, indigo buntings, tufted titmouse, red-eyed vireo, and Carolina chickadee. A large variety of birds can be evident at this overlook (especially in summer) due to the mature trees, the mixed shrub layer, and the edge where the two habitats come together. Berries, nuts, and fruits from these plants are also valuable to small and large mammals.<br /> <br /> The view is east across the French Broad River Valley. Ball Mountain can be seen in the foreground with Little Pisgah, Bearwallow, Bank, High Top, and Couch Mountains visible in the distance on a clear day.<br /> <br /> Access to the Mountains-to-Sea Trail is across the Parkway from the overlook.</p>",

Crabtree Falls Recreation Area was previously named Crabtree Meadows because of the crabapple trees and the open areas that were evident on the site. Few of the crabapple trees remain, and in 2010 the recreation area was renamed Crabtree Falls to emphasize the spectacular waterfall. Crabtree Falls is the tallest single waterfall along the Blue Ridge Parkway and is a scenic feature that interests hikers during every season.</p> <p>In 1863, small-scale logging began in the North Carolina mountains, followed by larger logging operations and the construction of a logging railroad. Some of the loggers brought their families and built cabins in the vicinity, and a small community coalesced around the area near Crabtree Falls. Soon a grist mill, woodworking shop, blacksmith shop, store, Baptist church/schoolhouse, and commissary were built. Logging continued at Crabtree Falls until the 1930s, when much of the land was acquired by the U.S. Forest Service.</p> <p>Crabtree Falls was one of the areas identified early on as a desirable place for a recreation area by Stanley Abbott, landscape architect of the Blue Ridge Parkway. In 1936, Abbott noted that Crabtree Falls was “an oasis of restful quiet and charm in the midst of some of the most dramatic scenery in North Carolina.” In 1941, the U.S. Forest Service agreed to transfer 160 acres to the National Park Service, with more land acquired later. When the first picnic area and trail system were completed, the Parkway opened the area for public use in 1948. The campground opened in 1954 and proved so popular that a two-week limit on camping had to be imposed. A new 82-site picnic area on the east side of the parkway opened in 1960.</p>",

The name “Looking Glass” comes from its mirror-like appearance when water freezes on its surface and glistens in the sunlight.<br /> <br /> In 1888, George and Edith Vanderbilt of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville purchased the land you see here. During this time, the southern Appalachian Mountains were in the midst of a major logging boom.<br /> <br /> At the time there were no land management or reforestation efforts in place and degradation of the land was starting to become apparent. The Vanderbilt’s saw a need to take action and asked Dr. Carl A. Schenck, a forestry educator from Germany, to help. Schenck founded America's first forestry school, The Biltmore Forest School, now the home of the Forest Service's Cradle of Forestry historical site. Schenck taught a scientific, hands-on approach to forest management that would keep logging profitable while also being sustainable.<br /> <br /> When George Vanderbilt died in 1914, Edith sold 87,000 acres of the land to the U.S. Forest Service, fulfilling her husband's wishes to help create the Pisgah National Forest.<br /> <br /> You can visit the <a href=\"https://cradleofforestry.com/\">Cradle of Forestry</a> to learn more about the Vanderbilt's legacy.

A rustic, wooden shelter greets visitors as they complete their climb. It provides a shady spot to rest or cover from a passing rainstorm. The trail shelter serves as the gateway to Craggy Bald, a beautiful open meadow with expansive views, colorful blooming flowers, and delicious blueberries in late summer. But the trail shelter is also a connector to our past—a relic that pre-dates the Parkway and harkens back to a difficult time in our history.<br /> <br /> The Great Depression was one of the worst economic periods in world history. President Franklin D. Roosevelt created a variety of public work relief programs to provide jobs during this terrible economic time. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was one of the most popular of these “New Deal” programs and focused on conservation projects on public lands. All told, 3 million young men participated in the CCC across the United States and they planted 3 billion trees, constructed trails, campgrounds, picnic areas, and developed landscape projects.<br /> <br /> Below Craggy Gardens to the west there was a CCC camp in Dillingham. In 1935 they built a road and trail through national forest land to access Craggy Gardens. Two years later, they added a picnic area and two shelters. The area became so popular that it hosted a Rhododendron Festival—before the Parkway even existed! When the Craggy Gardens section of the Parkway opened in 1950, the property transferred from the U.S. Forest Service to the National Park Service and most of the vehicle traffic shifted to the Parkway from Asheville. <br /> <br /> But the legacy of the CCC remains at Craggy Gardens. The Stoney Fork Forest Service Road, the picnic area, the trail to the bald, and the trail shelter are all still there. A visitor to the trail shelter today can marvel at the craftsmanship and longevity of this 80+ year old structure. It resembles a large barn with chestnut and oak posts supporting rafters, beams, and purlins carrying a shake roof. It is a testament to the work of an innovative program and it reflects the resiliency of the people and the times.<br /> <br /> The trail shelter is accessed by the Craggy Gardens Trail. From the Craggy Gardens Visitor Center the shelter is a 0.3-mile moderate hike. From the Craggy Gardens Picnic Area, it is a 0.5-mile moderate hike.</p>",

Town Mountain Road (NC 694) connects downtown Asheville with the Blue Ridge Parkway at the gap. The gap offers trail access for hikers and is used as a rest spot by bicyclists.<br /> <br /> A small gravel parking area and roadside parking are available for hikers just off the Blue Ridge Parkway on the side road perpendicular to the Parkway. A set of wooden steps provide access to the Mountains-to Sea Trail heading north. The trail heading south can be found by walking toward the large white and orange gates at the road entrance and crossing the Parkway. The southern trailhead is a small path to the left of the guardrail. It heads down the hill. White circular dots (blazes) mark the trail at intervals along the way.<br /> <br /> The Mountains-to-Sea Trail is a 1,200-mile trail that spans the State of North Carolina from the Great Smoky Mountains to the Atlantic coast. It runs parallel to the Blue Ridge Parkway for many miles. Due to its proximity to Asheville, the Craven Gap section is well-used. You will encounter other hikers and sometimes their dogs on this section of trail. As a reminder, the trail is located in a unit of the National Park Service and dogs are required to be on a leash.<br /> <br /> Many trail users run or walk these sections (north or south) for the mileage or exercise. They gain some elevation, so are somewhat challenging, and are “out and back” in nature. There are rocks and roots in the trail, so hiking poles may be helpful. Mountain views are only available during the winter. Vehicle noise can be heard from the Parkway below. Spring and summer wildflowers along this trail are stunning and plentiful when they are in bloom. Fall color in this forest is beautiful due to the variety of deciduous trees.<br /> <br /> Bears are frequently seen in vicinity of Craven Gap. Sing, talk, or make noise as you hike so they know that you are there. If you see a bear, clap your hands and try to look big. Do not run away. Back away slowly.  <br /> <br /> Popular hike destinations from Craven Gap:</p> <ul> <li>North – Craven Gap to Ox Creek Road (1.8 mile, one way)</li> <li>South – Craven Gap to Haw Creek Valley Overlook (2.9 miles, one way)</li> </ul>",

Unfortunately, that’s not the case. While much of the southern end of the Parkway is adjacent to Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests, the National Park Service also relies on a patchwork of partnerships, private citizens, and nonprofit groups to make the views possible.<br /> <br /> With its long-range views towards the distant mountain ranges and valley below, Fork Ridge Overlook is a great example of what we can achieve when we work together. This area is close to a housing subdivision and was at risk of development. Thankfully, the Conservation Trust for North Carolina, with the help of private landowners and philanthropists, was able to purchase and protect 81 acres adjacent to the Parkway that can be seen from this overlook. <br /> <br /> Without the purchase, “the land might have become a blight of development amid the forested views from the Parkway,” according to Executive Director Reid Wilson. Now it is part of a growing stretch of protected land that extends across the Plott Balsam Range toward Waterrock Knob.<br /> <br /> So, the next time you’re traveling along the Parkway, take a moment to appreciate the views and the people who help protect them.<br /> <br /> The Mountains-to-Sea Trail can be accessed across the Parkway from this overlook.</p>",

The topography of the surrounding mountains and valleys allowed hunters to relax by the camp fire, while still following the sounds of their dogs. The high hills echoed back the distinct voices of each hound, signaling to their owners who was closest to the catch!<br /> <br /> Families have also frequented the area simply to view the wonderful scenery. On a clear day you can see up to 50 miles. Sitting at 2,805 feet, this overlook offers views of<em> (from left to the right) </em>Fisher Peak, Slate Mountain, Round Peak, Sauratown Mountains (Hanging Rock & Pilot Mountain), Skull Camp Mountain, and Raccoon Mountain. During late spring the mountain tops come alive in a sea of green, and in fall burst with bright yellows and reds. On foggy days During late spring the mountain tops come alive in a sea of green, and in fall burst with bright yellows and reds.

It is one of the few rivers that flows north. The Cherokee called it Agiqua or \"Long Man”, an apt name as the entire watershed contains over 4,000 miles of rivers and streams. Its modern name came from early European settlers. Of the two broad (wide) rivers in this area, this one flowed into French territory in Tennessee. Hence the French Broad River was named!<br /> <br /> This overlook is on the south side of Asheville, close to the North Carolina Arboretum and NC 191. It is located on the east side of the Blue Ridge Parkway (Milepost 393.8) and provides views of the French Broad River. An interpretive sign provides an overview of area’s history in the 1800’s. This large parking area is perfect if you are thinking about hiking the section of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail called the Shut-In Trail. You can pick up the trail on the nearby Parkway on-ramp. The French Broad Overlook is also a great spot for bicyclists heading south towards Mount Pisgah to start their ride.<br /> <br /> Whether you spend a few minutes or a few hours, the French Broad Overlook provides an interesting glimpse into the rich history of this area.</p>",

Constructed in the 1940s as a lookout for land management agencies like the U.S. Forest Service, this tower was a home-away-from-home for fire watchers for nearly a half-century.<br /> <br /> Due to the rugged and rural terrain, lookouts would often spend days at a time in the tower’s cabin, subsisting on basic supplies and scanning the sky for wisps of smoke. But time—and technology—marches on. Airplanes, sophisticated cameras, infrared images, and even drones have rendered most hired lookouts, and the towers they inhabit, obsolete. Frying Pan Fire Tower was decommissioned in the 1990s, though a recent restoration means that visitors can still safely visit this historic structure today.<br /> <br /> This popular 1.5-mile hike begins at the dirt pull-off located on Forest Service Road 450. Please do not block the gate. Rumored to have been named by mountain herders for a communal frying pan that hung in a nearby tree, Frying Pan Mountain rises 5,340 above sea level. The historic steel fire tower adds another 70 feet to the total. Although the path climbs steadily for nearly a mile, the wide gravel roadbed and abundant wildflowers make for pleasant hike to the top at any time of year. From the summit, visitors can take in sweeping views of the surrounding mountains and valleys below.<br /> <br /> For a longer hike, begin at Mount Pisgah Campground, which adds another two miles to the total.</p>",

Seeing the waterfall requires a bit of luck, however, as this ephemeral falls only flows after periods of rain. During drier weather it will slow to a trickle or even dry up completely. So plan your visit after a rainy day, if you have that option!<br /> <br /> At the base of the waterfall is an old mica mine. Miners called the flaky, shiny mineral they mined “glass,” hence the name Glassmine Falls. There were many “glass mines” that operated in western North Carolina in the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> Today the waterfall and surrounding land is privately owned as part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/asheville-watershed.htm#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Conservation%20Trust,the%20water%20quality%20and%20forest\">Asheville watershed</a>. There is no public access to the waterfall. But the view from the overlook after a good rain is impressive—even better if you bring a pair of binoculars. And listen closely, you may even hear the distant sounds of this roaring cascade as it plummets over the steep cliff. The sign at the overlook says the falls is over 800 feet high. That seems to be extremely generous—most would estimate around 200 feet—but Glassmine Falls is a magnificent sight, nonetheless. A short path from the overlook leads to another viewing area.

Formed about 300 million years ago, the mountain soars to an elevation of 5,939. The original Cherokee name for the mountain was “Tanawha,” meaning a fabulous eagle. It was later named “Grandfather” by early European settlers who saw the face of an old man on one of the west facing cliffs.<br /> <br /> If you are traveling from the south, this will be your introduction to this mountain, as you will follow it for the next 7 miles. If arriving from the north, you will already be acquainted with the beauty of Grandfather Mountain.<br /> <br /> Visitors to Grandfather Mountain are easily confused by the division of the mountain between three different entities. The Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation cares for about 1/3 of the mountain. They operate a nature museum and the Mile High Swinging Bridge which spans 80 foot chasm at one mile in elevation. The entrance to their enterprise is on Hwy 221S, 1.5 miles north of this overlook and does have an entrance fee. <br /> <br /> The wild, undeveloped portions of the mountain are owned by the State of North Carolina and operate as Grandfather Mountain State Park. The park offers spectacular hiking and backpacking, but is known for its severe weather and challenging terrain--with 12 miles of trails that scramble along cliffs and up ladders. There is no charge to access the trails within the state park from Highway 105 and or from the parkway, at Boone Fork Parking Area at Milepost 299.9, 7 miles north of here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Blue Ridge Parkway traverses Grandfather Mountain at a lower elevation.

The name comes from an old mica mine that was located below the overlook. It operated from the mid-1800’s until the 1920’s.<br /> <br /> Two different hiking options await you. Walk up behind the picnic table and the trail forks to the left. It traverses north 1.7-miles to Licklog Ridge Overlook. This leisurely walk takes you from the Grassy Ridge Mine Overlook parking area to the Licklog Ridge Overlook and returns for a total of 3.4 miles. A second option is to go straight at the trailhead fork where the trail bends to the right to follow the Mountains-to-Sea Trail south. On this path you can walk as far as you like and return the same way.<br /> <br /> This part of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail does not stray far from the Parkway but still gives the illusion of being on an “off the grid” walk. The terrain is up and down, but not really steep for long periods. Parts of the trail are rocky, so sturdy footwear is necessary.<br /> <br /> The trail provides a pleasant hike into the remnants of a high elevation oak forest that are found in spots along the parkway. Awaiting you is an overstory of oak and birch that was logged several years ago, but still has some older trees remaining. This walk is flush with spring and summer wildflowers and has fall color well into October. High elevation birds you may spot in summer include: veery, rose-breasted grosbeak, blue-headed vireo, dark-eyed junco, winter wren, scarlet tanager, black-and-white warbler, least flycatcher and golden-crowned kinglet.<br /> <br /> This section of the Mountains-to Sea Trail is a pleasant foray into the high elevation forests not far from the Parkway itself that still puts you in a relatively secluded, easy to moderate hiking situation.</p>",

This is a very popular area, so be prepared to share the trail with others.<br /> <br /> Graveyard Fields is an extremely popular hiking area. Easy trail access is from the Graveyard Fields Overlook at Milepost 418.8 of the Blue Ridge Parkway, but the property is managed by Pisgah National Forest. Finding a parking spot on a weekend or during a busy time of year requires an early start to the day, a great deal of patience, or the willingness to park a significant distance away and walk on the road to the overlook. Signs on the roadsides clearly mark where motorists can and cannot park. Cars attempting to park in restricted areas have rolled over the edge down a steep embankment! Please do not put yourself or your family in danger. If the parking lot is full, visit one of the other hiking areas available along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Be sure to investigate your options before you embark on your journey.<br /> <br /> A sign at Graveyard Fields explains one theory behind its strange name. Many years ago, a windstorm uprooted the forest, leaving behind stumps that gave the area the appearance of a graveyard. Other theories include that logging in the early 20th century, prior to the area being under management of the US Forest Service, left tree stumps covered in moss resembling gravestones. Later, the Graveyard Fields area burned, destroying the stumps.<br /> <br /> The headwaters of the Yellowstone Prong, a tributary of the Pigeon River, originate in the mile-high valley. The two waterfalls in the Graveyard Fields area are accessible from the trailhead near the vault toilets in the overlook on the Parkway. The trail descends steps that give way to an asphalt path, necessary due to the amount of use the area receives. Many parts of the trail beyond the asphalt portion have been worn into deep ruts which are often muddy due to the frequency of precipitation. A trail map is available in the overlook parking lot. Familiarize yourself with the general loop trail prior to hiking. “Social trails” (or illegal trails) have been created over the years, which can make navigating confusing. Please do not compound this problem by going off the established trails. The 1.2-mile loop trail is rated as easy overall, however the “spur” trails to the waterfalls are steep and add additional mileage to the hike. Climbing on and near waterfalls is dangerous. Rocks near waterfalls are notoriously slippery.<br /> <br /> If you don't mind crowds, Graveyard Fields is an appealing hiking area for a variety of reasons. The Graveyard Fields Loop Trail is a reasonable hiking distance for families, including children, and includes waterfalls. It offers a variety of different plants, shrubs, and trees, as well as bird and wildlife diversity for natural history buffs. The trail connects to other trails in the valley and beyond, allowing further exploration for those who want a longer hike.<br /> <br /> Camping is not allowed in the Graveyard Fields area. During the season, the nearest National Park Service campground is located at Mount Pisgah. Dispersed camping is allowed nearby at Black Balsam and in the Shining Rock Wilderness. Contact <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=48260&actid=34\">Pisgah National Forest</a> for camping information and regulations.

This 9-mile paved spur road just 11 miles from the south end of the Blue Ridge Parkway has overlooks with gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains and valleys below, hiking trails, picnic grounds, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/watch-elk-heintooga-spur.htm\">opportunities to see elk</a>.<br /> <br /> For the first four miles you are within the Blue Ridge Parkway boundary. The road leads drivers along the mountain's crest with scenic overlooks on both sides of the road. To the left are the Smokies and peaks like Clingmans Dome and Mount Le Conte. To the right, the Plott Balsam Range and the Parkway's route is your view.<br /> <br /> As you reach Black Camp Gap you will leave the Parkway and enter the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A large wooden sign will welcome you and there is an adjacent parking area. A short walk from the parking area leads to a Masonic stone monument completed in 1938. It was built when the park was created and contains rocks from most states and different places around the world. There are both stone steps and an accessible paved ramp that take you to the monument. The stone structure is protected under a wooden pavilion and surrounded by a fence. You can still get close enough to see and read the stones.<br /> <br /> Next along the road is a small parking area on your left for Flat Creek Trail. This is a 5.2-mile round trip, out and back hike that is rated moderate. This trail brings you to the end of Heintooga Spur Road where the picnic area and bathrooms are.<br /> <br /> Carry on a few more miles and you come to Poll’s Gap. Here there is access to three remote hiking trails into the Smoky Mountains. These are Hemphill Bald Trail, Rough Fork Trail and Poll's Gap Trail. A few more miles of driving will bring you to Balsam Mountain Campground, the highest campground in the Smokies. Balsam has 46 campsites, fire pit grills, cold running water, bathrooms, and is a great spot for tents. For more information about hiking and camping in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, visit www.nps.gov/grsm.<br /> <br /> Soon you will reach the end of Heintooga Spur Road at 9 miles in. There is a lovely, shaded picnic area with plenty of spaced out picnic tables. There are restrooms here as well. Near the picnic area you will see the end of the Flat Creek hiking trail mentioned earlier. If you walk down this trail just a short way you will come to the Heintooga Overlook with two benches to relax and enjoy the view of the Great Smoky Mountains.<br /> <br /> For a more adventurous drive, you can continue to Heintooga-Round Bottom Road, marked by a large brown sign where the pavement ends. This is a narrow, gravel, one-lane, mountain road and will bring you out near the Qualla Cherokee Indian Boundary. This route is not suitable for RV’s or trailers, is 14 miles and one way only.</p>",

This farm has been preserved as it may have looked during the 1890s. Farm highlights include a demonstration garden, log home, chicken house, root cellar, barn, hog pen, spring house, and rail fencing surrounded by forest. This farm existed to feed the family throughout the year and provide for all of their needs. Food was grown in the fields, stored in the outbuildings, prepared and eaten in the cabin. Surplus crops could be bartered, or sold, for cash money in order to obtain things that could not be grown or gathered around the farm. </p> <p>On farms like this one, you can visit the places where a generation learned some tough lessons in life: preservation, restraint, conservation, sustainability, the value of working smart, living with nature and many, many others. It may seem difficult to relate to a world that on the surface appears so vastly different than our own, considering the families lived without electricity, indoor plumbing, motorized vehicles, interstate highway systems, cell phones, or the internet. If you scratch the surface a bit however, you will find that we have many similarities with these families. They ate much of the same foods that we do today. They wanted similar things for their children: to grow up in a healthy, safe environment learning how to raise their own families in the world. They liked to shop for new innovations and things to improve their lives, while living frugally. In short, they too laughed, cried, celebrated, debated, and lived life to the fullest they could just like we do today.</p> <p>Seasonally, in the summer and fall, rangers and volunteers can be found at the farm site to answer questions and, ocassionally, demonstrating 19th century Appalachian life. </p> <p> </p>",

Price planned to build a hotel retreat to be used primarily by insurance agents during their vacation periods. He also had plans to dam a stream on the property to create a lake stocked with rainbow trout. The resort, Price felt, would give a vacation spot to the agents and still make it possible to keep contact with the home office. <br /> <br /> On October 25, 1946, at 78 years of age, Julian Price was killed in an automobile accident while traveling from Greensboro to Blowing Rock. Julian Price Memorial Park was donated to the National Park Service by the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company in 1949. </p> <p paraeid=\"{63be47ca-958b-4e18-8892-951d65b3468b}{3}\" paraid=\"742371624\">Almost the entirety of the construction and development of Julian Price Park, including the Blue Ridge Parkway and associated facilities within the park boundaries, took place between 1955-1964. By the end of 1964, all the campground loops, the amphitheater, the picnic area, and their associated amenities were finished and operating. The park development was closely associated with the Mission 66 program, a federally sponsored program intended to improve visitor services within the National Park system. </p>",

If they get too little salt, they try to fulfill their need by eating rocks, dirt, and wood to satisfy their cravings.<br /> <br /> The overlook itself displays a narrow view of gently rolling mountains framed by close growing trees and shrubs. A picnic table makes for a pleasant lunch spot. The Mountains-to-Sea Trail can be accessed across the Parkway from the overlook.

The cabin was donated by Mr. K.R. Matthews in 1956 and subsequently moved to its current site, which is the same general location where the home of Ed and Lizzie Mabry. That home was built out of chestnut and using the sawmill on site.

These long-distance travelers are often seen in September and October along the high elevation meadows of the Blue Ridge Parkway. <br /> <br /> The main text on the wayside exhibit at the overlook says:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Orange-brown, black-striped monarchs are the only butterflies that migrate. On their southward flight in September, large numbers cross the mountains at several points in this area. Tunnel Gap is a popular place for viewing this striking event.<br /> <br /> Many monarchs that pass here spend the winter on the Florida panhandle; some may journey as far a central Mexico. In spring they head north, breeding along the way and depositing their eggs on milkweed. During the slower spring migration, monarchs travel in smaller groups.<br /> <br /> No single monarch makes the entire round trip. Offspring that hatch along the northward route either remain where they are born or journey on to the northern starting point.<br /> <br /> Sudden storms and migrating hawks pose the greatest threats to migrating monarchs.</em></p> <div> </div> </blockquote>",

Its unusual name is a biblical reference—in Deuteronomy, the Lord ordered Moses to the top of Mount Pisgah to reveal the “Promised Land” to the tribes of Israel.  Legend credits the naming to Rev. James Hall, a Scotch-Irish Presbyterian minister who was part of Rutherford's 1776 expedition into the Cherokee Nation.<br /> <br /> This special place continues to inspire visitors today, many who return year after year. The area is often bathed in clouds and fog and produces beautiful displays of wildflowers throughout the summer season. Come fall, the vibrant reds, yellows, and oranges of the changing leaves can make Mount Pisgah a vivid kaleidoscopic of color.

It provides long range views to the south and southeast of North Cove, Peppers Creek Valley, Dobson Knob, and distant views of Wolf Pen, Hickory Nut Mountain, Sugarloaf, Piney Mountain, Graveyard Mountain and more. Close up views of the Historic Orchard at Altapass face west from the overlook.<br /> <br /> The overlook has two picnic tables and parking for 15 cars. A wayside exhibit tells the history of the original Crest of the Blue Ridge Highway. Joseph Hyde Pratt, a North Carolina State Geologist, first proposed the scenic highway in 1906. His proposal anticipated the growth of the automobile industry and the subsequent boom it would bring in tourists flocking to see the natural beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Eight miles of the scenic highway were built from this location running north towards Linville Falls, but the outbreak of World War I brought the construction to an end. The idea of a scenic highway would be revived more than a decade later in the 1930s—becoming today’s Blue Ridge Parkway. <br /> <br /> The wayside has a historic photograph of a group of workmen and two teams of mules grading the roadbed for the Crest of the Blue Ridge Highway in 1913. It also has a map of the proposed route of the road beginning in Marion, Virginia running through Western North Carolina and ending at Tullulah Falls, Georgia.<br /> <br /> Railroad enthusiasts prize the North Cove Overlook because it provides views of the trains ascending from the valley below, up the slopes of the Blue Ridge mountains on the railroad engineering marvel known as \"The Loops.\"  Constructing a railroad with a sufficiently low grade to cross the steep slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains was a daunting task. Construction began in 1905 and was completed in 1908. It is 13.5 miles long, contains 18 tunnels and many switchback curves that give “The Loops” its name. It required the labor of 4,000 workmen, most of whom were immigrants from Italy, Russia and Germany. Accidents and violence are believed to have cost more than 200 of these workers their lives.<br /> <br /> Once completed the railroad forever changed the lives of the mountain families as timber and mining companies offering steady wages flocked to the area. Trains pass just below the Orchard at Altapass and disappear into a tunnel below McKinney Gap to emerge on the other side of the Blue Ridge. The Loops are best viewed after the leaves fall from the trees. <br /> <br /> The overlook also provides views to the west of the Historic Orchard at Altapass. The Orchard was created in 1908 by the Clinchfield Railroad and has been in operation for well over a century. It was considered to be an ideal location for an orchard because it could take advantage of the largely frost-free thermal layer found on the slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  <br /> <br /> McKinney Gap is named for Charles McKinney (1780-1852) who lived here with his very large family in the 1800s.",

Enjoy a boating trip around a 47-acre mountain lake or take a stroll along the water's edge.<br /> <br /> The hiking TRACK Trail is located on a portion of the Price Lake Trail beginning at the boat rental dock and ending at the beaver dam overlook. The hiking TRACK Trail is a 1-mile walk (2 miles round-trip). The entire Price Lake Trail is a 2.7-mile loop.<br /> <br /> The paddling TRACK Trail on Price Lake is 2-miles round-trip if you follow the perimeter of the 47-acre lake. Canoes, kayaks and paddleboards can be rented seasonally for use on Price Lake; however, motorized boats and swimming are not allowed. You may also bring your own watercraft. For your safety, you are required to wear a flotation device.<br /> <br /> Whether hiking or boating, Julian Price Lake is a beautiful spot. The hiking trail is a hard-packed dirt trail in most areas surrounded by rhododendron. The trail weaves in and out along the shore of the lake providing several access points to the clear sparkling water. Wooden boardwalks and foot bridges help with areas where the path traverses areas of beaver activity. Beaver gnawed tree stumps are commonly spotted along the trail, along with wood ducks floating on the lake.<br /> <br /> By water, boaters can circle the 47-acre lake on gentle rocking waters sliding up into coves and exploring streams that feed the lake with cold water. The openness of the lake is a bright sparkling landscape on a sunny day.",

        "notes": "Puckett Cabin\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/puckett-cabin.htm\n\n<p>Born around 1837, “Aunt Orlean” Puckett is a local legend. She lived here with her husband, John. Aunt Orlean was revered as a midwife who successfully delivered more than 1,000 babies. <br /> <br /> Orlean had 24 children of her own, but tragically, each one died in infancy. Many people speculate that this is why she worked so tirelessly to aid other mothers. “Aunt” Orlean Hawks Puckett died in 1939 at the age of 94 or 102, no one is quite sure which! (Not only is her age unknown, the spelling of her name varies based on the historical source.)<br /> <br /> An informational wayside on the site explains, \"Born in 1837, “Aunt” Orelena Hawks Puckett lived here during the latter of her 102 years. She was often heard to say, “The Forest was green when I was a-born and I’m green yet.” A bride at 16, Mrs. Puckett and her husband first farmed below nearby Groundhog Mountain.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Puckett was past age 50 when she began a long career of midwifery. She assisted at the births of more than 1,000 babies, delivering the last in 1939, the year she died. It has been said she never lost a child or mother through her own fault. Ironically, none of Mrs. Puckett’s own 24 children lived beyond infancy.<br /> <br /> Regardless of weather, “Aunt” Orelena went wherever and whenever called. Sometimes on horseback, often walking, the midwife brought assurance and kindness to all she visited. When she began her practice around 1890 her fee was one dollar, and “when time was good,” six dollars. Often receiving food or other goods in lieu of money, she generously shared all she had with neighbors or those in need. Today, Orelena Puckett is remembered in this area for her witty, cheerful personality, as well as for her unselfish and skillful practice as a midwife.”<br /> <br /> Orlean and John Puckett lived in a larger house that was located in what is now the garden plot on this site. The cabin here currently was moved to the property for one of John’s sisters to live in. It is preserved by the National Park Service to keep the memory of Orlean alive.</p>",

The pleasant wooded hike just north of Asheville brings you to the remains of the summer retreat of Dr. Chase Ambler. The Ambler family enjoyed the lodge and surrounding property in the early 1900’s and gave it a most unusual name.<br /> <br /> Rattlesnake Lodge was aptly named as 41 rattlesnakes were said to have been killed in the first three years the Amblers were there. The snake skins were hung on the living room ceiling. Certainly an interesting decorating choice! <em>(Please note that it is against federal law to disturb or kill snakes in the area now.)</em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hike-to-rattlesnake-lodge.htm\">Rattlesnake Lodge can be the perfect hike</a> when you're in the Asheville area. It’s great if you’re looking for a shorter hike or if your time is limited. It is also a less traveled trail than many others in the area, so give it a try if you crave a less crowded, quieter experience.<br /> <br /> The trailhead for the Rattlesnake Lodge Trail is located at Milepost 374.4 on the Blue Ridge Parkway. On the south end of the Tanbark Ridge Tunnel there are dirt pull-offs on both sides of the road that serve as parking for the trailhead. The trail begins on the west side of the road next to a small cascading creek. The trail quickly splits and both sides climb steadily for approximately 0.5 miles to the historic Rattlesnake Lodge site.<br /> <br /> Pets are allowed but must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet in length.</p>",

Picnic sites are on a first come first serve basis. The area is typically open from late May to late October. Never leave food out in the open or unattended.<br /> <br /> One of the biggest draws to this site is the weekend concert series held in the summer and autumn. These free concerts feature old time string bands, ballad singers, and bluegrass musicians. Bring chairs or blankets, as well as snacks and non-alcololic beverages. As a National Park site, alcohol is prohibited. Concerts take place outside and may be canceled in the event of inclement weather. <br /> <br /> Chestnut Ridge Trail, a moderate 5-mile loop, goes around the picnic area.

Do not climb on rocks near waterfalls and use extreme caution when walking along riverbanks. These rocks are slippery from mist and algae. The top of any waterfall is dangerous—never play in the stream above a waterfall.</strong><br /> <br /> Hike into a mile-high valley featuring spectacular waterfalls surrounded by rolling ridges. The Graveyard Fields Loop Trail is a very popular and reasonable hiking distance for families, including children, and includes waterfalls. The 1.3-mile loop trail is rated as easy overall, however the spur trails to the waterfalls are moderately steep. Trail access is from the Graveyard Fields Overlook at Milepost 418.8 of the Blue Ridge Parkway, but the area is managed by Pisgah National Forest. Finding a parking spot might require the willingness to park a significant distance away and walk on the road to the overlook. Signs on the roadsides clearly mark where motorists can and cannot park. Cars attempting to park in restricted areas have rolled over the edge down a steep embankment! If the parking lot is full, visit one of the other hiking areas available along the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br /> <br /> The two waterfalls in the Graveyard Fields area are accessible from the trailhead near the vault toilets in the overlook. A trail map is available in the overlook parking lot. Familiarize yourself with the general loop trail prior to hiking. Taking a photo of the trail map is recommended. “Social trails” (or illegal trails) have been created over the years, which can make navigating confusing. Please do not compound this problem by going off the established trails. <br /> <br /> Second (or Lower) Falls is only 1/3 of a mile from the trailhead. Follow the trail down to the Yellowstone Prong, the stream that feed both waterfalls. After crossing the stream, take a right on the spur trail that follows the stream as it flows down to the waterfall. A series of stair steps will take you to the base of the waterfall for safe viewing, photography, and cooling off in the mist of the falls. Return to the loop trail the same way you came.<br /> <br /> To reach the Upper Falls, continue on the loop trail through the beautiful open meadow. Look for a spur trail to the right after about a half a mile of hiking. It is before you recross the Yellowstone Prong. This 0.8-mile spur trail to the Upper Falls crosses small creeks and is rocky towards the end. The Upper Falls is divided into two sections, each accessible by a short side trail. At the lower section, the river flows over an angled rock outcrop resembling a chute before pooling above several large boulders. The upper section is a classic tall waterfall where the water falls over a high cliff and flows over a rock face.<br /> <br /> To return to your car, follow the Upper Falls Spur Trail back to the Graveyard Fields Loop Trail. Turn right on the loop trail where it will cross the Yellowstone Prong and ascend through a rhododendron thicket back to the other end of the parking lot.<br /> <br /> Be aware that camping is not allowed in the Graveyard Fields area. During the season, the nearest National Park Service campground is located at Mount Pisgah. In the winter, the Blue Ridge Parkway may be closed in this area due to ice and snow.</p>",

Traditionally, the bark of these common mountain trees was bruised and broken to extract the tannins, which was used to tan hides for leather-making. The forest in this area is still predominantly mature oak and hemlock.<br /> <br /> Although “social” trails appear to lead to the top of the tunnel, they are not Park Service authorized hiking trails and are steep, slippery, and dangerous. Traffic is busy on this section of the Parkway. Drivers from the south are approaching from a blind curve, drivers from the north are coming out of the tunnel. This makes anyone standing in the road very difficult to see. For your safety and the safety of others, please stay out of the road and do not walk inside the tunnel. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy the beauty and craftsmanship of the tunnel from the safety of the roadside.<br /> <br /> Tunnels along the Parkway were created to reduce the impacts open blasting would have had on the mountainsides. After initial construction of the Parkway in 1935, tunnel building took place in the late 1940’s – 1950’s. A concrete lining was added to the interiors to prevent problems with groundwater dripping, freezing, and roadways icing inside the tunnels. The semi-circular arches on the entrances of the tunnels were added by Spanish and Italian stonemasons in the 1950’s and 60’s. The stone is all local, from less than 50 miles away from each build location.<br /> <br /> There are 26 tunnels constructed along the entire 469 miles of the Blue Ridge Parkway. One is in the state of Virginia and 25 are in North Carolina. They range in length from 150 feet (Rough Ridge Tunnel) to 1,434 feet (Pine Mountain Tunnel).</p>",

        "notes": "The Loops Overlook\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-loops-ol.htm\n\nRailroad enthusiasts prize The Loops Overlook because it provides views of the trains ascending the Blue Ridge mountains from the valley below. The engineering marvel known as “The Loops” was constructed between 1905 and 1908 with the original intention of connecting the coalfields of Kentucky with the cotton mills of the Carolina Piedmont. It is 13.5 miles long, and contains 18 tunnels and many switchback curves -- giving “The Loops” its name. The trains are best viewed after the leaves fall from the trees.<br /> <br /> The Overlook provides views to the north, northeast, east and southeast. To the north, lies McKinney Gap named for Charles McKinney (1780-1852) through which the North Toe River Valley can be viewed. To the east, lie Jackson Knob and the Peppers Creek Valley. To the southeast, lie the Linville Ridge, Dobson Knob and Bald Knob. <br /> <br /> Due to its eastward facing orientation, the Loops Overlook is an excellent place to watch the sunrise and is generally dark enough after nightfall to observe any astronomical phenomenon that occur in that portion of the sky.<br /> <br /> The Loops is also a prime location to witness the natural phenomenon known as a fogfall.  When atmospheric conditions are right, fog forms in the North Toe River Valley, travels through McKinney Gap and because the fog is heavier than the surrounding air cascades down the slopes into the valley below.  This river of fog plunging through the gap and down the steep mountainside can rival the views of the parkway's most beautiful waterfalls.  The fogfall phenomenon occurs most frequently in the mornings from Mid-August to Early October. <br /> <br /> The Loops Overlook provides views of the Historic Orchard at Altapass lying directly below the overlook. The Historic Orchard at Altapass has been in operation for well over a century and was originally created by the Clinchfield Railroad in 1908.",

        "notes": "Trail Cabin at Smart View Recreation Area\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/trail-cabin.htm\n\n<p>Pioneer families began to settle in present day Floyd County in the 1740s and in Franklin County around the time of the American Revolution. Many made their homes in the mountains along the present-day Blue Ridge Parkway, including the family of W.J. Trail whose cabin today looks out onto the rolling hills of the Piedmont.</p> <p>This one-room cabin style was common in the area. Oftentimes the initial home was a simple structure—people needed a decent shelter fast so that they could move on to other activities that sustained their livelihood. Over time, as families grew and became more established on the land, extensions would be added to the house or a new home might be constructed nearby. Once this cabin no longer served as a home, it was used as a barn.</p> <p>During the development of the parkway, the cabin, like many other structures found along the way, was left to gradually fade back into the landscape and by 1947, little remained of the original structure. </p> <p>Today, the cabin is closed to visitors, but it is possible to look between the logs and see what remains; pieces of a floor and the fireplace but not much else. The cabin today lacks chinking—a mixture of clay, sand, lime, silt, ash, and dirt, that would have been placed between the logs. This protective mixture would have sealed the structure, providing some temperature control and keeping water from pooling between the logs. In another effort to seal the cabin, windows were kept small; before glass, they would be covered with animal skin or greased paper.</p> <p>The 2.6-mile easy to moderate Smart View Loop Trail passes here. There is also a bench near the cabin making it an ideal place to stop and take in the view or visit the adjacent picnic area.</p>",

Six of the ten highest peaks in the eastern United States are in the Black Mountain range, as well as 18 peaks over 6,300 feet in elevation. The shadows of these mountains, cast long over the valleys below, might be one reason for the name. The dark and dense spruce fir forest cloaking the ridge tops may be another.<br /> <br /> The Black Mountains are home to Mount Mitchell, the tallest peak east of the Mississippi River (6,684 feet). A side trip Mount Mitchell State Park provides visitors with an opportunity to walk to the top of the mountain. This impressive mountain range rises out of the valley created by the South Toe River as it flows northward. Big Ridge and Seven Mile Ridge dwarf in comparison yet add reference and breadth to the valley below. <br /> <br /> With its western facing view, this overlook is an excellent spot for viewing sunsets over the lofty peaks of the Black Mountains.",

Located just 18 miles from the southern end of the Parkway and farther away from larger cities, it has a more remote and quiet feel to it. Perfect for escaping the crowds you sometimes find at other park locations!<br /> <br /> Waterrock Knob has the highest elevation on the Parkway. The visitor center is located at 5,820 feet and the summit itself is 6,273 feet. A large open parking area can provide fantastic long-distance views anytime, but can be particularly stunning for sunrise and sunset. Fog and clouds are common here and temperatures are much cooler than in the surrounding valleys. High elevation deciduous trees mix with the spruce/fir forest to create this mountain retreat. Night owls also enjoy Waterrock Knob’s dark skies for star gazing. A visitor center, picnic tables, seasonal restrooms and a hike to the summit make this a hard to beat destination!<br /> <br /> The trail to the summit and back is round trip a mile but the elevation gain is 460 feet so take your time and enjoy the walk. The first .2 miles are paved, leading to an uneven and, at times steep, dirt and rock path. </p>",

This overlook is a family favorite for easy leg stretcher trails, picnic meals, and the relaxing sounds of the small stream flowing through the site. It is also a great place to search for wildflowers and migrating birds each spring.</p> <p>Wigwam Falls is one of the easiest to access waterfalls between Waynesboro and Roanoke, VA. It is a 0.1 mile walk to its base along a gently flowing stream. This waterfall is greatly impacted by rainfall – becoming more active and impressive following a recent storm.</p> <p>The Irish Creek Railroad was a 42 inch narrow gauge railway used by the South River Lumber Company based in nearby Cornwall, VA. Operated from 1916 to 1939, Climax locomotives climbed the mountain slopes to access and remove timber. Temporary track lines were constructed off branching off of the main trunk to provide access for loggers into various hollows. The felled trees would be loaded onto log cars to be pulled back to the sawmill. A small section of track and an old trestle have been reconstructed near the overlook, and visitors are welcome to stroll south along the old line for about half a mile to explore the re-growing forest. This exhibit commemorates timber-mining operations of the 19th century including the valuable lessons society learned from its affects.</p>",

Douglass was born in February 1818 on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, the son of an enslaved mother and a white father. As a child, he worked in the fields, was moved from one family to another and was hired out to shipbuilders in Baltimore. Through these years he learned to read and write, met free blacks – learning that it was possible to be African American and be free – joined the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Baltimore, and began to engage in debates. After several failed attempts to escape to the North, he succeeded in 1838, settling in New Bedford, Massachusetts, with his new wife Anna. Within the next few years, Douglass championed the right of African Americans to fight in the Union Army and in May 1863, saw two of his sons leave with the Massachusetts 54</span><sup>th</sup><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> Regiments for South Carolina. After the Civil War, he worked unceasingly for full civil rights for African Americans.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Douglass purchased his estate, Cedar Hill, in 1877. He was appointed US Minister and Counsel General to Haiti by President Benjamin Harrison, resigned the post in 1893, and returned to Cedar Hill where he died February 20, 1895.The site has a visitor center with exhibits. Contact the park for tours of the home. </span></p>",

This is the room for meetings guests and special gatherings. One such meeting included a number of gentlemen who gathered and voted to accept the <a href=\"https://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6326?show=full\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Charter to the American Museum of Natural History</span></a><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">.</span> Theodore Roosevelt recalls a time he was in the room: \"The ornaments of that parlor I remember now, including the gas chandelier decorated with a great quantity of cut-glass prisms. These prisms struck me as possessing peculiar magnificence. One of them fell off one day, and I hastily grabbed it and stowed it away, passing several days of furtive delight in the treasure, a delight always alloyed with fear that I would be found out and convicted of larceny.\" (Autobiography, p. 6)",

        "notes": "Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace Library\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/theodore-roosevelt-birthplace-library.htm\n\nTheodore Roosevelt describes this room in his autobiography: \"The middle room was a library, with tables, chairs and bookcases of gloomy respectability. It was without windows, and so was available only at night.\" (p.5)  The black-colored furniture in this room is upholstered with horsehair, which, T.R. recalls \"scratched the bare legs of children.\" (Autobiography, 5)<br /> <br /> As one examines the bookcases, one finds many heirloom books, which the family enjoyed. T.R. himself loved to read. He states \"While I was still a small boy...I already begun to read some of Mayne Reid's books and other boys' books of adventure...I was too young to understand much of Mayne Reid, excepting the adventure part and the natural history part- these enthralled me.\" (Autobiography, p. 15-16). Theodore Roosevelt was encouraged to read what he wanted, unless it was a dime novel or Ouida's books, which were deemed inappropriate for the young boy. One of T.R.'s prized possessions was a couple of books by J.G. Wood that he received from his father. When one looks closely in the bookcases, to this day, one still finds a book on natural history that J.G. Wood wrote. <br /> <br /> Additionally, in his autobiography, Theodore Roosevelt mentions an art piece called the \"Transfiguration\"- Today one sees a replica etching hanging above the fireplace mantle piece.<br /> Looking on the mantle piece, one can spot two black obelisks. These were souvenirs brought back from a trip down the Nile River that the family took in 1872. On that trip, T.R. brought back samples of bird taxidermy for his \"Roosevelt Museum.\" Today, these taxidermy birds are on display at the American Museum of Natural History. ",

The pieces are original to the house and cost nearly $3,000 in the 1850's. Above the fireplace mantle is a portrait of Martha Bulloch Roosevelt done by Jenny Loop. A similar portrait of Martha's sister, Anna, was also done by Jenny loop in 1873. Anna's portrait hangs in the nursery above the fireplace mantle.   <br /> <br />  ",

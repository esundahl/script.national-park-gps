Abigail Adams brought her seven year old son, John Quincy Adams, up to the top of near-by Penn’s Hill to watch the battle from afar. John Quincy later wrote, “Of June lighted the fires of Charlestown -- I saw with my own eyes those fires, and heard Britannia's thunders in the Battle of Bunker's hill and witnessed the tears of my mother and mingled with them my own, at the fall of Warren a dear friend of my father, and a beloved Physician to me.”<br />  <br /> The Abigail Adams Cairn is located in a neighborhood with limited parking.

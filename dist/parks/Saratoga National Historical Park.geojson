But only one commemorates the actions of a man who was instrumental in the American victory here, but later became a traitor to the United States: the infamous Benedict Arnold. The “Boot” monument is located at Stop 7 on the battlefield tour road. This monument is perhaps the most popular, unique, and controversial monument of the many placed here.<br /> <br /> After he was wounded, General Arnold underwent surgery and after months of recuperation was assigned to command the repatriated capital city, Philadelphia, in June 1778.<br /> <br /> There, Arnold’s resentment of perceived mistreatment boiled over into rage against the United States. He secretly sought British support and shared military intelligence. Exposed as a traitor at West Point in 1780, he escaped.<br /> <br /> No one in American history is as vilified for treason as Benedict Arnold. The “Boot Monument” is dedicated to this man who led Americans to victory in the Battles of Saratoga.</p> <h4>Reading the Monument</h4> <p>The monument does not mention Arnold by name, but there are a few intricate details which often go unnoticed by passersby.<br /> <br /> A boot and a two-star epaulet are draped over a howitzer barrel to symbolize an individual with the rank of Major General who suffered a wound during a battle in this location. A Laurel leaf wreath sits atop the howitzer, an emblem which often resonates victory, power, and glory.<br /> <br /> The reverse of the monument is inscribed with the following quote:</p> <blockquote> <p>“In memory of the most brilliant soldier of the Continental Army who was desperately wounded on this spot, the sally port of Burgoyne’s great [western] redoubt 7th October 1777 winning for his countrymen the decisive battle of the American Revolution and for himself the rank of Major General.”</p> </blockquote>",

Of loyalist sympathies, Freeman had to abandon the farm and move his family to Canada. He returned with Burgoyne as a member of a Loyalist regiment, known as Jessup’s Corps. His small cabin stood just beyond the two artillery pieces you see on the left. </p> <p>We are a little more than a mile north of the American lines, and about the same distance from the Hudson, to the east. </p> <p>On September 19th General Burgoyne advanced, deploying a 3-column movement toward the American position, whose extent and strength were unknown to him. </p> <p>General Fraser commanded the right column, composed of the German and British light infantry, grenadiers, loyalists, Canadians, and 12 guns. </p> <p>The center column, led by General Hamilton, consisted of 1600 men with 4 cannon, including the battalion companies of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd Regiments of the British line. Burgoyne accompanied this element. </p> <p>The left column was commanded by General von Riedesel, and included the German regiments of von Riedesel, Specht, von Rhetz, Hesse-Hanau, dragoons, light infantrymen known as chasseurs and jaegers, 6 battalion companies of the British 47th Regiment, and 8 cannon. The Germans had been sent to American by contracts between their duke and King George III of England, who was also the Elector of Hanover, one of many German city-states. </p> <p>General Fraser’s column marched along the road running westward from the river road to a point 3 miles from the river, and then turned southward. Hamilton’s column followed Fraser’s a short distance, turned south at the first road, and marched to the Great Ravine, crossed it, and moved west to a point north of the Freeman Farm. General von Riedesel’s column marched out along the river road. When the columns reached their assigned positions, a signal gun would coordinate a simultaneous movement against the Americans. </p> <p>Learning of the enemy’s movements, General Gates ordered Colonel Daniel Morgan’s rifle corps and Major Henry Dearborn’s light infantry battalion to reconnoiter the woods and fields of the American lines. They were followed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments from General Enoch Poor’s brigade. </p> <p>At about noon, part of Morgan’s corps fired upon and killed or wounded most of the advanced guard of General Hamilton’s column in the Freeman Farm clearing. The riflemen rushed forward to pursue the survivors, and ran head-on into the main body of Hamilton’s division. The British drove Colonel Morgan’s men south of the farm, where they scattered. </p> <p>Morgan was chagrinned by the sudden disorganization of his command, but with the persistent use of his turkey call he rallied the men and deployed on the fringe of the farm clearing. After a brief lull, during which the New Hampshire regiments joined the riflemen, the fight resumed. </p> <p>As it intensified, other regiments of General Poor’s brigade, followed by Brigadier General Ebenezer Learned’s brigade and the 10th Massachusetts Regiment, from Brigadier General John Patterson’s brigade, were committed. Morgan’s riflemen and General Poor’s troops bore the brunt of the fight, while the other troops faced General Fraser, preventing him from going to General Hamilton’s support. </p> <p>For more than 3 hours, the battle rolled back and forth across the weed-grown, stump-studded farm. The American troops, most of whom were veterans regulars, deployed, attacked, retreated, and rallied in a disciplined and soldierly manner. The British regiments upheld the great traditions of their service, counterattacking again and again with the bayonet, against increasingly heavy odds. But all their gallantry and skill were inadequate to counter the Americans’ numerical advantage and superior firepower. </p> <p>At around 6 PM, in response to an urgent order from General Burgoyne, General von Riedesel’s Germans appeared from the east, colors flying, singing hymns. Fresh troops from the Regiments von Riedesel, von Rhetz, and Pausch’s Hesse-Hanau artillery engaged the American right in support of the slowly retreating British. The newly reinforced ground forces rallied, delivering yet another bayonet charge, and at dusk, the Americans withdrew to their fortification on Bemis Heights. </p> <p>Both sides claimed victory. Burgoyne remained on the field of battle. Gates still blocked the road to Albany. </p> <p>The British would spend the next 17 days erecting fortifications facing those of the Americans. Their western flank would be protected by two redoubts. One would be a very formidable work, its outline appearing as white posts with red tops. It would become known as the Balcarres’ Redoubt, after Major Alexander Lindsay, the Earl of Balcarres, who commanded the light infantry defending this work. Built of horizontal logs, it was nearly 500 yards long, and mounted 8 cannon. It was to this position that most of the survivors of the fighting in the Wheatfield on October 7th fled.</p>",

Today his restored home looks much as it did when Generals Arnold and Poor used it for quarters in 1777. This single-room house may be small, but the panoramic view from the porch is larger than life!</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"On the summit of the height, three fourths of a mile northwest of Bemis’s, [John Neilson] owned a clearing of a few acres when the war broke out, and he had...a small dwelling...thereon. The dwelling...is still there.\"</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>- </em>Benson Lossing, 1848</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> A young and ambitious <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/john-neilson.htm\">John Neilson</a> came to this area in 1772 from just outside Elizabeth, NJ. He went to work in the village of Stillwater, two miles south of this house, on the farm of Abner Quitterfield (behind you as you face the front of the house). Only three years later, in 1775, he leased 150 acres of land here, and ‘married the boss’s daughter,’ Lydia. Within a year or two, they built this small house on the lot he had leased.<br /> <br /> But some time in 1777, they faced devastating news: a <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/crown-forces.htm\">British army</a> was invading southward from Canada into New York. Their route would take them basically through the Neilsons’ back yard.</p> <h4>Fortifying the High Ground</h4> <p>John took Lydia and their possessions to the safety of her parents’ home in Stillwater. He then exchanged his home for a tent, serving with his local militia regiment—some of whom would be encamped nearby.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/army-of-the-united-states.htm\">American army</a> officers moved into his empty house on September 12, 1777. About ten miles north, British forces steadily descended the Hudson River Valley as American troops hastily built menacing defenses 3/4 of a mile east on Bemus Heights—a ridge of bluffs overlooking the Hudson. Cannons on these heights, and fortifications on the flood plain below, commanded the river valley. The British choices were few: retreat, run the gauntlet, or go around. Knowing the terrain would force the British to move inland to the west, the Americans also built a long, ‘L-shaped’ fortified wall. From Bemus Heights, it ran northwest to a point just north of Neilson’s house, on what was then called <em>“The Summit,”</em> and then south and west another 3/4 of a mile. Such a massive barrier would surely thwart the British plans—or so the Americans hoped.</p> <h4>Use of the House</h4> <p>The American army used this house as a divisional and brigade headquarters. Ephraim Woodworth’s house, 1/2 mile south of Neilson’s, was headquarters for the American army commanding general, <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/horatio-gates.htm\">Horatio Gates.</a><br /> <br /> Who were the ‘strangers’ staying in Neilson’s house? The only account from the time of the battles says General Enoch Poor of New Hampshire and <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/benedict-arnold.htm\">General Benedict Arnold</a> of Connecticut were quartered here.<br /> <br /> Fighting came within about one mile of this house, but never made it to the American lines. As Gates’ army moved on, though, they left behind a farm in near-ruins.</p> <h4>After the Battles</h4> <p>John and Lydia returned shortly after the army’s departure and began restoring the farm. Their crops had been ravaged, and their fields torn up. John filed a damage claim in May 1778, in the amount of £100 (about three times a soldier’s annual salary), but he was not reimbursed.<br /> <br /> The Neilsons continued with their family life as well, eventually having eight children. As the family grew, a small house would no longer do; the first U.S. Census from 1790 lists eleven people living here. Some time before 1830, they built a larger, two-story home.<br /> <br /> By the 1890s, they had pushed back the original part of the house and added a carriage barn.</p>",

Halted by the cataclysm of the Civil War, the group was re-energized in 1872, intent on commemorating the centennial of Burgoyne’s surrender in October 1877. They chose Jared C. Markham as architect and the Booth Brothers of New York City as builders, and laid the cornerstone on the 100th anniversary of the American victory. Attempts to raise money and public support began in earnest, yet proved to be a difficult process. Only $2,300 was raised from private donations; the greater part of moneys used for the Monument’s construction came from the Federal government ($95,000) and New York State ($10,000). A debt of $4,500 remained in 1895 when the Monument was transferred to the state of New York.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>October 17, 1877</strong>: cornerstone laid</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>November 3, 1882</strong>: capstone placed</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>August 1887</strong>: bronze statues completed</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>August 1895</strong>: financial realities required transfer to New York State (NYS)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>October 1897</strong>: initial landscaping completed</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>October 17, 1912</strong>: official dedication upon the 135th anniversary of Burgoyne’s surrender</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>May 1980</strong>: Monument transferred to the National Park Service (NPS)</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Features of Saratoga Monument</h4> <p>The Monument, which features Gothic and Egyptian styled elements, is a rock-faced granite obelisk situated on a high bluff upon the grounds of Burgoyne’s last camp and overlooks the scenic Hudson Valley.<br /> <br /> Within the Monument are 188 steps that connect five levels and a viewing platform at the top.

The present house, erected in 1777 shortly after Burgoyne’s surrender, was the center of Schuyler’s extensive farming and milling operations.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My hobby horse has long been a country life; I dismounted once with reluctance, and now saddle him again...and hope to canter him on to the end of the journey of life.\" </p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">- Major General Philip Schuyler, 6 November 1777</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/philip-schuyler.htm\">Philip Schuyler (1733-1804)</a> wrote those words about his love of country life when he took up residence in what he called his “commodious box.” He built it hurriedly in the frosty autumn of November 1777 to replace its predecessor, which was burned by the <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/crown-forces.htm\">British </a>only a few weeks before.<br /> <br /> Restored by the National Park Service, Philip Schuyler’s house is a tangible reminder of the village of Saratoga’s founding family—now known as Schuylerville, having been renamed for the Schuyler family in 1831.</p> <h4>The Man</h4> <p>As a member of the Continental Congress, an influential New Yorker, and an experienced officer, Schuyler was given the rank of major general on June 19, 1775—making him third in command under George Washington and commander of the Northern Department of the Continental Army. In the summer of 1777, as British forces overwhelmingly swept down the Champlain and Hudson Valleys, Schuyler was blamed for the loss of Fort Ticonderoga and the American Army’s retreat. Despite his shrewd tactics to impede the British advance, Congress replaced Schuyler with General Horatio Gates on August 19, 1777, one month before the Battles of Saratoga. Notwithstanding this personal setback, Schuyler helped the army from his mansion in Albany by forwarding supplies and encouraging reinforcements northward.<br /> <br /> Wearied by many personal attacks and sacrifices, plagued with recurring illness and having no active command since being relieved by Gates, Schuyler resigned from the army in 1779. However, he continued to provide vital support by organizing and financing military campaigns, advising Washington, and continuing to serve in the Continental Congress.<br /> <br /> After the Revolutionary War, Schuyler remained active in business as well as state and national politics, but his real interests took an important turn: with visionary acumen he became one of the staunchest supporters for canal construction. Although he died before his dreams of successful canals came to be, Philip Schuyler is known as a father of United States canals.</p> <h4>The Enslaver</h4> <p>Philip Schuyler and his family, like many New Yorkers in the Colonial and Early Republic years relied upon the enslavement of men, women, and children of African descent as a basis of their wealth. From the earliest presence of Schuylers in Saratoga, enslaved people were present. They were involved in all aspects of building a settlement in the wilderness. They cleared land, harvested trees, planted and harvested crops, fished, tended livestock, cooked, cleaned, served food and drink, and a myriad of other tasks.<br /> <br /> As Philip Schuyler developed his inheritance starting in the 1760s, he also used enslaved people in his industrial developments including sawmills, a grist mill, and a linen mill. Between the Saratoga Estate and the Schuyler Mansion in Albany, there were typically 2-3 dozen enslaved people at any one time. Schuyler reported 14 enslaved people at the Saratoga Estate to the first federal census in 1790.<br /> <br /> In that 1790 census, about 14% of New York families reported ownership of over 20,000 (about 6% of the state's population) of their fellow humans, the largest population of any northern state. This averages out to 2.6 per enslaving household, so one can see the much greater degree to which the Schuylers relied upon unfree labor than even their fellow New York slaveholders. <br /> <br /> There is much we do not know about the individuals who were exploited on the Schuyler Estate. Saratoga NHP currently has a major study ongoing to learn more about slavery and the enslaved at the Sculyer Estate. We will be further incorporating the stories that will be uncovered through this process. For now, we can share, remember, and honor the following names that have been found in the family's letters or records: Jacob, Harry, Peter, Lewis, Cuff, Dick, Jim, Patrick, Tom, Anthony, Claas, Cato, Britt, Phoebe, Bett, Pol, Jane, Dian, and Libey.<br /> <br /> The end of slavery in New York came slowly. The first abolition law in the state was passed in 1799. However, it only freed people born after July 4 of that year. Seeing that the law was not having the intended effect, the legislature passed a second law in March of 1817 that would free any remaining enslaved people on July 4, 1827. When Emancipation Day finally arrived, around 4600 people finally became free nearly three decades after passage of the initial law. </p> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">The Estate</span> <p>The estate was originally part of the 1684 Saratoga Patent of 168,000 acres granted to seven New Yorkers (Schuylers owned 24,000 acres). Through inheritence and purchase the “farm at Saratoga” eventually came to Philip’s grandfather, Johannes Schuyler. This bustling farm, left in the care of Johannes’s oldest son, was obliterated by a raiding party of Native Americans and French Canadians in 1745. Almost all of the community’s enslaved and free people (over 100) were captured; Johannes’s oldest son and heir to the Schuyler fortune was killed on the spot. Philip Schuyler became the family’s new heir.<br /> <br /> From a second house built in the 1760s, Philip turned the remnants of the ruined farm into a busy farming, milling, and merchandising center, worked by tenants, enslaved people, and artisans (notably Scottish immigrants). With his wheat, flax, and hemp crops, award-winning linen mill, sawmills, herring fishery (transporting fish to sell as far away as Jamaica and Antigua), and general store selling goods and services, Philip’s Saratoga community and personal wealth grew substantially. Just like in 1745 though, the house, mills, and most of the buildings were destroyed on October 10, 1777, but this time by retreating British forces following the Battles of Saratoga.</p> <h4>The House</h4> <p>Following the surrender of British forces in Saratoga on October 17, 1777 and departure of tens of thousands of troops from the area, Philip immediately began to plan the rebuilding of his Saratoga house and farm out of its charred remains. Since December’s winter was approaching fast, his new “cheaply and speedily erected” house was completed within the weeks of November. It was built upon the existing foundation of a burned building and used fresh-cut lumber from his upper sawmill. Paying high wages for labor from all over Albany County, and even by using some captive <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/the-british-army.htm\">British soldiers</a> (who knew masonry), the plain, unrefined house was finished, but it was much smaller and simpler than the one to which Philip was accustomed. As time went on the house grew in size and comfort, with structural additions and finishing coats added to cover the naked interior and exterior.</p> <h4>The Continuing Tradition</h4> <p>Throughout Philip’s life and since, this house has been the destination of many visitors, some of whom were famous citizens. George Washington (godfather of daughter Catherine Schuyler), son-in-law Alexander Hamilton (who married daughter Elizabeth Schuyler), Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and the Marquis de Lafeyette visited this house, to name a few. Now, following in their footsteps, tens of thousands of people from all over the world continue to learn about the general, the visionary, and the man who was Philip Schuyler.</p>",

Because the course of the river, so beneficial for conveying all the bulky necessaries of an army, is precisely the route that an army ought to take for the great purposes of cutting communications between the Southern and Northern Provinces….\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">–General John Burgoyne of His Majesty's British Army </p> </blockquote> <p>Since the Revolutionary War's opening shots at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the British had wanted to bring an end to the rebellion in the American colonies. They hoped that 1777 could be the year. <br /> <br /> General John Burgoyne, commander of the British forces here at Saratoga, believed the Lake Champlain-Hudson River Valley Corridor would be the best travel route should an invasion become necessary. That belief formed the backbone of British plans to invade New York by marching south from Canada —a daring scheme that would utilize separate armies in an effort to isolate New England, the perceived heart of the rebellion. <br /> <br /> In 1777, the plan was put into action...Burgoyne’s British forces invaded south into New York using the natural corridor of waterways. A smaller force under Lieutenant-Colonel Barry St. Leger would support this movement by marching east from Lake Ontario toward the Mohawk River, which they would follow to the Hudson, and meet up with Burgoyne's troops at Albany. <br /> <br /> Once in Albany, the combined force would establish communications with General Sir William Howe in New York City --all in the hopes of stopping the American rebellion before France or Spain chose to intervene. <br /> <br /> Aware that General Burgoyne's troops were advancing south from Canada, the American forces, under the command of General Horatio Gates, made plans to prevent further invasion. But what made this land the most advantageous site for the Continental Army to take a stand against the advance of the British? Why here? <br /> <br /> Consider the landscape around you as you walk. Topography and ground cover played important roles here at Saratoga. The American Army worked to use these factors to their advantage. In September 1777, under the advice of Colonel Thaddeus Kosciuszko, a brilliant Polish engineer serving with the Americans, they chose a raised area a few miles south of here, known as Bemis Heights, to build their fortifications and stop the British advance to Albany. <br /> <br /> Bemis Heights overlooked the Hudson River and the road to Albany at a natural \"bottleneck\" in the river valley. The heights gave a commanding view north, where the British would be advancing from. Dense woodland and difficult ravines prevented the British from traversing the land just east of the river. Swampland and ravines directly beneath Bemis Heights restricted Burgoyne's advance to the river and the road, both of which were highly visible and vulnerable to American forces. <br /> <br /> These imposing defenses forced Burgoyne's army to take the only safe route open to them and move inland, away from the Hudson, a few miles north of Bemis Heights. <br /> <br /> This historic walking trail loosely follows some of the roads the British used for that move inland, as well as during the Battles of Saratoga, in September and October of 1777. Locating these roads was made possible by using maps drawn at the time by Lieutenant William Cumberland Wilkinson, a British mapmaker serving under British commander General Burgoyne. <br /> <br /> Did you know the Revolutionary War is considered America's first civil war?

Many people faced difficult decisions with no easy answers but potentially severe and even deadly consequences.<br /> <br /> If you lived here in the 1770s, would you be a Loyalist or Tory, terms for individuals loyal to the established government of Great Britain? Would you be a Rebel or Whig, terms for Americans wanting personal freedom and a country that could make its own decisions regarding government, trade, taxes and laws for its people? Or would you try to remain neutral? It must have been a difficult decision for many of those early Americans...a wrong decision could result in being jailed, losing friends, neighbors, job, home, and even family members. <br /> <br /> Just as politics can divide nations today, in the late 1700s there were a variety of viewpoints, often influenced by economic status, race, religion, gender and age, which resulted not only in discord on the battlefield but also in the personal lives of those torn between conflicting loyalties within their families and communities. <br /> <br /> The site you are on used to belong to John McBride during the 1770s. This family made the difficult decision to remain loyal to Great Britain and the King. Their neighbors, the Freemans, were also Loyalists. Would the McBrides and the Freemans ever have imagined their fields bearing fierce fighting between British soldiers and… fellow Americans? <br /> <br /> Loyalists involved with the Battles of Saratoga served mainly in two regiments, the Kings Loyal Americans and the Queen's Loyal Rangers. Throughout the Battles of Saratoga, the British troops were divided into three columns, and these Loyalist units were part of the right column. <br /> <br /> The road you are walking was used by the right hand column, furthest from the river, commanded by Brigadier General Simon Fraser. The Loyalist forces were positioned on the knolls behind this farm. The American Revolution truly was America's first civil war, pitting neighbor against neighbor and sometimes brother against brother. Always suspicious of one's fellow neighbors and friends, it was a trying time to be a local resident.  <br /> <br /> Who do you think of when you hear the term \"redcoats?\" What about Hessians? Native Warriors? They all played an important role here at Saratoga.  Keep hiking to find out who joined the British on the field of battle.</p>",

I, however, observed a little more decency than some parties had done, who left heads, legs and arms above ground. No other distinction is paid to officer or soldier than the officers are put in a hole by themselves. This friendly office to the dead, though it greatly affects the feelings, was nothing to the scene in bringing in the wounded; the one were past all pain, the other in the most excruciating torments, sending forth dreadful groans. They had remained out all night...some of them begged they might lie and die, others again were insensible, some upon the least movement were put in the most horrid tortures, and all had near a mile to be conveyed to the hospitals. These poor creatures, perishing with cold and weltering in their blood, displayed such a scene, it must be a heart of adamant that could not be affected by it, even to a degree of weakness.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">–Ensign Thomas Anbury,<br /> 24th Regiment of Foot </p> </blockquote> <p>The outcome of the second battle of Saratoga, October 7th, 1777, initiated the events which led to the capture of General Burgoyne's army. <br /> <br /> On October 8th, after burying General Fraser in a solemn ceremony, Burgoyne had little choice but to withdraw. A chilly, slow, soaking autumn rain turned the road to ankle-deep mud, and made the march even more of an ordeal for the dispirited army. Tired, cold and hungry from the grueling battles, they marched north. <br /> <br /> Eight miles north, in the Village of Saratoga, the British burned the country estate of American General Philip Schuyler to the ground in hopes of denying the pursuing Americans additional cover. About three-fourths of a mile west of there, they encamped on a hill and were surrounded by American forces and a full-scale siege of the British forces' positions began. Starving, outnumbered almost three to one, and with no hope of escape, the British surrendered to the Americans on October 17th, 1777. <br /> <br /> The British plan, meant to bring a decisive end to the Revolution and the war, instead resulted in France joining the side of the United States against England in 1778. France was joined by Spain in 1779, and the English declared war on the Netherlands in 1780, thus turning the revolution into an international conflict, one that continued for another 6 years and became a war of attrition for the British. <br /> <br /> This foreign support helped guarantee the independence of the United States, and established the Battles of Saratoga as the turning point of the American Revolution. <br /> <br /> To learn more about the week-long siege on the British and the surrender that followed, be sure to visit Victory Woods, 8 miles north of the Battlefield, to explore the scenes of that turbulent time. Victory Woods is accessible from behind Saratoga Monument, in the Village of Victory. In the summer months, make sure to visit and climb Saratoga Monument, located on Burgoyne Road in the Village of Victory, featuring fantastic views of the surrounding area and dramatized images of the American Revolution. The Monument is located on part of the grounds of Burgoyne's last camp. <br /> <br /> Also, tour General Philip Schuyler's country house, a center of commerce and a political way-station, which was visited by important figures like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. Philip Schuyler is perhaps the most famous American you’ve never heard of. He not only contributed to the success of the Battles of Saratoga, but was also instrumental in New York politics and was in many ways the father of the American canal system. Schuyler House is located on Rt. 4 in the Village of Schuylerville. All three sights are located within one mile of each other. <br /> <br /> As you return to the Visitor Center, take time out to explore the stories of the men, women and children of the Revolution. Speak with Park Rangers, read first-hand accounts, and explore the museum and the rest of this historic site. Be inspired by your journey, always remembering the great human cost of the freedoms that American citizens enjoy today. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The field of Saratoga is rich with the blood of heroes.

Each soldier carried over 40 pounds of equipment, and added to this was the daily grind of extreme weather —including heat, cold, driving rain, humidity— and mosquitoes and black flies, and accompanying hunger, thirst and fatigue. <br /> <br /> About one mile north of here, the British split into three columns, or three groups. One column followed the road along the Hudson River. A second kept about a mile west of the river. The third moved along one mile farther west from the river. This spacing was intended to help sweep around American positions the British were sure had to be somewhere near here. <br /> <br /> You are now walking on the same trail used by the troops in the center column accompanied by Burgoyne himself. But just who were these forces we so commonly call \"Redcoats?\" <br /> <br /> The British Regiments were famous on many European fields of battle, and here at Saratoga they consisted of men from England, Scotland, Wales, Germany and Ireland. Also with them were regiments of German auxiliaries –almost 3,000 officers and men– supplementing Burgoyne’s army.<br /> <br /> In addition, they were joined by Native people, including about 150 Fort Hunter Mohawk warriors and their families, as well as dozens of Iroquois and Algonquin warriors from the Seven Nations of Canada. The rest of the forces included French Canadians and American Loyalists. <br /> <br /> For this world-renowned fighting force, even the possibility of defeat at the hands of the contemptuous rebels was unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Integrated forces were not purely a British military practice. The American army integrated African Americans, American Indians, and Caucasian soldiers in the same units. In fact, about five percent of the American troops here at Saratoga were black men, reflecting a policy of integration which didn’t happen again until the Korean War. They served as soldiers in both the Continental Army and militia forces alongside their white counterparts. <br /> <br /> Enslaved men were sometimes forced to serve in the place of their owners. Many were not slaves at all, but free men who volunteered to serve. Although only white men were appointed as commissioned officers, all soldiers served and fought together and received the same rations, uniforms and pay. This marked a unique situation in a time of active slavery in this country. <br /> <br /> Shhhh...is that musket fire in the distance? The British have arrived here on this very land. Keep hiking to find out what happened on that first day of battle...</p>",

It was named after Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich Breymann, who initially commanded 600 German and American Loyalist troops at this fortification. The two sets of posts configured in small squares to the right signify two cabins manned by French Canadian militia.</p> <p>As the British retreated from Barber's Wheatfield, Brigadier General Simon Fraser rode back and forth along the British lines in order to rally the troops. As he did, he was mortally wounded, possibly from a rifleman’s bullet.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Towards three o'clock in the afternoon, instead of my dinner guest arriving as expected, poor General Fraser, who was to have been one of them, was brought to me on a stretcher, mortally wounded. The table, which had already been set for diner, was removed and a bed for the General was put in its place. I sat in a corner of the room, shivering and trembling.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">–Baroness Frederika von Riedesel</p> </blockquote> <p>While Balcarres’ Redoubt at Freeman's Farm held strong, here at Breymann's Redoubt, by late afternoon, the fewer than 200 German and Loyalists there proved no match for the more than 1000 Continental and militia troops who circled the defenders, capturing the fort. It was during the attack on the Breymann Redoubt here that Arnold was severely wounded in the left leg. Arnold's \"boot monument\" is off to your right in the stand of trees.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"At this stage in the action, General Benedict Arnold, while galloping up and down our line...received a musket ball which broke his leg and killed the horse under him. He was about 40 yards distant from me and in fair view.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">–Samuel Woodruff,<br /> Connecticut Militia</p> </blockquote> <p>The Americans' final surge that day overwhelmed the Germans and Loyalists defending this position and drove the British back toward Balcarres Redoubt. The fall of this redoubt exposed the rear of Burgoyne's camp and was perhaps THE crucial hour in the battle, as Americans gained control of the back door to the entire British line. </p> <p>Only the darkness saved Burgoyne from immediate disaster. Many men of both armies died that day; British losses were punctuated by the killings of Lieutenant Colonel Breymann and General Fraser. Their deaths foreshadowed the eventual end to Burgoyne’s plans for 1777, and the surrender of his army.</p>",

Morgan's riflemen singled out specific targets, while the massed Continental and British lines filled the air with volleys of lead. Sounds of men crying out in pain and fear could be heard across the field. Both sides scrambled to carry out their wounded. </p> <p>Just as the British lines began to waver in the face of deadly fire from the numerically superior Americans, German reinforcements from the left column arrived from the river road with two 6-pound cannons, forcing the Americans to withdraw under the cover of darkness.</p>",

According to this letter, Clinton was willing to send 2,000 troops north from the City to exert pressure south of Albany and make General Gates divert some troops to cope with this new threat. </p> <p>Burgoyne decided to wait for this diversion before he moved again against the American troops. For the next 16 days the two sides were encamped more or less facing each other; less than two miles separated the opposing armies. </p> <p>The Americans continued to strengthen their defensive fortifications and Bemis Heights, while the British constructed their own fortifications, represented by the red topped posts, some of which you might see nearby. Burgoyne's men felled hundreds of trees to construct several defensive \"redoubts,\"a name coming from the French term for \"temporary field fortifications.\" Each redoubt was built of walls formed with heavy logs. </p> <p>These positions were staggered to defend a 2-mile span west of the Hudson River, with each redoubt intended to provide supporting fire to those nearby. The soldiers also cut hundreds more trees to clear areas in front of these redoubts so the American enemy would have no hiding places near the British lines. Such massive clear-cutting for these works left much of the land bare.  </p> <p>The British kept working, and waiting...</p>",

The enemy’s position, on the other hand was strong and his large army was three times superior to ours so that we could not attack him with any hope of success.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">--Brunswick Lieutenant Anton Adolph Heinrich Du Roi,<br /> October 7, 1777</p> </blockquote> <p>It is said an army marches on its stomach. Burgoyne's army had difficulties moving through this unfamiliar countryside and even more trouble finding enough rations and supplies. A ration is the amount of food given to a solider for one day. <br /> <br /> On a campaign, it consisted of one and a half pounds of flour or bread and one and a half pounds of salted pork or beef. But the bread was not fresh and soft; it was flat, hard, and dry –poor tasting, but well preserved for storage and travel. This \"ship’s bread\"as it was then called, dismayed the Germans soldiers who were used to baked bread. The salted meat, soaked in saltwater for months at a time tasted even worse; washing the meat one to two times in fresh water was often required to make it edible. <br /> <br /> Women received half rations and children received about one quarter ration. <br /> <br /> On October 3rd, due to the British supply shortage, Burgoyne had to cut troops down to 1/3 of its normal rations. Officers sent out foraging parties to find food in the nearby farms. Eunice Campbell Reid, a child of a local farmer, reported on a German foraging party. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"When on our way home from Burgoyne's camp, we stopped several days at John McNeil's. Whilst there were a large party of Brunswickwers, to the number of thirty or more, come and went into Mister NcNeil's potato field and dug a considerable part of the crop. Each of them had three knapsacks or bags which they filled with potatoes and carried off. . . some took pairs of tow cloth trousers that were hanging up to dry, tied up the bottoms of the legs and filled them with potatoes, tied them up, and taking one under each arm went off with the trousers as well as their contents.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>What other foods did the foraging soldiers find? The locals grew a variety of crops, including wheat, barley, rye, potatoes, peas, pumpkins, and turnips. They also grew corn, beans, and squash –a reflection of the Native influence in the area. Hay and oats were grown as feed for horses and cattle. <br /> <br /> The locals that lived here, having temporarily fled, often found devastation when they returned home. Crops were ravaged, fences torn down, animals taken, and their houses were often burnt to the ground.</p>",

Sometimes younger boys served as officers' servants, or as drummers or fifers. Occasionally, boys as young as 14 or 15 served as officers in the British army. Civilian camp followers marched with both British and American armies. <br /> <br /> Camp followers included women and children, merchants, and occasional refugees. Their jobs were to wash, mend and sew the soldiers’ clothes, forage, tend the wounded or sick, help provide some supplies, and take care of themselves and their children. They did not generally cook for soldiers, as the soldiers did their own cooking. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult life, but their presence did afford armies some needed assistance. Camp followers were occasionally exposed to battlefield dangers. Two accounts tell of anonymous American camp followers killed in the fighting during the Battles of Saratoga.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I was convinced how much the Americans were pushed in our late action, on the 19th of September, for I met with several dead bodies belonging to the enemy, and among them were laying close to each other, two men and a woman, the latter of whom had her arms extended, and her hands grasping cartridges.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">–British Ensign Thomas Anbury,<br /> British 24th Regiment of Foot </p> </blockquote> <p> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"the American women followed close after the American soldiers, as they were advancing, and even exposed themselves where the shot were flying, to strip the dead....I saw one woman while thus employed, struck by a cannon ball and literally dashed to pieces.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"> –Ambrose Collins,<br /> Connecticut militia</p> </blockquote> <p>We often hear tales of the soldiers'contributions here at Saratoga and in the American Revolution...but what about the women?

Why get involved at all? There were a variety of reasons. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, women camp followers were an essential part of both American and British armies in the 18th Century. Their work as nurses, and doing laundry and mending clothes, and scavenging for supplies, were all extremely valuable to the military. <br /> <br /> At home however, when their husbands, sons or brothers went off to war, women were left to fend for themselves. In England and in America, military service could mean months and even years that a man would be away, leaving women to maintain homes, farms, families, and perhaps even businesses. They were then confronted with the realities of inflation, shortages, and threats to homes and towns. <br /> <br /> Here in America, women's efforts were also greatly needed in the combined fronts of economy and politics. Listen to this poem that appeared in the Massachusetts Gazette in 1767 in attempts to persuade women to political patriotism: </p> <blockquote> <p> \"Young ladies in town and those that lived round. Let a friend, at this season, advise you. Since money's so scarce, and times growing worse, Strange things may soon hap and surprise you. First, then, throw aside your high topknots of pride, Wear none but your own country linen, Of economy boast...Let your pride be the most To show clothes of your own make and spinning.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>This and other ventures followed the cues of Colonial leaders as they encouraged consumer boycotts of British goods. Self-sufficiency became both a political statement and an economic necessity. <br /> <br /> What about stories like that of Deborah Sampson, who masqueraded as a man to join the Continental Army, or Molly Pitcher, who took her injured husband's place in a cannon crew? <br /> <br /> These were very heroic but highly unusual exceptions. As a rule, women simply were not soldiers. They did, however sometimes provide crucial information for armies, and one young African-American teenager, named Phoebe Fraunces, may have actually saved George Washington by providing information about a plot against his life. <br /> <br /> Despite the contributions women made to the Patriot cause during the Revolutionary War, the achievement of independence failed to bring a revolution in the rights of American females. For most women, the war's end in 1783 signaled a return to their customary duties within their families and households. <br /> <br /> Although women gained little in the way of additional legal and political rights as a consequence of the struggle for independence, the American Revolution helped foster a female ideal that has become known as \"republican motherhood.\"These women involved in the Revolution instilled in their children the virtues on which a republican form of government was believed to rest –wisdom, honestly, loyalty and a compassion for ones fellow citizens. They believed this was best achieved through education, which brought about an unprecedented emphasis on increasing the opportunities for female education during the postwar era. <br /> <br /> Do you enjoy camping? Can you imagine being in rugged wilderness conditions for weeks at a time? With the American lines less than two miles away, how did it feel to be a solider or camp follower in the British army during those 16 days after the Battle of Freeman's Farm? Would you be anxious for action? Nervous? Exhausted from building fortifications? Homesick?</p>",

How were thousands of men, women, and children organized into an encampment and what where their living conditions like? <br /> <br /> There were standard British military regulations for the layout of field camps. In \"An Essay on Castrametation\" by Lewis Lochée in 1778 gave detailed descriptions. For example, the camps had parade grounds in the front for troop formations. Near this were rows of wedge-shaped tents for soldiers. Women and children, sutlers, wagons and equipment would have been at the rear of the camp. <br /> <br /> The same style of linen canvas tent the soldiers occupied was typically assigned to men, women and children as well. These tents, with no bottoms, had a supporting frame of two upright wooden poles and a cross pole, and were staked to the ground. To carry away rain, small trenches were sometimes dug around tent rows. The size of those tents would be comparable to a two person tent by today’s standards. Imagine how crowded those tents were with four to six soldiers each! <br /> <br /> Of course, no cooking, defecating, or garbage in or near the tents was permitted. Latrines, or \"necessaries\" as they were called, would be located on the edge of a gully or cliff if such existed. Otherwise, they were essentially pit toilets, with regimental necessaries being dug every four days or less and located no nearer than 300 feet from the nearest occupied tent. <br /> <br /> Just to your left is the area where the 9th Regiment of Foot, consisting mostly of men from Ireland, was encamped. In line next to them was the 21st Regiment of Foot, consisting mostly of men from Scotland. These were just part of the nearly 8000 troops composing Burgoyne's army, that arrived in this general area in September of 1777. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine so many people in these tranquil woods today?</p>",

They had only two ways to send a message; word of mouth, or a written message, either of which had to be sent with a messenger. That's right, no e-mail, cell phones, no radios, not even telegraphs! <br /> <br /> Certainly, there were also spies, and both sides used them, often for gaining information about an enemy or circumstances ahead of one's own army. British General Simon Fraser, as one example, made many payments to individuals in exchange for scouting and spying services. And yes, the American Revolution also had its share of secret messages hidden in everyday objects, like buttons, bullets, or clothes, or messages encrypted by clever codes or hidden in plain sight and only revealed by a chemical treatment. <br /> <br /> Of course, the punishment for spying was severe –execution by hanging. Perhaps the most infamous American traitor, General Benedict Arnold, was guilty of smuggling critical military information to the British –he was spying. Yet that wasn’t until 1780. During the Battles of Saratoga, Arnold was still on the American side. In fact, Arnold was considered by his troops as a man of great bravery and valor. <br /> <br /> So what happened? Answering that requires taking another step back in time. But even then, it’s complicated. In 1775, Arnold helped lead a daring mission to take over remote Fort Ticonderoga from the British. Credit for the victory went to Vermont militia commander Ethan Allan, with whom Arnold shared command. Arnold perceived this as a slight to his honor, the first among many that were yet to come.<br /> <br /> In early 1777, Arnold was passed over for promotion, as five other Brigadier Generals were promoted to Major General, leaving Arnold behind. A few months later, he gathered a militia force and repelled some British invaders from central Connecticut, which won him his promotion, but did not restore his seniority –he was still subordinate to those other five Major Generals. <br /> <br /> Here at Saratoga, Arnold suffered yet another blow to his ego. After the battle of Freeman's Farm on September 19th, a series of arguments with General Gates ensued, ranging from the unauthorized expense of public money to Arnold's anger over not being mentioned in dispatches back to the President of Congress, John Hancock. Gates decided to ignore Arnold’s further complaints, advice, and his very presence within the army. Arnold took it personally. <br /> <br /> Two weeks later, on Oct. 7, as Burgoyne's forces made a movement closer to the American lines, the Americans launched an attack. Joining this attack, Arnold rode to the field of battle and took part in the ensuing fight, culminating in the successful capture of the Breymann Redoubt. Severely wounded in the left leg just as the redoubt was being taken, and described as \"gallant\" in the report to President Hancock by Gates himself, Congress afterward decided to restore Arnold's seniority. <br /> <br /> Capturing Breymann Redoubt led to a British retreat, and the retreat led to the British surrender. General Horatio Gates, as the commanding American officer, was credited with the American victory –a reality that no doubt aggravated Arnold as he lay for months in Albany, and later in Connecticut, recovering from his leg wound. <br /> <br /> His leg healed, but his anger festered. <br /> <br /> In summer 1778, George Washington sent the now hobbling Arnold to Philadelphia to help stabilize the city in the wake of a British retreat from the area. While there, he met and eventually married Peggy Shippen, a much younger woman with Loyalist sentiments, and who infamously facilitated his contact with British intelligence officer, Major John André. <br /> <br /> As allegations of his conduct surfaced, Arnold requested a change of command that would put him back in New York as Commandant of West Point. Arnold and his wife felt that the powers-that-be never fully appreciated his actions or his service, and that the British might offer better treatment. He arranged to meet in secret with Major André, the head of British Intelligence in America. <br /> <br /> Arnold devised a plan to give over the defenses at West Point –the pride of the Continental Army and the key to advancing up the Hudson River. The information wouldn't be without cost, though: Arnold demanded 30,000 pounds-sterling in exchange, but would only receive 10,000 pounds-sterling, or nearly one million American dollars today. <br /> <br /> Arnold gave André detailed information including troop movements, maps and weapon locations. André was captured in route with the plans hidden in his boot and Arnold's betrayal was revealed. Had Arnold not chosen to betray the American cause, he may have been remembered as one of the greatest heroes of the Revolution. Instead, Arnold fled West Point, and set sail on HMS <i>Vulture </i>to New York City where he was made a British Brigadier General. He then fought against American forces in America for the rest of the war, and died in England in June of 1801. <br /> <br /> Once known as General Washington’s \"fighting General,\" he had become America’s worst betrayer. <br /> <br /> While today we have weapons of mass destruction that could conceivably destroy the entire population, what types of weapons did the armies use during the Revolutionary War and what sorts of damage could they inflict?</p>",

Several surgeons were busily employed during the night extracting bullets and performing other surgical operations.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">–Samuel Woodruff,<br /> Connecticut Militia </p> </blockquote> <p>Revolutionary War weaponry was very effective in killing or wounding soldiers. Amputations, infections and soldiers perishing in the crude field hospitals were all too common. <br /> <br /> What types of weapons were used here in these battles? The largest proportion of soldiers used muskets, which fired a single lead musket ball, or a combination of \"buck and ball,\" one full-size musket ball with a few smaller musket balls. <br /> <br /> Muskets were smooth-bore firearms, meaning their barrels were smooth inside and therefore were not very accurate. However, it was relatively easy to learn the dozen or so steps to load and fire a musket, a well trained soldier could fire his musket 3-4 times per minute. Multiplied by several dozen soldiers, this produced an intimidating volume of gunfire. <br /> <br /> A smaller number of soldiers used rifles, such as troops in Colonel Daniel Morgan's corps, one of the units George Washington had detached from his army. These were much more accurate, as the rifling, or spiral grooves along the length of their bores, made a musket ball spin like a well-thrown football. This also gave a rifle far greater range than a musket, allowing a trained shooter to hit a target two to three hundred yards, or two to three football fields, away. <br /> <br /> Rifles required more training to use and more time to load and fire –about one to two minutes between shots. And they were generally not fitted for bayonets. This made rifles better suited to small unit actions such as scouting and skirmishing. <br /> <br /> There were three types of artillery pieces used in the Revolutionary War: cannons, howitzers and mortars. In their day these were the most powerful, damaging, and far reaching human controlled weapons. <br /> <br /> Cannons, the most frequently used artillery pieces, fired a solid, non-exploding, iron cannonball. It was the velocity and the mass of a cannon ball smashing through targets that made cannons so destructive. Cannons were named for the weight of the cannonball they fired, and here at Saratoga, 3, 6, and 12 pound cannons were used. Depending on their size, it took a crew of approximately 6-12 soldiers to man one cannon. Loading and firing cannons was dangerous, exhausting and deafening work. <br /> <br /> Mortars and howitzer, by comparison, were shorter, stubbier tubes which fired hollow, exploding shells on a high arc. These artillery pieces were usually used in stationary situations like defending a redoubt, or for the lengthy siege of fortifications. <br /> <br /> Artillery had an important place here at Saratoga and influenced the initial success, and ultimate defeat of the British army here. On September 19th, it was the Germans' arrival on the field along with two 6-pound cannons that prevented an almost certain British defeat that day at the hands of the Americans. In contrast, some of Burgoyne's own artillery, captured from his army in battle on October 7th, was used against him north of here at Saratoga —present-day Schuylerville.<br /> <br /> Hear the distant echo of the cannons firing? We are coming upon the scene of the second battle of Saratoga. Keep walking to hear some details of that fateful day...</p>",

Plagued by severe supply shortages, desertions and faced with the onset of colder weather, he was forced to take the initiative. <br /> <br />  At mid-day on October 7th, 1,500 officers and men commanded by Generals Burgoyne, Philips, von Riedesel and Fraser marched out of camp along wooded roads which led them into Simeon Barber's farm field.

This would leave a mixed group of only 200 Brunswick grenadiers, jaegers, and Loyalists to defend it. </p> <p>After General Fraser’s corps was stopped that afternoon in the wheatfield, most of the survivors retreated to the stronger Balcarres Redoubt, which was closer. The Breymann was then seriously undermanned. While the British and Germans retreated into their works, fresh American troops arrived from the American camp at Bemis Heights. </p> <p>Brigadier General John Patterson’s brigade, one of John Glover’s regiments, and the 5th and 6th Massachusetts from John Nixon’s brigade brought the number of Americans on the battlefield to more than 8,000. While General Poor’s men fought and died in front of the stronger Balcarres Redoubt, General Learned’s and Colonel Morgan’s men, reinforced by the fresh Massachusetts regiments, deployed to attack Burgoyne’s right flank, consisting of the Germans in the Breymann Redoubt and two companies of Canadian militia in the log cabins between the redoubt and the Freeman Farm. </p> <p>The Canadians were soon driven from their posts, exposing the left and rear of Colonel Breymann’s position. The Americans then mounted a massive attack on the Germans. While most of the men stormed the front of the redoubt, a part of General Learned’s command and some riflemen swept through the gap left by the Canadians and into the Germans’ rear. </p> <p>During the final minutes of the attack, as remnants of Colonel Breymann’s corps made their last, desperate stand, General Arnold, who had been leading Poor’s troops in a series of futile and costly attempts to carry the Balcarres Redoubt, heard the firing on his left and joined a party of riflemen firing into the Germans from the rear. Just as the defense collapsed, he suffered a leg wound, now memorialized by the famous Boot Monument on the battlefield. </p> <p>Colonel Breymann, desperately trying to prevent his men from fleeing at sword-point, was shot, many believe by his own men. Darkness ended the day’s fighting. </p> <p>Possession of the Breymann Redoubt opened the right and rear of Burgoyne’s camp to the Americans. That night, leaving their campfires burning, the Royal Army withdrew under cover of darkness to the Great Redoubt overlooking the river road, where lay their hospital, artillery park, and supply depot. </p> <p>Along the path, on the southern end of the redoubt, is the granite Boot Monument. The inscription on one side details the actions of General Benedict Arnold at the Breymann Redoubt. The other side is a relief carving of a left boot draped over a cannon barrel, muzzle down, a sign of defeat or disgrace. The boot is topped with a Major General’s two-star epaulette and a crown with laurel wreath. General Arnold’s name does not appear on the monument.</p>",

Be prepared! Wear sturdy shoes, bring water, snacks, bug spray, and sunscreen! If you want a shorter trail, make sure to follow the Liason Trail for a 2 mile hike. <br /> <br /> Along the trail, listen to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sara/learn/photosmultimedia/wilkinson-trail-audio-tour.htm\">Wilkinson Trail Audio Tour</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sara/learn/photosmultimedia/wilkinson-trail-kid-s-audio-tour.htm\">Kid's Audio Tour</a> and retrace the same path where soldiers marched to and from battle.</p> <h4>The Wilkinson Trail and a Wilkinsons' Tale</h4> <p>Well, there were at least two by that name who share some notoriety in the Battles of 1777.</p> <p>One was James Wilkinson, who served as a 20 year-old Lieutenant Colonel aide to the American commander, <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/horatio-gates.htm\">General Horatio Gates. </a>Wilkinson participated in many of the Revolution's early battles and his memoirs of 1816 have been heavily relied on by historians. However, Wilkinson’s contempt toward <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/benedict-arnold.htm\">Benedict Arnold</a> has called into question the objectivity of his accounts of Arnold's role in the battles here. How bad was it? Well, Gates and Wilkinson themselves had a major falling out in 1778 over the so-called Conway Cabal. In fact, this feud was far worse than the one between Wilkinson and Arnold. Because of this, there had to be more than just contempt toward Arnold as Wilkinson ended up disliking Gates even more on a personal level!</p> <p>Considered ambitious and self-serving, Wilkinson led a rather checkered career in politics and the military following the Revolution. He rose to the rank of Major General in the War of 1812. After his death in 1825, historians uncovered a treasonous arrangement he had with the Spanish government which had started in the late 1780s!</p> <p>Given his questionable career, why would the National Park Service name our primary hiking trail on the Battlefield for such a person?</p> <p>Well, they didn't. That honor goes to William Cumberland Wilkinson of the British Army. William C. came south with <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/john-burgoyne.htm\">General John Burgoyne's</a> invading army in 1777 as a Lieutenant in the 62d Regiment. By the time the army reached Saratoga much of its trained engineering cadre had either been captured or left behind on garrison assignment. Having special artistic and technical talent, this Wilkinson was tasked with mapmaking for the British Army. His maps are the basis for the trail named for him.</p> <p>William Wilkinson <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/sara/learn/historyculture/after-saratoga.htm\">surrendered with the defeated army</a> and was ultimately paroled in 1780 returning to British service until his retirement from the army in 1786. His maps are technically and artfully detailed renderings of the British (northern) portion of the Battlefield. The American works to the south were largely unknown to the British. Wilkinson's collected maps are now housed at the Library of Congress.</p> <p>For more information</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/us-history-biographies/james-wilkinson\">James Wilkinson</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.62ndregiment.org/William_Wilkinson.htm\">William C.

You are welcome to use the picnic tables for cold meals or snacks, and caution you that no fires are permitted in this area. Barbecue grills are provided in the picnic area near the Visitor Center parking lot. The trail, which begins to the right of this parking lot, is a one-mile loop leading down below these heights. </p> <p>A very picturesque section of the 1820s Champlain Canal is at the bottom, and wayside exhibits mark the British general hospital, artillery park, and the house where General Fraser died. </p> <p>Though it is a pleasant and informative walk, the return will be steep enough to cause some visitors difficulty. Benches are provided for resting, but no drinking water is available on the trail. There are wayside exhibits just down the path to the southeast that indicate the second of three fortifications that made up what was known as the Great Redoubt. </p> <p>After the battle of October 7th, Burgoyne’s army drew itself up into these works and the area immediately below, preparing to retreat northward. It was to a small house below, occupied by Madame von Riedesel, wife of the General, that Brigadier General Simon Fraser was taken after being mortally wounded in the Barber Wheatfield that afternoon. </p> <p>Realizing death was near, he requested to be buried in the Great Redoubt the next day. Burgoyne complied with his trusted subordinate’s wishes, and in the company of his senior officers, attended the burial ceremony at sunset on October 8th, amidst a cannonading by the American guns. </p> <p>The British army would begin its retreat to Saratoga, today’s Schuylerville, 8 miles to the north, that night, under the cover of a rainstorm. The rainstorm continued through the 9th of October. </p> <p>As Burgoyne’s badly mauled army continued their retreat north through a sea of mud, General Gates’ soldiers drew and cooked rations and replenished their ammunition. On the 10th, the rain abated, and General Gates issued orders to start after the enemy. By 4 PM, they had arrived at Saratoga to find the British encamped on the heights beyond Fish Creek, entrenched and ready to defend themselves. </p> <p>The American army then deployed to surround the British. A ring of 5 brigades under Generals Poor, Patterson, Learned, Nixon, and Glover pinned Burgoyne’s army against the Hudson from the west. Colonel Morgan’s riflemen blocked the way north. General John Fellows’ 3,000 militia occupied the east side of the river, preventing escape to that side. The remnants of the British army were under constant cannon and musket fire for the next 3 days. </p> <p>On October 13th, General Burgoyne, on the advice of his subordinates, sent a message to General Gates proposing a “cessation of arms during the time necessary to communicate the preliminary terms by which, in any extremity, he and the army mean to abide.” The terms were agreed upon, and at 10:00 on October 17th, the British army marched out of its camp, carrying their arms in strict formation, as the musicians played the “Grenadiers’ March.” </p> <p>On the parade, near the ruins of old Fort Hardy, the gallant soldiers of the Crown parked their cannon, deposited their muskets, and emptied their cartridge boxes in the presence of only two American officers. The “Convention Army” then crossed Fish Creek and marched between the lines of the victorious Americans, who showed not the slightest sign of disrespect. </p> <p>At noon, General Burgoyne and his officers were escorted to General Gates’ marquee. Burgoyne removed his hat, bowed, and pronounced “General, the fortune of war has made me your prisoner.” Gates replied “You will always find me ready to testify that it was not brought about by any fault of your Excellency.” Then, in view of both armies, General Burgoyne stepped back, drew his sword, and presented it to General Gates, who received and returned it. </p> <p>As the British army marched away into captivity, the principal officers of both armies retired to the marquee to dine. Thus would end one of the most dramatic episodes of the American Revolution. With the surrender of Burgoyne’s army at Saratoga, now Schuylerville, on October 17th, 1777, the first British to ever surrender in the field, the world would sit up and take notice. </p> <p>Early the following year, the French court, convinced of the sincerity of the American quest for independence, and encouraged at their prospects of achieving it, would openly declare war on Great Britain. The subsequent flow of French arms, equipage, an army, and a navy would make possible the ultimate American victory almost 4 years later at Yorktown on October 19th, 1781. Saratoga would take its place in history as the “Turning Point of the American Revolution.”</p>",

To your left, 8 miles up the river, is Saratoga, and the working estate of General Philip Schuyler. It’s Schuylerville today. </p> <p>From this direction, advancing from the north, is General John Burgoyne, in command of 7000 British, German, Canadian, and Tory soldiers, and their camp followers. The artillery train consisted of 41 guns and mortars of various calibers. </p> <p>His advance from the north, down the Richelieu River, Lake Champlain, to Skenesboro, through Fort Ann and down the Hudson River, was part of Burgoyne’s grand strategy. The plan called for the advance of two armies from Montreal to New York to effect a juncture at Albany. Such a move would establish a chain of strong points from the St. Lawrence to the Atlantic, isolating New England, the stronghold of the rebellion, from the rest of the colonies. </p> <p>As the main army advanced towards Crown Point and Ticonderoga, Colonel Barry St. Leger would lead an additional force of 1000 Loyalists, Regulars, and Indians down the St. Lawrence and through the Great Lakes to provide a diversion on the Mohawk River. </p> <p>To your right is Bemis Heights, occupied by the Continental Army, 7000 strong under Major General Horatio Gates. General Gates took over command of the Northern Department of the American Army on August 19th. By early September, he had matured a strategy for defeating General Burgoyne. </p> <p>The army had moved northward to the heights behind Jotham Bemis’s tavern, where a bend in the river forced the road to Albany against the base of the hills. Here, under the direction of the 31 year old Polish engineer, Colonel Taddeusz Kosciuszko, the Americans built entrenchments that blocked the road and fortified the bluffs. The main line of entrenchments stretched from a ravine behind the bluff to the John Neilson farm on the crest of the heights, then southwest for ¾ of a mile. </p> <p>Twenty two cannon were placed at strategic points. Pickets manned outposts north of the camp. Reinforcements arrived daily. The army would more than double in size over the next few weeks. The Americans were ready. The next step was up to Burgoyne. </p> <p>As you leave the parking lot, make note of the ground cover and terrain along the sides of the tour road. The park lands today are managed according to a historic base map, and closely resemble their appearance of October 8th, 1777, the day after the Second Battle.</p>",

The white posts with blue tops indicate the outline of the American fortifications erected in the fall of 1777.</p> <p>Looking up the ridge in front of you, imagine walls made of horizontal logs with earth packed against the outside, where you see the white stakes. Down the slope, about where we are parked, would have been an abatis of felled trees with their branches sharpened to form a kind of 18th-century barbed wire.</p> <p>This was the left or western-most flank of the American camp on Bemis Heights. It was this flank, obscured by the heavy forest, that was General Burgoyne’s objective on both September 19th and October 7th, 1777. </p> <p>Burgoyne hoped that by moving inland from the river road, he could avoid the strong American works that would have made further movement down the river a bloody endeavor. It would be better, he determined, to sweep around the American left and on to Albany with little resistance. The heavy forest you have driven through and effective American patrols prevented any reconnaissance of this area by Burgoyne’s scouts. <br /> <br /> On September 19th, 1777, the men who were encamped here advanced to intercept the British and their German allies, in the clearing 1 miles north of these works, at Freeman’s Farm. <br /> <br /> From the parking lot, looking up at the ridge, you can see the small red farmhouse of young John and Lydia Neilson, who established this farm in 1777. During the time of the battles, John, a sergeant in the local regiment of militia, was engaged in moving various officers’ baggage with a cart and a team of oxen. He had moved Lydia somewhere south of Stillwater to be out of harm’s way.</p> <p>The house survived because of its occupation by Generals Benedict Arnold and Enoch Poor. It served as bedroom, dining room, and office for the generals, and that is how it is furnished today, with the personal effects of officers in the field.</p> <p>The Nelson's returned after the battles and returned the land to farming, successfully raising 8 children here. Some of their descendents still live in the area. <br /> <br /> You might enjoy a walk up the path, which is furnished, and opened most days in the summer. Wayside exhibits at the top give an idea of the layout of the American camp. On days the house is open, it is staffed by a park ranger who will be glad to explain, in depth, the people and the events that made this area significant. The rangers here are sometimes outfitted as Army of the United States soldiers and are pleased to explain what they can of the soldiers’ experience. <br /> <br /> The furnishings of the Neilson House make an interesting contrast with those of the modern military headquarters. Officers tried to maintain a semblance of the lifestyle to which they were accustomed, and brought with them camp chests filled with the decanters and wine glasses that are seen on the tables. The cumbersome camp cots or rope beds can be seen in place of their more practical counterparts. The crudely drawn map on the table is a replica of one drawn by Colonel Rufus Putnam of the 5th Massachusetts Regiment while here in Saratoga. No elaborate communications devices can be seen. In their place is the duty drummer at the front door who would beat the proper commands when necessary.</p> <p>This ridge was the scene of hectic activity during September and October 1777. More than 1200 men of General Poor’s brigade, consisting of 3 New Hampshire regiments, and 2 from New York, were encamped just south of the Neilson House, to your right. A few hundred yards further along this ridge to the south stood the headquarters of Major General Horatio Gates, the house belonging to Captain Ephraim Woodworth of the local militia. His barns housed the American field hospital.</p> <p>Just north of the Neilson House, in the apex of the American lines, was the camp of Colonel Daniel Morgan’s rifle corps, with the light infantry of Major Henry Dearborn. They would be the first to sally forth to meet the approaching enemy.</p> <p>The granite monument at the head of the parking lot commemorates the services of Colonel Taddeusz Kosciuszko, the young Polish engineer who laid out the American line. The stone obelisk west of the parking lot is a memorial to the American dead, placed here by the Daughters of the American Revolution.</p>",

These bluffs provide a fairly sheer drop of over 100 feet to the narrow flood plain and the river bed below. Earthworks on the plain below would block any movement south along the river or the road. </p> <p><br /> These works were manned by the Massachusetts troops of General John Glover’s brigade. Glover’s men were the most recent reinforcements to the American army, and were some of the steadiest veterans. <br /> Fortifications and artillery placed on the heights, where you are now, protected the works below, and were in turn protected by works on another height just to the south. British scouts could see this formidable interlocking system, and persuaded General Burgoyne that testing them would be folly. </p> <p><br /> This is where Kosciuszko’s skill as a military engineer was first appreciated. This part of the American lines on top of the bluff was occupied by the Massachusetts men of General John Nixon’s brigade, and detachments of Major Ebenezer Stevens’ artillery. Stevens’ men manned a hodgepodge of 22 artillery pieces of varying sizes, both iron and bronze, and spread out all along the American works. </p> <p><br /> You may wish to leave your car and walk up to the gun platforms, in order to see the ground below from the point of view of the American gunners.

They played a supportive role in the action that occurred here. The monument was placed here by the Sons of the American Revolution.<br /> <br /> A short walk up the path to the wayside exhibit provides an excellent view of this farm field where critical fighting occurred. The exhibits have paintings which depict the fighting here.<br /> <br /> (NARRATOR)<br /> In front of this small rise is a small field bisected by a road running east and west. The northern half of the field was ringed with a worm fence, and contained a small farmhouse, which the Germans referred to as the Weiser House. The southern part of the field was planted with corn, referred to by some Europeans as “Turkish wheat.” Further west was a small strip of brushy woods; then, another field can be seen.<br /> <br /> On October 7th, General Burgoyne ordered a reconnaissance in force to probe the American position from the high ground west of the Neilson Farm. If conditions proved favorable, he would launch an all-out attack on the 8th. If not, he would retreat, and try to save his army. It was a gamble, but Burgoyne was proud, brave, and an old gamester.<br /> <br /> The probing force was carefully chosen for mobility and shock power. From General Simon Fraser’s advanced corps came the British grenadiers and Light Infantry, Burgoyne’s elite units, and the 24th Regiment. Also, from the advanced corps came the German jaegers, chausseurs and grenadiers, men who would have been the pride of any European army. Men from the Hannau, Rhetz, von Riedesel, and Specht regiments were drafted from the German General Baron Frederick Adolph von Riedesel’s division. Brigadier General Hamilton’s division contributed men from the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd British Regiments. Ten cannons served by 107 artillerymen accompanied the column.<br /> <br /> Over 1700 officers and men, including General Burgoyne himself, marched out of the camp, leaving the remaining forces to man the fortifications and await the outcome of the probing action. When the advanced guard reached a point west of the Barber Farm, the column halted. While officers tried to scan the American works through the telescopes from the cabin’s roof and soldiers foraged for grain in the abandoned fields, the British forces dressed into lines behind the worm fence.<br /> <br /> The British front, which extended from the woods west of the Barber Farm to the southern fringe of the Freeman Farm was mostly open, but the flanks rested in the woods. James Wilkinson, the American Deputy Adjutant General, reported the British position to General Gates saying, “They are foraging and endeavoring to reconnoiter your left, and I think, sir, they offer you battle.”<br /> <br /> Gates asked, “What is the nature of the ground, and what’s your opinion?” Wilkinson replied, “Their front is open and their flanks rest on woods under cover of which they might be attacked. Their right is skirted by a lofty height. I would indulge them.” “Well then, order on Morgan to begin the game,” Gates answered.<br /> <br /> The American attack opened between 2:30 and 3:30 PM. Colonel Morgan’s corps of riflemen and light infantry under Major Henry Dearborn struck the British right, composed of General Fraser’s light infantry and the 24th Regiment.<br /> <br /> (Drum beats and battlefield noises in the background)<br /> <br /> General Enoch Poor’s brigade of New Hampshire men and New Yorkers moved up through the brushy woods behind him and attacked the British grenadiers and the units of General Hamilton’s division.General Ebenezer Learned’s target was the Germans in the center of the column. Learned’s brigade was soon supported by Brigadier General Ten Broeck’s brigade of Albany militia and a regiment from Jonathan Warner’s brigade of Massachusetts militia.<br /> <br /> General Poor’s men soon overwhelmed the greatly outnumbered British grenadiers whose commander, Major John Dyke Acland, fell badly wounded. Burgoyne’s aide, Lieutenant Sir Francis Clerke, was mortally wounded while trying to pass his general’s orders to retreat.<br /> <br /> Captain George Pausch of the German artillery, while directing the service of his two 6-pound cannons in a desperate attempt to hold back the American onslaught with canister shot, as if they were two large shotguns, suddenly noticed that his supporting infantry had been driven off. After a gallant scuffle to save his guns, he and his artillerymen were forced to abandon them.<br /> <br /> General Fraser’s veterans began to fall before the deadly accuracy of Morgan’s Pennsylvania and Virginia riflemen, who fired from the woods west of the Barber Farm. As the British right was rolled back, General Fraser rode among his men, encouraging and rallying them to maintain their ranks, keep up their fire and make the Americans pay dearly for every foot of ground.<br /> <br /> But the Scotsman’s efforts were in vain. He could not stop the turning movement. The gallant General Fraser came under the heavy fire of the American riflemen and fell mortally wounded.While Colonel Morgan and General Poor drove back the enemy’s flanks, General Learned’s brigade struck the Germans who, with both flanks exposed, stubbornly fought them off. In the midst of the attack, Benedict Arnold rode onto the field, and though he had no command, and was confined to camp due to an altercation with his commander, General Gates, led a second assault that caused the Germans to join the general retreat to the Balcarres Redoubt.<br /> <br /> (Gunfire in the background)<br /> <br /> By 5 PM the British probing column had lost 8 cannon and had suffered more than 400 casualties. Burgoyne’s advance was thwarted, but behind the strong walls of the Balcarres Redoubt, his soldiers could put up a stiff fight, as Poor’s men would discover.</p>",

A black-topped, looped trail leads south from the parking lot, past “Bloody Knoll,” the cannon platforms on the southern end of Balcarres Redoubt, the Freeman Farmhouse site, which is near the cannons in front of you, and back to the parking lot. </p> <p>The wayside exhibits and audio units depict the area as it was during the battles, and the entire loop is wheelchair accessible. It totals 500 yards. As this is one of the most significant areas in the battlefield story, you may choose to take this trail. If so, you may want to hang up, and call back with the code 66 when you’ve reached a point at which you would like to stop. The narrator will pick up the story where we’ve left off. Or, you can continue to listen from your current location. </p> <p>(Stop 66) John Freeman and his family established this small farm about 11 years before the battle. Of loyalist sympathies, Freeman had to abandon the farm and move his family to Canada. He returned with Burgoyne as a member of a Loyalist regiment, known as Jessup’s Corps. His small cabin stood just beyond the two artillery pieces you see on the left. </p> <p>We are a little more than a mile north of the American lines, and about the same distance from the Hudson, to the east. </p> <p>On September 19th General Burgoyne advanced, deploying a 3-column movement toward the American position, whose extent and strength were unknown to him. </p> <p>General Fraser commanded the right column, composed of the German and British light infantry, grenadiers, loyalists, Canadians, and 12 guns. </p> <p>The center column, led by General Hamilton, consisted of 1600 men with 4 cannon, including the battalion companies of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd Regiments of the British line. Burgoyne accompanied this element. </p> <p>The left column was commanded by General von Riedesel, and included the German regiments of von Riedesel, Specht, von Rhetz, Hesse-Hanau, dragoons, light infantrymen known as chasseurs and jaegers, 6 battalion companies of the British 47th Regiment, and 8 cannon. The Germans had been sent to American by contracts between their duke and King George III of England, who was also the Elector of Hanover, one of many German city-states. </p> <p>General Fraser’s column marched along the road running westward from the river road to a point 3 miles from the river, and then turned southward. Hamilton’s column followed Fraser’s a short distance, turned south at the first road, and marched to the Great Ravine, crossed it, and moved west to a point north of the Freeman Farm. General von Riedesel’s column marched out along the river road. When the columns reached their assigned positions, a signal gun would coordinate a simultaneous movement against the Americans. </p> <p>Learning of the enemy’s movements, General Gates ordered Colonel Daniel Morgan’s rifle corps and Major Henry Dearborn’s light infantry battalion to reconnoiter the woods and fields of the American lines. They were followed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments from General Enoch Poor’s brigade. </p> <p>At about noon, part of Morgan’s corps fired upon and killed or wounded most of the advanced guard of General Hamilton’s column in the Freeman Farm clearing. The riflemen rushed forward to pursue the survivors, and ran head-on into the main body of Hamilton’s division. The British drove Colonel Morgan’s men south of the farm, where they scattered. </p> <p>Morgan was chagrinned by the sudden disorganization of his command, but with the persistent use of his turkey call he rallied the men and deployed on the fringe of the farm clearing. After a brief lull, during which the New Hampshire regiments joined the riflemen, the fight resumed. </p> <p>As it intensified, other regiments of General Poor’s brigade, followed by Brigadier General Ebenezer Learned’s brigade and the 10th Massachusetts Regiment, from Brigadier General John Patterson’s brigade, were committed. Morgan’s riflemen and General Poor’s troops bore the brunt of the fight, while the other troops faced General Fraser, preventing him from going to General Hamilton’s support. </p> <p>For more than 3 hours, the battle rolled back and forth across the weed-grown, stump-studded farm. The American troops, most of whom were veterans regulars, deployed, attacked, retreated, and rallied in a disciplined and soldierly manner. The British regiments upheld the great traditions of their service, counterattacking again and again with the bayonet, against increasingly heavy odds. But all their gallantry and skill were inadequate to counter the Americans’ numerical advantage and superior firepower. </p> <p>At around 6 PM, in response to an urgent order from General Burgoyne, General von Riedesel’s Germans appeared from the east, colors flying, singing hymns. Fresh troops from the Regiments von Riedesel, von Rhetz, and Pausch’s Hesse-Hanau artillery engaged the American right in support of the slowly retreating British. The newly reinforced ground forces rallied, delivering yet another bayonet charge, and at dusk, the Americans withdrew to their fortification on Bemis Heights. </p> <p>Both sides claimed victory. Burgoyne remained on the field of battle. Gates still blocked the road to Albany. </p> <p>The British would spend the next 17 days erecting fortifications facing those of the Americans. Their western flank would be protected by two redoubts. One would be a very formidable work, its outline appearing as white posts with red tops. It would become known as the Balcarres’ Redoubt, after Major Alexander Lindsay, the Earl of Balcarres, who commanded the light infantry defending this work. Built of horizontal logs, it was nearly 500 yards long, and mounted 8 cannon. It was to this position that most of the survivors of the fighting in the Wheatfield on October 7th fled.</p>",

The structure to your right is a restroom. The path to your left leads to the Breymann Redoubt site and the famous Benedict Arnold “Boot” Monument. </p> <p>As at our other tour stops, there are wayside exhibits and audio units depicting the assault on the Breymann Redoubt.

If you choose to do so, hang up and call the tour back when you are ready, and enter the code 77 into your keypad to pick up where we leave off. Otherwise, allow the recording to continue. </p> <p>(Stop 77) The British army dug in after the fighting of the first battle on September 19th. Their western flank would be protected by two outworks known as “redoubts.” The larger of the two, the Balcarres Redoubt, was erected on the Freeman Farm, a little more than 500 yards south of here at Stop 6. That strong work was described earlier. </p> <p>The second, known as the Breymann Redoubt, after Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich C. Breymann, commander of the Brunswick grenadiers, ran roughly north and south along the crest of the rise to your left. It was of lighter construction, apparently rail-like logs piled between uprights, with no earth packed against the outside. Mounting two 6-pounder cannon, it was about 300 yards long. </p> <p>On the morning of October 7th, many of the Loyalists and Brunswickers manning this redoubt accompanied General Fraser’s corps, which was to again probe the American left. This would leave a mixed group of only 200 Brunswick grenadiers, jaegers, and Loyalists to defend it. </p> <p>After General Fraser’s corps was stopped that afternoon in the wheatfield, most of the survivors retreated to the stronger Balcarres Redoubt, which was closer. The Breymann was then seriously undermanned. While the British and Germans retreated into their works, fresh American troops arrived from the American camp at Bemis Heights. </p> <p>Brigadier General John Patterson’s brigade, one of John Glover’s regiments, and the 5th and 6th Massachusetts from John Nixon’s brigade brought the number of Americans on the battlefield to more than 8,000. While General Poor’s men fought and died in front of the stronger Balcarres Redoubt, General Learned’s and Colonel Morgan’s men, reinforced by the fresh Massachusetts regiments, deployed to attack Burgoyne’s right flank, consisting of the Germans in the Breymann Redoubt and two companies of Canadian militia in the log cabins between the redoubt and the Freeman Farm. </p> <p>The Canadians were soon driven from their posts, exposing the left and rear of Colonel Breymann’s position. The Americans then mounted a massive attack on the Germans. While most of the men stormed the front of the redoubt, a part of General Learned’s command and some riflemen swept through the gap left by the Canadians and into the Germans’ rear. </p> <p>During the final minutes of the attack, as remnants of Colonel Breymann’s corps made their last, desperate stand, General Arnold, who had been leading Poor’s troops in a series of futile and costly attempts to carry the Balcarres Redoubt, heard the firing on his left and joined a party of riflemen firing into the Germans from the rear. Just as the defense collapsed, he suffered a leg wound, now memorialized by the famous Boot Monument on the battlefield. </p> <p>Colonel Breymann, desperately trying to prevent his men from fleeing at sword-point, was shot, many believe by his own men. Darkness ended the day’s fighting. </p> <p>Possession of the Breymann Redoubt opened the right and rear of Burgoyne’s camp to the Americans. That night, leaving their campfires burning, the Royal Army withdrew under cover of darkness to the Great Redoubt overlooking the river road, where lay their hospital, artillery park, and supply depot. </p> <p>Along the path, on the southern end of the redoubt, is the granite Boot Monument. The inscription on one side details the actions of General Benedict Arnold at the Breymann Redoubt. The other side is a relief carving of a left boot draped over a cannon barrel, muzzle down, a sign of defeat or disgrace. The boot is topped with a Major General’s two-star epaulette and a crown with laurel wreath. General Arnold’s name does not appear on the monument.</p>",

It was located near a spring, no longer visible from the surface, but from which water for today’s Visitor Center is drawn. </p> <p>Between September 19th and October 7th, 1777, General Burgoyne occupied several large tents, known as “marquees,” using them as his office and headquarters, as well as his bedroom and dining room. Such an assemblage was common for general officers’ field headquarters in the 18th century. </p> <p>Spread out through the fields and woods on either side of you would have been the camps of the British 9th, 21st, 62nd, and 20th Regiments, with the Brunswick regiments von Riedesel and Specht, for a total of some 4,000 men. </p> <p>The soldiers would occupy small canvas “wedge” tents, roughly the size of a modern pup tent expected to shelter two people.

They would share the carrying of the tent poles, canvas, and kettle while on a march.

You will also see cannons and white marker posts tracing long-removed fortifications from the Revolutionary War battles fought here. On these grounds in 1777, determined American soldiers defeated a world class British army invading their homeland. <br /> <br /> This stunning victory spurred international allies to openly provide supplies and armed forces to the new Untied States, making it possible for America to ultimately win its independence. What you don’t see was arguably the most important element of the events that unfolded...the men, women and children on both sides of the conflict, some of whom were willing to make the supreme sacrifice for causes they believed in. <br /> <br /> The Battles of Saratoga were replete with a colorful cast of characters, political intrigue, sacrifice, and human drama. Walking the trail you will retrace the same paths where soldiers marched to and from battle, where determined souls overcame overwhelming odds, and where America’s fight for freedom breathed new life. <br /> <br /> Listen for the echoes of years gone by...let this trail be a journey into the past, and perhaps you may glimpse scenes of 18th-century America and the human stories and events surrounding the Battles of Saratoga.</p>",

They almost succeeded, but were stopped in the Battles of Saratoga just 7 miles south of Victory Woods. Beaten in battle, the British hoped to escape back to Canada with the remnants of their army.<br /> <br /> Retreating north to this area (present-day villages of Victory and Schuylerville), they halted and built defenses for protection against the pursuing American army. Surrounded, starved, exhausted, and outnumbered 3 to 1, the British surrendered on October 17, 1777.<br /> <br /> Here, in Victory Woods, is where the largest part of that army made its last stand. For one week British and loyalist American men, women, and children suffered helplessly in the filth of cold mud, excrement, and dead animals. They had little to eat and no hope of getting home.<br /> <br /> The American victory at Saratoga was not an ordinary one—it completely changed the nature of the Revolutionary War in favor of the United States, which finally won its fight for independence in 1783.<br /> <br /> It was in Victory Woods that British misery and depression turned into American victory and success.</p> <h4>Today</h4> <p>Although the retreating British army was here for only one week, these grounds should have been a treasure-trove of Revolutionary War artifacts. Yet, archaeologists working in 2005 found nothing left behind from the 2,500 British and loyalist Americans who were stationed here.<br /> <br /> Sadly, over the years, Victory Woods has been subjected to illegal ‘relic-hunting.’ This collecting of artifacts has robbed us all of information which contributes to our American Heritage. The scientific archaeological investigation here was severely compromised as a result of this looting activity.</p> <h4>Exploring Victory Woods</h4> <p>To explore Victory Woods, park at Saratoga Monument (handicapped parking available at the end of Monument Dr.) Signs will direct you to the nearby Victory Woods trailhead.<br /> <br /> White dots mark the trail as it extends south through Prospect Hill Cemetery, a private cemetery founded in the mid 1800s.<br /> <br /> As the trail exits the cemetery, it leads downhill to the Victory Woods boardwalk.

Often times, the men in my father’s regiment go days or even weeks without a proper washing. I then have to wash the dirty clothing of many men in the nearest stream. I often wish we were back in Ireland, where I only had to wash clothes for my landlord and his family. </p> <p>When it comes to food, I am grateful General Burgoyne allows some of the daily rations to be given to camp followers. Sadly, we are only given a quarter pound of salted beef or pork and a quarter pound of flour each day. The meat is so salty, and usually fatty and filled with bones, (<em>pause</em>) and sometimes has insects. It is often difficult to eat! </p> <p>Sometimes there is so little food, even for the soldiers in my father’s regiment, [<i>sounds of birds chirping</i>] we camp followers have to steal food from nearby farms and fields. We take wheat, corn, potatoes, turnips, whatever we can find. Mother always taught me it is wrong to steal, but steal we must if we are to eat.</p> <p>[<i>Sounds of a horse riding by.</i>]</p> <p>(<i>George</i>)<br /> As a gentleman volunteer with the Royal Artillery, I must help prepare my men for battle. We practice for hours each day so the cannon crews [<i>sound of a cannon blast</i>] know what to do in battle. Like other gentleman volunteers, [<i>some indistinct orders in the background</i>] I am sometimes assigned to Guard Duty. Many of the volunteers believe it is beneath their status.  [<i>Sounds of a horse-drawn wagon passing by.</i>] But a general order was issued saying we must take part in it. I personally find nothing wrong with the job. I am glad, however, I am able to dine with the officers. The food we eat is so much better than what the regular soldiers, or even the camp followers, receive. </p> <p>[<i>End of wagon passing, bird chirping.</i>]</p>",

Trapped in a hastily and poorly built camp, [<i>drumming ends</i>] with little food and even less shelter, they were surrounded by the Americans and forced to surrender just a few days later, on October 17th, 1777.<br /> <br /> What role did the American victory in the Battles of Saratoga play in the American Revolution? The Americans had very few victories in the early part of the war, making independence look nearly impossible. But the decisive American victory in the Battles of Saratoga greatly lifted American spirits and proved they had a real chance of winning the war. </p> <p>The next year, 1778, France declared war on England and joined the American Army in its fight against the British. That assistance helped guarantee the independence of the United States of America.</p> <p>(<i>Mary's voice</i>)<br /> But what happened to our two guides?</p> <p>(<i>George's voice</i>)<br /> Yeah, what happened?</p> <p>(<i>Narrator</i>)<br /> Good question! George Williams was a real twelve year old boy serving with General Burgoyne’s army here in New York. He retired from the American War at the age of nineteen, returned to England and enrolled in school at the Academy at Woolwich. After finishing school, he re-entered the army, joining the Twentieth Regiment, where he served for about twenty five years. After retiring, he married and lived out the rest of his life in Liverpool.</p> <p>Unlike George Williams, we have no official record of a Mary Morton. We only know about her father, Joseph Morton. Family records say he was one of many British soldiers who brought his family to join him here in America. There is no record of him bringing a daughter, so we created her character. Could he have had a daughter like Mary? It’s entirely possible!</p> <p>Joseph Morton was also one of many British soldiers who surrendered to American forces. He lived out the next four years with his family at a prisoner of war camp. His family did not return to Ireland after his capture. Instead, they continued living here in America. Sadly, Joseph died on August 12 1781. No one knows what happened to his family after that.  [<i>Colonial harpsichord music begins</i>] But many British soldiers, and their families, made new homes and new lives here in America. </p> <p>The Battles of Saratoga are not just names and dates in a textbook.

Parking is limited and fills quickly in the summer due to the popularity of the Bumpass Hell Trail. The trailhead is located at the northeast end of the parking area, near the entrance/exit. A scenic vista and vault toilets are located at the southwest end of the parking area. Water is not available at this location. This is one of the few areas of the park with cell service. </p> <h2><b>Brokeoff Volcano Vista</b></h2> <p>Drive to the far side of the parking area to reach the scenic vista. It is usually possible to pull to the side and hop out for a quick look, even when the parking area is full. A handful of waysides provide information about the eroded Brokeoff Volcano and its remnants visible today. Just below the waysides, a small rock terrace holds a lone bolder known as the glacial erratic. Lassen Peak is also clearly visible behind you.</p> <h2><b>Stargazing</b></h2> <p>This high-elevation parking area is one of the best locations in the park for stargazing. It is cold and often windy year-round in this exposed spot, so be sure to bring warm clothes and even blankets to enjoy the stars. There is plenty to see with your naked eye or a pair of binoculars. The Milky Way glows brightly on clear nights and often passes above Lassen Peak. Telescopes are welcome as well and can be enjoyed by all during the annual <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/dark-sky.htm\">Lassen Dark Sky Festival</a>. Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/stargazing.htm\">stargazing in the park</a>.

The first and largest avalanche covers about 2.5 square miles (6.8 square km) and created this undulating landscape.<br /> <br /> What caused the rock avalanches? Geologists believe that the dacite rock that forms Chaos Crags lava domes broke free. Years of freeze and thaw created cracks in the fragile rocks and weakened their bond. Steep-sided slopes allowed the loose rock to break free and rush downslope. Geologists describe the rocks here floating on a cushion of air during the avalanche. The rocks gained such high speeds, that air became trapped between the ground and rocks. With friction reduced, the rocks were able to flow very far. As they came to a rest on the edges of the flow, rocks in the center continued to move at a rapid rate, creating <em>frozen waves</em>.</p>",

The park highway winds around the lake's south and west shores and affords spectacular views of numerous volcanic peaks. Over 100 feet deep, this alpine lake can hold snow and ice well into the summer months. On calm days, its crystal clear waters offers a near-perfect reflection of the snow-capped Lassen Peak.</p> <h2>Scenic Views</h2> <p>The lake is clearly visible from a mile-long stretch of the park highway between the parking areas for Bumpass Hell and Lassen Peak Trails. Limited parking is available at the Lake Helen Picnic Area and small pullouts along the highway. Please use designated pullouts whenever possible. If space is limited, please do not drive or park on plants and be sure your vehicle is completely off the highway. A small pullout above the lake offers excellent sunset views to the southwest.</p> <h2>Picnic Area</h2> <p>A small picnic area is located on the southeast corner of the lake. Two vault toilets and a handful of picnic tables are available here. There is no drinking water available. </p> <h2>Swimming</h2> <p>The southern shore of the lake offers space for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/swimming.htm\">swimming</a>. This deep lake remains very cold year-round. All types of floating devices are <strong>not</strong> permitted on the lake to preserve the scenic view and crystal clear waters. Please do not drag or place equipment on plants. Lupine is often plentiful along the lakeshore, but is easily killed by footsteps or equipment.</p> <h2>Stay off Lake Ice</h2> <p>This high-elevation lake often holds snow or ice well into summer. Please stay off lake ice at all times. The lake is very deep and a falling through the ice could easily lead to hypothermia or drowning.</p>",

Many good photographs have been made of the volcano in action, but in another decade many of them will be lost or destroyed. It is necessary that a museum should be build so these pictures may be preserved indefinitely. </em>-B.F. Loomis, excerpt from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Pictorial_History_of_the_Lassen_Volcano/pU4OAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Pictorial%20history%20of%20the%20Lassen%20volcano&pg=PA1&printsec=frontcover&bsq=Pictorial%20history%20of%20the%20Lassen%20volcano\">Pictorial History of the Lassen Volcano</a>, 1926.<br /> <br /> The museum building was constructed of native stone and reinforced concrete, with 20 skylights set into the dome-shaped roof. The interior consisted of a main hall devoted primarily to geologic exhibits, including photographs that Loomis had made of the eruptions. A back wing featured mounted animal displays with background images Benjamin took and Estella hand-tinted.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Loomis also constructed the seismograph building, located near the front of the museum, out of different types of igneous rock. Inside, visitors could watch a seismograph in operation under glass as it recorded the Earth’s slightest movements, its pendulum-mounted needle inking tremulous lines across a perpetually revolving spool of paper.</p> <h2>An Extraordinary Gift</h2> <p>On February 4, 1929, B.F. and Estella Loomis signed the deed granting their 40-acre tract together with their museum and seismograph building as a gift to the national park. The initial boundaries of the park encompassed 82,800 acres (compared to 106,538 acres today) and excluded a number of privately owned land tracts. <br /> <br /> The donation became possible only after the act of Congress of January 19, 1929, extended the boundaries of the park to include the Manzanita Lake area. When the land and the buildings were deeded to the government in February 1929, few other national parks had museums and not one of these had been built and donated by private individuals. The gift of the museum vaulted Lassen Volcanic National Park into the first tier of parks with scientific and educational programs.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=06be7256-b0b2-407e-a5c0-c0758eea1e4b\">Loomis Museum was added to the National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP) in 1975. The building is included in the NRHP-listed <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=c9c94a53-9aa4-4aaf-b26b-0ef67ef84f9e\">Manzanita Lake Naturalist's Services Historic District</a>, which also includes the seismograph building, Loomis Residence, Manzanita Creek footbridge, the Naturalist's Residence, and the Manzanita Lake, Reflection Lake, and Lily Pond Trails.</p> <h2>The Loomis Residence</h2> <p>Shortly after Benjamin and Estella Loomis deeded their property to the national park, they sold their hotel in Viola and built a small summer across the present-day plaza from the museum. Under the terms of their gift deed, they retained the right to a lifetime lease on the property. The small lease was just big enough to accommodate their home and a photo and art store, in which they sold film, cameras, pictures, and postcards. B.F. lived until 1935. Upon her death in 1953, Estella donated the Loomis residence to the park.</p>",

        "notes": "Mount Harkness Fire Lookout\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/mount-harkness-fire-lookout.htm\n\n<p>Perched atop Mt. Harkness in the southeast corner of Lassen Volcanic National Park, Mount Harkness Fire Lookout has served as an active fire lookout and visitor destination since its construction in 1930. The rustic style two-story wood and stone structure sits at 8,046 feet elevation on the summit of an ancient shield volcano topped by a cinder cone. Visitors are able to access the summit and lookout by trail from either Juniper Lake or Warner Valley. The shortest and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/planyourvisit/hiking_mount_harkness.htm\">most popular trail</a> climbs 1.9 miles and 1,250 feet from Juniper Lake Campground to the summit. The sweeping vistas from the lookout span from the Three Sisters peaks in Oregon to the north, the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the south, and the Coast Range to the west. Fire staff reside in the lookout in the summer months and share information on the lookout and operations with visitors.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Mt. Harkness Fire Lookout was destroyed in the Dixie Fire in August 2021.</span></strong></p> <h2>A Model of NPS Rustic Architecture</h2> <p>Mount Harkness Fire Lookout and accompanying pit toilet were constructed primarily of local stone and wood in a style typical for National Park structures built in the 1920s and 1930s. The design philosophy centered on the use of local materials to make structures compatible with their environment and to achieve visual unity among different facilities. The lookout is unusual in comparison to the vast majority of fire lookouts and associated pit toilets in the United States, which are either of wood frame or steel construction. The top level is comprised of a single-room cabin, surrounded on four sides by a wooden catwalk and topped by a pitched wood shingle roof. A wooden staircase climbs the 12 feet to the catwalk and masonry of battered native stone extends from the ground to the windows on the upper floor.  </p> <h2>A Classic Fire Lookout</h2> <p>Mount Harkness Fire Lookout continues to use many of the station's original technology and systems. A report to the Director of the National Park Service described the newly constructed facility the year following its construction: </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"A fire-lookout station constructed during the season on top of Mount Harkness in Lassen Volcanic National Park is among the finest and best equipped in northern California. In addition to the usual maps and compasses, it contains an <a href=\"3a1b676c-13df-43af-b4b1-d8b9e17f5695\">Osborne fire finder</a> and a panoramic photograph mounted so that the location of the fire will be shown simultaneously on the photograph and the map when detected by the fire finder. This station serves a triple purpose. In addition to its importance in the fire prevention program of Lassen, it affords visitors, who may easily reach it by trail, an opportunity to view the country through powerful glasses, and it also contains a seismograph, which, in connection with two others, hourly records the slightest quivers of the earth.\"</p> <p>While some systems like the seismograph have since been replaced by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/nature/seismic-activity.htm\">digital seismic monitoring</a>, the fire observation tools have remained the same. Adopted in the 1850s, classic fire monitoring systems using maps and a compass function without electricity or Internet access (the lookout has neither). The building itself has seen a few upgrades over its many decades of service, including the addition of a weather monitoring station and radio repeater (powered by solar panels) and conversion from a wood to propane stove.</p> <h2>Maintaining a Historic Lookout</h2> <p>Extreme winters, rugged terrain, and regular use leave the Mount Harkness Fire Lookout in regular need of maintenance. In recent years, park staff and partners have replaced the roof and rehabilitated the original wooden doors and windows. In 2019, the park began a new rehabilitation project in partnership with <a href=\"https://historicorps.org/harkness-lookout-ca-2019/\">HistoriCorps</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to engaging volunteers on the rehabilitation of historic structures on publicly accessible lands. Between September 15 and 27 a group of HistoriCorps volunteers will work with park staff to remove and repoint failing mortar, replace deteriorated boards on the catwalk, and repair deteriorated window trim and door frames.<span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"> </span></span></span></span>The HistoriCorps crew will camp at Juniper Lake Campground and then hike up to the project site daily.<br />  </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",

In the late 1800s, the lake was lower in level and more indicative of a pond and was aptly named, Mud Lake. To attract more people to the area, a channel was dug to divert water from Manzanita Creek into Mud Lake. Trout were planted in the lake with an increased water level. For a few years, people paid the landowner to fish in the lake. Eventually, trout planting ceased.<br /> <br /> In 1926, park benefactor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/benjamin-franklin-loomis.htm\">Benjamin Franklin Loomis</a> purchased 40 acres, which included the lake. Reflection Lake was one location that Loomis captured photographs of the 1914-1945 Lassen Peak eruptions. Loomis and his wife Estella donated their 40 acres, the Loomis Museum, and the adjacent seismograph building to the park in 1929.<br /> <br /> A healthy population of native tui chub fish thrive in the warmer water. Fish stocking ended completely in the park in the early 1990s to preserve natural riparian ecosystems. As a result, the lake attracts water birds such as Canada geese, great blue heron, snowy egret, and kingfisher.</p> <h4>Reflection Lake Route</h4> <p>A half-mile route (not a defined trail) circles the lake and is a shorter alternative to the 1.8-mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/walkmanzanitalake.htm\">Manzanita Lake Loop</a>. The western shore offers unobstructed views of Chaos Crags and Lassen Peak, which are often reflected in the still lake.

Although named after the chemical element of sulfur—which is a byproduct of the hydrothermal system—the area bears the British English spelling of the word assigned by a pioneer that once laid claim to what was then known as Supan's Sulphur Works.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{83be7307-75cc-4348-b288-986ea486fc90}{28}\" paraid=\"1840149560\">Supan's Sulphur Works</h2> <p paraeid=\"{83be7307-75cc-4348-b288-986ea486fc90}{34}\" paraid=\"1487762954\">An Austrian immigrant and pioneer of the American West named Mathias B. Supan, extracted minerals from the ground here in the middle part of the nineteenth century. He refined sulfur and other elements into a variety of different products. Later, Supan's descendants filed a land claim for the area around the time Lassen Volcanic National Park was being created, and went on to develop Sulphur Works into a roadside attraction. Lassen Volcanic National Park acquired the Sulphur Works parcel from the Supan family in 1952.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{83be7307-75cc-4348-b288-986ea486fc90}{34}\" paraid=\"1487762954\">Inside a Volcano </h2> <p paraeid=\"{83be7307-75cc-4348-b288-986ea486fc90}{18}\" paraid=\"410351864\">Sulphur Works hydrothermal area sits at the center of a wide basin surrounded by towering volcanic peaks. Geologists have determined that the encircling peaks (Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Diller, Pilot Pinnacle, and Mount Conard) are all remnants of a large, eroded volcano called Brokeoff Volcano, or Mount Tehama. <br /> <br /> Similar to the nearby cone-shaped Mt. Shasta, the 11-mile-wide, 11,500-foot-tall volcano would have dominated the landscape. This composite volcano's eruptive period ended about 360,000 years ago. Ever since, the forces of erosion by wind, rain, ice, and hydrothermal activity have slowly broken apart and carried away Mount Tehama bit by bit, leaving the large erosional basin we see today. Sulphur Works hydrothermal system sits in the same general location as Mount Tehama's extinct central vent. Sulphur Works is part of the larger hydrothermal system in the park. Recent volcanic activity and the hydrothermal system are evidence that magma still lies beneath Lassen today.</p>",

Twenty-four miles of the 300-mile-long wagon route skirt through the northern edge of the park. Most of the original route in the park remains intact, with about 19 miles established as hiking trails. Nature has narrowed much of the trail, but faint wagon ruts are still visible in some locations. A cut through the forest across the road from this spot is one section of the route in the park.<br /> <br /> William H. Nobles created the Nobles Trail in 1852 when he joined the Gold Rush to California. The route was generally considered the easiest route into California. Pioneers traveled the route up until 1869 when the completion of the Central Pacific Railroad offered a new and easier method of travel.</p>",

        "notes": "\"The Hole\" of McKinley Station\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/dena-the-hole.htm\n\n<p>The area below the Riley Creek Railroad Bridge was off limits to the children of McKinley Station. Illicit traits of the \"Roaring 20s\"—bootlegging, alcohol distilling, gambling, violence, and prostitution—were centered here. U.S. Marshals made occasional raids, arresting distillers, madams, and their customers. Once bridge construction ended and that labor force drained away, many who had come to relieve workers of their pay moved on as well.<br /> <br /> Clustered here on land adjoining Morino’s original cabin site were three businesses: Donnelly's Restaurant, Mary Thompson’s Trading Post, and the McKinley Park Cigar Store. In the 1920s \"cigar stores,\" besides selling tobacco, were often contact points for prostitution, gambling and illegal liquor sales. Downstream a short distance was the cabin of John Coddy, a professional gold rush-era gambler.</p> <p>Thompson’s Trading Post was previously run by Klondike veteran Jack Cronin who operated it as a store and \"amusement place.\" His cabin, built by railroad workers in 1922, featured gambling, drinking, and other activities. When Cronin died in February 1923, Mary Murphy Thompson turned it into a trading post with an expanded inventory. She also did laundry and outfitted guided trips into the park and surrounding areas.</p> <p>Thompson came north with her husband and young son in 1913. After the birth of a daughter, and the death of her husband, she relocated to McKinley Station in 1922. Five years later, she sold out and moved to Suntrana near the Healy coal mines, where she opened another roadhouse and store catering to mine workers. She raised goats on her 15-acre \"goat ranch\" and earned the nickname, \"Goat Mary.\"</p> <p>Other small buildings dotted the large clearing. Stilt-legged caches kept fresh meat and supplies safe from roving animals. Fresh produce from two or three gardens supplemented purchased supplies. Chained sled dogs howled from the tops of doghouses. A team of horses required the owner to cut and dry summer grass for late season forage. The work was endless.</p> <p>As they aged, many of these jaded pioneers knew their chances of striking it rich were long gone. Given the isolation and limited economic opportunities of McKinley Station, the handful of people who settled here may have grown tired of following one boom to the next, and simply stayed for the comfort of the known.</p>",

In April 1915, President Woodrow Wilson selected a route that spanned from Seward to Fairbanks. The impact of his decision brought the railroad here and, in turn, contributed to the establishment of a national park in 1917 to conserve wildlife.<br /> <br /> To avoid the difficulties presented by the Nenana River, surveyors chose to largely stay on the west side of it, leading to a need to span Riley Creek.<br /> <br /> The Riley Creek Bridge, manufactured in Pennsylvania and shipped north on 24 rail cars loaded with 600 tons of steel via the Panama Canal, consisted of seven steel towers decked with 30-foot and 60-foot steel plate girders. When finished, the creek crossing would measure 900 feet in length.<br /> <br /> In the first week of January 1922, despite blizzards, sub-zero cold, and limited daylight hours, workers installed the first steel \"bent.\" Less than a month later, a steam crane crossed the bridge from south to north. A few days later, despite a minus-30°F wind chill, a celebratory train left Seward for Nenana, arriving on February 5. </p>",

Rather than forest, you would have seen open country, covered with low ground cover.<br /> <br /> McKinley Station was typical of Alaska towns of that era, booming overnight then fading into obscurity. Construction of the Alaska Railroad provided the original stimulus for the community and the development of the new park kept it going. Expediency, not stewardship, was the frontier byword. Throughout the 1920s, about 60 people over-wintered in McKinley Station, with dozens more in summer residence. Year-round employment was scarce, seasonal construction and tourism jobs the source of much needed cash. Despite the sometimes boisterous and rollicking nature of the village, a one-room schoolhouse existed and a hotel hosted a variety of relatively genteel social gatherings. Nearby, a trading post, a fox-farming enterprise, and the railroad depot offered occasional work for residents.<br /> <br /> When Mount McKinley National Park was founded in 1917, most locals considered it a passing fancy. Alaskans of that era viewed conservation as an impediment to the exploitation of the territory’s natural resources. They viewed national parks as playgrounds for over-privileged easterners, and resented new restraints. For four long years, the park existed in name only, without protection of any kind. In 1921, Congress finally appropriated funds to hire rangers to enforce park boundaries and poaching regulations. When the park’s first superintendent began building headquarters on the banks of Riley Creek, he was met with open hostility, and disdain.<br /> <br /> In 1932, less than 20 years after it emerged, McKinley Station effectively ceased to exist when park boundaries expanded east to the Nenana River, enveloping the community. Harsh winters and seasonal changes have all but erased McKinley Station. Except for cabin berms, trash dumps, and varied debris, little is left today.</p>",

Though Mount Healy is referred to as one mountain, the ridgeline extends for 15 miles (24 km) from the George Parks Highway to the Savage River. Mount Healy is part of the informally named Outer Range, which also includes Mount Margaret and Mount Wright to the west of the Savage River.<br /> <br /> The Mount Healy Trail leads from near the Denali Visitor Center to a point about half-way up Mount Healy. The trail begins at a relatively moderate incline, reaching a bench and overlook about a mile into the hike. From there, the trail grows significantly steeper. It can be very icy in spring and winter, so hikers should use caution if attempting the trail. Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/overlook.htm\">the Mount Healy Trail</a>.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <p>The foundation for the entire Outer Range is the metamorphic Yukon-Tanana Terrane. Terranes are fragments of the Earth’s crust that have been scraped or broken off of one tectonic plate and sutured onto another. The rocks of this terrane, the oldest that you’ll find in the park, formed ~400 million years ago as shallow-water seafloor deposits and were intruded by igneous rocks ~365 million years ago. In the Early Jurassic Epoch (~195 million years ago), these rocks were accreted onto the North American continent. Since then the Yukon-Tanana rocks have experienced multiple episodes of regional metamorphism.<br /> <br /> The Yukon-Tanana Terrane is the foundation for roughly the northern third of the park and many of the nearby mountains that line the George Parks Highway, including Sugarloaf Mountain northeast of the park entrance. The Yukon-Tanana Terrane extends northwards to the Brooks Range and makes up the hills surrounding Fairbanks, as well as east into Canada.</p>",

At Mile 45.8, there is a wide area in the road where buses pause for scenic views. Far below, visitors can see the Plains of Murie, which is crossed by numerous braided river channels and dotted with kettle ponds and large boulders, called glacial erratics. On the far side of the Plains of Murie, the Polychrome Glaciers and numerous peaks of the Alaska Range can be seen.<br /> <br /> In summer, nearly all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/visiting-denali.htm\">transit and tour buses</a> travel to this point. In spring and fall, intrepid visitors can cycle out to this point or visit it on a backpacking trip, but it is too far to reach otherwise.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <h4>Looking South</h4> <p><br /> If you’re a fan of geology, this is a great place to get out and walk around! A number of interesting glacial features can be seen from the Polychrome Overlook. High in the valleys to the south are the Polychrome Glaciers, barely visible as white patches of ice flowing towards the park road. Each of these glaciers terminates in a dark, stagnant, debris-covered ice field. The Polychrome Glaciers have retreated and downwasted substantially since they were first documented, and will likely disappear completely in the coming decades if the climate continues to warm.<br /> <br /> Between the glaciers and the road is a large outwash plain referred to as the Plains of Murie after famous wildlife biologist Adolph Murie. On days with clear skies, kettle ponds, mostly located towards the east end of this expanse, shine brightly on the plains. Overcast days more easily reveal solifluction lobes on some of the lower mountains. These lobes look like dripping paint from far away, and indeed they are dripping in a sense, as they are caused by the slow, downslope creep of water-saturated soils and sediments. Solifluction lobes are common in areas with permafrost and can be seen on hillsides throughout the park.<br /> <br /> A 35-foot-high (11m), house-sized erratic boulder on the lowlands to the south, transported to its current location by glaciers in the Pleistocene Epoch, looks small upon the vast Plains of Murie. See if you can spot it!</p> <h4>Looking North</h4> <p><br /> An arcing light-green layer of clay has stained the rocks below it on the north side of Polychrome Overlook. This clay is the product of volcanic ash weathering over time.<br /> <br /> Beginning in 2002, a layer of this slippery clay at the overlook caused half of the road to slump over four feet (~1.5 m) during several episodes of heavy precipitation. To mitigate the slumping, Federal Highways Administration and park staff removed the clay, backfilled with materials that were less susceptible to slumping, and added perforated pipes to drain water from the area. The pipes have no obvious inlets, but their outlets can be seen poking out of the slope on the south side of the road.</p>",

As the road traverses this steep slope high on the side of Polychrome Mountain, volcanic rocks of the Teklanika Formation are exposed. Generally, the lighter volcanic rock of the Teklanika Formation is rhyolite and the darker rock is basalt. Within those rock types, relatively small changes in rock chemistry result in the bright pallet of chromatic variety before you. Polychrome Mountain is memorable for its vivid rock colors and breaktaking vistas, but from a geological perspective it possesses intrinsic hazards. The Teklanika Formation is no exception to the general rule that volcanic rock is crumbly and weak and thus prone to landslides.<br /> <br /> Park managers have been aware of this landslide since the 1960s, but it wasn’t considered a major issue until it began to speed up markedly in 2014. By 2018 the slide rate had increased to as much as 13 inches per month, creating a swale that steepened the road gradient and limited sight lines. Beginning in August of 2019 and continuing until the time of this writing in January 2020, Pretty Rocks Landslide is moving downhill at a rate of almost 60 inches (1.5 m) per month with approximately 300 feet (91 meters) of the Denali Park Road in its clutches. In response, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/learn/nature/pretty-rocks.htm\">park managers are studying potential solutions</a> that will allow for continued access west of Polychrome Mountain for the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Why is Pretty Rocks Landslide changing so quickly, and why now? Boreholes drilled into the road between 2003 and 2019 have revealed significant amounts of thaw-sensitive (relatively warm) ice-rich permafrost directly beneath the road. Thus the most plausible answer is that the permafrost in the area is thawing, consistent with regional trends, resulting in loss of slope stability. Recent increases in precipitation amount and severity are probably contributing as well.",

Like all passes in Denali, the area is high enough to be mostly devoid of trees, allowing for expansive views—and, consequently, better chances to see wildlife than areas where thick brush and vegetation exist close to the road.<br /> <br /> Once the Denali Park Road was built out to this area in the late 1920s, visitors and park rangers noted that the area was particularly good for viewing caribou, sheep, and grizzly bears. Tourists could only reach the park by train at that time, and so crowding in Sable Pass by humans did not prove an immediate issue.<br /> <br /> As the state of Alaska completed the Denali Highway in the 1950s, however, the prospect of people being able to drive their own vehicles to Denali raised the likelihood that Sable Pass would become particularly busy—possibly impacting the behavior of wildlife in the process. To stem off any major issues, the park prohibited hiking and photography within two miles of the road in Sable Pass; visitors could hike or take photos from the road itself, but could not venture far from it. Over half a century later, that remains the case for visitors today, making Sable Pass a particularly good area to view wilderness without colorfully-dressed hikers out on the landscape, or wildlife changing behavior due to a large human presence.<br />  ",

Several trails in the area offer visitors a chance to go for a short or long hike. All visitors should be wildlife-aware and know how to behave in case of an encounter with a bear, moose or wolf. <h3>Geology</h3> <br /> Savage River is one of several braided rivers in Denali that are characterized by transitory channels meandering across wide beds of sediment over time. However this behavior is not the result of glacial melt, as is the case for most braided rivers in the park, because no glaciers remain in the Savage River watershed. Savage River is braided because of high sediment input from brittle rock, and from a relative lack of vegetation stabilizing its headwaters.<br /> <br /> An important transition zone that illustrates the glacial history of this area is located about halfway between the Savage River vehicular bridge and the Savage River Loop Trail footbridge to the north. Upstream (south) from this point, Savage River runs wide and shallow in a U-shaped valley typical of glacial scouring. Downstream (north), Savage River runs fast and restricted through a V-shaped valley typical of river erosion. Look for these distinctive shapes as you cross the vehicular bridge. While more extensive glaciations have affected the topography of the canyon in the past, they occurred over two million years ago. The river has therefore had substantial time to erode the V-shaped canyon that we see today.<br /> <br /> The Savage River canyon is one of the few places where erosion has exposed the Yukon-Tanana Terrane bedrock along the road. Take a closer look and you’ll notice large amounts of mica-quartz schist, a shiny rock that gets its sparkle from the flaky mineral sericite and quartz veins. The varieties of metamorphic rock in the Yukon-Tanana Terrane, along with the degree to which they have been folded and faulted, attest to the terrane’s age and dynamic history.<br /> <br /> Savage Rock, the jagged outcrop that you can walk to just uphill from the Savage River parking lot, is a surprising stumper. Why this outcrop is so prominent compared to its surroundings—despite being made of similar rocks—remains a mystery. One theory is that faulting caused the rock to protrude from the surrounding topography. A second is that it slid down from above. Or Savage Rock could be made of more resistant schist than the surrounding metamorphic rock. Further studies are needed to resolve this enigma.<br />  ",

Frozen turkeys and hams transported from Fairbanks supplemented game meat, local potatoes, and wild berries that comprised the inaugural meal.</p> <p>For almost two decades, people from far and wide gathered at this rustic hotel to celebrate holidays like the Fourth of July and Christmas. Dances and socials, though sometimes marred by brawling inebriates, enlivened the long winter nights. Here, dog mushers and trappers mingled with miners and rangers, schoolteachers and itinerants, and once, a U.S. president. In July 1923, President Warren Harding stopped by on a tour of the length of the Alaska Railroad, during which he drove a Golden Spike signaling its completion at Nenana.<br /> <br /> The hotel was one of the first things visitors saw when arriving by train. The 120-acre homestead of hotel proprietor Maurice Morino straddled the railroad tracks. One visitor described the unusual, flat-roofed, two-story log building as \"Italian-Alaskan.\" It featured exposed balconies, glass windows, and electric lights. Inside were two-dozen sleeping rooms, a mercantile, lunch counter, kitchen, and storeroom.</p>   <p>The Mount McKinley Park Hotel was not Morino’s first foray in the local hospitality sector. Five years earlier, just two years after he first settled here in 1914, Morino learned that his home on the banks of Riley Creek was right on the newly selected route of the Alaska Railroad. Quick to spot an opportunity, Morino added on to his cabin and turned it into a roadhouse and trading post. With the news of the establishment of Mount McKinley National Park in 1917, he renamed it the \"Park Gate Roadhouse.\"</p> <p>Meals and beds cost a dollar each. \"All Morino had was caribou hides for bunks,\" recalled one man, who also described the bill-of-fare as \"always caribou meat and beans.\" Morino was an inveterate gardener and he tended the usual cold-hardy crops.</p> <p>In late 1920, business booming, Morino realized that the roadhouse was unsuited to handle the volume. By late summer 1921, he was hard at work on a new hotel at a new location on the bluff near the tracks. After completion of the railroad, Morino planned to cash in on park tourism, envisioning a lively business.</p> <p>While there were reports of lice, dirty linen, drafty rooms, marginal food, and bad coffee, the hotel was not unusual by Alaska roadhouse standards. When it finally shut its doors in the 1930s, its golden era had long passed. The hotel, and its proprietor, aged poorly and business was lost to accommodations farther into the park at Savage Camp.</p> <p>When park boundaries came east and absorbed McKinley Station in 1932, Morino kept his homestead listed as a park in-holding. The title passed to the Park Service in 1947. Three years later in 1950, the dilapidated remains of his hotel were destroyed in a fire started by a transient.</p>",

From this perspective it looks like the north peak at an elevation of 19,470 feet (5,934 m) is approximately the same height as the taller south peak at 20,310 feet (6,190 m). This is because of your visual perspective; the north peak is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) closer than the south peak, so it appears taller.<br /> <br /> Though Denali and its surrounding mountains are largely composed of granitic rocks, Denali’s north peak is capped with a sedimentary rock called Kahiltna Flysch. The flysch formed in a deep oceanic basin approximately 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period. Since then it has uplifted not only above sea level, but to almost the top of the highest peak on the continent. Mountaineers thus have the potential to gaze at fossilized sea creatures while standing at the top of North America!<br /> <br /> Denali is still growing by about one millimeter per year. That may not seem like much, but at that rate it will rise one kilometer (3,300 feet) in the next million years—a brief period in geologic time.</p>",

They appear as dark orangey-brown bands—dikes of cooled magma—cutting through the gray outcrop from the lower left to the upper right.<br /> <br /> The typically gray rocks of the Cantwell Formation are often covered with vegetation in this area. The Teklanika Formation is younger and generally characterized by reddish- or yellow-brown-colored rocks. These two formations represent a very active time in Denali’s history, and their existence heavily influences the local topograhy and the difficulty of road maintenance.<br /> <br /> Around 80 million years ago, plate tectonics crumpled this area and created the Cantwell Basin. Over the next 10 million years, nearly 2.5 miles (4 km) of cobbles, gravel, sand, and silt filled in this basin. The sediments solidified over time into the sedimentary rock now referred to as the Cantwell Formation. Then around 60 million years ago during the Paleocene Epoch, lavas began to intrude the Cantwell Formation, forming the dikes, sills, and lava flows of the Teklanika Formation. Over the next 5 million years, nearly 2 miles (~3 km) of volcanic rock accumulated on top of the Cantwell Formation, primarily as alternating layers of basalt-andesite and rhyolite lava each several hundred feet thick. The lavas are interspersed with pyroclastic flows and other materials ejected from volcanoes.",

The rest area is open from late spring through late fall, with exact dates depending on the weather. In <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/shoulder-season.htm\">Denali's spring and fall seasons</a>, visitors may drive to the rest area in their own vehicles, snow and ice permitting. In summer, the rest stop is used by nearly every <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/visiting-denali.htm\">type of bus trip in Denali</a>. <br /> <br /> The rest stop overlooks the large, braided Teklanika River where wildlife often roams. Teklanika is the first significant glacially-fed river visitors encounter on a journey into Denali. The river is cloudy and gray, and is filled with pulverized rock—a product of the glacier feeding it from the nearby Alaska Range. All that sediment and gravel causes the various channels of the river to choke, causing the river's braids to change course throughout the summer. The result is a wide river valley full of gravel, giving the illusion that the river reaches epic flood levels, but in fact, the gravel bars are merely a product of the mountains being ground under by glaciers and washed downstream.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <p>Here, you will begin crossing through a dynamic mix of sedimentary and igneous rocks. Both Cathedral and Igloo mountains, which flank the road up ahead to the east and west respectively, are composed of the Cantwell Formation, a thick bed of sedimentary rocks that is topped and intruded by the colorful volcanics of the Teklanika Formation.</p> <p>Archaeological sites in the area contain materials composed of local and distant rock sources. For example, chert was collected near this location, while obsidian was likely sourced from upstream exposures of the Teklanika Formation. Obsidian and chert were used for over 13,000 years by inhabitants of this area to make projectile points, scrapers, and other tools. These tools were used to hunt bison, caribou, and other animals.</p>",

There is also a rest area for bus passengers. The location is a great jumping off point for day hikers or backpackers.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <p>The Toklat is the largest braided river that is crossed by the Denali Park Road. To the south, different channels of the river flow together near the foot of Divide Mountain. To the north, the channels largely form a few major braids, which can be difficult to cross on foot when water is high.<br /> <br /> The vast plain of cobbles, gravel, sand, and silt deposited by the river is a renewable resource. Every other year, large machinery excavates 22,000 cubic yards (17,000 m<sup>3</sup>) of sediment from the Toklat riverbed for use in resurfacing the park road. Geology and maintenance staff design the excavations to mimic braided river channels to minimize impacts on natural processes and visual aesthetics.<br /> <br /> The park road loses material over time because of erosion, slumping, and dust, and this material must be replaced to maintain a safe surface for travel. Toklat sediment provides a local source for the material, rather than it being imported from outside the park. This reduces the number of vehicles traveling the road. Using locally-sourced materials also prevents the spread of invasive plants whose seeds can hitchhike to new places when transported from outside the park. Finally, because the material does not need to be purchased and transport distances are shorter, the park saves money and produces less carbon dioxide emissions.</p>",

        "notes": "View of the Muldrow Glacier\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/dena-view-of-muldrow-glacier.htm\n\nLook south of the Denali Park Road at Mile 69 for a view of the Muldrow Glacier, the longest glacier (34 miles [54 km] long) on the north side of the Alaska Range. The lower portion of the glacier is visible from the road for the next several miles.<br /> <br /> Don’t look for shiny blue glacial ice, though, because here at the terminus of the glacier the ice is stagnant—unmoving—and covered in tundra. Yes, believe it or not that lumpy, hummocky, shrubby tundra less than a mile away to the south is underlain by ice. While perhaps not as romantically crevassed and frigid looking as an active glacier face, the vegetated terminus of the Muldrow is fascinating because it is evidence that the glacier surges.<br /> <br /> All glaciers flow—that is one of their defining features. Glacial flow is mostly controlled by temperature, snow accumulation, and slope. However, a small minority of glaciers is also substantially affected by subglacial hydrology. Called surging glaciers, these ice rivers advance with sudden and rapid speed—sometimes as much as 100 times faster than average—after long periods of sluggish movement. The terminus can advance several miles in a year or two, leaving a bathtub ring at the top of the glacial valley where the ice has drained out. Surging glaciers do not experience a net gain in mass during surge events; rather the mass is transferred from up high to down low.<br /> <br /> The Muldrow is one of four confirmed surging glaciers in Denali out of hundreds of glaciers. The upper 27 miles (42 km) currently flow slowly but constantly downhill as with any ‘living’ glacier. This movement carries away rocky debris and inhibits the growth of vegetation that might otherwise become established. However, the lower 7 miles (12 km) of Muldrow ice and debris are stagnant, having been deposited during glacial surges as long as 1,800 years ago and not having moved since. Younger moraines were deposited ~900 years ago and during surges in ~1905 and 1956–1957. Park geologists and university researchers speculate that the Muldrow may surge again at any time, and therefore monitor for signs of renewed surging.<br /> <br /> The Muldrow Glacier takes a 90° turn as it flows down from the mountains, changing course from primarily east to north. The McKinley Strand of the Denali Fault strongly controls part of the path of the Muldrow, much like the Hines Creek Fault controls part of the path of Hines Creek. Along the east-flowing section, the Muldrow follows a weakness in the rocks caused by the fault and flows parallel to the mountain front along very steep topography. The sharp zag to the north in the last few miles happens where the glacier frees itself from the relative confines of the fault and flows away from the mountain range like most glaciers.",

Wonder Lake transit buses will turn down the 1.5-mile-long Wonder Lake Campground Road to reach their destination at the south end of the lake. Either option provides views of Wonder Lake itself.</p> <h3>Geology</h3> <p>Do you wonder how Wonder Lake formed? Wonder Lake, 2.6 miles (4.2 km) long and 280 feet (85 m) deep, was excavated by the Muldrow Glacier and then dammed by its recessional moraines. Approximately 22,000 years ago, the Muldrow covered the area now occupied by the lake and formed the moraine that dams its north end. By ~14,000 years ago the glacier had retreated, leaving behind the recessional moraine that dams the southern end of the lake.<br /> <br /> Thanks to a quirk of topography, the inflow and outflow channels of Wonder Lake are located side-by-side at the northern end of the lake. The lake is fed by an unnamed stream that flows in from the east and crosses under the park road at mile 85.2. It drains just a few hundred feet (~100 m) to the west through Lake Creek.</p>",

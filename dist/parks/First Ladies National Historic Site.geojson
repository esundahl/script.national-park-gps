The Canalway Partners and the Ohio & Erie Canalway Coalition both serve as the coordinating entity for the heritage area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{11}\" paraid=\"9\">When the Ohio and Erie Canal was built between 1825 and 1832, there were only 22 states at the time. Nineteenth-century Ohio was geographically isolated from the economic prosperity of the east by the Appalachian Mountains. A lack of transit routes made obtaining and exporting goods and services difficult. Upon its completion in 1832, the Canal connected Lake Erie and the Ohio River to the Erie Canal, creating a vital transportation route between the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, allowing resources to flow more freely across Ohio and the nation. It is known for providing “routes of prosperity.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{27}\" paraid=\"10\">The creation of this inland water transportation system was a key point in the nation’s journey to becoming self-reliant on resource development, rather than relying on European trade routes. The Ohio & Erie Canal attracted pioneers, immigrants, and entrepreneurs to the region, leading to interconnected and thriving communities blossoming with opportunity for new business and industry. As the rise of railroads led to decreased use of the canal for transportation, industrial development continued on the canal's banks to harness its hydroelectric power.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{33}\" paraid=\"11\">In March of 1913, Ohio experienced a great flood, considered to be the second deadliest flood in the United States and the most devastating natural disaster Ohio ever experienced. The Ohio and Erie Canal was damaged beyond repair and ultimately abandoned. While this hurt local communities, their tenacity was unwavering. Community members knew the vitality of this region would be long-lasting if they worked to connect people back to their shared history of the Canalway. Today, the canal is still used for transportation, but this time for hiking, running, and cycling along the Towpath Trail, a recreation path that follows the old Canalway route and continues to connect the region's communities.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{90}\" paraid=\"19\">Historic Sites and Points of Interest: </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{96}\" paraid=\"20\"><a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/the-towpath-trail/\">Towpath Trail and Greenway</a>   </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{106}\" paraid=\"21\"><a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/cuyahoga-valley-scenic-railroad/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"3\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{114}\" paraid=\"22\"><a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/americas-byway/\">National Scenic Byway</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"4\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{122}\" paraid=\"23\"><a href=\"https://www.wrhs.org/\">Western Reserve Historical Society</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"5\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"5\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{130}\" paraid=\"24\"><a href=\"https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/parks/visit/parks/ohio-erie-canal-reservation\">Ohio & Erie Canal Reservation</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"6\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"6\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{138}\" paraid=\"25\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-cuyahoga-river-recovers.htm\">Industrial Valley & Cuyahoga River</a></p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"7\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"7\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{146}\" paraid=\"26\"><a href=\"http://www.ohioeriecanal.org/howehouse.html\">Richard Howe House</a>  </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"8\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"8\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{156}\" paraid=\"27\"><a href=\"https://www.visitcanton.com/directory/congressman-ralph-regula-canalway-center/\">Congressman Ralph Regula Canalway Center</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"9\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"9\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{164}\" paraid=\"28\"><a href=\"http://cityofcanalfulton-oh.gov/\">Canal Fulton</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"10\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"10\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{172}\" paraid=\"29\"><a href=\"https://historiczoarvillage.com/\">Historic Zoar Village</a> </p> </li> </ol> <h2 paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{184}\" paraid=\"31\">Notable People: </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"4\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{190}\" paraid=\"32\"><a href=\"https://www.summithistory.org/simon-perkins-family\">Simon Perkins</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"4\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{198}\" paraid=\"33\"><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-D-Rockefeller\">John D.

        "notes": "William McKinley Tomb\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/william-mckinley-tomb.htm\n\n<p>This large circular, domed mausoleum is the final resting place of President William McKinley.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">McKinley was born in Niles, Ohio but he called Canton home throughout his adult life. <span>In 1861, McKinley enlisted as a private in an Ohio infantry regiment and participated in several Civil War battles. After the war h</span>e began his career in this city, met his beloved wife, and ran for the highest office of the nation here. He was the last Civil War veteran elected president. His election in 1896 launched an era of Republican dominance that continued until 1910. McKinley governed during a period of intense American expansionism. Domestically, he supported policies that benefitted American business, including high protective tariffs and deflationary fiscal policies.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">On September 6, 1901, an anarchist shot McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He died eight days later. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">After lying in state at the United States Capitol, McKinley’s body returned to Canton.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Mark Hanna, McKinley's <span>lifelong friend, political mentor, and manager,</span> and some of McKinley’s friends immediately began planning a suitable memorial. They chose this site in Canton’s Westlawn Cemetery that McKinley once suggested would be an appropriate location for a soldiers’ and sailors’ memorial. The McKinley National Memorial Association, organized in 1901, purchased the site, and appealed to the public for the $600,000 needed to create the memorial. Construction began in 1905. Nine different States donated materials used in the memorial, completed in 1907. Ida McKinley died that year; she lies next to her husband in the memorial chamber. William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum, a private nonprofit organization under the umbrella of the Stark County Historical Society, administers the memorial and its grounds.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The McKinley Memorial that contains the tomb stands on a grass-covered hill overlooking the city of Canton. Designed by architect H. Van Buren Magonigle, the circular, domed pink granite building rises 96 feet above ground and measures 79 feet in diameter. The double bronze doors of the entrance were the largest in the nation at the time of installation. Originally a long, narrow reflecting pool stretched out from the base of the hill in front of the memorial. This feature, together with the 108 stone steps that lead up to the mausoleum, symbolized the President's sword in time of war. In 1951, a depressed lawn replaced the pool, but the sword effect remains. Midway up the steps is a large bronze statue by Charles Henry Niehaus of President McKinley delivering his last speech in Buffalo.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Colored marble laid in a cross pattern forms the floor of the mausoleum. The bodies of McKinley and his wife lie side by side in two polished, dark-green, granite sarcophagi, resting atop a ten-foot-square of polished dark maroon granite in the center of the space. Their two young daughters are also laid to rest here. Three semi-circular arched bays encircle the central chamber. The entablature and frieze extending around the bottom of the dome contain words from McKinley's last speech.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the </em></span><em><a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a></em><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><em>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded preservation work at the McKinley Memorial in 2000. </em></span></p>",

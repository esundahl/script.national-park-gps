It is known today as Awatixa or Sakakawea Village. They lived here from 1790-1834.  Historical records indicate from 40 to 60 lodges were here at different times. Currently there are 31 visible depressions.  <br /> <br /> The Sakakawea village archeology site was named after Sacagawea Charbonneau who joined the Lewis and Clark expedition to the Pacific Ocean as a guide and interpreter. Her and her husband Toussaint Charbonneau lived in this village before and after their adventure on the Corps of Discovery. Toussaint Charbonneau lived here most of his life. </p>",

On the horizon you might see Bison, Deer or Elk and as you walk down the path you see your Mother in the garden with her sisters singing their prayers to the growing corn. Your Father would be sitting on top of the lodge keeping watch for herds to hunt or enemies attacking.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3cbb3e3b-ceb5-453a-81fd-775492b6b659}{14}\" paraid=\"1472759059\">Feeling safe, you walk into the lodge and smell the fire. You know something good is cooking. You are home. Passing the windbreak (Wid-daksuti), you see the corral for your family’s prized horses on the right.

The horses are kept inside overnight protected from weather and thieves. Under the watchful eye of your brother. The horses, now, are grazing a short distance away.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c12426e5-537d-4c22-8073-71970dd9b856}{230}\" paraid=\"606778487\">Your favorite dog comes to greet you.

Food and water are stored in clay pots. The mortar and pestle have been used. The mortar has grain in it and there are berries on the mashing hide. You go to grab a berry, but your sister pops her head out of the cache pit (root cellar) to tell you that you must wait for the others. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3cbb3e3b-ceb5-453a-81fd-775492b6b659}{66}\" paraid=\"631160317\">You sit on a mat at the fireplace next to your Mother’s Father who is reclining on the Atuka.

Home to the Awatixa, a Hidatsa subgroup, this lively village covered an area of about 10 acres and contained at least 51 earthlodges. An estimate of 500-600 people lived in the village, 10 to 30 per lodge. The Hidatsa oral history tells us that the Awatixa subgroup claim no other homeland than the region along the Missouri River near the Knife River.<br /> <br /> The Awatixa oral history tells us that they were here long before Hidatsa proper and Awaxawi, another Hidatsa subgroup, arrived. Many generations lived in Awatixa Xi’e Village. They farmed, hunted and gathered food.They were devout in their beliefs and incorporated their spirituality in everything they did. The Awatixa tradition was to give freely of food and clothing, to all in need and no one in the village ever went hungry.<br /> <br /> This area was a major trading center, and, like a modern-day mall, people came from far and wide to trade goods. The corn and Knife River flint were the best-selling items. One could also trade beads, horses, produce, meats, hides, bison robes, beaded clothing for anything you wanted if you could negotiate a fair trade.",

For that reason, this land in the Missouri Plateau was not scraped and flattened out as the rest of the state. The hill features in the Missouri Plateau were shaped mainly by erosion, such as wind and rushing water. Much of the Missouri Plateau has small hills.”</p>",

Along that river were two Hidatsa towns, which were also home to many Mandan. Awatixa was the town where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a> and her husband, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, lived. These were winter villages, which were smaller than and upriver from summer villages. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{179}\" paraid=\"914467629\">Mandan and Hidatsa people cultivated crops in the fertile riverine lands, and they were well-acquainted with the French, British, and Spanish traders who traveled the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers to trade with them. They even permitted some of these traders, like Charbonneau, to live with them, as was customary in many Indigenous villages across the continent. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{223}\" paraid=\"1030498113\">In the winter of 1804–1805, Mandan and Hidatsa people permitted members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition to build a dwelling for the winter seven miles downriver. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{251}\" paraid=\"810725828\">Meriwether Lewis and William Clark wanted to be at this site because of its proximity to the Mandan and Hidatsa villages on the Knife River. They wanted to have access to the expansive trading network that revolved around these towns, which spanned west to the Rocky Mountains, north into Canada, and south through the Great Plains. A wide array of goods was available at these marketplaces: Spanish horses, Cheyenne leather goods, English and French guns and ammunition, and food grown and preserved by Mandan and Hidatsa people.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ab000ee8-b82f-45c3-a12b-0e56a16726af}{44}\" paraid=\"339846512\">Lewis and Clark wintered here because they needed access to the goods and information that Mandan and Hidatsa people had thanks to generations of developing relationships and trade networks with people who lived up and down the Missouri River. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The Northern Plains Heritage Foundation is the coordinating entity for the heritage area who celebrates traditional and modern native cultures, farming and ranching heritage, and its infinite legacies. </p> <p paraeid=\"{154f891e-a0db-4853-ad9f-37e83e605222}{252}\" paraid=\"9\">The Northern Plains National Heritage Area is rooted in the historical significance of the Missouri River. The first peoples traversed this landscape in the Paleo and Archaic eras. Settlements of the region trace back to the ancestral homelands of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people who utilized the fertile Missouri River bottomlands for agrarian purposes. The Oceti Sakowin ( known as “The Great Sioux Nation” in the 19th century) have ancestral ties to this nationally important lived-in landscape.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6435e32d-15f2-4c3d-8cb8-a7b28a6a5cee}{5}\" paraid=\"10\">Lewis and Clark spent 1803-1804 wintering here and the Mandan and Hidatsa people helped them during their long journey. This is also where Lewis & Clark met Sakakawea (or \"Sacagawea\"). Indigenous communities formed relationships with the early European fur traders from the 1730s to the 1860s. Numerous European artists, such as George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, dedicated time visiting the area to paint portraits of the Mandan people and the landscapes they inhabited. Through this, the Mandan are one of the most documented indigenous groups in all of North America.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6435e32d-15f2-4c3d-8cb8-a7b28a6a5cee}{20}\" paraid=\"11\">With westward expansion and the tension created by encroaching Euro-American settlements, the area became the battleground for the U.S. Dakota Wars of 1862-1865. The arrival of Jay Cooke’s Northern Pacific Railroad to the area in 1872 brought a new wave of European immigration to the region. With the establishment of the railroads, global immigration descended into the area. In 1883, the Northern Pacific Railroad completed construction of a permanent bridge that spanned the Missouri River at Bismarck. Completion of the bridge in 1883 coincided with the first agricultural economic “boom” in Dakota Territory. Immigrant farmers established cooperative and social activities that influenced local politics to push for their own economic agency. In 1919, a North Dakota state-owned Mill, a state Elevator, and the Bank of North Dakota were established to allow farmers and ranchers better local market control. </p> <p

Lewis and Clark remarked in 1804 that the population was substantially less than reports before the epidemic.<br /> <br /> “Beginning in October, as the expedition made its way through present northern South Dakota, it passed numerous abandoned villages, composed of earth-lodge dwellings and cultivated fields. Some of the fields, although unattended, still had squash and corn growing in them. These had once been home to the mighty Arikara tribe. About thirty thousand persons strong in the year the United States won its independence, the tribe had been reduced by smallpox epidemics in the 1780’s to not much more than one-fifth that size. … What had been eighteen villages the previous year had been reduced to three by the time Lewis arrived.” (Ambrose, 178)<br /> <br /> Because of the smallpox epidemic in 1781, the Awatixa had to abandon Lower Hidatsa village. Some survivors moved to other surrounding villages, but most went north to Rock Village (near where the Garrison Dam is today).<br /> <br />  ",

Being close to such a large village, like Big Hidatsa, would have helped provide protection from the Sioux. They lived in Taylor Bluff Village from 1834 until 1845. In 1845, all the Hidatsa vacated the Knife River area to settle, north, at Like-A-Fishhook Village. Like-A-Fishhook Village was inundated when the Garrison Dam was completed in 1950. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b1c75d2c-7fcb-4f85-8308-eac53f947e63}{118}\" paraid=\"2039614745\">In 1837 another smallpox epidemic came to the villages on the upper Missouri River. Again the loss of life was devastating to the tribes. Over 50% of the Hidatsa and Arikara succumbed to smallpox. The Mandan lost 93% of their population leaving only 138 Mandan. Before they encountered Europeans, the Mandan population was estimated to have been 10,000 to 15,000 strong. <br /> <br /> Resilient, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara have joined together to establish the Three Affiliated Tribes (MHA Nation) in Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Their membership is 16,900 strong. <br /> <br /> To find out more, please, follow the links below. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5c3a9f3d-156a-4132-9bf3-6eed06fb9b74}{14}\" paraid=\"1539433321\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"> </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5c3a9f3d-156a-4132-9bf3-6eed06fb9b74}{14}\" paraid=\"1539433321\" style=\"text-align: center;\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><a href=\"https://www.ndstudies.gov/gr8/content/unit-ii-time-transformation-1201-1860/lesson-4-alliances-and-conflicts/topic-1-smallpox-epidemics-1781-1837-1851/section-2-smallpox-among-indian-tribes\">Why weren't they vaccinated?</a> <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/knri/learn/historyculture/images/Four-Bears-Speech-2_2.jpg?maxwidth=1200&autorotate=false\">Four Bears Last Words</a><br />  <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/history-of-hidatsa-post-1845.htm\">History of Hidatsa: Post-1845</a></p> <p paraeid=\"{b1c75d2c-7fcb-4f85-8308-eac53f947e63}{147}\" paraid=\"666574674\" style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{b1c75d2c-7fcb-4f85-8308-eac53f947e63}{151}\" paraid=\"1667011100\"> </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5c3a9f3d-156a-4132-9bf3-6eed06fb9b74}{56}\" paraid=\"1486363555\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{b1c75d2c-7fcb-4f85-8308-eac53f947e63}{223}\" paraid=\"204754701\"> </p>",

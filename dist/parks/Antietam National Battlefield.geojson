The red cross of bricks at the base of the monument, the symbol of the American Red Cross which she founded after the Civil War, is made of brick from the chimney at the home in which she was born.<br /> <br /> Arriving on the north end of the battlefield at about noon on September 17, Barton watched as surgeons wrapped soldiers' wounds with corn husks, having completely run out of proper bandages. She delivered wagons loaded with bandages and other medical supplies, including lanterns, which enabled the army's medical personnel to work through the night.<br /> <br /> As bullets whizzed overhead and artillery boomed in the distance, Barton cradled the heads of suffering soldiers, prepared food, and brought water to the wounded men. As she knelt down to give a wounded man a drink, she felt her sleeve quiver. She noticed a bullet hole in her sleeve and discovered that the bullet killed the man for whom she was caring.<br /> <br /> Following the battle, Clara Barton collapsed in exhaustion. She also became ill with typhoid fever. Returning to Washington, she soon regained her strength and later returned to other battlefields where she helped care for the wounded and dying.</p>",

Mass graves and shallow individual burials were not uncommon and by 1864, many of the graves had become exposed. A suitable, permanent solution was necessary. To that end, Maryland State Senator Lewis P. Firey spearheaded a plan in which the state of Maryland purchased a little more than 11 acres of land for the establishment a cemetery for the men who died in the Maryland Campaign.<br /> <br /> In an effort to locate grave sites and identify the occupants, two men, Aaron Good and Joseph Gill, proved invaluable. In the days, months, and years following the battle, they freely gave of their time and gathered a large number of names and burial locations using letters, receipts, diaries, photographs, marks on belts or cartridge boxes, and by interviewing relatives and survivors.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, contributions totaling over $70,000 were submitted from 18 Northern states to the administrators of the Antietam National Cemetery Board. With a workforce consisting primarily of honorably discharged soldiers, the process of removing bodies from the farms and fields began in October 1866 and was complete by August 1867. In all, the Antietam National Cemetery became the final resting place for the remains of 4,776 Union soldiers killed in the Battles of Antietam, South Mountain, Monocacy and other action in Maryland. The identities of only 38% of the burials are known.<br /> <br /> Although the original plan allowed for burial of soldiers from both sides, the rancor and bitterness over the recently completed conflict and the devastated South's inability to raise funds to join in such a venture persuaded Maryland to recant. Consequently, only Union dead are interred here. Confederate remains were re-interred in Washington Confederate Cemetery in Hagerstown, Maryland; Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Frederick, Maryland; and Elmwood Cemetery in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Approximately 2,800 Southerners are buried in these three cemeteries, over 60% of who are unknown.<br /> <br /> On September 17, 1867, the fifth anniversary of the battle, the cemetery was dedicated before a crowd numbering in the thousands, including President Andrew Johnson, four members of his Cabinet, and the governors of the 18 states whose solders are buried in the cemetery. In his brief remarks, President Johnson proclaimed, \"When we look on yon battle field I think of the brave men on both sides, who fell in the fierce struggle of battle, who sleep silent in their graves...Would to God we of the living could imitate their example, as they lay sleeping in peace in their tombs, and live together in friendship and peace.\"<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/anti/learn/historyculture/antietam-national-cemetery.htm\">Click here to access the cemetery roster.</a></p>",

May it stand throughout all ages as a symbol of mercy, peace, and understanding.\"</strong></em>Maryland Governor Millard Tawes, Church Rededication Service, September 2, 1962<br /> The Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest one-day battle in American History. Yet ironically one of the most noted landmarks on this field of combat is a house of worship associated with peace and love. This historic church was built by local German Baptist Brethren in 1852 on land donated by local farmer Samuel Mumma. The name \"Dunker\" comes from their practice of full immersion baptism. During its early history the congregation consisted of about a half-dozen farm families from the local area. Although heavily damaged during the battle by rifle and artillery fire, the church survived, only to be blown down by a windstorm in 1921. Rebuilt for the Civil War Centennial, it stands today as not only a step back in time, but also as a solemn reminder of the impact the battle had on the local families<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/anti/learn/historyculture/who-were-the-dunkers.htm\">Learn more about the Dunkers.</a></p>",

Fearful that Union sharpshooters would use the farm buildings as a strongpoint, Confederates set fire to them. The column of fire and smoke was visible all morning above the battlefield. This fire was the only deliberate destruction of civilian property. One Union soldier remembered, \"Just in front of us a house was burning, and the fire and smoke, flashing of muskets and whizzing of bullets, yells of men …were perfectly horrible.\"</p> <p>The Mummas spent the winter at the Sherrick farm near Burnside Bridge and were able to rebuild in 1863. After the war, the Federal Government compensated residents for damage caused by Union soldiers. However, since this farm was burned by Confederates, the Mummas received no compensation. Starting in 1870 the family deeded interest in this burial ground to local families.

In 1890, congressional legislation gave the War Department oversight of the Antietam Battlefield Commission to preserve and maintain the battle lines from the September 17, 1862 Battle of Antietam. Until 1933, when administration of the battlefield transferred to the National Park Service, the War Department was the steward of Antietam and many other Civil War battlefield sites for commemorative and educational purposes. The preserved landscapes were meant to honor the dead and serve as open- air classrooms for military study<br /> <br /> Built to provide a commanding view of the Antietam Battlefield, this structure was constructed by local workers using primarily local resources and materials such as native limestone. Rising nearly sixty feet, the tower enabled visitors to have a better view of the Antietam battlefield. The surrounding topography lacked elevated natural land features, making it difficult at times to envision the battlefield landscape as a whole. As part of a new preservation plan developed between 1890 and 1895, the tower also allowed visitors to view battlefield land still held in private ownership by local Sharpsburg residents. The \"Antietam Plan\" preserved narrow strips of land, maintaining the rural agricultural landscape while simultaneously providing access to key battle locations. With limited access to most of the battlefield, the Tower provided a commanding 360 degree view. While a fair portion of returning war veterans made use of the Observation Tower, its construction also reflected an increase in tourism at the turn of the century. Whether utilized by veterans or the larger tourist population, the Tower demonstrates the War Department's physical impact on the landscape of the Antietam Battlefield.</p>",

The house is a two-story, L-shaped brick structure on a stone foundation with a steeply pitched roof with two single chimneys. At the time of the battle, the farm grounds included then a barn, smoke house, cave house, a springhouse and a toll house. Because of its panoramic view of almost the entire Antietam Valley around Sharpsburg, Pry's prosperous farm and home was taken over by Union commander George B. McClellan to use as his headquarters during the Battle of Antietam.</p> <p>After the battle, the Pry House served as a Union hospital, as well as the headquarters for Maj. Jonathan Letterman, Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac.

In the furious fighting across this ground, over 1,100 of Lawton's Confederates were killed or wounded. Lawton, educated at West Point and Harvard University, was also wounded. He survived the Civil War and became president of the American Bar Association in 1882. He was appointed minister to Austria in 1887, and died there in 1896.</p>",

        "notes": "The Joseph Poffenberger Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-joseph-poffenberger-farm.htm\n\n<p paraeid=\"{ec1b931d-0295-4299-8038-305780ae0a98}{179}\" paraid=\"217170429\">When the Civil War began in 1861, Joseph Poffenberger and his wife Mary Ann had no way of knowing that it would arrive on their doorstep nearly a year later. Their home sits just a few miles north of Sharpsburg, Maryland. By September of 1862 their house and belongings would be claimed by the greatest conflict our country has ever experienced. Today, their home and property sit empty but are maintained and preserved by the National Park Service. However, the story of the Poffenberger family and farm continues.<br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Historical Ownership and Structural Changes</span></strong><br /> Originally the plot of land where the Poffenberger farm sits today was owned by James Chapline, son of Sharpsburg founder Joseph Chapline, in the late 1700s. The nearly 1400-acre plot of land would eventually be divided and leased or sold in family-sized tracts. Nearly 272 acres would eventually be sold to Christian Middlekauff. Through this time a house, shed, wash house, wagon shed, and corn crib were constructed. From 1813 to 1833 the property exchanged hands among the Middlekauff family and their spouses. In 1833 the farm was owned by Daniel Nekirk, husband of Rosanna Middlekauff. Daniel mortgaged the farmstead to nearby neighbor, Jacob Coffman as insurance for a loan of $3,000 dollars, due to paid over the span of 10 years. Daniel constructed a bank barn, equipment shed, icehouse, and smokehouse to expand the farmstead, suggesting that Daniel was using the money to make improvements on the farm. By the fall of 1833 both Daniel and Rosanna Nekirk would pass away, leaving Jacob Coffman to take ownership of the property in 1843. Jacob Coffman would remain the sole owner until 1852 but by 1850 the United States Census listed Joseph and Mary Ann Poffenberger as the residents of the home. Two years later, the property was officially sold to Joseph Poffenberger.</p> <p paraeid=\"{cd25beb0-98d3-4ea6-9809-6ded087c7db6}{39}\" paraid=\"1649374304\">By 1880 Joseph Poffenberger turned over managing of the farm to his nephew Otho Poffenberger and his wife Elizabeth. When Joseph passed away in 1888 Otho purchased the farm, updated the house, and constructed an addition to the back of the main house. Otho continued to live on the farm until his death in 1932. During Otho’s ownership the United States War Department purchased a tract of land that runs across the front of the property in order to construct a tour road, known today as Mansfield Avenue. This road allowed the War Department to erect historic markers, tablets, and monuments dedicated to the fighting that occurred in this area. After Otho’s passing in 1932, by another Joseph Poffenberger, Otho’s son, purchased the property. In 1944 Joseph Poffenberger deeded the property over to his relative, Elmer Poffenberger who remained the owner until 1966. Fred and Renee Kramer were the last private owners of the property and on June 8, 2000 the National Park Service purchased the land and structures. Under the Park Service’s ownership, the structures were stabilized and restored to their 1862 appearance. The only structures missing are the smokehouse, kitchen and the tenant house.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>“I had nothing left.” The Battle of Antietam</em></strong><br /> By September of 1862, the Poffenbergers had worked for months to fill their barn with stores of food, large stacks of hay to feed their livestock filled the loft. Orchard trees were loaded with apples, peaches, and plums. The store house was stocked with smoked meat. They had every reason to believe that winter of 1862 would be spent comfortably. Joseph and Mary Ann had no children of their own, but they did allow several members of their extended family to stay with them over the years. In 1862 their nephew Josiah and an orphan they had taken in, Isaac Mallott, were both living on the property.<br /> <br /> On September 16th, soldiers warned many of the residents around Sharpsburg of the coming battle. Thousands of troops streamed onto the field from Boonsboro, Maryland after the battle of South Mountain and soon the armies would re-engage the fighting around Sharpsburg. Many of the Poffenberger’s neighbors fled a few miles north to the Manor Church, which was of the same denomination as Antietam’s Dunker Church. It is unknown where Joseph and Mary Ann sheltered during the battle. The area around Sharpsburg was home to many of their relatives so it is possible they might have stayed with family until the danger had passed.</p>   <p paraeid=\"{06f38c69-bffe-439e-a787-df46c145c6e7}{2}\" paraid=\"1461892418\">By the evening of the 16th hundreds of soldiers of Union General Joseph Hooker’s I Corps had arrived in the area around the Poffenberger farm. They had been ordered to cross the Antietam Creek that evening; once across they set up camp around the Poffenberger home. The high ground just north of the farm became an ideal location for Union artillery and the barn became headquarters for Joseph Hooker as his men settled in for the night. Some of Hooker’s men skirmished with the left flank of the Confederate line in the woods just south of the Poffenberger property on the evening of the 16th, but the real fighting erupted the next morning.</p> <p paraeid=\"{06f38c69-bffe-439e-a787-df46c145c6e7}{54}\" paraid=\"214644598\">As the sun began to rise on the morning of September 17th, Confederate cannons on the Dunker Church plateau and Nicodemus heights opened fire on the soldiers around the Poffenberger farm. As the First Corps surged forward toward the Confederate line, the area quickly transformed from a camp to a field hospital as the injured were brought back from the front lines. As Union surgeons worked tirelessly to treat as many of the injured as they could, they quickly exhausted their supplies. Around noon, the Poffenberger farm received another historic visitor, Clara Barton and her wagons of much needed medical supplies. More information about her can be found<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/anti/learn/historyculture/clarabarton.htm\"> here.</a><br /> <br /> <em><strong>Aftermath</strong></em><br /> After the fighting was over and Lee had retreated across the Potomac, Joseph and Mary Ann returned to their home. They found weary Federal soldiers camping all over their property and discovered that nearly all their belongings stolen or destroyed. Joseph recalled “I returned to my house; it was completely empty. I had nothing left. I lived on army crackers that I found on the battlefield for five days.” 1 The Union army would stay encamped on the Poffenberger property until late October. In that time soldiers continued to devour the stores of food and livestock that belonged to the Poffenberger family. According to the claim that Joseph filed against the Federal government his losses included:<br /> <br /> • 500 bushels of wheat<br /> • 60 bushels of rye<br /> • 150 bushels of oats<br /> • 80 bushels of potatoes<br /> • 20 tons of hay<br /> • 240 pounds of bacon<br /> • 28 acres plus 200 bushels of old corn<br /> • 18 loads of fodder<br /> • 14 tons of straw<br /> • 20 acres of pasture<br /> • 7 beef cattle<br /> • 20 swine<br /> • 13 sheep<br /> • 5 cords of hickory wood<br /> • 7 cords of oak wood<br /> • over 5,350 fence rails (described as a worm fence, nine rails to the panel),<br /> • 50 bushels of apples<br /> • 4 four barrels of cider<br /> • 4 bushels of peaches<br /> • grapes on the vine<br /> • 2 bushels of dried cherries and plums<br /> • 10 gallons each apple, plum and peach butter</p>   <p paraeid=\"{06f38c69-bffe-439e-a787-df46c145c6e7}{241}\" paraid=\"880624848\">Joseph Poffenberger claimed it was valued at $2,277.53 but it was “disallowed” by the government because they could not prove what was originally in their or that the United States Army had taken all the missing supplies. Joseph Poffenberger never received any reimbursement from the government. Over thirty years later, in 1893, the estate was finally awarded $1918.00 in compensation for Joseph’s war claim.</p> <p paraeid=\"{6c933813-7bf0-4621-b128-e7833b75e40d}{36}\" paraid=\"1885221288\">Today Joseph and Mary Ann are both buried in the Mountain View Cemetery in Sharpsburg, Maryland. Mary Ann passed away just two years after the Battle of Antietam, and it is possible that her death was caused by an increase in disease due to the unsanitary conditions and mass burials around Sharpsburg. Disease was not only the biggest killer of soldiers during the war but was also responsible for the deaths of many of Mary Ann’s neighbors. Joseph Poffenberger would never remarry and was buried next to his wife on June 13, 1888 at the age of 76. Today visitors can still walk the grounds of Joseph and Mary Ann’s home. The house and exterior buildings sit empty today, in order to protect the resources and visitor safety the structures are no longer accessible. The surrounding land is leased by the Park Service to local farmers so long as they plant period-accurate crops. Today, the farmstead serves as a window into the past, allowing park visitors to see a near perfectly preserved farmstead of Sharpsburg from the 1860s.</p>",

        "notes": "The Miller Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-miller-farm.htm\n\n<h4>The Miller Farm and Family</h4> The Millers enjoyed a prosperous and quiet life in Western Maryland, until their farm became entangled in the bloodiest one day battle in American history.<br />   <p><span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Establishment of the Property</strong><br /> What would become known as the D.R. Miller farm was first established by Christopher Cruss in the 1780s, and he lived there until about 1800 before he sold it to John Myers. It was around this time that the farmhouse and barn were first built, possibly by John Myers. In 1844, John Miller purchased the farm after John Myers’ death. John invested in property all around Sharpsburg and allowed his children to live in many of the homes. John decided to let his son David R. Miller, his wife Margaret, and their six children move onto this tract north of Sharpsburg.</span></p> <br /> When D.R. moved in, the home was an ell shaped vernacular-style house, meaning construction was influenced by access to materials and the needs and building traditions of the local area more than a specific style. In addition to the main home, there were two tenant houses, a blacksmith shop, an out-kitchen, and several other structures on the property. The Hagerstown Turnpike, a main road connecting Sharpsburg to Hagerstown, was completed in 1810. The pike cut through the middle of the Miller property and separated the home from the barn, stable, corncrib, and hog pen. This wide turnpike, that was built and maintained through tolls, was ideal for both armies to easily move soldiers marching in column during the Maryland Campaign, and unfortunately it would lead huge numbers of Union and Confederate soldiers to the Millers’ front door. Once the Millers realized that the war was on their doorstep, they left their home to stay with his father in Sharpsburg.<br />   <p><strong>The Bloodiest Fighting on the Bloodiest Day</strong></p> On September 17, 1862, the fighting began at daybreak, when the Union Army’s First Corps moved south from the area of Joseph Poffenberger’s farm. The Union troops passed by the Miller residence on their way south, but were halted when they encountered Confederate troops waiting for them in the Miller’s cornfield. An intense infantry battle followed. Soldiers in the Cornfield faced artillery fire from all directions. After approximately two hours of back and forth fighting, General Robert E. Lee sent reinforcements to aid Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson’s exhausted troops in the Cornfield. The Confederate reinforcements pushed the Union troops back to the northern edge of the Cornfield, but then the Union Twelfth Corps arrived on the field and counterattacked. Around nine in the morning, the fighting slowed. Thousands of bullets and lives were spent in the attempt to gain control over D.R. Miller’s cornfield. In four hours of combat, almost eight thousand Union and Confederate soldiers had been killed or wounded in the area of the Cornfield. After this day, Miller’s field was simply referred to as “The Cornfield” due to the horrendous fighting that occurred there.<br /> <br /> As the day progressed, the fighting moved south closer to Sharpsburg where the Miller family had fled to the safety of D.R.’s father’s home. During this time, David Miller realized that the family’s pet parrot Polly was still in her cage hanging from the porch when the family had gone inside to shelter. Even with shells bursting around him, Miller dashed across the porch to rescue the beloved pet. However, before he could reach the bird, the leather strap that tethered her cage to the ceiling was severed by a shell fragment, sending Polly crashing to the ground. The story that D.R. Miller told was that he heard the bird cry, “Oh poor Polly!” as it fell. Luckily, both Polly and David made it safely back into his father’s house.<br /> <br /> “<em>Every Stalk of Corn was…Cut as Closely as Could Have Been Done with a Knife”</em><br /> <br /> Upon their return home, the Millers were greeted with a gut-wrenching sight. It was evident that their home had been the center of some of the Civil War’s most ferocious fighting. Miraculously, the home and barn were relatively unscathed, and only the blacksmith shop was destroyed. However, the Miller’s crops were decimated by the savage fighting that had taken place. Union General Joseph Hooker recalled the scene that played on the Miller’s farm, saying that, “every stalk of corn in the northern and greater part of the field was cut as closely as could have been done with a knife, and the slain lay in rows precisely as they stood in their ranks a few moments before. It was never my fortune to witness a more bloody, dismal battlefield.” When the MIller’s returned they saw the food stored in the barn that had been previously harvested being distributed to the Union soldiers and to the wounded still on the field. The wounded from the Miller farm were quickly moved a quarter mile north to a field hospital.<br /> <br /> For days after the battle, Union burial details buried their comrades in graves near where they fell. Once the Union dead were interred, they also buried the Confederate dead. Miller’s farm fields were ideal for burials: the soft soils of farmed land made the gruesome task much easier compared to the untilled earth and so many had fallen in this small parcel of land. This made farming his fields very difficult for Miller in the several years following the battle. It took five years for the National Cemetery to be established for the reinternment of the Union soldiers, and then another two to five years for the reinternment of Confederate soldiers in three local cemeteries. Despite the best efforts of soldiers and locals to track where roughly 5,000 men had been buried in the fields, it was impossible to locate everyone.<br />   <p><strong>1862 to Present Day</strong></p> The Millers continued to live on the farm for the next twenty years. When his father, John Miller, died in 1882 he left a large amount of property to his eight children. However, he left no recorded will that dictated how his estate should be split among them. Unfortunately, his siblings would fight over D.R. Miller’s property, which he had lived on for almost forty years. A bitter court battle ensued, which lead to the sale of the property; the revenue was then divided amongst all of John’s children. In 1883, D.R. and Margaret Miller purchased the farm, but they sold it a little over two years later to someone outside of the family, Euromus Hoffman. A couple of years later, Margaret died on November 13, 1888. David died in September of 1893.<br /> <br /> The home stayed in the Hoffman family until 1933. The property changed hands several times, until in 1989 the farm was sold to the Conservation Fund. A year later, the Fund donated the property to the National Park Service. The home has been restored its 1862 appearance and is being persevered to ensure future generations have the opportunity to learn about the Millers. The fields are leased out each year to local farmers to raise crops and livestock. Even though the Cornfield is not always planted with corn for the health of the soil, the living farm program is important for preserving the agricultural landscape and history of the battlefield.<br /> <br /> Antietam National Battlefield is still one large cemetery. In 2008, a hiker in the park discovered a ground hog hole in the Cornfield with bones in it and alerted park staff. An archeological dig revealed bones, clothing scraps, a belt buckle, and brass buttons with the New York insignia. Upon examination of the bones, it was determined that the soldier was roughly seventeen to nineteen years old. The young man was returned home to New York, and was buried in Saratoga National Cemetery with full military honors on September 17, 2009, one hundred and forty-seven years after he gave the ultimate sacrifice in the Miller Cornfield.",

        "notes": "The Mumma Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-mumma-farm.htm\n\n<strong>The Mumma Family and Farm: A Story of Forgiveness and Recovery<br /> <br /> Forgiveness</strong><br /> “As to your burning our house, we know that in doing so, you were carrying out orders.”<br /> This was Samuel Mumma Jr.’s response to Sergeant James F. Clark of the 3rd North Carolina Infantry who wrote to the postmaster of Sharpsburg, Maryland in March of 1906. When Clark sought information about the family whose home he helped destroy in the battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, he had no way of knowing that the postmaster who received his letter was actually Samuel Mumma Jr., the son of the owner of that farm. Samuel wrote back to Clark and informed him of the Mumma family’s experience during and after the battle. He outlined the damage done to their family and ended with his acceptance of Clark’s actions. To understand the magnitude of Samuel Jr.’s act of forgiveness, we must understand what the Mumma family lost that fateful September day.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Mummas and Their Farm</strong><br /> At the time of the battle of Antietam, Samuel Mumma Jr. lived with his parents, Elizabeth and Samuel Sr., and nine of his siblings on their 151-acre farm. Members of the German Baptist Brethren, their ancestors had fled religious persecution in the Rhine River Valley. They first arrived in Philadelphia in 1732. They settled in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and remained there until May of 1796. At that time, Jacob Mumma moved his family to the Sharpsburg area. In the following years, Jacob purchased the property that would become the Mumma farm. Jacob bought the land from the Orndorff family who built the original home, barn, and outbuildings. Jacob’s son, John, was the first Mumma to live there. During this time, the family expanded the home with a two-story brick addition. After this modification, the house looked very similar to how it does today, save for a first-floor addition built in 1919.<br /> <br /> In 1831, Jacob sold the house and land to his youngest son, Samuel Mumma, Sr. Samuel successfully farmed the property for next 30 years. In 1860, the value of their farm totaled $11,000, well over $300,000 adjusted for inflation to 2020 dollars. Along with running a thriving farm, Samuel Sr. was father to a large family. He married Barbra Hertzler in 1822. The couple had five children, including a son who died in infancy. In 1833, their last child, a daughter, was born. The baby and Barbara tragically died shortly after the birth. Samuel remarried a few months later to Elizabeth Miller. Samuel and Elizabeth had eleven children, one of whom, Samuel Mumma Jr., would later go on to become the postmaster of Sharpsburg and receive Sergeant James F. Clark’s letter. <br /> <br /> <strong>A Family Forever Changed</strong><br /> Sunday, September 14, 1862 began just like any other for the Mummas. Being German Baptist Brethren or “Dunkers,” the family started their day by walking the short distance from their home to a small white church on the western edge of their property. That church, the Dunker Church, stood on a 4.5-acre plot of land that the Mummas had donated to the congregation. This place of peace was where the Mummas would spend the morning of September 14, unaware that life would soon change forever. During the church service, they began to hear the rumble of artillery fire as the Battle of South Mountain raged just six miles to the east. Following the end of services, members of congregation gathered at the Mumma farm for an uneasy noontime meal. The children, who had been playing outside in the yard, ran inside to report growing clouds of smoke forming on the mountain. War had come to this peaceful community. By the next morning, soldiers had arrived in the area and the people of Sharpsburg realized that another battle would soon take place. Samuel Jr. described his family’s experience as they fled to safety:<br /> <br /> <em>“My father was told the family had better get away, so we left on Monday afternoon the 15th, took nothing with us as they were cannonading then, and we were afraid there would be a great battle at once. Some clothing was gotten together and the silverware packed in a basket, ready to take but in our haste to get away, all was left behind. Father and mother and the younger children left in the two-horse carry … all going about four miles, and camped in a large church called the Manor Church.”</em><br /> <br /> In their haste to leave, the only thing the Mummas brought with them was a gold pocket watch that Samuel Sr. grabbed on his way out of the house. He hung it around his youngest child’s neck to calm her as they fled their home. The family sheltered at Manor Church safe from the battle. However, when they returned, they found that all they owned was gone.<br /> <br /> The Mumma home was the only structure deliberately destroyed during the battle. Around 6:30 am, Brigadier General Roswell S. Ripley, whose brigade had been stationed to the south and west of the Mumma farm, ordered his troops to burn the home. He was concerned that enemy sharpshooters would use the structure as cover to pick off his Confederate soldiers. Members of the 3rd North Carolina Infantry led by Sgt. James F. Clark volunteered for the task. Clark, “recalled throwing a torch through an open window and onto a quilt covered bed. Within a few moments the whole house was in flames.” The fire would quickly spread, and by 7:30, the house and outbuildings were in flames. A stray Union artillery shell would set the barn ablaze and completed the total destruction of the Mumma farm. The soldiers who fought on the northern end of the field witnessed the fire raging from about 6:30 to 11:00 am. The bright flames and mass of smoke further added to the confusion and chaos of the battlefield. A soldier of the 83rd New York remarked that, “just in front of us a house was burning, and the fire and smoke, flashing of muskets and whizzing of bullets, yells of men …were perfectly horrible.” ight brought an end to the fighting, but the nightmare for the Mummas had just begun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Destruction and Recovery</strong><br /> The family returned on September 19. All that remained of their once prosperous farm was the stone shell of their springhouse and three brick walls of their home. The Mummas, left with nothing, stayed at the home of their neighbor, Joseph Sherrick, through the winter of 1862. It took nine months, but the Mumma family rebuilt their home using the surviving brick walls. They moved back in in June of 1863, just before the Confederate army once again moved through the area on its way to Gettysburg. The Mummas, like their neighbors, petitioned the federal government for compensation for the loss of their home. Government officials refused on the grounds that Confederate, not Union, soldiers were responsible for the burning of the home. The Mummas never received a dime for what they lost. Despite this, with the help of friends and family, they were able to rebuild and return to their farm. The family attempted to move on and forget about those horrible September days. They were successful until that day in March of 1906 when Sergeant James F. Clark’s letter arrived. We can never know why Samuel Mumma Jr. responded so kindly to Sergeant Clark. But Samuel Mumma Jr.’s words of forgiveness serve as a reminder that compassion can be found even in the worst of circumstances.<br /> <br /> The farm remained in the family until 1885, when it was sold to Rezin D. Fisher. The property changed hands several more times until it was purchased by the National Park Service in 1961. The Park Service would allow the owners, Hugh and Hattie Spielman, to live there until 1985. In the mid-2000s, the Mumma house and farm became the park’s Education Center. Today, thousands of children come every year to learn about the battle of Antietam and the story of the Mumma family. The Mumma Education Center serves to preserve the memory of the Mumma family and how through tremendous struggle and hardship, they were able to rebuild and forgive.",

They owned a sizable portion of land and ran a prosperous farm and industrial complex along the main road from Frederick to Sharpsburg. The Newcomer’s had no idea that the fall of 1862 would bring war, death, and destruction to their doorsteps.<br />  <br /> <strong>Historical Ownership and Structural Changes</strong><br /> In 1762, Christian Orndorff, a settler from Pennsylvania, purchased 512 acres near the Antietam Creek, and began developing the property that would be later known as the Newcomer farm. He called the tract “Mount Pleasant.” Orndorff built a large three-story home and barn. He also constructed a grist mill, sawmill, and plaster mill along the Antietam Creek. The mills were powered by the seemingly endless flow of creek water. During his ownership, Orndorff expanded the complex to include several workshops and a cooper shop. The property bordered the main thoroughfare connecting Frederick and Sharpsburg and became a center for commerce. Local farmers brought their grain to the mill to be processed and turned into flour for personal use and sale.<br /> <br /> In 1786 Christian Orndorff transferred the milling business to his son Christopher, who continued developing the property. He constructed a home not far from his fathers, and this is the structure that we recognize today as the Newcomer house. Christian continued running the milling operation until the early 19th century, when it was purchased by the Mumma family. The property changed hands several times from 1806 to 1853, when Joshua Newcomer purchased 156 acres of the land formerly known as Mount Pleasant . For almost a decade, the Newcomer family enjoyed the tranquility of the Antietam Valley, before war shattered their peaceful existence.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Battle of Antietam</strong><br /> Confederate and Union forces began arriving in the Sharpsburg area following the battle of South Mountain on September 15th. There were skirmishes on and around the Newcomer property as Union forces tried to secure the Middle Bridge. Captain John C. Tidball of Battery A of the Second U.S. Artillery described the cannonade near the bridge on the 15th in his after action report: “In a few minutes they opened a fire of Artillery; upon which I brought my pieces into position, on the crest of the hill to the right of the road, and fired in reply”.i Tidball recalled that the exchange of fire began around noon and persisted until dark that evening. Skirmishes continued on the 16th, and as the day came to a close nearly 100,000 soldiers settled down for a restless night of sleep knowing that battle was eminent.<br /> <br /> At dawn on September 17th, shots rang out breaking the morning calm as Union soldiers left the cover of the North Woods and moved into a field of corn ready for harvest. Union soldiers attacked south through the Cornfield encountering Confederate infantry and artillery fire from Nicodemus Heights and the Dunker Church plateau. A soldier from the First Texas described the Cornfield as, “the hottest place I ever saw on this earth or want to see hereafter. There were shot, shells, and Minie balls sweeping the face of the earth; legs, arms, and other parts of human bodies were flying in the air like straw in a whirlwind. The dogs of war were loose, and ‘havoc’ was their cry.” Around 9:30, Union forces continued moving south, and fought Confederate forces under D.H Hill in the Sunken Road. At 10:00, a cannonade erupted near the Newcomer property, as General Fitz John Porter ordered the Fifth Corps to advance. Captain Tidball recalled the events in his after action report:<br /> <br /> <em>I was ordered to cross the turnpike bridge over the Antietam where I took position on the right of the road. In front the enemy's Sharpshooters were posted and there being no infantry at hand to drive them back, I opened fire upon them with Canister, and gradually worked my guns by hand up a steep ploughed field to the crest of the hill where I placed them in a commanding position not only for the enemy directly in front, but for an enfilading fire in front of Sumner's Corps on the right and that of Burnside on the left of me. The enemy's batteries all the while were very active, but with some exception his practice was bad.... On the 17th I had one private--Hitz killed, and one severely and two slightly wounded and 10 horses killed. I fired in all about 1,200 rounds.</em><br /> <br /> The Fifth Corps advanced across the Middle Bridge pushing Confederate forces back and successfully occupied the high ground, moving to the outskirts of Sharpsburg by day’s end. After twelve grueling hours, the Battle of Antietam was over. Twenty-three thousand soldiers were missing or had been wounded or killed.<br /> <br /> <strong>Aftermath and Preservation</strong><br /> In the wake of the battle, the Newcomer house, barn, and mill, like many of the structures surrounding the battlefield, became a field hospital for wounded soldiers. Several days after the battle, a photographer named Alexander Gardner visited Sharpsburg and took photographs of the devastation. He Newcomer property is featured in several photographs. Gardner captured the Middle Bridge, the original Orndorff home, and several out buildings of the mill complex.<br /> <br /> The Newcomer family returned to their home to find that they had not been spared from the destructive storm of battle. Joshua Newcomer submitted a claim to the United States government requesting compensation for the damage done to his property,<br /> <br /> <em>On or about 17th day of September 1862 a portion of the U.S. (Army) under the command of General Porter (V Corps) encamped on and near said farm, and on the four days immediately succeeding said battle appropriated for their immediate use a large quantity of his property including 4,964 fence rails, 28 panels of board fence, 42 panels of board fence 16 feet long, 1 sorrel horse, 18 acres of corn and fodder, and the uncut hay on 77 acres of pasture land.</em><br /> <br /> The Newcomers claim amounted to over $3,000 dollars in damages. However, they only received $145 dollars as compensation because it was apparently unclear whether Union or Confederates caused the damage. The Newcomers crops and property were devastated during the fall of 1862, and they never recovered financially . The family left the Sharpsburg area for a time and eventually returned to Maryland and settled in Clear Spring. The milling complex changed hands several times and operated until the late 1880s. After nearly a century, the milling operation along Antietam Creek was shuttered, but its story continues.<br /> <br /> The only structures that remain on the Newcomer property are the house and barn; Maryland Route 34 divides the property in half. The National Park Service acquired the barn in 2003, and it was restored in 2014. A private owner restored the Newcomer house in 2000, and the National Park Service purchased the structure in 2007. In 2010, the Newcomer house opened to the public through a partnership between the National Park Service, the Heart of the Civil War Heritage Area, and the Hagerstown-Washington County Convention and Visitors Bureau, as a visitor center. Here, you can find information on Civil War sites in the Heritage area which spans three counties, peruse exhibits, and participate in monthly programming. <br /> You can find out more about <a href=\"https://www.heartofthecivilwar.org/newcomer-house/\">special programs by visiting this website</a>.<br /> <br /> You can be a part of the Newcomer story by visiting the historic farmstead and enjoying a peaceful walk along Antietam Creek, imagining a time when peace was no where to be found.",

Following the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, the Federal army used many buildings at the Newcomer complex, including the mill, the house, and the barn, as a place to care for the wounded. This lasted for many weeks and Newcomer suffered greatly from the damage to his property and the use of his goods. He filed claims to the government but his business would never recover. In a few years he sold the property to Jacob Myers, who operated the mill complex until just after the turn of the 20th century. The mill was eventually torn down and the stones were reused. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gardner, a photographer working for Matthew Brady, took a series of images following the battle of Antietam. He took more photographs of the area around the Middle Bridge than of any other place. The images are an important part of the Newcomer property's history, showing the various structures at the Newcomer farm and mill, including the original Orndorff house and the one known today as the Newcomer house.<br /> The Newcomer property, at its prime, was a high traffic business complex. While many of the structures are no longer standing, the road passing through the complex continues to be one heavily traveled. The Newcomer house and barn are positioned at the eastern gateway to the Antietam National Battlefield. The house serves as an Exhibit and Visitor Center for the Heart of the Civil War Heritage Area. It provides information on the large concentration of Civil War sites in Carroll, Frederick, and Washington counties. Interpretive and site panels in three rooms of the exhibit center explore the main themes of the heritage area: In the Heat of Battle, On the Home Front, and Beyond the Battlefield.

William Goodhue, 3rd Wisconsin Infantry<br /> <br /> The night before the battle, the Union First and Twelfth Corps crossed Antietam Creek and marched onto the farm fields just behind you. It was the First Corps, commanded by Gen. Joseph Hooker, that opened the battle the following morning.</p> <p>\"A foggy morning was the 17th of September,\" remembered Sgt. Austin Stearns, \"and each army was astir and preparing for the deadly struggle that the lowest private knew was to take place.\" Pvt. Frederick Hitchcock wrote how, \"all realized that there was ugly business and plenty of it just ahead.\"</p> <p>At the earliest blush of dawn, the deep toned thunder of artillery, mixed with the steady rattle of musketry, could be heard through the fog. The soldiers of the First Corps advanced south toward the catastrophe in the Cornfield, one-half mile to the south.</p> <p>Early that morning, Confederate cavalry commander, Gen. J.E.B. Stuart positioned more than a dozen cannon three-quarters of a mile southwest on high ground called Nicodemus Heights. Led by Maj. John Pelham, the shells from these guns devastated the Union soldiers as they advanced out of the North Woods and across the open ground toward the Cornfield.</p> <p>Federal artillerist Albert Monroe vividly remembered the fire that came from Pelham's guns: \"…we could see the first rays of the sun lighting up the distant hilltops, when there was a sudden flash, and the air around us appeared to be alive with shot and shell…The opposite hill seemed suddenly to have become an active volcano, belching forth flame and smoke.\"</p>",

        "notes": "The Otto Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-otto-farm.htm\n\n<strong>The John Otto Family and Farm</strong><br /> After carrying the Burnside Bridge, Union forces advanced over and across the Otto Farm late in the afternoon of September 17, 1862. The Otto Family owned two enslaved people who assisted their six children in working their farm. It is from the stories told by Hillary, one of the enslaved, that we have a better understanding of the Otto Farm at the time of the battle.<br /> Establishment of the Farm<br /> <br /> The farmhouse was constructed on about 90 acres, just southeast of the town of Sharpsburg. Unfortunately, not much of the farm buildings remain today, only the eggshell blue, timber frame house, a few stones from a cellar, and barn foundation remain. Fortunately, much of the original woodwork, floors, and hardware still survives in the house. No other house on the battlefield has as many remaining architectural features as the Otto Farmhouse.<br /> <br /> John Otto was the son of John David Otto who emigrated in 1795 from Germany. John was born in 1802 and as a youngster assisted his father with his tailor business located in Sharpsburg. He married Dorcas Miller in 1825 and soon after the couple purchased the land where they started their family. In the years leading up to the Civil War, John and Dorcas had six children two enslaved people living on the farm. The family and their close neighbors the Sherricks were members of the German Baptist Brethren Church and the Ottos made and donated the bricks that were used to construct the Dunker Church in 1853.<br /> <br /> Before the armies invaded Sharpsburg, records revealed that the Otto Farm was very prosperous. Unfortunately, tragedy struck on Christmas Eve in 1844 when Dorcas died. During the next few years, it can certainly be assumed that Aunt Nancy, mother of Hillary who was also enslaved, assisted John with raising the children. John would marry his second wife, Katherine Gardnouer in 1849.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Maryland Campaign</strong><br /> Again, much of what is known today concerning the farm at the time of the battle comes from Aunt Nancy’s son, Hillary. He was the other enslaved person working the fields with John and his sons.<br /> <br /> Hillary remembered the Confederates showing up on the morning of September 15. The Ottos and Aunt Nancy provided food for the tired “rough” looking soldiers. John took his family away from the area on the 16, but historians are not sure where they went. In 1915, Hillary remembered that he returned on the evening of the 16 to check on the house and found someone had broken in! He eventually tracked the intruder down because, “he left the doors open while making his way through the house.” Hillary confronted the young soldier who then “left after a scolding, without saying a word.”<br /> <br /> During the battle, a Union brigade commanded by Col. Thomas Welsh, advanced across the area where the buildings were located and artillery was posted on the high ground south of the barn. On the left of Welsh’s men, was the division commanded by Gen. Isaac P. Rodman. A timely Confederate counter-attack led by A.P. Hill’s men struck the Federals in the Otto’s 40 acre cornfield, on the south end of the property. It was the action that unfolded on the Otto Farm that brought the bloody day to a close.<br /> <br /> <strong>After the Battle and Freedom</strong><br /> Following the battle, John Otto returned home to find, “my house, bar, and granary were taken possession of...and used for a hospital purpose until November 4, 1862, during which time everything in and around it that could be of any service, was taken and used, including beds, furniture, and commissary stores.” In 1873, Otto put a claim into the government for $2,350.60. He only received $893.53 for the losses he and his family incurred in the fall of 1862.<br /> <br /> One of the outcomes of the battle was that President Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation. Hillary remembered that John Jr. told him, “Now Hillary, you’re your own men. Pop wants to hire you, but you can go work where you please. If you decide to go away, and it happens that by and by you have nothing to do, come back and make your house with us.” Hillary stayed at the Otto Farm.<br /> <br /> John retired as a farmer and lived until 1884. He and his wives are buried in the Lutheran Cemetery in Sharpsburg. Starting in 1976, the Otto Farm became part of the Antietam National Battlefield. Today, The Final Attack Trail winds it’s way in and around the property of the Otto Farm.",

        "name": "The Piper Farm",
        "notes": "The Piper Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-piper-farm.htm\n\n<strong>The Henry Piper Farm and Family</strong><br /> On the morning of September 19, 1862, the detritus of a bloody battle was very evident in the small town of Sharpsburg, Maryland. The heavy scent of wood smoke and decaying flesh consumed the small community located near the Potomac River and Antietam Creek. Leaving his brother Samuel’s farm near the river, Henry Piper and his wife Betsy, made their way to their farm located on the other side of town near the Hagerstown Pike. Both prayed that the main house and outbuildings had not been destroyed by the event that took place on the previous Wednesday, September 17.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Maryland Campaign</strong><br /> It had been a week filled with terror for the Piper family. On Monday, September 15, the vanguard of the Army of Northern Virginia arrived in the Antietam Valley following a battle on South Mountain. That afternoon, Confederate Generals James Longstreet and Daniel H. Hill found their way to the Piper home and informed Mr. Piper that his residence was selected as their headquarters. Staff officers, orderlies, soldiers and horses soon established themselves around the house as the army prepared for battle. Although Henry Piper was known in the community as an ardent Unionist, he felt it prudent to welcome his unexpected guests with dinner and other refreshments. As dinner was served, the Piper sisters offered the generals some of their homemade wine. General Longstreet politely refused the offer, but General Hill had no qualms and drank from the cup offered to him. After seeing no ill effect on Hill, Longstreet changed his mind saying, ”Ladies, I will thank you for some of that wine.”<br /> <br /> Warned by the Confederates of the approaching battle, the couple, three of the six children and the enslaved people residing on the farm “quickly packed what they could carry into a wagon, and Elizabeth buried her dishes in the ash pile”. Mary Ellen Piper remembered their flight: “We left everything as it was on the farm, taking only the horses with us and one carriage”. The Pipers headed first to the Killiansburg Cave along the Potomac River but eventually took shelter at the Samuel Piper farm.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Battle</strong><br /> The Henry Piper Farm was centrally located astride Lee’s defensive line on September 17. From a plateau behind the Piper farmhouse, General Lee and Major General Longstreet saw the columns of Union troops on his front and his flanks. In addition, Confederate artillery batteries sited their targets from this high ground. By 9:00 A.M., two Confederate brigades anchored down the so-called “Sunken Road,” six hundred yards north of the Piper Barn, and it served as a fall back position for troops engaged to the North. Major General William French and Major General Richardson drove their divisions towards the Sunken Road through the Mumma and Roulette Farms beginning at 9:30 A.M. Meanwhile, Confederate Major Gen. Richard Anderson maneuvered his division around and through the Piper buildings and orchard. These Confederate regiments withstood the fire of four Union batteries of twenty-pound Parrot rifled cannons coming at them from a distance of two miles on their right. By 11:00 A.M., the Sunken Road had become a death trap for the Confederate defenders. Receiving fire from three different directions, the Confederate battle line broke for the rear through the Piper Orchard towards the Hagerstown Pike. Hit by a Confederate shell fragment, Major General Richardson was mortally wounded and carried from the field. Major General George McClellan ordered his replacement, Major General Winfield S. Hancock, to call off the attack and consolidate the Union position north of the Sunken Road. That evening, the 7th Maine Regiment of the Sixth Corps received an order to advance towards the Piper Barn. The Confederates drove back the ill-fated attack, which resulted in many Union casualties.<br /> <br /> The following day, neither side renewed the battle, and the Piper farm became a no man’s land between the lines. On the evening of the 18th, Lee took his army back across the Potomac River and returned to Virginia.<br /> <br /> On September 19, the farmers and townspeople of Sharpsburg warily returned to their houses and farms. The Pipers were relieved to find their house, barn and out buildings still standing. Inside their home, however, laying underneath their prized piano were two dead Confederate soldiers. The Pipers’ personal possessions were strewn around the buildings and Union soldiers were butchering the livestock that had not been driven off. Their farm and their lives were in shambles. The Union army stayed in Sharpsburg for the next six weeks.<br /> <br /> <strong>Aftermath</strong><br /> Eventually, Henry Piper filed a claim to the federal authorities for assorted damages to his property and livestock. Although the board of claims awarded him $2,488, he did not receive payment because he did not produce a certificate of loyalty. Twenty-four years later, Henry sued the U.S. Government and one of the witnesses was former enslaved person Jeremiah Summers.<br /> <br /> Henry and Elizabeth moved to Sharpsburg in 1863 and resided at a house they had purchased in 1857 following the death of Henry’s father. This house is still located at the corner of Main and Church streets in Sharpsburg.<br /> <br /> In April of 1864, a company of the 19th United States Colored Troops headquartered at the Methodist Episcopal Church in Sharpsburg was accused of seizing “diverse colored men, free and slave” for service in the Union army. One of those men was young Jeremiah Summers who was only 15 at the time. Henry Piper found the lad at the church headquarters and took him back to the farm. Piper claimed that Jeremiah could not serve because of his age. Not convinced, eight soldiers from the company roughed him up and put him under arrest. He was released on the condition that he produce Jeremiah. The soldiers took Jeremiah away as the people of Sharpsburg townspeople loudly objected.Henry journeyed to Frederick, Maryland and voiced his complaint to the Provost Marshal who thereupon released Jeremiah to his custody. Later, many citizens of Sharpsburg submitted a petition to Major General Lew Wallace and demanded an investigation.<br /> <br /> After Maryland emancipated slaves in 1864, Jerimiah continued to work and reside on the Piper Farm as a paid employee of Henry’s son Samuel. Henry retired to his elegant stone house and later employed Jeremiah’s son Emory. After Henry Piper’s death, he provided Jeremiah with a small cottage and garden near the Sunken Road. Jeremiah Cornelius Summers died in 1925 at the age of 76 and is buried in the Tolson’s Chapel Cemetery of Sharpsburg. Elizabeth Piper died on January 19, 1887 and Henry succumbed five years later on January 14, 1892.<br /> <br /> The Piper Farm that Henry and Elizabeth bought from his father in 1854, was composed of 184 acres and had the only commercial apple orchard in that part of Washington County. Each fall, the cider press located near the stone barn produced many gallons of cider for sale. Six other buildings surrounded the modest farmhouse: the kitchen/enslaved quarters, root cellar, store house, smokehouse, and the barn. The slave quarters were located in the stone house west of the main house. In 1850, Henry owned four slaves and his father owned five slaves. To accommodate these two families, the quarters were divided into two sections with a loft above each section. By 1860, there were six slaves on the farm, five of them children. A kitchen was also located in this building. The Pipers also employed a sixteen year old free black farm hand named John Jumper. The main house had two levels and a root cellar. The second level included the parents’ and children’s rooms. On the first level was the parlor and the center of activity. The piano provided hours of entertainment for the family and guests.<br /> The Piper Farm remained in the family until 1960.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service bought the property from the Antietam-Sharpsburg Museum, Inc. in 1964 for $75,000. Today, the NPS leases out the fields to area farmers and the apple orchard has been re-planted. As the seasons, change, the memories of the hardships that the Pipers and their neighbors endured will never be forgotten.<br /> <br /> To learn more about what our Natural Resource Division is working on in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/anti/learn/nature/the-piper-orchard.htm\">Piper Orchard, click here.</a>",

        "notes": "The Pry Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-pry-farm.htm\n\n<strong>The Phillip Pry Farm and Family</strong><br /> For Phillip and Elizabeth Pry and their five children, their lives were changed forever by a knock on the door. Their stately home stands on high ground overlooking Antietam Creek and the rolling hills of Western Maryland beyond. On most September days, the view from the Pry’s home was as peaceful as it was beautiful. However, September of 1862 was unlike any other before or since. That September would bring fear, suffering and death to the Pry home.<br /> Brothers Phillip and Samuel Pry built the house 1844. After Phillip married Elizabeth Cost in 1847, the couple occupied the home while Samuel and his family moved to a nearby mill. Fifteen years later in 1862 Phillip and Elizabeth Pry had five living children; Samuel Jr., the oldest has just turned 14 and the youngest, Annie, had just turned two.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Battle</strong><br /> Two days before the battle of Antietam, a soldier pounded on the door, and when they answered, a Union soldier told the Prys that the Union Army of the Potomac was taking over their farm. Fifteen thousand soldiers of the Union Second Corps settled onto their property all day on September 15. The next day, a throng of officers moved into the house itself including the army’s commander General George Brinton McClellan. McClellan’s primary headquarters was located just to the east outside of the town of Keedysville, but from there General McClellan could not see Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia that has massed on the hills just west of Antietam Creek. Edmund Randolph Brown of the 27th Indiana remembered that,<br /> <br /> <em>“from that higher ground a view could be had of some of the positions of the enemy. Soldiers of the Twenty-seventh relate that General McClellan and other officers came, during the afternoon of the 16th, and were taking observations from this high ground. So many soldiers gathered around them that they drew the fire of a rebel battery. The general did not retire himself, but he gave personal directions for the soldiers to do so.”</em><br /> <br /> McClellan spent the night before the battle in the Pry House. Philip Pry also stayed at the house. Mrs. Pry and her children escaped to a safer location at the Keedysville farm of Jacob Keedy. McClellan remained at the Pry House on the seventeenth and except for when he advanced across Antietam creek, McClellan and his staff would watch the battle though field glasses from the family home and yard. A reporter with the Boston Journal wrote:<br /> <br /> <em>\"Turning from the conflict on the right, I rode down the line, toward the center, forded the Antietam and ascended the hill east of it to the large square mansion of Mr. Pry, where General McClellan had established his headquarters. The general was sitting in an arm-chair in front of the house. His staff were about him; their horses saddled and bridled, were hitched to the trees and fences. Stakes had been driven in the earth in front of the house, to which were strapped the headquarters telescopes, through which a view of the operations and movements of the two armies could be obtained.<br /> It was a commanding situation. The panorama included fully two-thirds of the battlefield, from the woods by the Dunker Church southward to the hills below Sharpsburg.\"</em><br /> <br /> Allegedly, McClellan went to the attic of the house where there was a trap door and stood on a barrel to look out over the battle. There is still a trap door in the roof of the house today.<br /> <br /> On the high ground adjacent to the house, McClellan’s Chief of Artillery placed some of his long-range rifled cannon. All day on the seventeenth the heavy guns pounded southern soldiers a mile to the west. The Pry House was also advantageously situated to be able to receive signal flag messages from both the left and right wings of McClellan’s army. Historian Willard Brown wrote:<br /> <br /> <em>\"At 10 a.m. (September 16), there had been established on the field at Antietam a station communicating with the lookout on Washington; one with the left of General Burnside's forces, that connected with Elk Mountain; and one on the right with General Meade. A station of observation had been constructed on the crest of Elk Mountain (Red Hill) at the gap cut for the convenience of the officers and designated by the soldiers ''McClellan's Gap.\" The extensive view from this position commanding Sharpsburg and Shepherdstown, and also main points of the battlefield, with its approaches …. All the stations established were placed in communication with the central station at headquarters (Pry house) …. Lieutenant Stone remained at headqu</em>arters where he received the messages constantly coming in from all parts of the fields.\"<br /> <br /> As the battle raged across the creek, soldiers and officers at all levels of command were shot down. General Joseph Hooker, who led the Army’s First Corps, was struck by a bullet early that morning. He was brought to the Pry House so that surgeons could tend to his wounded foot that had filled his boot with blood. A shell fragment struck Major General Israel Richardson as he led the Union attack at Bloody Lane. Eventually moved to the Pry House, Richardson was treated there for his injury and for pneumonia. When she heard about her husband’s condition, Richardson’s wife Frances, along with her sister-in-law, travelled to Sharpsburg to care for him. Frances wrote, “Israel is slowly but steadily improving [but he] has grown very thin and very weak. He is very much depressed, not at all like himself, and inclined to look on the dark side, more than is good for him.”<br /> <br /> While Israel Richardson was recovering from his injury, President Lincoln visited him at the Pry House. Richardson’s wound became infected and he died on November 3, 1862 in the upstairs bedroom. Mrs. Pry claimed that the reason Richardson died was because his wife and sister gave him things to eat against the doctor’s orders. Frances and his sister-in-law had his body embalmed and accompanied his remains back to his home state of Michigan.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Aftermath</strong><br /> By September 20, 1862, McClellan had moved his headquarters south of Sharpsburg. Although McClellan and his staff only occupied the Pry House for a few days, the army presence continued as the Pry Barn was used as a field hospital for Union soldiers until they could be moved to Frederick, MD. The house was used as a hospital for Richardson and possibly other officers for about two months.<br /> <br /> The Pry’s farm was ruined. The Union Army burned their fences for firewood, fed their hay and grain to the army’s horses and mules, trampled their fields, and took their food, horses, and livestock. Mr. Pry filed a claim for his losses and eventually he was paid $4,243.53, but the government waited as late as 1872 to pay some of it. To add insult to injury, the government claimed there was an overpayment error, and Mr. Pry had to return $1,209.38. Unfortunately, the Prys never recovered financially from the losses they suffered because of the army’s occupation of their property. In 1873, the Prys moved to Tennessee; they must have missed their home. When Elizabeth Pry died in 1886, her last wished were to be buried with her family in the Fairview Cemetery in Keedysville, MD. When Philip passed away in 1900, he was also buried there next to his wife.<br /> <br /> The farm passed through several owners over the next century. In 1974, the Federal Government purchased two acres of the farm including the land where the house stands. Unfortunately, in 1976, much of the Pry House burned due to an electrical fire. The Historic Structures Report for the Pry House says, “The exterior walls and roof remained intact but the central hallway with staircase, the northeast parlor, the large upstairs bedroom, and part of the southeast sitting room were damaged - considerably. The front door, the front Victorian gallery, the front window sashes, sills, and lintels were all burned out. The floor between the parlor and basement, the floor between the northeast parlor, and the large northeast bedroom also burned.”<br /> <br /> In the fall of 1977, the NPS rebuilt the burned areas. Contractors did the mechanical, electrical, and plaster, but park maintenance employees did most of the other work. The rear part of the house, the east parlors, and one bedroom were remodeled for park housing. In 2001 and 2002, the park’s Law Enforcement and Natural Resources Division used the space for offices. Currently, the park has an agreement with the National Museum of Civil War Medicine to use the house and barn for exhibit space and interpretive programming. Today you can stroll the house and grounds where Lincoln and McClellan walked, cannons were fired, signals were sent, where generals died, and enjoy the once again serene and commanding view of the battlefield.",

        "name": "The Roulette Farm",
        "notes": "The Roulette Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-roulette-farm.htm\n\n<strong>The Roulette Family and Farm</strong><br /> At the time of the Civil War, William and Margaret Roulette and their children lived on a large, productive farm outside the small town of Sharpsburg. However, by the end of September 1862, that farm had become the backdrop for a significant part of the action of the bloodiest single-day battle in American history. Today, their house and some of their outbuildings stand as silent witnesses to the carnage.<br /> <br /> <strong>Historical Ownership and Structural Changes</strong><br /> The original owners of what we now know as the Roulette property are unfortunately unknown as are the names of those who built the first house on the site. We do know that as early as 1739, William Anderson lived here and farmed a tract called Anderson’s Delight. John Reynolds, who purchased the property in 1761, probably began construction of the oldest part of the house that exists today, which dates to the mid-1700s, and was originally constructed as a two-room cabin; this is the southern part of the house today. Around 1780, the center section was added. Around 1800, a kitchen was added to the north end, which included a beehive oven. Finally, a bathroom was added on in the 20th century.<br /> <br /> Reynolds and his descendants owned the farm until 1804 when John Miller bought the farm. His descendants would grow crops and raise livestock on the property for the next eighty years. Included in this list of descendants was Margaret Ann Miller, whose husband, William Roulette bought the property before the Civil War. The Roulettes had been in Washington County since before 1780, and William Roulette grew up on a different farm in the local area. William and Margaret were married in 1847 and had their first child in 1849.<br /> <br /> <strong>“Drive ‘Em:” The Battle of Antietam</strong><br /> By Tuesday, September 16th, having heard the sounds of battle coming from South Mountain as early as September 14th, William Roulette took his family, including his six children who ranged in age from 1 to 14 years old, to the Manor Church, a Brethren church located six miles north of the battlefield. However, the farm couldn’t be left alone indefinitely, so William returned on September 17:<br /> <br /> <em>Mr. Roulette had removed himself to a safe place in season, but returning himself to look after his stock he was held in limbo by the rebs. When firing began he went into the cellar for safety, but when our boys cleaned out the Johnnies he quickly ran out, shouting excitedly: ‘Give it to ‘em!’ ‘Drive ‘em!’—'Take anything on my place only drive ‘em! Drive ‘em!’ Then he started for the rear, for he wasn’t singing just then “there’s no place like home.</em><br /> <br /> Also living on the farm at the time of the battle were Nancy Camel, a former slave who was working as a domestic servant, and Robert Simon, a 15-year old African American man who was working as a hired farm hand. Camel had been born into slavery October 13, 1813. On June 14, 1859, Andrew Miller of Tilghmanton manumitted Camel. She likely lived in a small room above the kitchen. Her responsibilities probably included gardening, caring for the children, cooking, and cleaning. She was a member of the Brethren church and is buried in the cemetery at the Manor Church north of the battlefield. There was also a tenant farmer’s house along the Roulette farm lane, which Hiram Osborne Clip or Clipp, a Virginian who had briefly been a Confederate soldier before leaving the army and moving to Maryland, lived in while he leased part of the Roulette farm. Archeological evidence suggests that the Clipp house was built around 1820; y 1900 it had been razed.<br /> <br /> Though the house was largely in its present state by the time the Roulettes moved in, William Roulette probably added the large bank barn to sustain his farming operation. The family kept horses, cows, sheep, and pigs on their property and grew corn, wheat, oats, and rye. The farm also contained an orchard, a vegetable garden, and several beehives. These hives would create particular chaos for a rookie regiment advancing toward the Sunken Road around 10:00 am on September 17th. As a Confederate shell exploded among the 132nd PA, the men broke, knocking over the hives. As George Lovettt, Company A, 132nd PA described it in his dedication speech for the regiment’s monument at Antietam in 1904:<br /> <br /> <em>In the line of advance by Kimball to attain this point [the Sunken Road], his forces had to pass through the garden and yard of a residence known as the “Roulette House” and in going through this place on a double quick several bee hives were upset, which caused some disorder and confusion amongst the men, especially the line of the One-Hundred and Thirty-Second Pennsylvania Volunteers, but the confusion caused by this accident of bees was soon straightened out by the action of the Brigade Commander, Field and Staff of the One-Hundred and Thirty-Second.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Death and Devastation: Aftermath</strong><br /> Many wounded Union soldiers were taken back to the Roulette barn, and later ambulances would pick up those who needed to be transported at the intersection of the Roulette farm lane and the Sunken Road. After the fighting had ceased, Union soldiers who held the field began the grim task of burying the dead. Roulette reported that 700 soldiers were buried on his property alone.<br /> <br /> Despite filing claims with the federal government for damages to his property totaling more than $3,500, William Roulette received no compensation for his home and outbuildings, though he did receive a payment of $371 for a hospital claim. The financial impact of the battle was nothing compared to the personal loss that the Roulettes suffered. As a result of typhoid fever, likely caused by the unsanitary conditions of so many soldiers camping nearby, the Roulette’s youngest daughter, Carrie May, who was only twenty months old, died on October 21, 1862.<br /> <br /> Some of the most famous photographs that Alexander Gardner and James Gibson, photographers employed by Matthew Brady, took during their time at Antietam were taken close to where the Roulette Farm Lane intersects the Sunken Road. This series of photos was the first time in the United States that war dead had been photographed before they were buried. To learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/anti/learn/photosmultimedia/gardnerphotos.htm\">photography at Antietam visit this page</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reunion and Preservation</strong><br /> On September 16-17, 1891 veterans of the 14th Connecticut returned to Antietam to tour the grounds. They had difficulty securing accommodations in the small village for so many people—upwards of 300. Ultimately, the Chairman, Secretary, and their wives stayed at the Roulette house, “a spot having great attraction to us not only because of its relation to our first battle experience but as Edenic in its kind.”<br /> <br /> The farm remained in the Roulette family until 1956. In 1998, the Richard King Mellon Foundation purchased the farm and donated it to Antietam National Battlefield. Today, the Roulette farm helps us to picture the landscape that Union troops advanced through toward the Sunken Road and to understand the depth of suffering that followed in the wake of the twelve-hour battle. The house and farm stand as a symbol of not only bravery, but also perseverance and resilience in the face of trauma.",

        "name": "The Sherrick Farm",
        "notes": "The Sherrick Farm\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-sherrick-farm.htm\n\n<strong>Establishment of the Farm</strong><br /> Christian Orndorff purchased the land that would eventually be known as the Sherrick farm in 1761. Orndorff owned a large tract in the area, and upon his death his son divided the land and sold it to two families who wanted to settle along the Antietam Creek in 1796. Joseph Sherrick and Jacob Mumma made the journey from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania to the outskirts of Sharpsburg. Since their farmsteads adjoined on one side, the two families became neighbors in the rolling hills of western Maryland. After the long journey to their new homes, they established a friendship that would span generations.<br /> <br /> The 194 acres that Joseph purchased included an established farm. The deed refers to existing houses, outhouses, barns, fields, woods, meadows, and a “water ditch that is made for the use of watering the meadow.” The original house, presumed to be a log or timber framed structure, is no longer standing. Joseph’s son, Joseph Jr., acquired the land from his father and continued to enlarge the farm.<br /> <br /> Joseph Jr. constructed the brick structure that is known today as the Sherrick farmhouse around the time when he took over the farm from his father. The new home was fashioned in a Greek Revival style, and was completed at one time—it has not been substantially enlarged or modified since its construction. The home is also notable for two other reasons. Instead of having a spring house, the structure is built over the spring the family would have used for fresh water and to keep perishable foods cool longer. In addition, the yard was terraced. The architectural trends of the 1830s are evident throughout the interior, with its highly stylized grandeur. Many of the materials were cheaper and more accessible then they appear. The stairs and baseboard molding in the central hall were marbleized with use of paint on a feather, and the simple pine doors were painted to look like dark walnut. A gold painted pinstripe gave the door the appearance of a having a raised edge as if it included an inset panel. These touches gave the impression that the home was finer and the family more affluent.<br /> <br /> <strong>Battle</strong><br /> After the Confederate defeat at the Battle of South Mountain, General Robert E. Lee pulled his troops back. Moving west, he decided to make a defensive stand around the town of Sharpsburg. The morning before the battle, Confederate troops from Brigadier General Robert Toombs’ brigade took up positions near the house to help guard against Union troops crossing the Antietam Creek near the Lower Bridge, better known as the Burnside Bridge. On September 17, 1862, Confederate artillery was positioned on the heights overlooking the Sherrick farm, where Antietam National Cemetery is today. Additionally, Brigadier General Robert Toombs sent Confederate skirmishers forward of their line to guard the approach to the Lower Bridge. Their goal was to prevent Union soldiers from using the narrow ravine between the Otto and Sherrick farms to get to the bridge. During the fighting, the Sherrick home was hit at least once by an artillery shell and suffered some damage from rifle fire. However, the home made it out of the fight relatively unharmed. Similarly, the outbuildings on the property also suffered little damage.<br /> <br /> <strong>Aftermath</strong><br /> While the Sherrick home was not badly damaged, combat and hungry soldiers had devastated their fields and food stores. Union forces used the Sherrick farm as a field hospital in the aftermath of the battle. The Union army stayed on the field for roughly six weeks following the battle to tend to the dead and wounded. In addition, the Army of the Potomac needed to resupply and train the many new regiments that had the misfortune to join right before the bloodiest single-day battle. This extended bivouac proved more damaging to the Sherrick’s farm then the battle itself.<br /> <br /> Historians believe that in the years before the battle, Joseph Sherrick, Jr. retired from farming and was in the process of moving out of his home to a new one about ten miles north in nearby Funkstown, Maryland. As a result, it is likely that Sherrick rented out a tenant house on his farm. His tenant, Leonard Emmert, tended the Sherrick’s fields at the time of the battle. Joseph Sherrick filed claims to the government for $8 of structural damage from artillery shells to his home and $1,351 in damages from occupying Federal troops.<br /> <br /> However, the Sherrick’s loss was nothing compared to what the family’s neighbors and old friends, the Mummas, suffered. Samuel and Elizabeth Mumma and their ten children lived in a house in the center of the battlefield. The Confederate soldiers burned down the Mumma house to prevent Union sharpshooters from using the upper windows as cover, leaving the family homeless. All that remained of the Mumma farm were three brick walls and the shell of their spring house; all the other outbuildings had burned. Historians believe that the Sherrick’s tenant, Emmert, lived in a separate structure located on the property that is no longer standing. This left the main house empty, and Joseph allowed the Mummas to move in after the battle. They stayed at his home for nine months until they were able to rebuild in June 1863. This act of kindness is a testament to the bonds among this small community and how residents did their best to look after each other in times of hardship.<br /> <br /> <strong>To Present Day</strong><br /> After the Mummas moved out, Joseph continued to rent the farm to tenants, and sold some portions of his property, possibly to try and recuperate money his family lost during the Maryland Campaign. Joseph Sherrick, Jr. died in 1871, and his wife died in 1874; both are buried in the Mumma Cemetery along with Joseph’s parents and members of the Mumma family, once again showing the close ties of these two families in life and death. Joseph’s son-in-law, Victor Newcomer, inherited the farm and continued to seek compensation from the government, but he received very little.<br /> <br /> For several decades, the property remained in the Sherrick-Newcomer family. Sections of the land were sold to veterans’ associations for the placement of monuments and to the federal government for preservation. In 1925, after being in the family for 129 years, the home was sold outside of the family to James Doresy. The National Park Service purchased the 186-acre farm in 1964. The home remains largely untouched; the most extensive modification was the addition of electricity in 1958. Several of the original outbuildings no longer exist. For instance, any tenant houses and a stone outbuilding visible in Alexander Gardner’s photographs taken several days after the battle have vanished. Only the foundation of the barn, which predated the battle, still stands. Unfortunately, the barn caught fire on the night of June 18-19, 1865 and was destroyed.<br /> <br /> Today, visitors can see the Sherrick farm along the driving tour road as they approach Stop 9, the Burnside Bridge. In 1965, a bypass road was created to divert traffic off the Burnside Bridge in order to better preserve this iconic structure. The grounds are accessible by hiking or taking the bypass road, known as Burnside Bridge Road. This splendid Greek Revival home has remined unchanged and enables us to understand the prosperous farming community of Sharpsburg and the Sherrick family. It transports us back in time not only to the Battle of Antietam, but to the height of fashion in the 1830s.",

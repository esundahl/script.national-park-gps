The station has ample parking and is a primary starting point for train excursions and events that head into the national park. The station is on a bus line and within walking distance of shopping and dining.<br /> <br /> A connector trail leads from the station to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail</a>. Cuyahoga Valley National Park is 6.5 miles north. The towpath and railroad run parallel to each other in the park. Bicycles, runners, and hikers can use Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad’s <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/explorer/\">shuttle service</a> for a combination trail-train adventure. The Towpath Trail also continues south and heads through downtown Akron. However, Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad ends at Akron Northside Station.<br /> <br /> Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad operates on tracks constructed by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a>. The railway opened in 1880 to connect the coal fields of central Ohio to the industrial centers of Canton, Akron, and Cleveland. Building the Valley Railway was a test of local perseverance. By the 1880s, railroads were some of the largest corporations in America. Yet, despite financial troubles and construction difficulties, the Valley Railway emerged independent of other railroads. Shaped by the influence of David L. King, an Akron attorney and businessman, the Valley Railway became a partnership among the three cities it served.<br /> <br /> Riders on the scenic railroad see a pastoral landscape similar to what passengers saw along the same route a century ago. Railroads were industrial giants and played an integral role in the history of this region. Nearby exhibits in the station tell more of their history.</p>",

If you can capture that energy with a waterwheel, you can use it to grind grain and make a living. About 1853, the Alexander family built a grist mill here. In time, they replaced the waterwheel with more efficient turbines. Around 1900, the Alexanders sold the business to the Wilsons. After 70 years of using waterpower, the Wilsons switched to electric motors. Today, the family sells pre-bagged feed and fertilizer.

The Valley Railway ushered in a new period of growth. Around 1900, the Cleveland-Akron Bag Company located its factory next to the railroad tracks, shifting the orientation of the community. The company added a store and workers’ residences. Boston Mill Visitor Center now operates in the company store.<br /> <br /> The Valley Railway had a depot in every community along its route through the Cuyahoga Valley, including here in Boston. In 1968, Robert Hunker, a local designer and historic preservationist, purchased the depot. He moved it to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/peninsula-depot.htm\">Peninsula</a> to replace one that had burned.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service built the current boarding station near the site of the original depot. Its architecture is reminiscent of the historic design.<br /> <br /> To reach the visitor center, accessible restrooms, and most locations within Boston, passengers will need to cross the railroad tracks. Walkways from the boarding station lead to the pedestrian crossing.</p>",

By this time, Boston was a paper mill town. Boston had first boomed in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-ohio-erie-canal.htm\">canal era</a> by making canal boats. Boston quieted down as canal traffic slowed with the expansion of railroads in the 1850s. It boomed again after a railroad came directly through town with the 1880 opening of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a>.<br /> <br /> First, Samuel Dyke bought an existing mill on the west side of the Cuyahoga River adjacent to the tracks. He converted it into a toy marble factory. This business was short lived. Then the Cleveland Akron Bag Company opened in 1902, making roofing paper and paper bag liners. As the paper mill expanded, more workers were needed. Polish and other immigrants moved here from Cleveland to fill the need. Boston had become a mill company town. It stayed that way even after the bag company closed in 1923. Some workers drove the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">towpath</a> to work at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jaite-a-paper-mill-and-company-town.htm\">Jaite Paper Mill</a> to the north.<br /> <br /> The 1900s image shows the Commercial Hotel, which stood where the M.D. Garage is now located.

Paddlers may park their vehicles at the trailhead after unloading equipment at the Cuyahoga River Water Trail <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-store-trailhead-river-access.htm\">drop-off</a>.<br /> <br /> When the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> opened in 1827, it pushed Boston from a small frontier hamlet to a busy canal town. Boston became a place where people lived, but also passed through on their travels. Starting in 1880, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a> brought people and commerce through the community. By that time, people from nearby cities started coming here to relax. Today, the tradition continues. People pass through the community as they recreate in the park. People also live here, calling Boston home.<br /> <br /> From this trailhead, visitors can head north or south on the Towpath, Valley, and Buckeye trails. The towpath follows the historic route of the Ohio & Erie Canal and is open to bicycles. A 2.2-mile (each way) walk from here will take you to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/brandywine-falls-trailhead.htm\">Brandywine Falls</a>. Head north 0.5 miles on the towpath to the Stanford Connector to find Stanford Trail, which leads to the falls. This route is not open to bicycles.<br /> <br /> The Valley and Buckeye trails provide more secluded options. The Valley Trail accommodates horses and connects bridle trail networks in the south end of the park with Brecksville Reservation to the north. Horse trailers are permitted at Boston Trailhead. However, the parking lot was not designed to accommodate them, and it can be a challenge to navigate.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.buckeyetrail.org/\">Buckeye Trail</a> circles the state of Ohio. Here, it heads up and down the wooded ravines created by tributaries of the Cuyahoga River. Follow blue blazes to find the Buckeye Trail.<br /> <br /> Heading west over the river, visitors can explore the park at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Boston Mill Visitor Center</a>.

A cluster of outdoor exhibits features Boston’s canal era businesses, including its role in boat building. Boatyards produced the long, barge-like boats that carried passengers and freight. A play structure in the exhibit cluster lets people experience a scale model of a partial canal boat.<br /> <br /> This exhibit cluster is also a good location to see some basic features of the canal. The exhibits are adjacent to the towpath. Today, it is a popular <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">recreational trail</a>. Historically, mules and horses walked the towpath to pull canal boats. These sure-footed animals powered the boats, which did not have motors. The now-dry canal ditch is on the other side of the towpath from the exhibits. Workers dug it by hand to be 40 feet wide and four feet deep.<br /> <br /> During the canal heyday, about half of the boats on the canal were built in Boston and Peninsula. Boston had three boatyards in 1856, the year featured in a bird’s eye drawing of the village in the exhibits. The drawing shows a bustling boatyard on the far side of the canal from the exhibits, a blacksmith shop, and a lumberyard.<br /> <br /> Canal boats included passenger packets and cargo boats. The latter are featured in the exhibits. The size and shape of a canal boat was determined by the smallest lock, which on the Ohio & Erie Canal is 75 feet long by 15 feet wide. The wide, flat-bottomed hull of the boats provided maximum space for cargo while allowing the boat to operate in the canal’s shallow water. Crew and passenger cabins were located at the bow and stern of the boat, while a structure in the middle served as stables for the mules.<br /> <br /> Other businesses took advantage of the canal boom. Julian Edson had a sawmill and gristmill. Jim and Lucy Brown owned the Commercial Hotel, which stood in the location of MD Garage, as well as a small store.<br /> <br /> The Boston Land and Manufacturing Company opened across the street along the towpath in 1835. Notice how the building is not square. Its side façade parallels the canal. Its front façade parallels the road. As a result, it has a rhomboid shape. Today, it houses a store with food and gifts operated by the <a href=\"https://www.conservancyforcvnp.org/\">Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a>.<br /> <br /> Bring yourself into the past by imagining how the sensory experience of Boston would have been different from today. Imagine the banging hammer of a blacksmith; the smell of wet, steamed wood coming from a boatyard; and the sight of work men loading a canal boat and well-dressed passengers hurrying into Commercial Hotel.<br /> <br /> Fortune is fickle. While the town boomed in the 1830s, competition from trains had made an impact by the 1850s. By 1860, the Browns’ business ventures were over and a decade later, Edson’s had crashed as well. Boston would boom again. To learn more about that boom, cross the street to the exhibit adjacent to Boston Store or follow Boston Mills Road west over the Cuyahoga River to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Boston Mill Visitor Center</a>.<br /> <br /> To explore more canal era history, walk the towpath north less than 0.1 mile to Lock 32. An exhibit describes the role of locks in the canal system. Stumpy Basin, where boats could turn around or park, is one mile south along the towpath. Find comprehensive, family-friendly exhibits about the canal at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/historyculture/canal-exploration-center.htm\">Canal Exploration Center</a>, located nine miles north along the Towpath Trail.

It was one of three small crossroads communities in what is now the southern section of Cuyahoga Valley National Park.<br /> <br /> Crossroads communities were once very common in the United States. They grew up at transportation nodes and served as places that provided goods and services to people in outlying areas. They typically had a cluster of homes and farm buildings, a school, church, post office, and at least one commercial enterprise such as a store, tavern, or blacksmith shop. The communities of Botzum, Ira, and Everett emerged during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-ohio-erie-canal.htm\">canal era</a> in the 1800s, becoming shipping and supply points. That service continued with the arrival of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a>, the forerunner of <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a>. Each community had a train depot. Today, nothing remains of Botzum and Ira. Everett is 3.5 miles to the north.<br /> <br /> While not a historic building, the design of Botzum Station evokes the community’s historic depot.

They dug the foundation, made the bricks, and framed in the building using local materials. The design was inspired by illustrations in Asher Benjamin’s popular 1806 stylebook, <em>The American Builder’s Companion</em>. The Frazees chose elements of the Federal style, something that was familiar to them. This style emphasizes balance and symmetry. For the Frazees, the house symbolized success. Although they initially had financial losses when the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> cut through their property, this new transportation route ultimately was a benefit. They went from living in a wilderness outpost to being established farmers. They may have used part of their settlement from suing the state of Ohio to purchase the hardware and glass used inside.<br /> <br /> Minor changes have been made to the house during the past two centuries. The second owner, John Hynton, added a kitchen “ell” in the back, with a woodburning stove. The Frazees had most likely cooked on the hearth. Later residents added electricity and a toilet. However, the room layout has changed very little, a testimony to the timeless Federal style.<br /> <br /> More recently, the building has shown signs of shifting. In 2011 the National Park Service closed the Frazee House to monitor cracks in the foundation and assess damages. The building remains closed pending funding to stabilize and re-open the historic building.<br /> <br /> To learn more, cross Canal Road to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a> where there is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/frazee-house-towpath-panel.htm\">second graphic panel</a> about the Frazee family.

Here they raised their family, farming to put food on the table. Initially they probably lived in a log-style cabin further up the hill along the former road. Early tax records indicate that the Frazee family had horses and a cow. After the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> was built here in 1825, we see a shift in the Frazees’ practices. Tax records after 1827 show Stephen Frazee had up to 8 “milch” (milk) cows—about 7 more than a subsistence family. They probably shipped out excess milk and dairy products on the canal, getting paid in cash. In time they became respected members of their community, raising children who would become teachers, ministers, and farmers.<br /> <br /> The house has been a home to a farming family for most of its existence. Stephen Frazee sold it to John and Elizabeth Hynton. After John’s passing in 1865, Elizabeth and a son-in-law nurtured and grew one of the more profitable farms in the area. After Elizabeth Hynton passed, the house only changed hands a couple of times before being purchased by the National Park Service. In the 1980s, preservationists and historical carpenters stabilized the house. Time is beginning to take its toll though, resulting in the temporary closure of the house in 2012. It waits again, for more work, as it stands guard over the valley.<br /> <br /> Cross Canal Road to get a closer look at the architecture, use the vault toilet, and read a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/frazee-house-panel.htm\">second graphic panel</a>.</p>",

This idea of a fort makes sense, with these earth walls, ringing around this high plateau with steep slopes below. Yet in 1983, archeologists discovered a stone ramp that led from within the earth walls to the surrounding plateau. And archeologists have found no evidence of dwellings within these walls, only a few briefly used fire hearths. Why build a fort if you were not going to live inside it? Archeologists now think these walls may have had a different purpose – more ceremonial. Ceremonial use would have no long term occupation within the walls. Perhaps the walls, now badly worn by plowing and time, did serve as a sort of protection – on the spiritual plane. What do you think?</p>",

Roosevelt proposed putting the nation’s unemployed young men to work rebuilding the country. Out of that vision came the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/legacy-of-the-ccc-at-cuyahoga-valley.htm\">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC).<br /> <br /> At that time, Akron Metropolitan Park District (now <a href=\"https://www.summitmetroparks.org/\">Summit Metro Parks</a>) managed Virginia Kendall Park as a state park. The district recruited CCC Company 576 to develop the park. During a December 1933 snowstorm, the first group of young men arrived at their camp, located near this spot. For nearly a decade, Company 576 used manual labor to build trails, roads, and facilities.<br /> <br /> One of their last efforts was construction of the 11-room Happy Days Camp for children, completed in 1938. They used local Berea Sandstone and wormy American chestnut as their building materials. You can see the “worm” holes in the wood caused by chestnut blight. This fungal disease killed most American chestnut trees during the first half of the 1900s.<br /> <br /> The camp’s name came from the ‘Happy Days Are Here Again’ theme song of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/franklin-d-roosevelt.htm\">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>’s New Deal political platform. The song’s title was given as a symbol of hope for Depression-era youth.<br /> <br /> For years the building served as a dormitory for a summer playground program sponsored by the Akron Board of Education and Recreation Commission. Today, the building is an event space called Happy Days Lodge. It is managed by the <a href=\"https://www.conservancyforcvnp.org/\">Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a>. Visitors come to hear concerts, attend programs, or rent the facility for special occasions.

At one time, a larger building stood in front of the one you see today. The property here changed hands a few times in the 1800s. Martha and Norman Hunt bought it in 1867. Sometime during their ownership, the larger house was lost, perhaps to fire. The Hunts quickly converted their backyard outbuilding into living space. During the Hunt years, this was mostly a grain farm, producing winter wheat, Indian corn, and oats.<br /> <br /> William and Nelle Fiedler purchased the property in 1919. Although William held many jobs through the years, farming was his love. He ran a “truck” farm, selling produce from a stand along the road. In 1920, the Fiedlers welcomed a new baby girl, Helyn. Throughout her life, Helyn cherished the memories and friendships of her <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/kidsyouth/helyn-fiedler-toth.htm\">Everett childhood</a>.<br /> <br /> The exhibits outside Hunt House were developed from family photos and oral and written histories shared by Helyn and her school friends. Imagine being a young girl growing up in Cuyahoga Valley. Flip through her album, listen to their stories, and take your photo with her calf and chickens.<br /> <br /> Hunt House has <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">seasonal hours</a>. When it is open, you can explore the hands-on nature exhibits inside and pick up park information. The restrooms are open all year.

In response to the crisis, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/legacy-of-the-ccc-at-cuyahoga-valley.htm\">Civilian Conservation Corps</a>, or CCC. The Ledges Shelter is a product of this back-to-work program.<br /> <br /> The men employed by the CCC often came with no skills and little work experience. The CCC provided employment, education, and training. At the same time, it left the nation with new parks, forests, roads, and facilities for outdoor recreation. Locally, the sweat and effort of those young men created this retreat for all to enjoy.<br /> <br /> Today, the Ledges Shelter may be reserved at <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/233367\">recreation.gov</a> by groups and families with up to 75 people for a fee. The shelter includes an enclosed area with two fireplaces, eight picnic tables, and an area to serve food. Electrical outlets for normal, two-pronged household appliances such as coffee pots and crock pots are available. It does not have centralized heat. The building’s open pavilion has eight additional picnic tables and a large grill. Drinking water is available at a fountain from May 1 to September 15. Restrooms with flush toilets are available year-round.<br /> <br /> Ledges Shelter is constructed from local Berea sandstone and wormy chestnut, wood from American chestnut trees that had been killed by a blight. The CCC paid attention to the placement of buildings, as well as their design. A large grassy playfield sits next to and in harmony with Ledges Shelter. It invites people to run around, toss a ball, and enjoy the expansive outdoors.</p>",

A short walk would take them to the former community of Ira, located near today’s Ira and Riverview roads. Though the community did not have any stores, taverns, or churches, it was a distribution point for dairy products.

Lock 32 was one of 44 locks on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> between Lake Erie in Cleveland and the Portage Summit in Akron.<br /> <br /> As with highway interchanges, locks became places where businesses concentrated.

McBride’s Grocery served canallers at Lock 32.<br /> <br /> With the opening of the canal, Boston boomed. It grew from a small frontier hamlet to a bustling canal town.

Businesses often sprang up at these spots, making use of the stopped traffic or the power of the falling water. Here at Lock 37, there was a tavern and a store. During the mid-1800s, the Alexanders built a mill across from this tavern. In time, that mill was sold to the Wilson family, who still own the business today. Regulating a constant four feet of water in the canal is a challenge. From the beginning, engineers struggled with too much or too little water. Near this busy lock is a flood gate that allows excess water to be released from the canal into the nearby Cuyahoga River. Even today this lock remains busy—being near the Towpath Trail, the Wilson Feed Mill, and the access road to the Fitzwater Trainyard. </p>",

On summer weekends when conditions allow, volunteers demonstrate how a lock operates. Canals were designed as waterways without waterfalls or a current. Locks were built to raise or lower canal boats wherever there was a significant change in elevation. A lock works much like a toy in a bathtub. If a boat needs to go up, water is let in through butterfly valves in the upstream gate. The chamber is filled until it is level with the upstream water. If the boat needs to go down, water is let out through butterfly valves in the downstream gate. When the water is low enough to match the downstream level, the downstream gates can be opened.

Boats carried timber and farm products to Lake Erie and returned with manufactured goods and specialty foods.<br /> <br /> Unlike Ohio’s rivers, canals offered a consistent depth for boats to travel and no current. Yet the land they travel through is not flat. Water is travelling north from a high point near Portage Lakes in Akron, down 395 feet to the level of Lake Erie at Cleveland. Whenever the drop of water or land was significant, a lock was installed to move boats up or down. In effect, locks acted as elevators for boats. Water would be let in from the higher side to raise the water level, or let out on the lower side to lower the boats.<br /> <br /> Originally locks were made of carved sandstone, and often lined or “puddled” with clay to keep them from leaking. But water takes its toll. During 1905-1906 renovations, this sandstone lock was refaced with a new concrete surface, now also wearing away.<br /> <br /> Along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a>, a graphic panel describes the function of the locks.

In 1832, he built a water-powered grist mill here, beside the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a>. Local farmers came to the mill to have their grain ground and then shipped out to distant markets on canal boats. When the Valley Railway arrived in 1880, it competed with the canal. To get goods over the river to the new station, the mill built a bridge from its upper level to the east bank. Wagons heavy with ground grain and feed crossed over and were offloaded onto freight cars.<br /> <br /> In 1902, Chandler Moody and Charles Thomas bought the mill and enlarged it. They continued to mill flour and feed until 1931, when a fire burned the mill to the ground. While the dust from grinding grain is highly combustible, questions have remained about the fire.<br /> <br /> For more history, head north to Lock 29 or head south to Deep Lock Quarry. For your safety and to protect park resources, do not climb on the stone ruins.</p>",

After heavy rains, mud and gravel flow over the opening and into the canal. Periodically, the National Park Service must dredge this section of canal. Look for accumulation under “Mudcatcher Falls.” This manmade waterfall flows during all but dry weather. A graphic panel explains the scene. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8ae80938-fc4a-41f3-8dc3-3a555abccf2f}{163}\" paraid=\"1326709139\">From here, visitors can travel north or south on the Towpath Trail.

The Canalway Partners and the Ohio & Erie Canalway Coalition both serve as the coordinating entity for the heritage area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{11}\" paraid=\"9\">When the Ohio and Erie Canal was built between 1825 and 1832, there were only 22 states at the time. Nineteenth-century Ohio was geographically isolated from the economic prosperity of the east by the Appalachian Mountains. A lack of transit routes made obtaining and exporting goods and services difficult. Upon its completion in 1832, the Canal connected Lake Erie and the Ohio River to the Erie Canal, creating a vital transportation route between the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, allowing resources to flow more freely across Ohio and the nation. It is known for providing “routes of prosperity.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{27}\" paraid=\"10\">The creation of this inland water transportation system was a key point in the nation’s journey to becoming self-reliant on resource development, rather than relying on European trade routes. The Ohio & Erie Canal attracted pioneers, immigrants, and entrepreneurs to the region, leading to interconnected and thriving communities blossoming with opportunity for new business and industry. As the rise of railroads led to decreased use of the canal for transportation, industrial development continued on the canal's banks to harness its hydroelectric power.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{33}\" paraid=\"11\">In March of 1913, Ohio experienced a great flood, considered to be the second deadliest flood in the United States and the most devastating natural disaster Ohio ever experienced. The Ohio and Erie Canal was damaged beyond repair and ultimately abandoned. While this hurt local communities, their tenacity was unwavering. Community members knew the vitality of this region would be long-lasting if they worked to connect people back to their shared history of the Canalway. Today, the canal is still used for transportation, but this time for hiking, running, and cycling along the Towpath Trail, a recreation path that follows the old Canalway route and continues to connect the region's communities.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{90}\" paraid=\"19\">Historic Sites and Points of Interest: </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{96}\" paraid=\"20\"><a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/the-towpath-trail/\">Towpath Trail and Greenway</a>   </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{106}\" paraid=\"21\"><a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/cuyahoga-valley-scenic-railroad/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"3\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{114}\" paraid=\"22\"><a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/americas-byway/\">National Scenic Byway</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"4\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{122}\" paraid=\"23\"><a href=\"https://www.wrhs.org/\">Western Reserve Historical Society</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"5\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"5\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{130}\" paraid=\"24\"><a href=\"https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/parks/visit/parks/ohio-erie-canal-reservation\">Ohio & Erie Canal Reservation</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"6\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"6\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{138}\" paraid=\"25\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-cuyahoga-river-recovers.htm\">Industrial Valley & Cuyahoga River</a></p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"7\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"7\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{146}\" paraid=\"26\"><a href=\"http://www.ohioeriecanal.org/howehouse.html\">Richard Howe House</a>  </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"8\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"8\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{156}\" paraid=\"27\"><a href=\"https://www.visitcanton.com/directory/congressman-ralph-regula-canalway-center/\">Congressman Ralph Regula Canalway Center</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"9\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"9\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{164}\" paraid=\"28\"><a href=\"http://cityofcanalfulton-oh.gov/\">Canal Fulton</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"10\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"10\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{172}\" paraid=\"29\"><a href=\"https://historiczoarvillage.com/\">Historic Zoar Village</a> </p> </li> </ol> <h2 paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{184}\" paraid=\"31\">Notable People: </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"4\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{190}\" paraid=\"32\"><a href=\"https://www.summithistory.org/simon-perkins-family\">Simon Perkins</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"4\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{198}\" paraid=\"33\"><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-D-Rockefeller\">John D.

It is a place where you can set your own pace. Race down the hills on a sled on a snowy day. Slow down to enjoy the scenery and nearby trails.<br /> <br /> In the 1800s, the Ritchie family farmed this area. As Cleveland and Akron became major industrial cities after the Civil War, business leaders began buying farmland for valley retreats. Cleveland industrialist Hayward Kendall purchased much of the area. He willed his property to the state for a park and asked that it be named for his mother, Virginia Kendall.<br /> <br /> Kendall Hills was not part of the original Virginia Kendall Park. In 1936 the Akron Metropolitan Park District wrote to neighbor A.A. Stambaugh, vice-president of Standard Oil, offering to lease the property. Winter sports enthusiasts were spilling over from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/kendall-lake-through-the-years.htm\">Kendall Lake area</a> for coasting and skiing whenever the toboggan chutes were crowded. Stambaugh said that wasn’t necessary, he was happy to see the land used.<br /> <br /> Today, the scenery is dominated by oak, hickory, and beech woodlands that have reclaimed the former farmland surrounding the hills. Dark green of stands of white and red pines dot the woodlands. They were planted by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/legacy-of-the-ccc-at-cuyahoga-valley.htm\">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> in the 1930s to hurry forest regeneration. The hills themselves are a mix of mowed grass and meadow. In late summer, meadow flowers attract butterflies and other pollinators.<br /> <br /> Pine Hollow provides access to the park’s interconnected trail system. The 3.3-mile Salt Run Trail starts to the left of the parking when facing the hills. The 4.5-mile Wetmore Trail is across Quick Road. Connector trails lead downhill to the 1-mile Lake and 2.3-mile Cross Country trails.</p>",

It is located at a high spot in the middle of Cuyahoga Valley, off State Route 303. This is a good choice for hikers and runners who prefer solitude, scenic views, and the physical challenge of hills. See our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hiking.htm\">hiking page</a> for trip planning information.<br /> <br /> The Buckeye Trail makes a 1,400-mile circle across Ohio. It is managed by the <a href=\"https://www.buckeyetrail.org/\">Buckeye Trail Association</a> which divides the trail into 26 sections and offers detailed maps. The route is marked by blue blazes, often painted on the trees. Hikers can enjoy day trips or plan for through-hiking. The section north from Pine Lane wanders 2.5 miles through upland forest along the east rim before crossing the valley’s floodplain in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/village-of-boston.htm\">Boston</a>. There it heads up the western valley wall to Blue Hen Falls and beyond. The south section quickly joins the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a> in Peninsula and explores the lowlands along the historic <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a>. Access it by following the parking lot west to the old Pine Lane and turning right, down the old brick road.<br /> <br /> The Valley Trail is shared by hikers and horseback riders. It goes the length of the park, connecting with other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/horse-trails.htm\">horse trails</a> to the north and south. The Pine Lane parking lot is small and does not have designated trailer spaces. It is not an ideal starting place for riders, but some may travel through. Remember that horses always have the right of way. If hikers encounter a horse, stay visible and greet the rider. Stand off the trail and keep any <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">pets</a> on a short leash. Allow plenty of space to pass and avoid sudden movements. Horse trails can be muddy, so plan your footwear wisely. The section north goes through Boston in 2.4 miles, crosses the floodplain at Jaite, and continues into Brecksville Reservation. The section south connects with the Wetmore trail system in 3.8 miles and the Everett area trails beyond.<br /> <br /> The land around this trailhead was once owned by Fred C. Kelly. Kelly was a nationally known newspaper columnist, humorist, and Wright Brothers biographer. He had a passion for conservation, helping form the first Cuyahoga Valley Association. In the 1940s, he infamously carried an axe on his walks to chop up tacky billboards along State Route 303. Pine Lane was named for all the trees he planted on his property.</p>",

It consisted of a wooden crib dam, a gate, and a feeder channel. This system diverted Cuyahoga River water to “feed” the canal from Brecksville to Cuyahoga Heights. The concrete Brecksville Diversion Dam was added in 1951-52. About 120 feet north, the newer dam created a dam pool that hid the old wooden structure underwater.<br /> <br /> Dams harm fish habitat, change water temperatures, and alter the natural flow of water and sediment through our waterways. In 2020, the National Park Service and its partners <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/dam-removal.htm\">removed these dams</a> to help wildlife recover and to make our water cleaner. After almost 200 years, the Cuyahoga once again flows freely here. A modern screw pump will help maintain the proper water level in the nearby section of canal that is designated a national historic landmark. This was the best solution for protecting both natural and cultural resources.<br /> <br /> From here, visitors can go north or south on the Towpath Trail. To the north are the remains of Lock 36, one of many water-filled “elevators” that raised or lowered canal boats. Beyond is the Mudcatcher and a view of a bald eagle nest across the river.

The 100-mile river’s headwaters are only 30 miles from its mouth. It travels southwest before turning north. It flows through farmlands, woodlands, suburbs, and cities. The Cuyahoga was once so polluted that it caught fire many times, downstream in Cleveland’s shipping channel. The infamous <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/story-of-the-fire.htm\">1969 blaze</a> helped spark the Clean Water Act, the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, and other milestones in the environmental movement.

Discover the basic geology at the Ritchie Ledges graphic panel. It describes how water and weathering shaped the rock.<br /> <br /> About 315-320 million years ago, the area was steamy swamp. Periodically fast-moving streams dropped sand and pebbles here. Over time, this material was compacted into rock called Sharon Sandstone and Conglomerate. Erosion has carved the rock into the forms you see today.<br /> <br /> Like a sponge, the rock absorbs rainfall between the grains of sand and pebbles. This water makes the Ledges cooler and moister than its surroundings. More northern plants and animals can thrive here. Look for evergreen eastern hemlock trees and listen for the cheery, buzzy song of black-throated green warblers. Take a moment to enjoy the coolness and beauty of this microclimate.<br /> <br /> Life on the Ledges is fragile. Mosses and ferns cling to sand and pebble crevices.

Competition and economic slumps delayed its completion until 1880. This became the shortest route between Akron and the coalfields of Tuscarawas County to the south and Cleveland’s ports in the north. For the valley, these train stations were a lifeline to the outside world. They provided passenger service and allowed farmers to ship out their milk, cheese, grain, and lumber.

Legend tells us that he suggested the name of Boston when <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/village-of-boston.htm\">the village</a> decided to incorporate. Sadly, he didn’t live to see Boston become a bustling canal town.<br /> <br /> His oldest son, George, no doubt profited from the canal. He built this Greek Revival house in 1843 and expanded the family farm to 283 acres by 1853.  Over time, the family had sheep, dairy cattle, orchards, timber, and grain. Besides farming, George and his son ran a lumber business on the property.<br /> <br /> Today, the <a href=\"https://www.conservancyforcvnp.org/\">Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a> offers overnight accommodations for individuals and groups in a restored Stanford House. The building’s interior reflects its historic character while also featuring furnishings crafted locally from sustainable and reclaimed materials. The house is normally closed to the public, except for lodging and for special programs.<br /> <br /> The grounds of Stanford House have picnic tables for outdoor gatherings. Across Stanford Road from the house, the Stanford Connector leads to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail</a>. A 0.4-mile trail heads around the pond and to Hines Hill Conference Center. The 1.5-mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/stanford-trailhead.htm\">Stanford Trail</a> starts behind the barn and leads to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/brandywine-falls-trailhead.htm\">Brandywine Falls</a>.</p>",

Here two bridges cross the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/cuyahoga-national-heritage-river.htm\">Cuyahoga River</a>, bringing Summit and Cuyahoga counties together. The oldest is the 1881 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/preserving-the-station-road-bridge.htm\">Station Road Bridge</a>. It was built of wrought iron in the style of a railroad bridge, using both older and newer technologies. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/explore-the-station-road-bridge-area.htm\">Photographers love</a> the arched Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge that dominates the view. Concrete was a relatively new construction material when it was built in 1931.<br /> <br /> The river that re-carved these narrows has an unusual shape. It flows south from its headwaters in Geauga County until it hits Akron’s bedrock. There it turns sharply north, burrowing into a pre-glacial riverbed. This U-turn gives the river its name: Cuyahoga, after an Iroquoian word for curve or jawbone. The ridge it hits at Akron forms a continental divide, with water south of it flowing toward the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and the water north flowing into Lake Erie at Cleveland. Cuyahoga Valley lies between the cities. The river and its terraces form the bottomlands. Steep ravines and rock ledges define the uplands on either side.</p>",

Documents reveal that Ma Parker had her tavern on or near this location by the time of canal construction. Artifacts uncovered here also suggest this was a pre-canal tavern. The original building was the southern half of the structure. By 1841, Moses Gleason bought the property and sold it to his son. Isaac Gleason added the southern part of the building, turning it into a store serving travelers waiting at Lock 38. The Gleason family continued to live here until the early 1900s. After that, the building became a residence and later housed a blacksmith shop. As the building wore down, it became a multi-resident structure.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service purchased the property and began historic reconstruction in the early 1990s.

Here the canal must cross the Cuyahoga River’s largest tributary, <a href=\"https://www.tinkerscreek.org/about-us/\">Tinkers Creek</a>. Using technology first developed by the Romans, canal engineers made an aqueduct to carry the built waterway over the natural stream. Originally it was a bit farther north. However, shortly after the canal was constructed, Tinkers Creek flooded the aqueduct, proving how unpredictable it can be. The aqueduct was re-built at its present location, but in time suffered more flooding, debris, and leakage. The previous aqueduct was built by the King Iron Bridge Company, but even iron cannot stand against floodwaters. In 2011 the national park replaced it with this concrete one.</p>",

The trail surface is unpaved and the landscape is hilly. Trail conditions can be muddy in spring or after a heavy rain. For everyone’s safety, hikers should always yield to horseback riders.<br /> <br /> From the bulletin board information panels, you can head in two directions.

After the war h</span>e began his career in this city, met his beloved wife, and ran for the highest office of the nation here. He was the last Civil War veteran elected president. His election in 1896 launched an era of Republican dominance that continued until 1910. McKinley governed during a period of intense American expansionism. Domestically, he supported policies that benefitted American business, including high protective tariffs and deflationary fiscal policies.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">On September 6, 1901, an anarchist shot McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He died eight days later. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">After lying in state at the United States Capitol, McKinley’s body returned to Canton.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Mark Hanna, McKinley's <span>lifelong friend, political mentor, and manager,</span> and some of McKinley’s friends immediately began planning a suitable memorial. They chose this site in Canton’s Westlawn Cemetery that McKinley once suggested would be an appropriate location for a soldiers’ and sailors’ memorial. The McKinley National Memorial Association, organized in 1901, purchased the site, and appealed to the public for the $600,000 needed to create the memorial. Construction began in 1905. Nine different States donated materials used in the memorial, completed in 1907. Ida McKinley died that year; she lies next to her husband in the memorial chamber. William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum, a private nonprofit organization under the umbrella of the Stark County Historical Society, administers the memorial and its grounds.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The McKinley Memorial that contains the tomb stands on a grass-covered hill overlooking the city of Canton. Designed by architect H. Van Buren Magonigle, the circular, domed pink granite building rises 96 feet above ground and measures 79 feet in diameter. The double bronze doors of the entrance were the largest in the nation at the time of installation. Originally a long, narrow reflecting pool stretched out from the base of the hill in front of the memorial. This feature, together with the 108 stone steps that lead up to the mausoleum, symbolized the President's sword in time of war. In 1951, a depressed lawn replaced the pool, but the sword effect remains. Midway up the steps is a large bronze statue by Charles Henry Niehaus of President McKinley delivering his last speech in Buffalo.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Colored marble laid in a cross pattern forms the floor of the mausoleum. The bodies of McKinley and his wife lie side by side in two polished, dark-green, granite sarcophagi, resting atop a ten-foot-square of polished dark maroon granite in the center of the space. Their two young daughters are also laid to rest here. Three semi-circular arched bays encircle the central chamber. The entablature and frieze extending around the bottom of the dome contain words from McKinley's last speech.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the </em></span><em><a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a></em><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><em>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded preservation work at the McKinley Memorial in 2000. </em></span></p>",

They marched four miles and crossed to the north side of Old Town Creek and camped in the late afternoon. At 5 p.m., from a commanding ridge south of Old Town Creek, Confederate forces surprised Smith’s troops with artillery and infantry fire. The Federals scrambled and formed a line that pushed the Confederates off the ridge and forced them to retreat to Harrisburg. The fight at Old Town Creek ended the Battle of Tupelo. Among the casualties was Forrest himself, who was kept out of action for three weeks.<br /> <br /> To learn more about the Battle of Tupelo and the surrounding area check out the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tupe/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Parkway Visitor Center on the Natchez Trace Parkway</a>.<br /> <br />  ",

        "notes": "Tupelo National Battlefield Monument\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/tupelo-national-battlefield-monument.htm\n\nThis granite monument was placed here in the 1930s. The National Battlefield was established and originally managed by the War Department starting in 1929. The monument commemorates the men who fought at the Battle of Tupelo, also known as the Battle of Harrisburg.<br /> <br /> The monument inscription is as follows:<br /> IN MEMORY<br /> OF THE MEN OF THE<br /> FEDERAL AND<br /> THE CONFEDERATE ARMIES<br /> WHO TOOK PART IN THE <br /> BATTLE OF TUPELO<br /> OR HARRISBURG<br /> JULY 14-15.<br /> 1864<br /> WHICH RESUTLED IN<br /> A VICTORY FOR THE<br /> FEDERAL FORCES UNDER<br /> MAJOR GENERAL<br /> ANDREW J. SMITH<br /> <br /> <strong>Battle Summary:</strong><br /> On the morning of July 14, the Battle of Tupelo began at 7:30 a.m. when the Confederates began a series of uncoordinated charges against the Federal position. These attacks were beaten back with heavy losses to the Confederates. Failing to break the Federal center, the Confederates attacked the Federal right again without success. After dark, the Confederates made another attack from the south without significant effect. Although his troops had repulsed several Confederate attacks, Federal General Andrew Jackson Smith ordered his men back towards Memphis. His army would engage the Confederate forces several miles outside of town on July 15, 1864 at what is called the Battle of Old Town Creek.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tupe/index.htm\">Battle of Tupelo National Battlefield</a> for additional Information.<br /> <br />  ",

Lee</a> (CSA) could only watch as Union armies defeated Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley and in the Carolinas. Added to this was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/jefferson-davis.htm\">President Jefferson Davis'</a> (CSA) commitment to continued prosecution of the war and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/us-grant.htm\">Gen. Grant's</a> (USA) continued buildup of Union troops at Petersburg.</p> <p>Lee had <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/john-gordon.htm\">Gen. Gordon</a> (CSA) formulate a plan that, at the very least, would enable the Army of Northern Virginia to pull out of Petersburg unmolested and perhaps give it a chance to link up with the Confederate army in North Carolina. The idea was a surprise attack that would force Grant to shorten his lines or even set his lines back, allowing for a clean pullout for Lee.</p> <p>Gordon developed a pre-dawn surprise attack on a Union fort, Fort Stedman. It was one of the closest spots on the line, there were fewer wooden obstructions, and a supply depot on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/united-states-military-railroad.htm\">U.S. Military Railroad</a> was less than a mile behind it. Lee approved the plan.<br /> <br /> <strong>4:00 am</strong></p> <p>On a signal, lead parties headed out to overwhelm Union pickets and to remove wooden defenses. This was the initial wave of a force that represented nearly half of Lee's army.</p> <p>It was a complete surprise as they captured Fort Stedman and the batteries just to the north and south of it with little resistance. As the Confederates rounded up nearly a 1,000 prisoners, the lead attackers reached Harrison's Creek along the Prince George Court House Road.</p> <br /> <p><strong>6:00 am - 7:00 am</strong></p> <p>Due to the various whereabouts of the senior commanders, the Union response fell upon <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/john-hartranft.htm\">Gen. Hartranft</a> (USA), a divisional commander in the IX Corps.</p> <p>Between some confusion among the attacking Confederates, Union artillery support from up and down the line, and the response by Hartranft's infantry the attack is stopped.</p> <p>Gordon, who was in Fort Stedman, realized the plan had failed when his lead men started returning unable to find the depot and reporting Union resistance. Lee soon gave permission to Gordon to pull his men back.<br /> <br /> <strong>8:00 am</strong><br /> <br /> By 7:30am the Union forces had sealed the breach and the Union artillery was heavily bombarding Fort Stedman. A coordinated attack started shortly before 8:00am, Hartranft advanced on the fort, re-claimed it, and made the ground between the lines a true \"no man's\" land for those Confederates retreating to their trenches.<br /> <br /> This gamble turned out to be a four hour action with no impact on the Union lines. In fact the Union counter attack further down the line near Fort Fisher, produced greater results. The ground won there allowed the Union to launch one of their break through attacks on April 2, 1865.</p> <p>The battle of Fort Stedman was a devastating blow for Lee's army.</p>",

        "notes": "Poplar Grove National Cemetery\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/poplar-grove-national-cemetery.htm\n\n<p>The eight-acre Poplar Grove National Cemetery is the final resting place for over 6,000 U.S soldiers, who died during the Civil War. Soldiers who served in the Spanish American War, WWI, WWII and Korean War are also buried in the cemetery. One British soldier, a member of the Royal Fusiliers, who died from the flu while training soldiers at Camp Lee, (Fort Gregg-Adams) during WWI is buried in section X.<br /> <br /> The layout of the cemetery is fairly unique among national cemeteries, consisting of a square parcel with concentric circles radiating from a flagpole and mound at the center. Initially, the Poplar Grove Church meeting hall stood at the center of the cemetery. The deteriorated building was removed in 1868. Beginning in 1871, the federal government implemented a series of improvements for the cemetery, including the cemetery’s brick enclosure wall and iron gates, marble headstones for the graves, and the erection of a superintendent’s lodge near the cemetery’s entrance. Additional improvements at Poplar Grove National Cemetery included the construction of an iron rostrum (1897) and restrooms and maintenance facilities (1929). <br /> <br /> In 1933, the management of the cemetery was transferred to the National Park ServiceIn 1957 the cemetery officially closed to new interments. The last burials were of three unknown U.S. soldiers on Memorial Day in 2003.Poplar Grove National Cemetery is part of Petersburg National Battlefield.<i></i></p>",

He was a successful businessman and avid conservationist. Mather was the first Director of the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> He was appointed special assistant to the Secretary of the Interior, in 1915. Mather focused on establishing an office to manage the National Parks. His vigorous efforts built public and political support for the parks. This helped persuade Congress to create the National Park Service (NPS) in 1916. Stephen Mather was appointed Director of the NPS in May 1917. He continued to promote park access, development. Mather also contributed generously to the parks from his personal fortune.<br /> <br /> National park sites throughout the country have plaques dedicated to Mather. All concluding with the inscription \"There will never come an end to the good that he has done.\" Petersburg National Battlefield dedicated this plaque in August of 1991.

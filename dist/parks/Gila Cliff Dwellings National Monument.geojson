About 28 million years ago, the ground under your feet exploded and shot huge amounts of ash and shards of volcanic glass into the sky. As this material fell to the ground, it was still hot and welded together into a stone called tuff.<br /> <br /> Later volcanoes oozed lava over the welded tuff forming the darker andesite rock above. As the lava erupted, escaping gasses left the many holes you see in the hillside today.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Formation in the Gila Conglomerate</strong><br /> As the volcanoes quited, the long process of steady erosion began. Ground level was once at the height of the caves. The creek slowly began to carve laterally through the weak points in the canyon walls. The final result was large caves, scoured out of the Gila Conglomerate. This is where the Mogollon people built their homes over 700 years ago.",

Do you see closets or storage space? Is there a kitchen area for cooking? What about working and sleeping space for the family? It is all here, with a solid roof over your head, and a beautiful view of the surrounding area. The smaller rooms were used for storage, the large space that now looks open was likely an enclosed living space, and the fire pit represents a cooking area.<br /> <br /> <strong>What’s Cooking?</strong><br /> Of the 32 species of plant remains found in the dwellings, 24 were wild. These include wild grapes, berries, acorns, and piñon nuts. Domestic crops grown included several varieties of corn, beans, and squash. Early inhabitants grew these crops along the river and high on the mesa tops. The rabbits and deer of the area would have been a welcomed source of protein for the Mogollon people’s diet.",

Careful observation reveals a row of wooden beams just below the door. Archaeologist think that occupants may have climbed up a ladder onto a wooden balcony to enter the door. Some archeologist associate the T-shaped door with the Ancestral Puebloan Culture found to the north of this area. How did an Ancestral Puebloan door get on a Mogollon home? Many believe that the door is an indication of trade. Not just the trading of goods; but of ideas, beliefs and even architectural styles. Others believe that the T-shaped door is a feature of the entire Southwest rather than being indicative of a single cultural group.<br /> <br /> The actual purpose or meaning of the T-shaped door remains a mystery to archeologist.",

They are the original beams the Mogollon people used to build roofs for their homes.<br /> <br /> Look for the small round “plug” in one of the beams. Using dendrochronology (the study of tree ring patterns), archeologists can accurately date the structures you see before you. Most of the rooms were built in the 1280’s, but humans used these caves for shelter much earlier. The heavy soot on the cave’s ceilings, and artifacts that date to earlier cultural groups make it likely that humans temporarily camped in these caves for thousands of years.<br /> <br /> Yet only the Mogollon people decided to build within the caves and make this place their home. There must have been very compelling events that caused these people to leave their pueblos and reside in the cliffs.",

Several families made the dwellings their home for about one or two generations; building, crafting art, raising children, and sharing stories much as we do today. Imagine the details of their lives and leave the clues for others to discover and enjoy as well.<br /> <br /> <strong>Where Did They Go?</strong><br /> The reasons the Mogollon people left the dwellings around 1300 remains unknown. However, they continued a tradition of journeying that was a part of their culture. Evidence of the Mogollon culture disappears from the archeological record in the 1400s, but the Mogollon people did not disappear. Their descendants live on in today’s Pueblo Cultures of Arizona and New Mexico.",

For the Mogollon people, the yucca had many uses. The leaves were frayed at the ends to become paintbrushes, fibers from the leaves became weaving twine, mats, and sandals.

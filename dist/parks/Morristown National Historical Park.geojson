They camped along the Mendham-Elizabethtown Road at the base of the hill on the east side of the Wick farm orchard.</p> <p> </p> <p>Most of the nearly 2,000 soldiers of the Line mutinied on January 1, 1781 because of disputes over their terms of enlistment. During the mutiny one enlisted man was killed in the orchard. A couple of officers were wounded and one was killed.</p> <p> </p> <p>A lieutenant gave this description of the officer’s death, “<em>a solider from the mob made a charge upon Lieut. Col. William Butler, who was obliged to retreat between the huts to save his life. He went around one hut and the soldier around another to head him, met Capt. Bettin who was coming down the alley, who seeing a man coming towards him on a charge, charged his Espontoon to oppose him, when the fellow fired his piece and shot the Captain through the body and he died two hours later.\"</em></p> <p><br /> This monument to the dead officer was erected around 1900. It replaced an earlier monument. Local tradition claims the monument marks the burial site of the officer killed during the mutiny. However there is no documentation to prove this. While the quote and the monument you see both claim the officer’s name was “Bettin,” records show the name was actually Bitting.<br />  </p> <p>Local tradition also claimed he was buried near a black oak tree which became known as the “Bettin Oak.” A 1938 study concluded that the Bettin Oak was more than 200 years old and was a well-developed tree of at least ten inches in 1779.<br /> <br /> On November 25, 1971, wind and heavy snow caused the weakened Bettin Oak to fall. In 1975 a red oak sapling, the state tree of New Jersey, was planted nearby as a replacement.</p>",

The tower was constructued in 1909 by John Bensel, who lived in the nearby house, then known as the Queen Anne Farm. A windmill on the tower drove a pump from a well at the base of the tower to a tank at the top. The height of the tower helped pressure the water through the pipes of the three-story house in a gravity-fed system. This system was replaced by an electric pump in 1929 by the new owners, the Cross family. Today, the tower still stands as an impressive ediface and a reminder of the estate's history.<br /> <br /> Keen observers may note the evidence of absence; namely, the missing walkways and windmill. Supports for the upper walkway are still visible, as well as the support and mechanism for the windmill on the top of the tower. You may also see the former site of the supports for the lower walkway. Both walkways were removed by the Park Service over concerns for safety, and the windmill was lost to adverse weather.",

        "notes": "Fort Nonsense\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/fort-nonsense.htm\n\nFollowing his winter encampment in the area after the battles of Trenton and Princeton, General George Washington wanted to secure Morristown as a supply base. On May 14, 1777 he ordered the construction of a fortification, called a redoubt, on a hill bordering Morristown so <em>“…that it may serve as a retreat in case of necessity.”</em><br /> <br /> Originally referred to as “the Hill” or “Kinney’s Hill,” the fortified redoubt commanded the town. The function of the Fort was as an observation and alarm post, and a place of retreat for guards stationed in the town. The British never made an attack on Morristown, however, and the fortified hilltop was never used. It was common for a small fortification such as Fort Nonsense to be built for the protection of military encampments and strategic military depots.<br /> <br /> Washington’s men leveled surrounding trees, dug trenches, raised breastworks, built a guardhouse for 30 men, and fortified the crown of the hill with an earthwork redoubt. As early as the 1790s the hill was called Fort Nonsense. A legend had grown that Washington had set his men to fortify the hill simply as a way of keeping troops busy. This explanation is very unlikely. In their pension claims after the war, soldiers referred to the work as 'Fort Nonsense.'<br /> <br /> In addition to the earthworks, it is believed that the Morris County Militia was instructed to build a beacon of between 18 and 20 feet high. It was to be constructed of a loose frame of logs with smaller combustibles filling the center. Such beacons were in fact found extending from the Hudson Highlands and all through northern New Jersey. The beacon system was used on June 7, 1780 and again on June 23 when the British crossed into New Jersey. Records tell of area militia responding to the alarms in June and engaging the British at Springfield.<br /> <br /> Fort Nonsense Hill is open to the public and subject to the same hours as other park grounds. In addition, the park is surrounded by private property. For your safety and for the consideration of park neighbors, please be careful as you walk the grounds.",

Given communication methods available at the time of the American Revolution, the Continental Army employed cannon fire, waving flags, and signal fires, or beacons, to convey predetermined messages when faced with emergency.<br /> <br /> This overlook would have been an ideal spot to build a signal beacon during the period of the American Revolution. According to orders, beacons were to be \"made of Logs intermixed with Brush square at Bottom about sixteen feet & to Diminish as they rise like a pyramid & should be about 18 to 20 feet high.\" A huge bonfire lit in case of alarm caught the attention of everyone in the vicinity for miles around - including sentries manning other beacons, who would then light theirs in turn. The sight of a lit beacon traveled much faster than an express rider carrying a message. The beacon's implied message was simple enough: \"We are under attack!\" Local militia units would respond to the beacon, turning out in force to confront British incursions into New Jersey from New York.<br /> <br /> However, though a beacon was <em>ordered</em> to be built at the \"point\" of this hill, there is no conclusive positive evidence of a beacon <em>actually</em> being constructed here on this particular hill, much less lit because of impending danger. How should this impact our interpretation of the hill's importance, whether or not a beacon was actually built? In much the same way as the \"nonsense\" name seems to originate from the lack of battle or necessity for the fort, hindsight offers its own perspective, though we should remember the view of those living through the history we talk of as well. Building a fort and having orders for a beacon were prudent during a time of war, after all.",

He also worked on the Balto statue for New York City's Central Park, among many others. Washington was an excellent horseman, so the statue's composition is a natural mode for the General. Miss Clark requested that Washington's horse be modeled after a strong, sturdy horse drawing a milk wagon in town, and Frederick Roth obliged, taking several films of the subject horse in motion to study before setting to work. The bronze statue was cast in Florence, Italy. Its unveiling occured on October 19th, 1929, on the anniversary of Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown.",

The Guard was reorganized in Morristown during the first Encampment in 1779 and again in 1780. Washington made his headquarters in the Ford House opposite.<br /> Erected in 1932, by Tempe Wicke Society, Children of the American Revolution.\"<br /> <br /> Washington's Life Guard protected the Commander in Chief, his headquarters, and his baggage. Numbering between 100 and 250 men, they were handpicked volunteers from many of the Army's various brigades, and a constant presence at headquarters. Their duties included standing post within and without the Ford Mansion and escorting the Commander and his guests when they traveled. Rather than taking up more room in the already crowded Ford Mansion, they built a series of log huts nearby to shelter in through the coldest winter in living memory. The widow Ford's eldest son, Timothy, volunteered to serve in the Life Guard over the course of the encampment.<br /> <br /> The marker, like the others in its series, was placed here prior to the establishment of the National Historical Park. Nothing of the original huts, built in much the same manner as the ones in Jockey Hollow, remained to mark the site. The winter quarters of the famous Washington was a stone's throw across Morris Avenue, and had been celebrated in memory since the war's end, and especially once the Washington Association opened it to public tours in the late 19th century.<br /> <br /> The Tempe Wick Society of the Children of the American Revolution placed this marker here, not the federal or local governments. Their involvement and successful establishment of the marker shows the power of community in creating and maintaining historic memory. The timing is also of interest. By 1932, the National Park Service had recommended historic sites, specifically Washington's Headquarters and Jockey Hollow, become federally designated historic sites.

In theory, this allowed proper drainage during periods of rain and thawing snow, as well as ample material with which to forage and gather for hut construction. In practice, this led Quartermaster Nathaniel Greene and his Quartermaster's corps to lay out sites for huts in places such as this, a hillside somewhat removed from the core of the camp sites overall. Rather than being a dim-viewed oversight, the site has its advantages, and was carefully selected and inspected by the corps before soldiers arrived starting in November of 1779.<br /> <br /> This site was occupied by Brigadier General John Stark's unit, consisting of four regiments from New England colonies: two Connecticut regiments and one each from Rhode Island and Massachussetts. Many of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/morr/learn/historyculture/brigades-and-regiments.htm\">brigades and regiments</a> at Jockey Hollow were simply named after their place of recruitment, with Stark's brigade being one of the exceptions due to its \"blended\" nature. Together, the men worked to clear the hillside of trees, and use the fallen timber to build row after row of huts according to regulation, in which they would weather the fiercest winter in American history.<br /> <br /> After the war, without soldiers to occupy and repair them, and considering the inherently temporary nature of their construction, the huts mouldered and fell into disrepair, with local farmers scavenging and reclaiming what useful resources remained from them. When it came time to memorialize the Army's presence here at the end of the 19th century, nothing remained but the stones used to build the fireplaces and hearths in the huts, and even they had been displaced from their original sites. Some stones may have been used to build the monument itself near the turn of the 20th century, but it's difficult to say one way or another. In any event, building monuments with archaeologically significant materials is not considered good practice in the field today.<br /> <br /> The site also offers a good view of the valley below, including portions of the Great Swamp and the Watchung Mountains to the south and east of this point.",

        "notes": "Wick Farm House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/wick-farm-house.htm\n\n<p>Henry Wick built this Cape Cod Style house around 1750. His 1,400 acre farm, most of which was covered by forest, made him the largest landowner in Morristown. Henry Wick's trees attracted Washington's army to the area as a winter encampment site because they needed logs to build cabins for shelter and wood to burn for heating and cooking. During the winter of 1779-1780 the army chopped down over 600 acres of his trees on Mr. Wick's property and more on neighbor's property. Additionally, Major General Arthur St. Clair, commander of 2,000 Pennsylvania soldiers, made his quarters in Mr. Wick's home for the winter.</p> <p>Today the house is furnished to portray its use as a general's headquarters.</p>",

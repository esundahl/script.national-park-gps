        "notes": "El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/el-camino-real-de-tierra-adentro-national-historic-trail.htm\n\n<p>During the Spanish colonial era, New Mexico was linked to the outside world by a single thoroughfare that descended the Rio Grande Valley from north of Santa Fe, dropped through the natural gate at El Paso, and wended its way via the provinces of the Viceroyalty of New Spain to Mexico City, some twelve hundred miles to the south.<br /> <br /> This artery of commerce and travel came to be known as El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, which meant ‘royal road’ or ‘king’s highway.’ Blazed atop a network of indigenous footpaths and trade corridors that connected Mexico's ancient cultures with the equally ancient cultures of the American Southwest, this highway was the oldest of the great highways heading north. Extended by segments throughout the 16th century, it was at one time the longest road in North America.<br /> <br /> The settlement expedition of 1598, led by Juan de Oñate, brought settlers, priests, soldiers, indigenous and mestizo guides and servants into today's New Mexico. It also defined the full length of the trail as we know it today. The northern end of that trail, and the primary Spanish settlement, was initially located at Ohkay Owingeh (San Juan Pueblo), but in 1600 it moved to nearby San Gabriel del Yungue. Ten years later, Santa Fe became the capital of the Spanish province of Nuevo México. Once these settlements were established, the trail became a lifeline back to central Mexico.<br /> <br /> El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro served a variety of purposes. Many of its users were involved in the Spanish empire’s prolonged project of converting American Indians to Christianity, yet the road hosted a diverse array of characters; people headed northward included settlers, priests, and newly appointed officials, while those headed south included retiring officials, friars, traders, enslaved Indians, convicts, and prisoners of war. The trail also served as a principal avenue of communication and commerce by which goods and information flowed back and forth. Caravans along the route typically consisted of thirty-two wagons, each of which was hauled by eight mules and carried about 4,000 pounds of freight; most caravans brought other stock as well, such as cattle, sheep, goats, burros, and chickens. Royal decrees, mail, mission supplies, and private merchandise was included among the freight.<br /> <br /> Traffic over the trail came to an abrupt halt in 1680 when an Indian revolt, led by the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo religious leader, Popé, forced all Spanish residents—along with many Indians from Isleta and Socorro—to leave Nuevo México and retreat south to what is now El Paso, Texas and Juárez, Chihuahua. During their stay in that area, they built three missions, Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elizario, all of which still stand. In 1692, however, the Spanish army, under Diego de Vargas, reconquered Nuevo México and recolonized formerly abandoned pueblos and missions.<br /> <br /> Over the next 200 years, the trail continued to witness periods of conflict and peace, as well as representatives of different cultures that brought with them currents of change that would forever alter the face of this land. El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro remained active throughout the Spanish period (until 1821). After that date, traders along the Santa Fe Trail supplied New Mexico with American goods during the relatively brief Mexican period (until 1846), and for the first several decades of American rule. Long distance traffic over the royal road ceased when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad was completed from eastern Kansas to Santa Fe (in February 1880) and on to El Paso (in June 1881).</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/el-camino-real-nht\">Bureau of Land Managment, New Mexico State Office</a></h2>",

The routes built to cross La Bajada between 1598 and 1932 follow precontact pathways across the mesa, indicating its importance to native cultures who utilized natural topography, grade changes and drainage systems to best utilize the mesa top.

Nor was it spared the modern development of the 20th century that further fragmented the area. Yet in the 1990s, when years of trapped moisture and deterioration threatened to destroy Socorro Mission, various powers intervened to ensure its protection.<br /> <br /> The community launched a full-scale church restoration that resulted in the making of 22,000 adobes to stabilize walls, repairs to the bell tower, and conservation of cherished interiors. After seven years of work, St. Michael resumed his place beside the altar, and the doors of Socorro Mission opened to new generations. With every new baptism or graveyard burial at Socorro Mission today, the story of Socorro del Sur and the legacy of El Camino Real carry on.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(328 S.

It is located at the historic crossroads of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro and Tijeras Canyon in Albuquerque, New Mexico. These paths were originally used by Indigenous groups for trade and movement across territories, and eventually evolved into El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, and more recently, Interstate 25. The neighborhood was also at the crossroads of tradition and urban development as the eastern gateway to downtown Albuquerque. When outside forces tried to condemn this historic neighborhood, its citizens would not stand by and allow it to be razed. </p> <p paraeid=\"{393fa277-32df-4dcf-ae6c-4cb92c09ebf4}{252}\" paraid=\"1113516499\">Martineztown is a close-knit neighborhood just east of downtown Albuquerque. It represents a piece of history in the center of urban development that continues to evolve around this historic neighborhood. Martineztown can trace its roots to the early 1800s as a popular summer pastureland. It continued to grow in the 1820s as a stop for traders and travelers along El Camino Real. It blossomed at the crossroads of trade, agriculture, and commerce. The acequia, or community irrigation ditch, was constructed in 1832 to bring water from the Rio Grande to help this growing community. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, many residents were employed in constructing the railroad in Albuquerque. When the Santa Fe Railroad connection was completed in 1880, El Camino became obsolete, and the railroad downsized its work force. This led to an economic decline for the residents of Martineztown.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{10384655-ddc3-456e-ab9b-5dcf38800b03}{45}\" paraid=\"738692707\">In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Pan American Highway and Interstate 25 were built on the periphery of Martineztown, which led to this neighborhood being zoned for commercial use. This allowed the City of Albuquerque to construct a new city hall and convention center but made residential loans and permits inaccessible to residents, permanently changing the status of this historic neighborhood. In 1970, the City’s Urban Renewal condemned Martineztown as a “blighted slum and substandard neighborhood.” But the proud residents of Martineztown would not sit by and allow their home to be destroyed; they organized and protested the Urban Renewal Condemnation. They established the Citizens Information Committee of Martineztown (CICM) and turned the Condemnation into a redevelopment opportunity with help from the Design Planning Assistance Center at the University of New Mexico. With CICM’s commitment and continued community support, Martineztown adapted again and, as a result, remains a gateway to downtown Albuquerque while maintaining its historic residential roots. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (35.086, -106.641) Access Martineztown Park at the corner of Edith Blvd NE and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd, near Downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. <br /> Martineztown Park has historic markers, a playground, and a retracement of El Camino Real.

Maese’s vertical log and adobe plaster jacal was simple and practical, joining other jacales built along the plaza perimeter as a means of community defense. Established on Mexico’s northern frontier in 1848, west of the Rio Grande and El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, Mesilla was an easy target for Apache Indian attacks. Even so, Maese and Mesilla’s other proud pioneering families would rather risk raids than lose their cultural identities as Mexicans after the 1846 Mexican-American War left their former homelands in U.S. hands. <br /> <br /> In addition to El Camino Real, the town’s trade connections were maintained through a variety of stage, freight and mail routes, including the Butterfield Overland Mail, San Antonio Mail and Wells Fargo Express. <br /> <br /> Unlike many Camino Real communities that have withered through time, Mesilla remains a vital voice and vision of the Mesilla Valley’s unique political, cultural, commercial and social past. While most plaza buildings are dedicated to tourist activities, historic preservation regulations ensure that they and other structures in the historic district continue to speak to Mesilla’s distinctive architectural history. Equally important is the town’s ongoing observance of cultural traditions and customs. They flow through daily life on the plaza and in the historic district, from the acequias through the pecan groves, to the barns, businesses and homes where local families, many of them descendants of the original founders, continue to work and live.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Mesilla, New Mexico)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> Today the historic La Mesilla Plaza welcomes trail travelers to enjoy its hospitality and culture.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/new-mexico-mesilla-plaza-and-mesilla-historic-district.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

As a drive or walk through the district reveals, the area’s eclectic collection of homes and small businesses reflect the pioneering spirits of those who set down roots along the southerly path of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, then known as the Chihuahua Trail, after the Mexican-American War. The original town site for modern-day Las Cruces, and a once-bustling section of El Camino Real, the Mesquite Historic District today stretches across Campo, San Pedro, Tornillo and Mesquite streets between Chestnut and Colorado avenues.<br /> <br /> Today, as home to some 713 historic homes and buildings, the district is only half its original size. In the 1960s, the razing of the entire western part of the district to make room for parking lots and non-traditional architecture was the result of a shortsighted urban renewal project. Other community projects have further altered aspects of the district’s original traditional character. Many of the changes contributed to the economic stagnation of the city’s old downtown. But recent efforts to boost awareness of El Camino Real and its history in the old neighborhood are heightening local pride in the trail, fueling architectural preservation initiatives and drawing new residents to the area’s traditional treasures.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p>Location (Mesquite Street, Las Cruces, New Mexico)</p> <p><br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/new-mexico-mesquite-historic-district.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

In 1788, the site was the chosen spot to locate a strategic military stronghold on New Spain’s western frontier. Soldiers from San Elzeario (also San Elceario), a decommissioned Spanish fort in Guajoquilla, Mexico (present-day Chihuahua), occupied the new presidio to defend area residents and El Camino Real caravans from Apaches. Like the fort it replaced, the new presidio was named in honor of San Elzear, the French patron saint of soldiers.<br /> <br /> Today, the presidio chapel continues to anchor San Elizario as an active parish. Four vertical bells and four horizontal buttresses bring an imposing symmetry to the relatively small building, which is set in a frame of low masonry walls and a dramatic sweep of front steps. The stark white building paints a picture of purity and stability in an ever-changing world. Despite centuries of change, El Camino Real, today’s Glorieta Road, still leads residents and visitors to and from the chapel at the old presidio.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (1556 San Elizario Road, San Elizario, New Mexico)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/texas-presidio-chapel-of-san-elizario.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Yet in the 18th and 19th centuries, San Elizario’s adobe embrace held more than the charming air of history it exudes today. Set on a section of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro locally known as the Mission Trail at the point where the trail moves north from Mexico across the Rio Grande and into the United States, San Elizario remains a well-preserved portrait of more than 300 eventful years of frontier life.<br /> <br /> Once a major commercial connector on El Camino Real, San Elizario now connects the contemporary reality of the lower El Paso Valley as an increasingly urban borderland to the community’s history as an agricultural heartland, a military presidio and a transportation corridor for both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. While the town may feel sleepy to some visitors, its adobe architecture provides a stimulating reason for visitors to slow down, explore and experience a unique lesson in the history of the Southwest and the U.S.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (San Elizario, Texas (about 17 miles southeast of El Paso))</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/texas-san-elizario-historic-district.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Gruber had been charged with practicing witchcraft by the Office of the Holy Inquisition, but he faced his final trial attempting to cross the desert. The decomposing remains of Gruber and his horse were reportedly found just beyond the escarpment at the northernmost point of Yost Draw, at a site now known as La Cruz del Alemán (The Cross of the German). The incident reportedly inspired the Jornada del Muerto’s ominous name.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (The Yost Draw trailhead is located on Sierra Country Rd. A013, near Truth or Consequences, NM)</p> <p>Traversing nearly 3.8 miles of the Jornada del Muerto, the Yost Draw section of El Camino Real today is one of the best-preserved portions of the trail. A short climb east on the interpretive trail brings hikers to an overlook from where the trail’s south-north path comes into view.

        "notes": "Ysleta Mission\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/ysleta-mission.htm\n\n<p>Today at the mission, the community’s unique integration of Indian tradition with Christian religion is expressed in a profusion of Native motifs—rain clouds, corn stalks, baskets, blankets and more—that flow through the church’s neoclassical interiors. The display is an unexpected contrast to its Spanish Colonial Revival facade with sparse architectural décor. The cultural, architectural and spiritual juxtapositions reflect the disparate influences that have impacted Ysleta Mission during the more than 300 years since residents first made their way down El Camino Real to face an unknown future in El Paso del Norte (present-day Juárez, Mexico) in New Spain.<br /> <br /> Ysleta del Sur is one of various Indian communities established in the region following the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, when many Tiwa, Piro, Tompiro, Tano and Jemez Indians fled south from New Mexico with embattled Spanish settlers. The Tigua had left Isleta Pueblo, which was founded as a Spanish Franciscan mission after the Spanish colonization of New Mexico in 1598. Many Isletans stayed at the pueblo following the revolt. When Spaniards made a failed attempt to reclaim New Mexico a year after the revolt, additional Isletans joined their retreat back down El Camino Real to join the Tigua settlement on the south banks of the Rio Grande. Some of the Native Americans feared the revolt and chose to follow the Spaniards south, while others where forced to retreat to El Paso del Norte.<br /> <br /> As members of a federally recognized tribe and sovereign nation, the only Indian pueblo in Texas, Ysleta del Sur’s native peoples maintain a strong presence in the lower El Paso Valley. Despite the modern development of many tribal lands, and ongoing legal disputes over land titles, Ysleta Mission remains a spiritual hub of the Tigua. Inside the mission today, statues of St. Anthony and Kateri Tekakwitha, the Catholic Church’s sole American Indian saint, share close quarters. Outside, El Camino Real runs along Socorro Road to the east and parts of Alameda to the west. Ysleta del Sur’s complex cultural landscape endures, distinguishing it as a place where missions and roads may rise and die, but history prevails.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (131 S Zaragoza Rd, El Paso, TX)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> Onsite facilities include the church, an adjacent school, gift shop, and administrative office.<br /> <strong>Exhibits</strong><br /> Several historical markers are located near the front of the church.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/texas-ysleta-mission.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elca/index.htm\">El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The approaches were obstructed by abatis. The strength of the fortification proved effective against the Confederate assualts during the October 1862 battle of Corinth.  ",

Albert Sidney Johnston, the Confederate commander who was killed during the afternoon of the first day.<br /> <br /> At the extreme right, the figure in front represents the Confederate infantryman who has snatched up his flag in defiance of the Northern army. The figure to his rear is the artilleryman, who is calm as he appears to gaze through the smoke of battle.<br /> <br /> To the left, the figure in front represents the cavalryman. His hand is spread, indicating frustration. He is eager to help, but cannot penetrate the heavy undergrowth. The figure back of the cavalryman represents the officers of the Confederate army. He has his head bowed in submission to the order to cease firing when, it seemed, had it not been given the first day, there might have been a Confederate victory.<br /> <br /> The central group represents a \"Defeated Victory.\" The front figure, representing the Confederacy, is surrendering the laurel wreath of victory to Death, on the left, and Night, on the right. Death came to their commander and Night brought reinforcements to the enemy, and the battle was lost.<br /> <br /> The panel of heads on the right represents the spirit of the first day. How hopefully and fearlessly the 11 young Confederates rushed into battle! The panel of heads on the left represents the second day of the battle and the sorrow of the men, now reduced to 10, over the victory so nearly won and so unexpectedly lost.</p>",

It was initially known as Cross City. It is located in the northeast corner of Mississippi near the Tennessee border, 22 miles southwest of Pittsburg Landing, on the Tennessee River, where on April 6-7, 1862, the terrible battle of Shiloh was fought. In the years since the Civil War, Corinth has grown into a small city, but the general landscape has changed little. Several small streams (Cane, Bridge, Phillips, Elam, and Turner creeks) meander through the area. The soft rolling hills, mixed pine and hardwood forests, and open farmland resemble the terrain of southern Tennessee.<br /> <br /> Located near the site of Battery Robinett, the <strong>Corinth Civil War Interpretive Center</strong>, is open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm every day except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day. Center exhibits include interactive displays and multimedia presentations on the Battle of Shiloh and the Siege and Battle of Corinth. The culminating interpretive feature is a commemorative courtyard where stone and flowing water chronicle the birth and growth of the United States, the accompanying rise of sectionalism, key events leading to the Civil War, and a symbolic representation of four years of war.",

On the second day, Buell's forces proceded rather easily over the battlefield until running into the first major Confederate defensive line at this postion on the Hamburg-Purdy Road. Here on April 7, the famed Washington Light Artillery from New Orleans unlimbered and reportedly fired 60 rounds at the approaching enemy. <br /> <br /> The attacking Federals of Hazen's Brigade neared the muzzles of the Washington Artillery taking heavy casaulties, including four color bearers of the 41st Ohio shot down. In fact, Hazen's three regiments suffered more casualties than any of Buell's or Lew Wallace's other reinforcing brigades on this day. <br /> <br /> Hazen's men captured the guns of the Washington Artillery shooting down many cannoneers and horses, but the victory was short lived. A counterattack by the Crescent Regiment and 19th Louisiana Infantry retook the guns from the 41st Ohio pushing them back through the field. <br /> <br /> However, even with the determined Confederate defense in this area, the southerners lacked the power or numbers to push the fresh Federals off the field. Even so, Union general Thomas Crittenden would say that the fighting he witnessed in the Daniel Davis Wheatfield was the fiercest he saw during the entire war. <br /> <br /> The death of one Confederate private here, Samuel B. Todd, of the Crescent Regiment, would personally touch the White House, for Samuel's half-sister was First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln.",

Albert Sidney Johnston, was taken after being found wounded on April 6. That afternoon, Johnston ordered his reserves to go into action and advance on the right flank in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Federal troops and their base of supplies at Pittsburg Landing. He also hoped to make it impossible for reinforcements to come to Grant's assistance from across the river. While personally directing his reserves, he was struck behind the right knee by a Minie ball, which cut the large artery.<br /> <br /> At the time General Johnston was struck, he was sitting on his horse \"Fireeater.\" He was taken to the ravine about 100 yards south of this monument by his staff members. There he died from loss of blood a few minutes later, ironically with an unused tourniquet in his pocket. Johnston was the highest ranking officer killed in combat during the Civil War and remains the highest ranking American military officer ever to be killed in action. After his death, command of the Confederate army passed to General P.G.T. Beauregard.<br /> <br /> This monument is one of five on the Shiloh battlefield that were erected in 1902 by the United States government to pay tribute to and mark the spot where high ranking officers were killed in the Battle of Shiloh. At each corner of the concrete base is a pyramid of 8\" shells and in the center is a 30 pdr.

On the first day, elements of three Union divisions manned the line along a little-used farm road that ran through the Joseph Duncan property. Duncan and his family worked a small cotton field that bordered the road to the south. With its open fields of fire and road cover, there is little wonder that the Duncan plot became one of the most important localities on the battlefield.<br /> <br /> This position, atop a small rise and fronting an almost impenetrable undergrowth, became the target of the numerous Confederate attacks on April 6. Heavy fighting raged in the area of the Hornets' Nest on the first day, with no less than eight distinct Confederate attacks turned back by the determined defenders of the Sunken Road. Attesting to the fury in the area, Confederates so named the location because, they said, the enemy's bullets sounded like swarms of angry hornets.<br /> <br /> Confederate General Daniel Ruggles, after having witnessed the unsuccessful attacks against the position, formed a line of artillery consisting of as many as 53 big guns and concentrated its fire upon the Federal line. With the aid of these cannon, the Confederates were able to form a circle around the Hornets' Nest, surrounding and capturing General Prentiss, with nearly 2,200 troops, late in the day on April 6.</p>",

Almost 110,000 in blue and gray fought one another in the fiercest fighting ever seen by this nation. By the end of the battle 23,476 soldiers were either dead, wounded, or missing. The butcher's bill at Shiloh exceeded the United States' casualty numbers from all previous wars combined. It was a shock to the nation, and a portent of battles to come. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Congress established Shiloh National Military Park to commemorate and honor those who fought and sacrificed at Shiloh. American's set aside and continue to preserve this land so future generations will not forget the terrible carnage that occured in April of 1862. Monumentation, position tablets, and cannon now mark the spots where men battled to the death 160 years ago. <br /> <br /> The 22-stop audio tour will examine some of the more important sites in the Battle of Shiloh. <br /> <br />  ",

In order to bury the dead not only from the April 6-7, 1862, battle of Shiloh but also from all the operations along the Tennessee River, workers began building the \"Pittsburg Landing National Cemetery.\" Changed to \"Shiloh National Cemetery\" in 1889, the cemetery holds 3,584 Civil War dead, 2,359 of them unknown. In the fall of 1866, workers disinterred the dead from 156 locations on the battlefield, and 565 different locations along the Tennessee River. Headboards of wood first marked each grave, but were replaced in 1876 and 1877 by granite stones. Tall stones marked the known dead and square, short stones denoted unknown soldiers.<br /> <br /> Workers built a stone wall around the cemetery in 1867, and fashioned ornamental iron gates at the entrance in 1911. A superintendent cared for the cemetery until it was officially consolidated with Shiloh National Military Park in 1943. The results of so much labor produced what one observer called \"the handsomest cemetery in the South.\"<br /> <br /> Although established as a Civil War burial ground, the Shiloh National Cemetery now holds deceased soldiers from later American wars. Many World War I and II, Korea, and Vietnam burials are in the newest section of the cemetery. There is also one Persian Gulf War memorial. Total interred in the cemetery now stands as 3,892. Although the cemetery was officially closed in 1984, it still averages two or three burials a year, mostly widows of soldiers already interred.</p>",

Visitors frequently came to see them. The 15-inch Rodmans weigh about 49,000 pounds, and required 300 to 400 soldiers to move them up the bluff from river to fort. The balls fired by the smooth-bore Rodmans weigh 500 to 600 pounds and took about fifty pounds of black powder, a type of gunpowder.</p> <p>It was a special occasion each time the big guns were fired. On February 27, 1864, three shots were fired from the 15-inch Rodman. Crowds of visitors beheld the occasion. Again, on April 1, 1864, a large party from Washington came to witness the workings of the big guns. The Rodman was fired at a 25-degree elevation at a range of three miles. Because the guns put off an intense concussive force, it was noted that observers would raise their toes and open their mouths to lessen the effects.<br /> The cannon closest to the river is of particular importance. Engraved on its 15-inch muzzle is 'No. 1' and the initials 'TJR'. The 'No 1' is in reference to the fact that this cannon was the first produced by Cyrus Alger and Company. The initials are of the individual who inspected the gun, in this case Brigadier General Thomas J. Rodman who also designed the weapon. </p>",

        "notes": "Accokeek Creek\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/accokeek-creek.htm\n\n<p>The Accokeek Creek archeological site (18PR8) is located in Southern Maryland along the banks of the Potomac River. This archeological site is among the most significant sites in the nation because of the impact its excavation had on our modern understanding of Native American societies in the Eastern Middle Atlantic.</p> <p>The site is located within the boundaries of Piscataway Park, which is administered by National Capital Parks-East of the National Park Service. Situated approximately 25 miles downriver from Washington D.C., along Piscataway Creek, the Accokeek Creek site was home to the Potomac Valley’s indigenous inhabitants for thousands of years–dating as far back as 6,000 years ago and through the 1500s. Among the occupants were the Piscataway Indians of Southern Maryland whose ancestors still live nearby today.<br /> <br /> The Accokeek Creek site was excavated in the 1930’s by Alice and Henry Ferguson who purchased land for their home in present-day Piscataway Park in the 1920’s. After excavating tens of thousands of artifacts, the Ferguson’s came to believe that they had rediscovered the site of “Moyaone,” the principal town of the Piscataway chiefdom visited by Captain John Smith in 1608. While the accuracy of the Fergusons’ claim is still disputed today, the excavations yielded a large collection of diagnostic artifacts that have helped form archeologist’s understanding of Native American history and culture in the region.<br /> <br /> Based on analysis of stone projectile points found at the site, archeologists have determined that humans have intermittently called Accokeek Creek home for nearly 6,000 years. The site also contains four ossuaries that appear to have been in use between the 1300’s and European contact in the 1600s. The individuals buried in the ossuaries were interred with elaborate grave goods including copper adornments, shell beads, and clay pipes. These finds indicate that the area was occupied by politically complex chiefdoms by the 1500’s and was the home of the Piscataway chiefdom. The Accokeek Creek excavations indicate that potentially dozens of buildings stood at the site. These structures were enclosed by a series of protective palisades at the edge of the town, indicating that Accokeek Creek’s inhabitants were, at times, living in a violent world.<br /> <br /> Archeologists believe that the predecessors of the Piscataway and other related peoples came to the Chesapeake Bay from the Appalachian Mountains sometime in the 1300’s bringing with them their Algonquian language and material culture. Based on ethnohistoric documents some archeologists and historians believe that the Piscataway group migrated instead from the area that became Maryland’s Eastern Shore in the 1300’s. Whatever the case, archeologists agree that the arrival of the Piscataway and other related people resulted in the creation of complex cultural traditions in the Potomac Valley.<br /> <br /> In 1608, Captain John Smith visited Piscataway Creek on his voyage up the Potomac River and its tributaries. Smith’s 1612 map of the Chesapeake includes the town of “Moyaons” placed in the approximate location of Accokeek Creek. Map symbols indicate that the settlement was home to a werowance, a powerful Native American chieftain who controlled other groups within a geographical area. In 1634, a group of English colonists sailed up the Potomac and met with the leaders of the Piscataway nation at Moyaone. Their leader, Wannas, informed the colonists that the lands of Piscataway Creek were theirs and English settlement could not occur in the vicinity. It is unknown if the archeological site of Accokeek Creek represents this 17th century village or an earlier settlement that the Piscataway nation relocated from. What is known however, is that the territory was a fundamentally important landscape for the Piscataway people from the time of European contact to the present day.<br /> <br /> By the 1690’s, Piscataway land in Prince George’s and Charles Counties had been confiscated by the English colonists and occupied by Maryland planters. Eventually, the Piscataway nation decided to move beyond the borders of the Maryland Colony and dispersed north and west. While many Piscataway migrated outside of Maryland, others decided to stay, forming the ancestors of the current Piscataway inhabitants of the state. The diagnostic artifacts and archeological features present at the Accokeek Creek site have been used to develop and refine a cultural-history of the Mid-Atlantic region. Since its rediscovery in the 1930’s, Accokeek Creek has been one of the most important sites in the nation for understanding the Native American societies of the East Coast.<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"> </span></span></span></p> <h3>Sources:</h3> <p><br /> Colonial Encounters<br /> 2014. Accokeek Creek (18PR8), <a href=\"http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/AccokeekCreekSummary.aspx\">http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/AccokeekCreekSummary.aspx</a><br /> <br /> Colonial Encounters<br /> 2014. Susquehannock Fort (18PR8),<br /> <a href=\"http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/SusquehannockFortSummary.aspx\">http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/SusquehannockFortSummary.aspx</a><br /> <br /> Curry, Dennis C.<br /> 1999. Feast of the Dead: Aboriginal Ossuaries in Maryland, Archaeological Society of Maryland and Maryland Historical Trust Press, Crownsville, MD.<br /> <br /> King et al.,<br /> 2019.

        "notes": "Appalachian Forest National Heritage Area\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/appalachian-forest-national-heritage-area.htm\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.appalachianforest.us/\">Appalachian Forest National Heritage Area</a> (<strong>AFNHA</strong>) works to conserve, enhance, interpret, and promote a regional network of forest heritage resources in the central Appalachian Highlands. Designated a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/heritageareas/index.htm\">National Heritage Area</a> in 2019, AFNHA covers sixteen counties in West Virginia (Barbour, Braxton, Grant, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, Morgan, Nicholas, Pendleton, Preston, Pocahontas, Randolph, Tucker, Upshur, Webster) and two counties in western Maryland (Garrett, Allegany). <br /> <br /> Forest heritage is the ongoing story how the forest shapes history and culture, and how both nature and humans shape the forest. The mountains and forests have played a central role in central Appalachian life since the first indigenous inhabitants, and the landscape continues to cultivate local traditions, folkways, language, crafts, dance, music, festivals, and fairs. Logging after the Civil War fueled the industrial revolution and provided an important livelihood for workers, but the demand for timber decimated the forests. Today, scientific forestry and public land holdings have allowed the forests to regrow, providing sustainable forest products while offering an abundance of outdoor recreational opportunities, including hiking, biking, fishing, hunting, camping, climbing, and skiing. The history of the region is represented by its plentiful historical societies, museums, and historic preservation efforts. Forest communities and main streets offer a variety of small town experiences, with arts, shopping, local foods, and a hearty welcome for visitors. <br /> <br /> AFNHA is managed by the grassroots nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.appalachianforest.us/about.htm\">Appalachian Forest Heritage Area, Inc.</a> (<strong>AFHA</strong>). AFHA partners with organizations with shared goals and is developing a management plan to coordinate partnership efforts to conserve the area’s forests and strengthen rural communities through conservation, historic preservation, education, heritage tourism, and sustainable economic development.<br /> <br /> Notable points of interest in the region include:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.appalachianforest.us/DiscoveryCenter/index.htm\">Appalachian Forest Discovery Center</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Canaan_Valley/visit/plan_your_visit.html\">Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/choh/index.htm\">Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park</a> </li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/mnf/\">Monongahela National Forest</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pohe/index.htm\">Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail</a></li> <li><strong>Excursion trains, such as the <a href=\"https://wvstateparks.com/park/cass-scenic-railroad-state-park/\">Cass Scenic Railroad</a></strong></li> <li><strong>Historical societies and small museums</strong></li> <li><strong>State parks and state forests </strong></li> <li><strong>Welcoming rural communities</strong></li> </ul>",

With a combined total casualty figure of over 900 killed or wounded during the engagement, 40 of the Union soldiers who fought and died bravely in defense of the capital. Four civilians related to the cemetery's first caretaker were buried after the Civil War. A veteran of the battle was interred in 1936, closing the cemetery to future burials. </p> <p>Battleground National Cemetery, located one-half mile north of Fort Stevens, is one acre in size, and one of our nation's smallest national cemeteries. The entrance to the Cemetery is flanked by two <span style=\"font-size: 14.6666669845581px;\">Civil War vintage</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> 6-pounder, smoothbore guns. Also near the entrance are monuments commemorating those units which fought at Fort Stevens:</span></p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/000/25th-new-york-volunteer-cavalry-monument.htm\">25th New York Volunteer Cavalry Monument</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/98th-pennsylvania-volunteer-infantry-monument.htm\">98th Pennsylvania Volunteer Monument</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/122nd-new-york-infantry-monument.htm\">122nd New York Volunteer Monument</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/150th-ohio-national-guard-infantry-monument.htm\">150th Ohio National Guard Monument</a></li> </ul> <p>Within the cemetery grounds is a series of cast iron markers containing the words of a poem entitled \"The Bivouac of the Dead,\" written by Theodore O'Hara in memory of those men who perished during the Mexican War. This poem, as well as the words of the Gettysburg Address in bronze found on the side of the caretaker's lodge, are reminiscent of many national cemeteries.</p> <p><span>The center of the cemetery is marked by a central flagpole, surrounded by 41 regulation marble headstones, marking the remains of the honored dead of Fort Stevens. Behind these headstones and to the east, stands a marble rostrum used to conduct yearly Memorial Day services. The four granite pillars are in memory of the four volunteer companies who fought at Fort Stevens.</span></p>",

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. </p>",

Ferry Hill is best known as the home of Henry Kyd Douglas, Confederate Officer and author of his Civil War personal account, \"I Rode With Stonewall.\"<br /> <br /> In the 18th and early 19th century German settlers migrated from Pennsylvania south into Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, where they then farmed the rich soil. These settlers crossed the Potomac using Packhorse Ford and later Blackford's Ferry below Ferry Hill. Come the 1830s the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal crossed this north/south route, tapping the river waters to provide a controlled water transportation route into western Maryland.<br /> <br /> John Blackford who built and resided at Ferry Hill benefited from this crossroads of commerce. Unlike southern plantations, Ferry Hill profited from not just one cash crop, such as tobacco or cotton, but from a variety of crops, including grains, wheat, corn, an orchard, and even lumbering.<br /> <br /> \"I was with the company that set fire to [the bridge], and when . . . I saw the glowing windows in my home on the hill beyond the river . . . I realized that the war had begun.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, 1861<br /> <br /> By 1860, Ferry Hill shifted through marriage into the Douglas family as Reverend Robert Douglas. As the Civil War began in 1861, Reverend Douglas' son Henry Kyd enlisted in the Confederate army where he served under Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson. Both young Douglas and Ferry Hill became fully engaged in the war. Douglas and his unit burned the bridge crossing the Potomac to limit Union forces from entering into Virginia, and Union forces burned the Ferry Hill barn.<br /> <br /> Throughout the war, Boteler's Ford, also known as Packhorse Ford, a mile downstream from Ferry Hill, provided a frequently used crossing for soldiers from both North and South. Due to its strategic location on the border, Ferry Hill was occupied at various times by both armies. During the 1862 Antietam campaign Ferry Hill served as a headquarters, hospital and artillery base for Confederate forces. During the Battle of Antietam residents of Sharpsburg, fled west along the C&O Canal towpath and sought shelter at Killiansburg Cave, waiting for the fighting to pass. One resident noted that the cave \"... was crowded with a variety of people of all classes.\" Following Antietam, the Battle of Shepherdstown played out along the river below the Ferry Hill. As troops moved on to fight elsewhere, Ferry Hill was scarred with it fences burned, livestock gone, and fields trampled.<br /> <br /> \"We encamped near Shepherdstown and I visited my home across the Potomac and saw the desolation of war. My beautiful home was a barren waste and a common, and the blackened walls of the burnt barn stood up against the sky as a monument of useless and barbarous destruction. I felt that it would be hard for me, going into Pennsylvania, to set aside all ideas of retaliation.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, \"I Rode With Stonewall\"<br /> <br /> Then during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, and the Monocacy Campaign in 1864, Boteler's Ford provided a crossing for both Union and Confederate troops. And, Ferry Hill again suffered the impact of the war.<br /> <br /> At the end of the Civil War, Ferry Hill lost its previous grandeur. Henry Kyd Douglas moved to Hagerstown to pursue his career as a lawyer as the site then went into the hands of Henry Kyd's sister, Nancy. In the 20th century, Ferry Hill operated as a pig farm, and by mid-century, as a restaurant. In 1979, the C&O Canal National Historical Park headquarters moved into Ferry Hill and operated here until 2002. For the past ten years, Ferry Hill shifted into a slower period as the house was opened for tours during summer weekends.</p>",

After an accident in 1877 in which three men were killed, the caissons were drained of water before the boats descended. In 1878, 1,918 trips were recorded on the Incline Plane.

Early on the morning of September 11, 2016, the Spong family was moored to the concrete wall theat ran beneath the powerhouse, right at a steam pipe. At usual time, 6 am, the powerhouse blew out the boilers and the steam burst and forced super hot steam into the cabin of the boat where the children were sleeping. Mrs. Spong tried to save them and was severely scalded. Mr. Spong also rushed to save his children.

Built in 1832, the Catoctin Aqueduct is the fourth of eleven such “works of art” on the canal.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Catoctin Creek Aqueduct was known as the \"Crooked Aqueduct\" because canal boats had to make a sharp turn to cross it. From its original creation, the Catoctin Creek Aqueduct's structural integrity was questionable. The elliptical arch in the center was not as structurally sound as the semicircle arches on either side. The aqueduct began sagging in the early 1900s. It leaked and was prone to flooding. In 1973, two years after Congress established the C&O Canal National Historical Park, it collapsed, leaving only a small piece standing.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Park Service gathered up the aqueduct’s stones and buried them with the hopes that someday the aqueduct would be restored. Nearly 35 years later, a restoration project gained enough funding to rebuild. The four hundred and fifty-nine stones where uncovered and the engineering crew began to fit the blocks together like a giant 3-demensional puzzle. Each stone was measured, and the crew used those measurements to create foam stones. Historic photos were then used to identify where individual stones were positioned. Missing stones or those in poor condition were replaced. In a little over a year, construction was complete. Today, new viewing areas and waysides allow visitors to learn about the structure and the efforts to rebuild it.",

The Red Cross continued to use the house as a warehouse for relief supplies, stationery, and Red Cross publications. </p> <p>Inside, the first floor includes a parlor room, dining room, offices, and a kitchen. The second floor was for bedrooms, including Ms. Barton's room at the rear of the house. Look up to the third floor and note the windows with red crosses in them. Some of the interior walls and ceilings are covered with muslin, the same material used in bandages.</p> <p>During her residence here, Barton developed the landscape into a miniature farm that was primarily self-sustaining, including crops, stables, and a chicken coop. This agricultural use of the landscape is no longer evident; development at the Glen Echo amusement park including roller coasters and the modern parking lot built over most of the farming operation. Many of the trees and plants that grow today are not consistent with the historic function of the grounds. However, the Clara Barton House is the most significant building associated with her time at Glen Echo, and it remains intact.</p> <p>In the years following Ms. Barton's death in 1912, her colleague, Dr. Julian Hubbell, replaced the porch with a columned, one-story porch. His twin nieces inherited the house in 1929 and converted the interior to rent-producing apartments, added baths and kitchens, and a garage with screened porches above at the western rear corner. </p> <p>Congress declared the Clara Barton House a National Historic Landmark on January 12, 1965, and in 1974 passed legislation establishing the house and grounds as the Clara Barton National Historic Site. This property was acquired by NPS in April 1975 through a donation from the Friends of Clara Barton. </p>",

Built from 1833 to 1835, the Conococheague Aqueduct is the fifth of eleven such \"works of art\" on the canal. It consists of three equal 60' arch spans extending 196' between abutments.</p> <p>In August 1863, Confederate soldiers damaged the Conococheague Aqueduct in an effort to stop the canal's transportation of coal to Georgetown where it was used by the Union. Repairs took four days and the canal returned to operation. In April 1920, a canal boat broke through the upstream wall of the aqueduct, falling into the creek below. This shut down the canal for over four months. Repaired with a timber wall, this version of the aqueduct functioned until two 1924 floods closed the canal for good.</p> <p>In 2019, the NPS completed restoration of the Conococheague Aqueduct, reopening this exciting feature on the C&O Canal. The restored Conococheague Aqueduct provides a watered section of the canal to allow for canal boat operations and other public uses between Lock 44 and approximately 450 feet upstream of the existing aqueduct (approx. 0.70 miles). The $10.2 million project took two years to complete, and was funded through federal, state, local and private dollars including national park entrance fees and Maryland's Transportation Alternatives and Bikeways programs. </p> <p>Williamsport is now the only place in North America where visitors can view a variety of canal features in one place, including an operational lift lock and refurbished lockhouse, a railroad lift bridge, a canal turning basin and warehouse, and now a watered aqueduct. </p> <h3><br /> Conococheague Aqueduct Restored </h3> <p>The National Park Service would like to acknowledge and thank those involved for their support with this projects.

The project also restores a significant historic resource and provides unique opportunities for visitors. <br /> <br /> <strong>How can I access the towpath at the Williamsport Visitor Center?</strong><br /> Pedestrians and cyclists are able to cross the canal at the historic railroad lift bridge (adjacent to Rt. 11). Parking is still available by the Cushwa Warehouse. <br /> <br /> <strong>What is the railroad lift bridge? </strong><br /> Originally used to allow trains to cross the canal, visitors are now able to cross the bridge on a newly constructed stairway, which includes a low bike rail. (This is a great spot to get a view of the canal and aqueduct!). <br /> <br /> <strong>Where can I find accessible parking near the towpath?</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Parking is also available close to the towpath at Lockhouse 44 parking lot and from the Bollman Bridge at River Bottom Park. These are the best access points for visitors with bike trailers, strollers, or wheelchairs. Dam 5 is the next closest location along the towpath that also has parking. <br /> <br /> <strong>Who can I contact if I have further questions regarding the restoration? </strong><br /> For more information, please contact the C&O Canal Williamsport Visitor Center by calling 301-582-0813.</p> <br />  ",

It was built originally in the shape of a trapezium, armed with 7 guns, and afterwards expanded to mount 11 guns and mortars, including a massive 100-pounder Parrott rifle located at reshaped northeastern angle</p> <p>The fort was heavily engaged during the Battle of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-stevens.htm\">Fort Stevens</a> on July 11-12, 1864. Fort DeRussy's provided battery support to Fort Stevens to the northeast and also engaged rebel infantry north of the Defenses of Washington.. Altogether, Fort DeRussy had 11 guns and mortars which fired a total of 109 rounds to aid in the defense of Fort Stevens. Its 100-pounder Parrott rifle was the largest piece of artillery in the engagement, and was very effective in checking the Confederates' advance. It had a range that reached nearly all the way to Silver Spring, Maryland, and could destroy large bodies of troops.</p> <p>Fort DeRussy is in a good state of preservation. The parapet which consists of high earth mounds with openings where guns were mounted, and the deep ditch (dry moat) around the parapet, remain in clear and distinct outline. Also, there is visible evidence of where the powder magazines were located inside the fort. Near the fort, on the outside, well-defined rifle trenches extend in each direction.<br />  </p>",

Constructiobn commenced between Ocotober and December of 1861, and \"completed\" in the spring of 1862. The fort was built to protect a critical Ridge<br /> Road (Alabama Avenue) intersection and was supported by Forts Meigs and Chaplin to the north and Fort Davis to the south.<br /> <br /> Fort DuPont was a regular hexagonal redoubt, designed for 14 guns, 12<br /> firing through embrasures. Fort Dupont had six sides, each 100 feet long, protected by a deep moat and trees felled side-by-side with branches pointing outward. It was named for Flag Officer Samuel F. Dupont, who commanded the naval victory at Port Royal, South Carolina, in November 1861.<br /> <br /> It was never a strong work and in 1862, a commission studying the Defenses of Washington noted that a deep ravine to the west of the fort should be covered by a blockhouse. At other times, traverses to cover the sally port, magazine and rifle pits to the cover approaches were recommended.</p> <p>In April 1864, Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer, advised the abandonment of Fort Dupont. The army officially abandoned the fort in 1865. The grounds reverted to its original landowner, Michael Caton. </p> <p>Although its garrison and guns never saw battle, Fort Dupont served as a lifeline of freedom. Runaway slaves found safety here before moving on to join the growing community of \"contrabands\" in Washington. The barracks and guns are gone, but the fort's earthworks can still be traced near the picnic area on Alabama Avenue.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the National Capital Planning Commission acquired the old fort and surrounding land for recreation. A golf course was constructed and as the city grew, golf gave way in 1970 to the sports complex along Ely Place that now includes tennis and basketball courts, athletic fields, a softball diamond, and an indoor ice rink.  Once where soldiers viewed farmlands, park visitors now grow fruits and vegetables in the community garden.</p>",

Stanton appointed a commission to examine the efficiency of the Defenses of Washington. The commision evaluated each of the forts, and made recommendations for improvement. Toward the end of the account, one gap was noted in the defensive arrangement:</span></p> <p>\"The commission furthers their opinion that the Defense of Washington cannot be considered complete without the defense of the river against an enemy's armed vessels. Foreign intervention would bring against us always in superior naval force on the Potomac, and we are, even now, threatened with Confederate iron-clads fitted in English Ports. The Commission believe on Jones' Point near Alexandria, a battery of six guns of the heaviest caliber, say four 200-pounders and two 15-inch guns in casements, and by constructing a battery of ten guns and a covering work on the opposite shore of the Potomac, at the near Roziers Bluff. An examination had been made, revealing a most favorable and strong position on that side, easily communicated with by water. Surveys are in progress.\"</p> <p>The suggestion of the committee was accepted, and the work on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fofo/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Fort Foote</a> began at Rozier's Bluff in 1863. </p> <p>The grand earthwork was first constructed in 1863 by the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, commanded by Colonel William Seward, Jr. The site, together with Battery Rodgers in Alexandria, Virginia, was designed for river defense. Their massive 15-inch Rodman guns (Columbiads) and 200-pounder Parrott rifles possessed the firepower to penetrate enemy ironclad ships. The Federal engineers had perfected earthwork construction around Washington D.C. by this point in the war. Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer Defenses of Washington, described the two sites as \"model works.\"Fort Foote was named in honor of Rear Admiral Andrew H. Foote, who distinguished himself in the actions against the confederate forts on the Mississippi Rivers and died of wounds on June 26,1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote's guns became a tourist attraction for government officials, military officers, and well-connect civilians, who traveled on river transports from the city to the Maryland shoreline to see the 49,000 lbs Rodmans test fired. General Barnard invited President Abraham Lincoln to visit the fort in late 1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote remained an active military installation until 1874. The U.S. Army performed a number of tests and experiments with cannons, carriages, and stone magazines at the site. <br /> <br />  </p> <p><span> </span></p>",

The earthwork was built to guard the approaches to Benning's Bridge, which crosses the Anacostia River.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was irregularly shaped with nine sides, and a perimeter of 354 yards. This fort was located less than mile east of Benning's Bridge and commanded the approaches to the bridge from Bladensburg via the Eastern Branch Road, and from Upper Marlboro by way of Benning Road.</p> <p>Over the next four years it underwent extensive repair and modification. The major problem with the fort was that it sat atop a rounded hill, and approaches to it were not visible from the parapet. To fix this problem 400 yards of rifle pits were constructed to cover its approaches. Structures were built that would provide a full range on which to attack oncoming troops (bastionets). These structures were projected from three angles of the exterior slope of the ditch (counterscarp) to provide reverse and covering fire for the exterior slopes. After Early's raid in 1864, the engineers laid abatis and constructed rifle trenches toward Anacostia River in order to prevent a flanking movement from that side.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was one of the later forts to be abandoned. At the end of the Civil War, Fort Mahan was named among the 11 works that occupied commanding positions and should be retained for a skeleton defense of the city. However, it was abandoned and reverted back to the Manning family. Mary Manning claimed damages in 1864, and in 1865 bought the abatis around the fort for $31 at public auction.</p> <p>Structures that were built at Fort Mahan included a guard house, at least two barracks, officers' quarters, a mess house, stables and some sheds.</p> <p><span>Fort Mahan was named after Dennis Hart Mahan. who was an American soldier and educator.

Construction began in 1861. When Fort Marcy was completed, it had a perimeter of 338 feet and mounted 18 guns, a 10-inch mortar and two 24-pounder Coehorn mortars.</p> <p>The hill on which the fort is located was known as Prospect Hill. Originally the fort was called Fort W.F. Smith after Major General William F. Smith, the troops of whose division began construction of the work. His division crossed Chain Bridge on the night of September 24, 1861, and immediately commenced construction of Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen. The 79th New York Highlanders, the 141st Pennsylvania and the Iron Brigade also helped complete the work in the fall of 1862. A force of about 500 contrabands were employed. The 152nd New York worked on the entrenchments, which are still in a very good state of preservation. The site of Fort Marcy is near the location where the famous, but bloodless duel between Henry Clay and John Randolph was fought in 1826.</p> <p>The fort was not entirely completed until the fall of 1862. It is a relatively undisturbed fort and was named in honor of a native of Massachusetts, the Honorable Randolph B. Marcy, a distinguished soldier, father-in-law, and Chief of Staff to Gen. George B. McClellan. Detachments of the 4th New York Heavy Artillery, 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and the 130th Pennsylvania infantry were among the troops that performed garrison duty here during the war. An interesting incident of history is that the body of troops, which afterwards became famous, and the \"Iron Brigade\" was originated at this fort in the summer of 1861. It was composed of the 19th Indiana, the 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin Regiments. The 24th Michigan was added to the brigade soon after the battle of South Mountain. These regulars remained together until the close of the war.</p> <p>After the Civil War ended Fort Marcy was returned to its original owners, the Vanderwerken family.

This advanced battery had eight 12-pounder guns and a magazine, a covered walkway connected it to the main fort to the south. A double line of rifle trenches was added to strengthen the position.</span></p> <p>Eventually, the fort was the largest and strongest of those defending the capital with a dozen heavy guns, three Parrott siege guns and nine 27-pounder barbette guns. A strength of three thousand men of the First Brigade made Fort Reno the stronghold of the northern defenses of the capital.</p> <p>In July 1864, due to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's insistence that troops be moved from the defenses to reinforce his army at Petersburg, Fort Reno was under-manned, as were all of the defenses around the city. Hearing from spies that the capital was poorly defended, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Gen. Jubal A. Early to attack from the north. Around noon Monday, July 11, 1864 (before the Battle of Fort Stevens), Fort Reno was the first of the defenses to view Early's advance near Rockville, Maryland. The lookouts from the signal tower at Fort Reno saw clouds of dust, and then Confederate army wagons moving toward the city.</p> <p>During Early's assault of Fort Stevens on July 11th and 12th, 1864, the heavy guns of Fort Reno lent little support value, as there was a fear the long range guns would hit the Union Army's advanced pickets. One of the shells that was fired from Fort Reno by a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle traveled 3.5 miles north of the fort, killing four Confederates where the present day Bethesda Naval Hospital is located in Bethesda, Maryland. Due to Fort Stevens being reinforced on July 12, 1864, it was never taken by the Confederate army, nor was the capital city ever reached.</p> <p>During the fighting of July 10-12, 1864, small squadrons of soldiers from Forts Reno and Stevens had advanced into the countryside north of the city to fend off the invaders. A few Confederates were taken prisoner and brought back to camps where they were held until transfer to a central prison. Early's army retreated back across the Potomac River near Leesburg, Virginia, and Washington breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>After the close of the war, the forts (Reno included) were slowly dismantled and abandoned. Most of Fort Reno could be seen as late as 1892, but the fort and battery at the north end were eventually graded down for the construction of a water reservoir. Today the site is bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Fessenden Street, Belt Road, and Chesapeake Street, NW.</p>",

The earthen citadels that encircled the capital had long been abandoned by Federal soldiers. Peace, posterity, and the ploughshare returned much of the landscape to its pre-war condition, including Fort Stevens, site of the famed battle in July 1864. Early preservation efforts included the installation of a sign marking the spot where President Abraham Lincoln was under fire on July 12, 1864.<br /> <br /> Fort Stevens' eroding earthworks were a lasting testament to the Defenses of Washington as the Brightwood neighborhood developed around it. <br /> <br /> As part of the McMillan Plan, a comprehensive planning document for the development of the monumental core and the park system of Washington, D.C (first written in 1902 by the Senate Park Commission), the proposed Fort Drive Parkway consisted of \"a new drive-way through the suburbs of Washington to be called 'Fort Drive,' and include in its winding ways some of the most important of the fortifications which served as the Defenses of Washington during the rebellion . . .\"<br /> <br /> Rapid urban expansion and budget restraints, including the First World War and Great Depression, affected the full development of the parkway; however the Federal government was able to acquire most of the Fort Drive right-of-way between 1929 and 1932, and the forts/batteries managed by the National Park Service today.<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) accomplished a great deal of work on the fort parks. The CCC established nine camps in the Washington D.C. area, including one, established on October 23, 1933, at Fort Dupont Park. The CCC activities at Fort Dupont included erecting buildings for workers to live and eat in, cleaning up foot and horse trails, performing minor road construction, putting in a sewer, and constructing a two-car garage, carpenter shop, and toilet room. The CCC also performed \"forest protection,\" including cleaning up dead and fallen lumber, burning brush, grubbing stumps, cleaning up the dump, and disposing of trash at forts Stanton, Bunker Hill and Mahan, and doing general cleanup at forts Totten and Foote. At Fort Stevens, the CCC undertook a restoration, reconstruction, and landscape project; costing $25,000. The workers rebuilt the western portion of the fort parapet, using cement \"falsies,\" as one author called them, \"instead of logs and planks,\" because they would last longer.<br /> <br /> The work at Fort Stevens was completed in 1938. It was the only fortification restoration project. Today, Fort Stevens Park is managed by the National Park Service (Rock Creek Park).</p>",

Since this area belonged to the War, Jefferson Davis. Davis agreed to allow a light to be placed with conditions that \" the light shall be placed upon the wharf and not within any of the fortifications; and the light keeper shall be subordinate to the military command of the post and public ground in all that relate to police and discipline. If the care of the light can be placed with the Ordnance Sergeant, it will prevent interference with his present charge of other public property.\" With this permission the Lighthouse Board appropriated $500 for a light. This first light was an 18.5-foot iron post, which was placed November 7,1857. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{215}\" paraid=\"1587903521\">The 1857 light pole remained until the 1870's when growth of the wharf caused obstruction to the light pole.

This was considered the first \"real\" lighthouse and a sixth order illuminant lens was placed in the tower. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{221}\" paraid=\"1996703945\">The current tower was built in 1889 as the Fog Bell Tower.  In 1901 the light was moved to the tower, due to the surrounding area overshadowing the “real” lighthouse.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{229}\" paraid=\"1672031331\">In 1954, the light was changed to unmanned automatic flashing red light. During the years that followed the wharf and all buildings associated with the lighthouse were removed. The light/fog bell tower is all that remains of a once active light station. Sometime during the late 1970's the fog bell mechanism broke, ending the bell ringing at Fort Washington. In 2020, the United States Coast Guard, removed the triangle red marker and light to the river, ending a more than a century of active duty. The tower remains standing in its original place.  </p>",

Five black students were arrested, and the legality of their arrests was debated in U.S. Supreme Court (Griffin v. Maryland). In June 1964, their arrests were overturned with four other similar cases immediately before the passage of the Civil Rights Act which outlawed public segregation.<br /> <br /> Since 1971, the National Park Service has owned and operated the site and today, with the help of the Glen Echo Park Partnership for Arts and Culture, offers year-round cultural and recreational activities.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service funded a 2019 project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/civilrightsgrant\">African American Civil Rights Grant Program</a>, which works to document, interpret, and preserve the sites and stories related to the African American struggle to gain equal rights as citizens, to delevop a documentary film discussing the significance of this property related to the Civil Rights Movement.</p>",

Located on the Potomac River, it was a logical choice for the canal's terminus. Canal activity further spurred Georgetown's economic growth. By the late 1800s, it was a bustling industrial port, with loads of cargo transferring between ocean-going ships, smaller boats, and wagons. On the canal, mule-drawn coal boats sidled up alongside Georgetown's warehouses to unload their freight. After their week-long journey down the 184.5 mile canal, canal families looked forward to the sights and sounds of Georgetown.<br /> <br /> Construction of the canal began in 1828. Thousands of men, primarily immigrants, performed the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging and blasting through soil and rock. The skilled laborers, including stonemasons, carpenters, and blacksmiths created the dams, locks, culverts, aqueducts, and the Paw Paw Tunnel. Though each section of the canal started operating as it was completed, the entire route between Cumberland and Georgetown officially opened on October 10, 1850. After years of decreasing profits and devastating floods, operation of the canal ceased in 1924.</p> <br />  ",

Four platforms for 15-inch Rodman guns and three magazines were completed before the government interest and funding waned.<br /> <br /> The Edicott System in the 1890s brought the construction of Battery White, the concrete structure that is visible now.<br /> <br /> Ricochet Firing<br /> Guns in the Water Battery could ricochet or bounce, shot across the river surface and hit a ship near the waterline causing sever hull damage.<br /> <br /> The Water Battery held many structures to support the Fort's operation:<br /> <br /> (1) Magazine- stored ammunition<br /> (2) Storehouse- housed gun carriages in peacetimer<br /> (3) Stables- housed workhorses<br /> (4) Saddlers shop- where leather equipment was repaired<br /> (5) Shot furnace- a furnace for heating solid cannon-balls. A red hot shot lodged in a ship's timbers could start a disasterous fire.<br /> (6) Blacksmith shop- where metal items were repaired and manufactured<br /> (7) Gatehouse- included two guardrooms and a bridge over the ditch",

A British squadron slowly making its way up the Potomac expected resistance from the well-positioned fort. Alexandrians, fearing they were next after Washington's fall three days before, expected protection from the fort.<br /> <br /> Samuel Dyson, U.S. Army captain in command decided his 45-man garrison would be no match for the British. He ordered the fort destroyed and was later court martialed for his decision.<br /> <br /> Defenseless Alexandria negotiated surrender, and the British confiscated tobacco and other property. As the enemy withdrew down the Potomac with their prizes, angry Americans shot from shore and dispatched fire-ships with little effect.<br /> <br /> Welcome to Fort Washington's Waterside Trail<br /> <br /> Living where the land meets the water gives us everything we need: shelter in the woods, food to eat, and clean water to drink. Our climate promises a good life for the 15 million people and the more than 3,000 types of plants and animals that live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Certain soils and plant roots soak up much of the 30-40 inches of rain we receive each year. Leaves also absorb water, and forests slow a hard rain’s fall to earth. Woodlands shade the streams, and their roots hold stream banks in place. Pine trees and hardwoods layered over flowering shrubs, berry bushes, and wildflowers provide food and shelter for birds, mammals, insects, and turtles- just to name a few. In the clean, cool water nearby, fishes and shellfish feast on aquatic plants, and become food for larger fish, birds- like the Bald Eagle -and people.<br /> <br /> When rivers flood, or when rain hits land without woodlands, fast running water takes everything in its path to the bay. Pollutants from our homes, yards, cars, and work also flow into the bay. To protect the water, plants, and animals that live here, ribbons of waterside (or riparian) buffers of forests line the rivers and streams. These waterside woodlands slow the erosion of soil and absorb extra nutrients, while also providing shelter and food for wildlife. Preserving even small sections of riparian habitat helps protect our largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay. <br /> <br /> As a river meets the ocean, a dynamic world of daily and seasonal changes in saltiness and temperature becomes the home to unique plants and animals. The rhythmic tidal changes work like an engine producing food, and decomposing matter. Winter storms tear wetland plants into food for fishes and all microscopic life. These tiny aquatic plants and single-cell animals grow in abundance when nutrients churn up from the bay floor and flow off the land. In the spring, many different types of ocean fishes swim up rivers to eat and lay eggs, and then return again to the salty ocean. In the warm waters of summer, crayfish and shellfish find food, and become food. Throughout the fall, millions of migratory birds come to the Atlantic Flyway to feed on the plants, nutrients, fishes, and shellfish. Throughout the year, each part of the ecosystem depends on another in a powerful dance of life. Walking on this trail, you will see some of the plants and Animals that make their home in waterside woodlands.",

The glistening white and pink quartz sandstone structure is the longest aqueduct along the C&O Canal measuring in at 516 feet. At the time of the Civil War, during the Maryland Campaign of 1862, the Monocacy Aqueduct was nearly destroyed by Confederate General D.H. Hill. However, concerned Lockkeeper Thomas Walter persuaded the Confederate troops that destroying Lock 27 would be far more impactful in their pursuit. Today, the Monocacy Aqueduct still stands thanks to restoration work that was completed in 2004 and continual preservation of this structural gem.  ",

Deeper than wide, room behind room, and exterior chimneys at one end the house was typical of an architectural style popular in lower Southern Maryland from the second half of the 18th century well into the first half of the 19th century. Homes of this style and construction were often owned by tradespeople or small landowners of modest means. As typical as this house is it is also in many ways atypical.</p> <p><br /> What makes this home more interesting is the way it was constructed. Much of it is far less “sophisticated” than one might think. Its sills and joists were laid without any support and riven clapboard of less than ideal dimensions were used in the construction of the roof and attic partitions. There is evidence that the ceiling rafters and joists were made from improperly dried wood and warped shortly after construction. No doubt other homes were built using these shortcuts, and no wonder only one, Laurel Branch, survived.<br /> If there is one aspect of the house that is the most interesting and helps us date it more precisely it is the two small, cater-cornered fireplaces. Laurel Branch is the only example of this room behind room plan with such fireplaces recorded in Charles County or as far as is known, in all of Southern Maryland. This design of corner fireplaces was common in the area between 1740 and 1770 and given all the other data the house is generally agreed to have been built circa 1770.</p>",

This tobacco barn was originally the property of William Hall of southern Anne Arundel County. He had two such barns, and they were the largest and most important structures on his property. Built well, these barns survived all manner of weather, but one of the barns, at last, was endangered by development plans. Efforts by the National Park Service and the Accokeek Foundation secured the relocation of this tobacco barn to the National Colonial Farm. The barn features fascinating construction techniques and was carefully reconstructed to preserve early agricultural messages. The original designers had made use of pieces from earlier barns. The basic construction technique is known as “Tidewater framing” and consists of plates, rafters and corner braces connected by pinned mortise and tenon joints. Hand adzed oak, walnut and chestnut timbers predominate. The roof is steeply pitched at about 54 degrees, and the eves rest on a false plate (where the soffit would normally fit) allowing for increased ventilation.</p> <p> </p> <p>The frame was covered with clapboard siding in approximately 4-foot lengths. The open spaces, where clapboards have been left off, serve to increase ventilation as well.  All siding and roofing were secured with completely hand-forged nails made in the 18th century. The tobacco barn is capable of housing 12,000-18,000 lbs of tobacco. At a time when most people have lost connection to land and agricultural roots, visitors are invited to enter the tobacco house, stand under the curing leaf and weathered beams and experience the rhythms of our agricultural past that continue to inform the present day.  </p>",

To save building six miles of canal along the river, the C&O Canal Company decided to construct a tunnel through a steep topographic ridge now called Tunnel Hill. When work began on the tunnel in 1836, the builders estimated the project would be completed within two years. The tunnel ultimately required 14 years to complete due to labor issues and violence, funding shortfalls, work stoppages, and the challenges of digging a 3,118-foot tunnel through the hard, loose shale. The tunnel opened in October 1850 with rockslides continuing to be a challenge throughout the tunnel’s history. <br /> <br /> Today, when you plan your visit to the Paw Paw Tunnel, bring a flashlight and discover the weep holes, rope burns, rub rails, as well as brass plates marking every 100-feet that bring the tunnel’s history to life. Following your travels through the tunnel, enjoy the two-mile long Tunnel Hill Trail where you can discover breathtaking views of the Paw Paw Bends.  <br /> <br />  ",

Milling the pyrite ore and sorting it by quality and size was an essential part of the mining operation. After sorting by size, the ore would be spread out and hammered until it could pass through a 2 1/2 inch ring. Smaller pieces were ground between wheels and screens until fine. It was then sent down the hill via the vertical structures show on the sign image and put into railway cars.<br /> <br /> When the mine closed down in 1920, the buildings were abandoned and many of the mine tailings were left exposed. Sulfur from the pyrite started to leach into the creek and raised the acidity of the water. While reclamation of the mine land was ongoing since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1970, the largest reclamation project took place in 1995, capping mineshafts, burying mine tailings with lime, building storm-water channels to divert run-off, and planting trees and shrubs.",

To protect the monument, it was surrounded by an iron ornamental fence and a gate.<br /> <br /> The monument became a destination visit for many travelers. Thousands of visitors, from America, Europe, and Asia paid their respects to George Washington by visiting the monument. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt came down from Washington, D.C. on a day visit. Roosevelt noted:<br />   \"...I spent about four hours ashore, taking [my] lunch and walking up to the monument which marks where the house stood in which Washington was born. It was a simple shaft.\"<br /> <br /> In the late-1920s, the Wakefield National Memorial Association formed to commemorate the landscape at George Washington's birthplace. The group decided to build a house as a memorial to Washington on the same spot where the monument stood. Many complained that moving the monument would be too costly, since the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, and that moving the monument from the original birthhouse location would lessen its importance.<br /> <br /> Despite the objections, in 1931, the monument was removed from its original base. It was transported in pieces by carts and reinstalled at the park entrance on a new base which added five feet to the overall height of the monument. The original design was also changed with the words \"Washington's Birthplace\" and the years of its installation removed from the monument.<br /> <br /> The monument is now the first landmark that visitors to the park see. ",

        "notes": "The Memorial House Museum\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-memorial-house-museum.htm\n\nIn June of 1923, a group of public-spirited women met in the home of wealthy socialite Josephine Wheelwright Rust, a descendant of the Washington Family, to discuss plans to develop George Washington's birthplace for the anniversary of his 200th birthday in 1932. During this meeting, the Wakefield National Memorial Association (WNMA) was born and Rust became the group's president. As president, Rust's vision was to build from scratch a \"Memorial House\" at the place of Washington's birth and surround it with the appearances of an 18th century plantation environment. This romantic, but unrealistic vision would create a series of challenges to the entire development of the Memorial Area and the Memorial House Museum.<br /> <br /> Rust initiated her plan by approaching Congress for funding to build the house. Congress agreed to the request and sent instructions to build a house as close as possible to the originial design. With no surviving images of Washington's birthhouse to use as inspiration, it is rumored that Rust decided to base the house on the architecture of local colonial structures that she had known growing up, including her childhood home, Twiford, still located in Westmoreland County today. Rust's \"Memorial House\" would not resemble the birthhouse of George Washington as it would be much larger and grander than the 1732 home. <br /> <br /> Rust was determined to place the Memorial House at the same location of the monument the War Department had placed in 1896. Although the monument stood on grounds that were reputedly the location of the birthhouse, there were many who doubted that it was the actual location. Moving the monument was also costly, and seemed to some to be a frivolous expense, considering the nation was in the midst of the Great Depression. Nonetheless, Rust perservered. The funds to move the monument arrived, and it was removed from its existing base, loaded on carts in pieces, and installed on a new base at the entrance to the park. <br /> <br /> With the arrival of the National Park Service (NPS), who arrived after the creation of George Washington Birthplace National Monument in January 1930, Rust found challenges with her ideas for not only the Memorial House, but the Colonial Revival Garden, and the buildings and layout of the Memorial Area. <br /> <br /> Rust's plans for the Memorial House Museum went forward, and the house was completed in the summer of 1931, in time for the Bicentennial of Washington's birth. On June 26, 1931, Rust died, only four days after turning over the deed for the property to the National Park Service. A tribute service was held for her on February 11, 1932, in the Memorial House Museum with many WNMA members in attendance. On May 14, 1932, the Memorial House Museum was officially opened by the National Park Service. ",

        "name": "The Thomas Stone House",
        "notes": "The Thomas Stone House\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-mansion-at-haberdeventure.htm\n\n<p>One of the more unique features at Thomas Stone’s plantation of Haberdeventure is the curved five-part house. While parts of the house are original to Thomas Stone’s lifetime, fire damage, renovation, and modernization have changed the structure.</p> <p>Thomas Stone purchased the 442-acre property from his uncle, Daniel Jenifer, on December 13, 1770. Construction of the house's brick Central Block began in the spring of 1771. The following year, Thomas and his family likely took up residence even though the work was incomplete.</p> <p>The Central Block’s first floor comprises the Center Passage along with the East and West Rooms. The second floor had two large rooms that would have served as bed chambers.</p> <h4>Center Passage</h4> <p>Upon entering the Center Passage, guests could see a large and attractive stairway, expensive portraits, and decorative rooms to the left and right, which provided clues to the wealth and status of the Stones. With doors at each end, this breezeway may have been one of the house's most comfortable rooms during the spring, summer, and fall.</p> <h4>West Room</h4> <p>The West Room is believed to be the Master Bedchamber. Ornate first floor bedchambers in colonial era homes often served the dual purposes of being daytime or informal parlors. In the case of Margaret Stone, who developed a debilitating case of arthritis that often turned her into an invalid, she likely did not receive many guests but could converse with her family on her better days.</p> <p>While there is no supporting evidence, the lifestyles of slave owning gentry of the time suggests that an enslaved African American may have slept either on the floor of the West Room or in the adjacent Center Passage, to be readily available to care for the family's needs both night and day.</p> <h4>East Room</h4> <p>It is evident this room was used for entertaining. Contrary to modern and romanticized visions of colonial era homes, most were not elegant and pristine. Few colonial homes had rooms as beautiful as Thomas Stone's East Room. The expensive furnishing and window coverings and the well crafted woodwork were designed to impress guests, and even though this woodwork is a reconstruction of the original it still shows the detail that was put into the work.</p> <p>Aside from its beauty, the East Room may have served a more important function. With only one doorway, the room could provide privacy for Thomas Stone as he performed his legal and political duties along with directing county defense activities during the American Revolution. In Maryland’s heavily class-based society, the elegance of the East Room emphasized the importance, power, and success of Thomas Stone and justified his role as a leading figure in the community.</p> <h4>Second Floor</h4> <p>The purpose of the second floor was to serve as bed chambers, not just for Thomas and Margaret Stone’s three children. Upon Thomas's father's and eldest brother's deaths in 1773, Thomas permitted some of his younger brothers and sisters to live in the home. Also, as a host to law clients, political allies, several siblings and their families, distant relations, and countless friends, Stone was expected to provide places for everyone to sleep. </p> <p>Crowded homes were quite common in the colonial era. Rooms were hot and stuffy in the summer and drafty and cold in the winter. Privacy by modern standards barely existed. Even George Washington referred to his mansion of Mount Vernon as a “well-restored tavern.”</p> <h4>West Hyphen</h4> <p>The adjoining West Hyphen was built during Thomas Stone’s ownership to connect to the West Wing, which served as a kitchen for the Stones. This Hyphen may have served as a multi-use space with easily moved furnishings to allow dining, indoor chores and crafts, entertaining, and possibly to serve as a guest chamber.</p> <h4>West Wing</h4> <p>The original West Wing kitchen space is believed to have been a small and relatively unadorned structure designed for the function of cooking, cleaning, and other household chores by enslaved workers. The current West Wing, which partially rests upon the original foundations, dates from the mid-1840s. There are two rooms on the first floor and a steep stairway that leads to two more rooms above. In 1846, William Briscoe Stone remarked in a letter to his daughter Mary that the West Wing was, “…much enlarged improved & amended. I am certain you will be surprised and pleased with the change.\"<br /> <br /> During the 20th-century, the residents redesigned the West Hyphen to create a connective hallway between the second floor of the Central Block and the West Wing. This modernization was removed by the National Park Service to help return the mansion to a more historical design.</p> <h4>East Hyphen</h4> <p>The East Hyphen was a unique space. Its primary function was to serve as a protective cover for the full cellar that existed beneath the Central Block. It is not connected in the same way as the West Hyphen is connected. In order to gain access to the space, one would have to go outside the house and enter from the outside. </p> <h4>East Wing</h4> <p>Architectural historians believe that the East Wing is the oldest part of the house. It was likely a wholly separate and independent structure moved from some other location on the plantation to serve as the East Wing. Like the East Hyphen, there was no internal connection from the Central Block to the East Wing. One had to exit the mansion, walk across the lawn, and then enter the East Wing. </p>",

        "notes": "The Washington Family Burial Ground\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/the-washington-family-burial-ground.htm\n\nBeginning in the late 17th century, the Washington Family Burial Ground, near John and Anne Washington's Bridges Creek home, was the final resting place for generations of Washington family members. But by the late 19th century, the old \"family vault\" had become a decayed ruin, with the burial vault sunken into the ground, and worn and broken gravestones surrounding it.<br /> <br /> Restoration and preservation efforts at the burial ground began in 1906, ten years after the obelisk was placed to honor the birth site of George Washington. Funded by the Virginia chapter of the Society of Colonial Dames of America, Washington descendants cleaned up the gravestones and enclosed them with a block wall and an ornate iron gate. <br /> <br /> By the time the Wakefield National Memorial Association formed in 1923, the burial ground was again in disrepair. One of the group's primary goals was to \"...rescue from decay and preserve the old family vault and burial ground which is in a most neglected condition.\"<br /> <br /> The burial ground restoration effort became another place of contention between the Association, their architect, and the National Park Service. Concerned that the Association's plan for the burial ground was contemporary and expensive, the NPS wanted to pay homage to the ancestors in a \"...simple, typical Colonial graveyard.\" In the end, the design chosen came down to cost, with the National Park Service's cheaper option being selected. Restoration appears to have been completed in 1931, just before the official opening of the park. <br /> <br /> Today, the burial ground stands silent; as a reminder of the efforts to remember the lineage of George Washington at the place of his birth. ",

        "notes": "Washington Aqueduct\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/washington-aqueduct.htm\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">The Washington Aqueduct was the District of Columbia's first public water system. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers from 1853 to 1863, it was a monumental engineering achievement. Its designer, Army Engineer Montgomery C. Meigs, supervised the project until 1861, when he was appointed Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army. The construction and successful operation of the Washington Aqueduct symbolizes the Army Corps of Engineers importance in the field of public works and reflects the military influence on life in antebellum America. The Washington Aqueduct, constructed over 150 years ago, still supplies the nation's capital with public water today.<br /> <br /> In the 1850s, the growing population of Washington and the memory of two devastating fires forced Congress to acknowledge that the nation's capital required more than wells and springs to provide its water. In 1853, Congress commissioned a public water system. One year later, construction of the Washington Aqueduct began in Great Falls, Maryland. Meig's plan was to divert the water from the Potomac River into a large, underground conduit. Gravity, and later pumping stations, directed water through the conduit to reservoirs where it could then be pumped into the city's pipelines.<br /> <br /> To accomplish this feat, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a masonry dam across the Potomac, a control gatehouse at Great Falls, a twelve-mile conduit, eleven tunnels, six bridges, several pipelines, and two reservoirs. By 1863, the Corps had completed three resevoirs. Wagons and boats on the C&O Canal brought supplies like cast iron, sand, concrete, brick, and Seneca sandstone to the construction sites. The initial dam reached halfway across the river. In 1890, in order to meet the District's increasing demand for water, it was extended to the Virginia side. Meigs designed the dam to be anchored to the river bottom, not to block its flow but to divert it.<br /> <br /> Although no longer in service, the first gatehouse still stands next to the historic Great Falls Tavern along the C&O Canal in Maryland. Inside was a system of 20 small cast iron slide gates that filtered the largest debris from the water.<br /> <br /> The conduit stretches almost twelve miles downriver from the intake at Great Falls to the Georgetown Reservoir. The underground, circular tube, built of brick, stone, and mortar, is 9 feet in diameter. A road ran parallel to the conduit to facilitate cleaning, repairs and inspections. The road was originally named Conduit Road; today it is MacArthur Boulevard.<br /> <br /> As part of the original Washington Aqueduct water system, workers constructed six bridges to carry the conduit over streams and creeks. Only three, Bridge #3, Cabin John Bridge (also called Union Arch Bridge) and Rock Creek Bridge, remain today. Cabin John Bridge, built of granite and sandstone, held the record as the world's longest masonry arch structure (220 feet) for 40 years. Today, Rock Creek Bridge’s 200-foot arch is still one of the longest unsupported metal pipe arches in the world. <br /> <br /> Aqueduct water spilled into two reservoirs, Dalecarlia Reservoir at the District line and the Georgetown Reservoir two miles downriver. By allowing the murky river water to stand in these reservoirs, debris settles to the bottom before distribution throughout the city. However, the process never successfully removed all of the sediment and thus, Washington City's public water had a muddy-yellowish color until the installation of a rapid-sand filtration system in 1928. Today both reservoirs have been completely modernized.<br /> <br /> Several inscriptions at various places honor the engineers who designed and built the Aqueduct. Meigs had his own name and his assistant’s name, Alfred L. Rives, engraved on the Cabin John Bridge. When Rives quit the US Army to join the Confederate Army in 1861, Meigs replaced his name with the Latin phrase <i>Esto Perpetua</i>, or “Let It Stand Forever.\" After former US Secretary of War Jefferson Davis became the president of the Confederacy, his name was removed from the bridge as well. In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt ordered it be re-engraved.<br /> <br /> While building the Washington Aqueduct, Meigs was also Chief Engineer for the extensions and new dome of the U.S. Capitol, and the enlargement of the General Post Office Building. Both of these buildings are now National Historic Landmarks. After his work with the new aqueduct, Meigs served as Quartermaster General of the United States Army, both during and after the Civil War. During this tenure, he designed the Pension Bureau building, now the National Building Museum (also a National Historic Landmark). During the Civil War, Meigs helped establish Arlington National Cemetery, where he is buried.<br /> <br /> In the twentieth century, the aqueduct’s capacity was expanded many times. As of 2017, it produces 300 million gallons of filtered water per day, has a storage capacity of 44 million gallons, and serves 1.1 million customers. The aqueduct provides public water for all of Washington, DC, Arlington County, and Falls Church City in Virginia. The continual effectiveness of the historic water system is a testament to Meig’s design and the professional work of the Army Corps of Engineers who continue to operate it today. A portion of the aqueduct runs through the Cheasapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, where you can see the originial engineer's house and gatehouse. </span></span></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"> </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Sources:<br /> <span style=\"color:null;\">\"The Washington Aqueduct System.\"</span> National Park Service.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Ways, Harry C. <em>Washinton Aqueduct: 1852-1992.</em> US Army Corps of Engineers.</span></span></span></p>   <p> </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"http://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=6d960253-5f0c-4d15-a2a2-84735ea482f2\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmark Nomination</span></a> of the Washington Aqueduct.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</span></a> are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

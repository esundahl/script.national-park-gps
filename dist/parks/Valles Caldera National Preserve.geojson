The location offered the shelter of towering, old-growth conifers, ample spring water, and a vista of Valle Grande—qualities that have attracted human use and occupation here for several thousand years.<br /> <br /> Beginning as a land grant in 1860, private ownership was held by a series of four families: the Cabeza de Bacas (1860-1899), the Oteros (1899-1917), the Bonds (1917-1962), and the Dunigans (1962-2000). Throughout this succession of owners, the land was used for sheep grazing, sulfur mining, cattle ranching, logging, geothermal exploration, and tourism. By 1963, logging operations had cut over 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares) of timber from the property, and a century of livestock grazing had trampled and compacted the soils beside streams, causing erosion, sedimentation, and unnatural channelization of waterways. <br /> <br /> The Cabin District consists of the Historic Ranch Headquarters buildings and includes: the Ranger Station, where you can find a passport stamp, park-related gift items for sale; the Greer Cabin (1951); the Otero Cabin (1915); the Commissary (1941); the Bond Cabin (1918); the Ranch Foreman's Cabin (1918); and the Caretaker's Cabin (1951). Visitors are welcome to take photos, but we ask you to please stay off of the porches and other parts of these structures. The cabins are not available for rent.<br /> <br /> Parking and portable toilets can be found behind the Otero Cabin and Commissary. This is also the designated parking area for the Ranger Station and South Mountain Trail. ",

It contains volcanic features like sulfuric-acid springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud-pots, and supports a range of “extremophile” algae and bacteria living in the high-temperature acidic pool and stream environments. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the western United States. Originally patented in 1898 as a mining claim by New Mexico businessman and politician, Maríano Otero, who mined sulfur at the site from 1902 to 1904. The Otero family then developed the site as a health resort spa, which operated through much of the twentieth century until it burned down in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, Los Alamos National Laboratory established an experimental geothermal well on the site. Access from NM-4, Mile Marker 27, FS 105 to metal gate and parking area.

The trail travels 1,300 miles throughout the state, offering recreational opportunities year-round as the nation's only subtorpical National Scenic Trail. The Florida Trail is divided to two sections within the Preserve:<br /> <br /> <strong>Big Cypress Southern Section - </strong><em><strong>Length: 24.6 miles (linear)</strong></em><br /> This section of the Florida Trail passes through the great swamp of dwarf pond cypress and crosses pine islands, hammocks, giant ferns, and prairies with cabbage palm and saw palmetto. Bromeliads (air plants) are everywhere. Seven Mile Camp is a particularly interesting location, where the night sounds of the chuck-will’s-widows mingle with the occasional screams of a bobcat or the sound of wild turkeys. Bluebirds, quail, kites, wood storks, short-tailed hawks, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker may also be seen.<br /> <br /> <strong>Big Cypress Northern Section - </strong><em><strong>Length: 8 miles (linear)</strong></em><br /> Traveling north from the I-75 trailhead, enter Big Cypress north. This far dryer section of the trail in the Preserve follows Nobles Grade road while allowing beautiful swamp views. The Carpenter Camp Loop, blazed in blue, provides access to a campsites (Carpenter Camp, Panther Camp and CCC Camp). Backcountry permits are required and are available at the entrance off of the rest stop. <br /> <br /> Large sections of the trail will be inundated with water throughout the duration of the year. If planning on going on full to multi-day hikes, hikers must be prepared to deal with water an backcountry camping while practicing Leave No Trace principles.<br /> <br />  ",

The five-mile roundtrip Gator Hook Trail offers such an opportunity. The trail begins along an elevated logging tram, but soon enters ankle to knee-deep water. For some, the water may rise to hip height. This scenic, moderately strenous hike, is unlike any other in Big Cypress National Preserve. You will become immersed in the resource (literally and figuratively), and experience something that very few visitors do - a wet hike through the cypress swamp.<br /> <br /> The trailhead for Gator Hook Trail is located along the Loop Road roughly 2 miles from Monroe Station. If traveling south on the Loop Road from Monroe Station, the trailhead will be located on the left. You will see an informational kiosk. The trail begins to the right of it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Accessibility Information</strong>: This trail is a moderately strenuous hike which involves hiking through several inches to 4 feet of water. Individuals who attempt this trail should be in good health and highly mobile. Footing can be uneven in spots where the water has dissolved the limestone. Visitors should use care when walking across the exposed limestone as it can be uneven and slippery. Hiking poles or walking sticks are suggested and sturdy footwear. ",

    "audioDescription": "One of the trailheads for the Halfway Creek Canoe Trail is located at the Everglades National Park -Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch. The Halfway Creek Canoe Trail is 7.3-miles long from the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch to the Big Cypress Swamp Welcome Center in Big Cypress National Preserve. The parking lot for the Gulf Coast boat launch is an unmarked, grassy area. The grass is worn and shows tire tracks from vehicles. There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking pass this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

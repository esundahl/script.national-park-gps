    "audioDescription": "The Milam Gap Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a black and white photograph of a man in bib overalls standing by a roadside fruit stand selling apples and apple cider. The text reads, \"Apple of Their Eye - Apples were a cash crop for the people who lived in what is now Shenandoah National Park. Former residents raised different types of apples - some of which were actually created here - including the Milam, for which this gap is named. The Milam apple was probably developed in an orchard very near where you stand right now.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a black and white photograph of President Herbert Hoover fly-fishing in one of the mountain streams that ran through his property. The text reads, \"Fit for a President. The Park's clear mountain streams host a variety of fish species, including native eastern brook trout. Fly-fisherman and U.S. President Herbert Hoover chose a site two miles east of here, at the headwaters of the Rapidan River, for his weekend retreat because of its proximity to these streams and their trout. Rapidan Camp was built in 1929 and gave the 31st President the perfect place to practice his favorite pastime.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Rapidan Camp. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Mill Prong - Rapidan Camp. 4-mile round trip, moderate, 2.75 hours hiking time, 870-foot elevation gain, 3 stream crossings. Go left on the Appalachian Trail south, and cross Skyline Drive. Go left on the blue-blazed Mill Prong Trail. Turn right on Mill Prong Horse Trail. Explore the camp, and then retrace your steps to Milam Gap parking.\" \"Hike #2: Appalachian Trail - Tanners Ridge. The trail is marked in purple with a dashed line. 2.1-mile round trip, easiest, 1.5 hours hiking time, 175-foot elevation gain. Go right on the Appalachian Trail north to Tanners Ridge Road. Return by the same route to the starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Do not attempt to cross streams in icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. Leave what you find. Artifacts are protected by law. Filter or treat water from streams before drinking. Please respect family cemeteries.\"",

    "audioDescription": "The Beahms Gap Orientation Shelter is next to the parking area. The only view from this overlook is looking east, from across Skyline Dive. This view looks over a field with a line of trees in the distance. Further in the distance are the peaks of a few mountains. From the left is Hogback Mountain, Fork Mountain, and Oventop Mountain. There is an orientation shelter at this overlook. The orientation shelter is a small roof supported by six brown beams. The beams are frames for six upright 36 inch by 54 inch panels in glass enclosures. Panel 1. Bulletin Board Bulletin boards contain seasonal information. Panel 2. Park Map This graphic is divided into two columns, the left has text and images and the right has a map. On the right column, title text reads, \"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park.\" Below the title is a color photograph of a man standing atop a rock outcrop and looking to the mountains in the distance on a sunny day. Layered on the image is the quote \"...for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" -President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty. Please observe the 35 mph speed limit to see it all safely. - 75 Overlooks - Spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. - 500 Miles of Trails - Beautiful waterfalls, quiet forests, and mountain summits are just a hike away. - Visitor Centers - Films, exhibits, and Ranger-led walks and talks tell Shenandoah's stories.\" The map to the right shows the boundaries of, driving route through, and highlights in Shenandoah National Park. The map area is 30 miles wide by 150 miles long. Shenandoah National Park is shaded green. Highlights include entrance stations, visitor centers, campgrounds, lodging, restrooms, food services, and trailheads. At the bottom of the map is the park emergency number: (800) 732-0911. At the top and bottom of the graphic are black bars. The black bar at the top has the text, \"Shenandoah National Park,\" to the left, and \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior,\" on the right with the National Park Service arrowhead logo to the far right. The lower black bar has the Leave No Trace logo on the left with the text \"Leave No Trace Principe #6, Respect Wildlife,\" and on the right the text \"www.nps.gov/shen.\" Panel 3. Spring/Summer The graphic is split into two horizontal sections with text and graphics in rectangles. The top section has the title, \"Spring\" with the subtitle \"Renewal.\" The rectangle is split vertically. The left side contains three color photographs with text descriptions. The first image is white flowers with four petals labeled \"Flowering Dogwood,\" and the accompanying text, \"Dogwood blossoms are well-known messengers of spring, but this understory tree has other jobs, too - like providing food and shelter.\" The second image shows a mother deer and two fawns walking in high grasses labeled \"White-tailed Deer\" with the accompanying text \"White-tailed deer hide their fawns under the dogwood's low-hanging branches and feed on its tender shoots, buds, and later, berries.\" The third image shows a dark blue bird with black tail feathers labeled \"Indigo Bunting,\" and the accompanying text \"Indigo buntings often build their nests in dogwood trees and line them with deer hair. Birds love the berries' high fat content, a great trade-off for the dogwood, since its seeds are spread by those who eat them, ensuring the dogwood's renewal.\" The right side of the top panel contains the text, \"From the moment the first plant pushes up through the forest floor beginning its annual growth cycle, spring is renewal. Hungry black bears come out of their dens with winter-born cubs. Migratory birds return, butterflies emerge, and wildflowers herald the season. Every life, new and old, depends on another.\" There are nine color photographs under this text arranged in a 3 by 3 square. From the top left they are: a bush with clumps of white flowers labeled \"Mountain Laurel,\" a butterfly with white and yellow markings and blue tips on the wings labeled \"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,\" round mounds of fungus growing out of the forest floor labeled \"Morel Mushrooms\" a small curled up salamander labeled \"Red-backed Salamander,\" a bird with yellow, black, and white markings labeled \"Chestnut-sided Warbler,\" a single white flower with three petals and large green leaves labeled \"Large-flowered Trillium,\" a light brown toad on the ground labeled \"Spring Pepper,\" a set of three yellow and red bell shaped flowers labeled \"Wild Columbine\"",

    "audioDescription": "The Upper Blackrock Summit Trailhead exhibit is a 36 by 54 inch color panel. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken skyward up the talus slope toward the sky. The text reads, \"An Ocean Preserved - The exposed rocks of Blackrock formed the seabed of the Iapetus Ocean, an ancient body of water that predates the Appalachian Mountains. The geological forces that created the mountains changed the seabed into solid quartzite rock. You can see the layers of sand and quartzite on the rocks. Blackrock is still changing. Weathering has caused what was once a cliff to crumble into a talus slope, a river of moving rocks. Water, ice, and roots break the rocks into even smaller pieces that slide downhill. Eventually the rocks will have settled enough that plants can grow and Blackrock will look like other forested mountainsides. The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is a close-up of a table mountain pine cone lying on the forest floor. The text reads, \"A Forest Renewed - Around Blackrock you might notice burn scars here and there. You might also see new oak and table mountain pine seedlings reaching for the sun. It's hard to see the relationship between the two - fire and these seedlings - but actually we wouldn't have one without the other! The Blackrock area was the site of a prescribed burn in 2008. Shenandoah fire managers were concerned that, because the area had not burned for many years, the thick mountain laurel was choking out native oaks and pines. A carefully planned fire helped clear the brush, open the forest canopy, and regenerate important species. You Can Help - The popularity of the cliffs makes your care even more important. Constant trampling can endanger the fragile vegetation. Please stay on the trail and avoid stepping on sensitive plants and lichen-covered rocks. The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hikes to Blackrock Summit. The text reads, \"Suggested Hike: Hike: #1 Blackrock Summit (This trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line.) 1-mile circuit, easiest, 0.75 hours hiking time, 175-foot elevation gain. Follow the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) south. After a short distance, the trees open up and the A.T. goes around a rocky talus slope. Stay on the A.T. and continue south around the slope. At the intersection, turn left onto the Blackrock Hut Road - Trayfoot Mountain Trail, and follow the trail back to the parking lot. Hike #2: Blackrock Spur Trail & Trayfoot Mountain Trail - (This trail is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 1.6-mile circuit, easiest, 1-hour hiking time, 445-foot elevation gain. Follow the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) south. After a short distance, the trees open up and the A.T. goes around a rocky talus slope. At the trail post, turn right to follow the Blackrock Spur Trail through a boulder field. Continue downhill to the intersection, and turn left onto Trayfoot Mountain Trail. When the trail meets the A.T., it becomes Blackrock Hut Road - Trayfoot Mountain Trail, which will take you back to the starting point. A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. Be aware that you are in snake habitat.",

Their time in the Corps improved their mental as well as physical health and taught them a sense of discipline which was to prove useful in the future.<br /> As enrollee George Moody, Jr. said afterwards:<br /> \"The CCC showed me a lot of rights and wrongs, it grew me up, grew a bit faster than I would have grew otherwise. It kept me out of trouble, chances are. It showed me how to gain responsibility, get out and fend for myself in a proper way.\"</p>",

Reveille was at 6:00 a.m., followed by flag-raising and barracks clean-up. Then, breakfast, chores around camp, and off to assigned work projects. The boys build trails, laid phone line, and fought forest fires. Their work also included landscaping and reforestation.

    "bodyText": "<p>In the beginning, the official requirements for being a CCC enrollee were to be a man between the ages of 18-25, unmarried, and in need of assistance. (Although some older WWI veterans were also allowed to enroll.) Unofficially, some of the CCC boys lied about their ages to enter the Corps.<br /> CCC enrollees earned 30 dollars a month, a dollar a day, but $25 were automatically deducted and sent back home to their families, thus spreading the economic benefits of the program to the whole country. The remaining five dollars were often spent at the camp store or when they were out for a night on the town.<br /> Initially, some local towns were hesitant to have CCC camps built nearby, fearing the consequences of having so many newcomers to the area. But as the economic benefits of having a CCC camp also spread to the local communities, and the work projects started to show concrete results, opposition often faded away. Ultimately, over 6,500 boys and men worked at the CCC camps in Shenandoah National Park.</p>",

There are wooden cross beams on the ceiling and a door at the far end. In the foreground is a wooden stove used to heat the building. There are multiple cots positioned on each side of a middle aisle which runs the length of the building. Each cot has a blanket rolled at the foot of the cot. There are clothes and duffel bags hanging by the head of each cot. Each cot area looks similar to the next.

Barracks were kept immaculate, scrubbed regularly by the boys on Saturdays after their half-day in the field. NP-2 barracks had electricity, but they were heated with wood. Maintaining the heat was another way an industrious enrollee could make a few extra dollars. Enrollees would each chip in 25 or 50 cents a month to pay one boy to \"keep the home fires burning\" during the long, cold nights.",

Drought conditions, poor farming practices and indiscriminate timber harvesting were contributing to the erosion of the nation's soil. In addition, the chestnut blight, a fungus, felled the mighty American Chestnut tree, a key part of both the ecology and economy here in the Appalachian region.<br /> Elected into office to bring some respite to the nation's problems, President Franklin Roosevelt set about to create a \"New Deal,\" implementing work-relief programs to aid the economy and the environment but also to bring people a sense of hope and purpose.<br /> The Civilian Conservation Corps, known as the CCC, was one of the most successful programs to come out of this era. Over the course of nine years, between 1933-1942, more than two million men (and a few women) were put to work helping to heal, and improve, our nation's public lands as well as give themselves a brighter future.<br /> The proposed Shenandoah National Park was the very first National Park site to have a Civilian Conservation Corps camp. The men arrived here on May 15th, 1933 and set to work to help construct the camp. Then they tackled the project of building a National Park.</p> <h3>Touring the CCC Camp</h3> <p>As you walk through this site of CCC Camp NP-2, think of the \"boys\" of the CCC and the legacy that they left for us to enjoy today.

Start from this spot and make your way down the \"Company Street\" past the office, mess hall and towards the five barracks. Then make your way back to the technical, recreation and education buildings.<br /> <br /> If you are not there already, go to the Homepage, hit \"Tours\" then \"Big Meadows CCC Camp\" to follow the tour of the camp.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A large rectangular panel in a brown frame mounted on brown posts. On this panel there is a small graphic of the National Park Service arrowhead in the upper left corner. On the panel there are multiple black and white images and graphics related to this site, a former Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp. The graphics depict ten buildings found within the camp and where they were located i.e., how the camp was laid out. There is also a large red star with the accompanying text \"You Are Here. \"The first image depicts three young men, CCC enrollees wearing work clothes and hats, using shovels to dig a ditch. The second image depicts the company sign, which is mounted on a wooden post. The text of the sign reads: \"United States Dept. of Interior, Shenandoah National Park, Camp N.P.2, 350 Company C.C.C., Camp Fechner, Big Meadows, National Park Service.\" The third image depicts four young men wearing work clothes, CCC enrollees, posing and smiling for the camera. Accompanying Text for the images: \"Imagine this meadow as the hub of activity that was daily life. From \"Reveille\" to \"Taps,\" thousands of boys worked, played, and learned here for nearly a decade. At the end of each workday, the boys NP-2 returned here to their home away from home.\" Accompanying Text: \"A HOME AWAY FROM HOME\" Paragraph 1: The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC): If you study the landscape carefully, you will see the remnants of a road here- the road to a new life for hundreds of young men. This was the entrance to Camp NP-2, one of the first outposts of President Franklin Roosevelt's Depression-era work relief program, the Civilian Conservation Corps. The first enrollees arrived in 1933, each with a renewed sense of hope for a better life for himself and his family, and for a nation in distress. Paragraph 2: Exploring Camp NP-2 Today: After the CCC program ended, the camp was dismantled leaving few traces. Archeologists have identified the locations of the camp's building now marked with posts and selective mowing. Each building site is identified by a sign that reveals a small part of the story of the \"boys\" of Shenandoah. Continue your exploration of the CCC story at Byrd Visitor Center.",

Many saw parts of the country they had never seen before.</p> <h3>The Nation Benefits</h3> <p>The nation as a whole benefitted tremendously from their efforts in reforestation and the conservation of natural resources. Billions of trees were planted throughout the United States, helping to combat the effects of erosion and drought. Hundreds of parks and recreation areas, both at the state and national level, were created, allowing Americans opportunities to connect with nature in ways that had not been possible before. Vacations were suddenly affordable to people who didn't have much money. Buildings and infrastructure were built with such craftsmanship that they are still in use today.<br /> This is not to say that the Civilian Conservation Corps was a perfect program. At times it was disorganized, enrollees deserted (particularly in the later years), it was racially segregated, and women were only allowed to be minimally involved. Opportunities for an even greater good were missed. But the program more than accomplished what it set out to do; it benefitted the economy, helped to restore our environment and addressed the issue of youth unemployment, giving purpose and pride to the enrollees.<br /> Moreover, the fact that many young men had experience with military discipline and living would prove valuable as the country had to make the transition to war.</p> <h3>The End of the CCC</h3> <p>By 1942 conditions in the United States and the world had changed. The Civilian Conservation Corps was shut down as the economy had improved and enrollment dropped; men were needed to fight in World War II. The last of the CCC boys left Shenandoah in June 1942.<br /> Yet the conservation movement they helped to create lives on in our Parks and in the many youth conservation projects of today.</p>",

Consider these safety tips: Wear sturdy shoes Take plenty of water for yourself and your companions, including your pet!

That's a good thing, but it's still a lot of feet tramping through the Park!\" \"Leave No Trace is a set of outdoor ethics that guides lovers of the outdoors toward treading lightly and lessening their impact on the earth. If all visitors practiced Leave No Trace principles, it would help Shenandoah stay clean, beautiful, and wild. In addition to heeding the safety tips above, remember: leave what you find; pack out what you pack in; stay on the trails; maintain a safe distance from , and do not feed , wildlife; and be considerate of others.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Cedar Run Trail and Whiteoak Canyon Trail.

As the lava cooled, it shrank into intriguing six-sided shapes down through its depths, forming columns. Geologists call this columnar jointing. Take the Compton East hike (detailed below) to see an example of columnar jointing, one of the finest in the park.\" The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is of rocks and lichens in various shades of brown, rust, blue, green, and gray.

    "audioDescription": "The view from this overlook faces west. Vegetation covers the foreground and descends out of view. A large mountain on the left, Hawksbill, is the highest visible peak. To the right of Hawksbill and further away is Nakedtop Peak, which descends through Hershberger Ridge down to the Shenandoah Valley below. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Crescent Rock Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The title text reads: \"A Home Away From Home?\" Above the title text is a black and white image of a family walking away from a house. There is a man closer to the camera wearing overalls and carrying household items. The man is looking back and there is a small white dog next to him. Toward where the man is looking and further back in the picture is a woman in a floral dress carrying a child and walking with two more children. The woman and children are walking through a wooden gate. All of the people in the picture are wearing coats and hats. The body text reads: \"In late 1935, when Shenandoah National Park was officially established, 465 families remained on the land, most with no plans for relocation. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Resettlement Administration was tapped to help. The government allocated funds to purchase 6,291 acres in seven locations; 343 were in Page County's Ida Valley just below you. The Ida plans called for 28 farms, each with a house and outbuildings for livestock. A cadre of \"enumerators\" conducted a detailed census of the families and deemed 293 \"homestead prospects\" meaning that, based on information gathered, these families had the means to pay the $5 monthly rent the first year and then purchase the property at its appraised value with a 40-year mortgage. Only 172 families chose to move from their mountain homes to homestead communities like the one below you; very few bought them a year later.\" Next to the text are two black and white images. The upper image depicts a group of men gathered around a truck with an open back. There are two men in the bed of the truck and nine on the ground. The men are loading items into the bed of the truck, which appears about half full. The caption reads, \"The Dodson family, leaving their mountain home in 1937. The Civilian Conservation Corps helped load and transport their belongings to the Ida Valley, just below you. Today, you can still see the houses of the homestead community intended to be home to those forced to move.\" The lower image is a black and white image depicting a neighborhood with identical houses in a large cleared area of land with mountains in the distance. There is one house close to the front and a road leading into the distance with the other houses forking away from the main road at set intervals. There are about ten house separated at equal intervals as the road heads to the horizon. The mountains in the background are surrounded by fog. A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

    "audioDescription": "The Dark Hollow Falls Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph of the water cascading over the rocks of Dark Hollow. The text reads, \"Water on the Rocks - The splashing stream that you follow to Dark Hollow Falls is a life saver. Starting from springs less than a mile away, the water nourishes plants, animals and humans. Park biologists keep an eye on changes in streams such as this one, to reduce negative impacts from humans and weather. Temperature changes of just a few degrees or high acid levels can make streams unlivable for many species. Once the water tumbles through Dark Hollow and leaves the Park, it joins other streams and rivers and passes through farmland, housing developments, towns, and industrial areas along its journey to Chesapeake Bay. Will it still be able to sustain life when it gets there?\" There are four smaller pictures on the bottom left of the panel: a crayfish, purple-flowering raspberry, an ovenbird, and jewelweed. The text reads, \"Who lives here? Take time to see and hear what's around you as you hike. In the stream, look for crayfish, brook trout, salamanders, and frogs. Listen for redstarts and ovenbirds. Bursts of color herald the seasons: trillium in spring, purple-flowering raspberry in summer, and jewelweed from summer into fall.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Dark Hollow Falls. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hike: Hike: Dark Hollow Falls - 1.4-mile, round trip, moderate, 1 hours hiking time, 440-foot elevation gain. Follow the trail 0.75-mile to the base of the falls and return by the same route. If you plan to continue hiking beyond the falls, obtain a map from the visitor center for trail information. This trail is short, but very steep and rocky. The return climb is challenging! Sturdy shoes with gripping soles such as hiking boots and sneakers are best suited for the rocky terrain found on this hike. Stay on the trail and do not venture out onto the rocks near the waterfall. These rocks are very slippery and dangerous. The pathway that crosses Skyline Drive joins the Story of the Forest Trail which leads to Byrd Visitor Center (0.4-mile) and to Big Meadows Campground (0.66-mile). Pets are not allowed on this trail.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at Entrance Stations, Visitor Centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour. Pets are not allowed on Dark Hollow Falls Trail. When you return from your hike, check for ticks.

Hike to a remote camping site, and fall asleep to the sounds of the nighttime forest. Look for squirrels and salamanders, and listen for owls, songbirds, and wood frogs. Capture the beauty of the forest on your camera: wildflowers, mushrooms, and the waterfalls and cascades of Doyles River and Jones Run. The deep pools are perfect for wading, and the tumbling water is great for fishing. Generations of people have escaped hectic lifestyles for the relaxation and rejuvenation that comes from the natural therapy of playing in Shenandoah National Park.\" \"The tree shaded streams of the Park provide perfect habitat for native brook trout. Trout need cool, clean water that is well oxygenated from running over rocks and riffles. All of Shenandoah's streams are open to catch-and-release fishing, some are open for harvest. Check current Park regulations. A valid state fishing license is required.\" The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is two campers setting-up a blue and gray dome tent in a small clearing in the forest. The text reads, \"Get away from the paved world by camping in Shenandoah's backcountry. Backcountry camping immerses you in nature, challenges your body, and refreshes your mind. If you have the right equipment and a free backcountry camping permit, you can camp almost anywhere in the Park. Talk to a Ranger to learn more about backcountry camping.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Doyles River Falls.

Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks.

    "audioDescription": "The Compton Gap Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken of columnar jointing. The text reads, \"Prismatic Features - Millions of years ago plates on the earth's surface in this area began pulling apart, and lava-at first it was black-colored basalt, but eventually it metamorphosed into the greenstone you see today- oozed up out of the earth and through the cracks between the plates. As the lava cooled, it shrank into intriguing six-sided shapes down through its depths, forming columns. Geologists call this columnar jointing. Take the Compton East hike (detailed below) to see an example of columnar jointing, one of the finest in the park.\" The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is of rocks and lichens in various shades of brown, rust, blue, green, and gray. The test reads, \"Ancient Colors - Fort Windham Rocks and all the greenstone in this area are part of the Catoctin Formation, a series of related lava flows in Virginia, Maryland, and southern Pennsylvania. These rocks are being broken apart, little by little, by the power of ice and frost. Because the rocks at Fort Windham are covered with lichen and weathering rapidly, they feature some fascinating colors.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Compton Peak The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Compton Peak, West and East - 2.4-mile T-hike, moderate, 1.75 hours hiking time, 835-foot elevation gain. Cross Skyline Drive and begin at the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) post. Take the A.T. south to the trail post at the T-intersection. Go right at the post. Continue on the trail to the west viewpoint. Return to the intersection, and continue straight to the east viewpoint. The columnar jointing is underneath the east viewpoint; to see it, follow the blue blazes. This part of the trail is rough and rocky, but very short. When you reach the base of the cliff, look up to see the columnar jointing. Return the way you came, crossing Skyline Drive to reach the parking area.\" \"Hike #2: Fort Windham Rocks - (This hike is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 0.8-mile round trip hike, easiest, Â½ hour hiking time, 130-foot elevation gain. Follow the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) north to its intersection with the Dickey Ridge Trail. Turn left. In about 300 yards, explore Fort Windham Rocks on the right. Return the way you came.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour. - Be sure you know your route.

Observe your surroundings. Can you imagine what this spot would have been like when the Fox family still held funerals here? What did this space mean to the family?<br /> If you are visiting in spring, you may discover flowers that the Fox family planted years ago - frilly old fashioned daffodils and narcissuses, deep purple bearded irises. On the ground of the cemetery look for periwinkle, a low vine also called \"myrtle\" or \"cemetery weed.\" Periwinkle has blue-violet flowers nestled against dark glossy leaves that make an attractive ground cover and was commonly planted around cemeteries.</p> <h3>How do you protect history?</h3> <p>All cultural resources in Shenandoah are protected. Many cemeteries in the Park are maintained by the families to this day. These places and the history they hold may not last forever - which is why we need to appreciate them while they are still around.<br /> Some history here is already lost. Near here and along the trail you'll find blackheart cherry trees, which the Foxes planted for their fruit. During a visit here in 1976, Lemuel Fox Jr. recalled one of these cherry trees in the cemetery, \"I picked many a cherry off that tree. Blackheart cherries...Be plowing corn, and I'd get up there and eat cherries, rest the horse. I'd set up in the tree and eat cherries.\" This cherry tree that Lemuel remembered was knocked down in a storm a few years past. Other trees that were here were also knocked down - a few tulip trees and spicebushes. The result of this loss is the sunny clearing here today. Can you imagine what this spot will look like in another 20 years? What about 100, or 500 years?<br /> The forest is always changing, and some of that change means that, over time, we will begin to lose the clues of lives once lived here. Some of the loss, like open cornfields becoming forest and the slow crumbling of rock walls may not be immediately evident. As you walk to the next stop just a little ways down the trail, think about what you can do to protect this history.</p>",

A short section of the trail here is on the Merchant property. Today, the rock foundation of Merchant's barn lies under thick spicebush and multiflora rose.<br /> After the turn, you will be walking along an old county road which once connected the Fox family to the town of Front Royal. To your left (and possibly not even visible through the dense forest) is a rusting wire fence over piled rocks. This was once a wall that separated a field from the road. Imagine the fence new, the field cleared, and the barn standing tall. Imagine the wagons, and later cars, traveling down to Front Royal to the markets, or maybe to a social dance.<br /> The time on this road is yours: to think, to explore, to discover what you may. In the summer look for the blackberries and wineberries that line trail. Keep an eye out for bright red cardinals in the winter. You may spot bear or deer along the old road foraging for food. In the fall, as vibrant colors come out, try to identify different trees - dogwoods, hickories, maples, sassafras, black gums, and oaks. Look for wildflowers in the spring as the sun is still shining through the forest canopy. Or, simply enjoy walking a road that many people have walked before.</p>",

The original purpose of these rock piles is unknown.</p> <h3>Where do these rocks come from?</h3> <p>The rocks piled here are greenstone, volcanic rocks found in much of Shenandoah. Greenstone formed hundreds of millions of years ago when tectonic plates drifted apart and created rifts in the earth's surface. Ancient lava flows rose through these rifts, covering valleys and lapping up against hills and older mountains. The lavas were composed of basalt. Eventually heat and pressure metamorphosed the rock and new minerals like chlorite and epidote grew within the basalt. These minerals give the rock the greenish color that they have today and distinguish greenstone from unaltered basalt.<br /> Greenstone is found on some of the most well-known peaks in the Park, including on Hawksbill and Stony Man. Greenstone also forms rich soil - an attractive feature for settlers looking to farm. Today, much of this greenstone is covered by lichen with trees growing through the crevices. Does the plant life surrounding the rock piles give you a clue as to how long it has been since people moved these rocks?<br /> When you find evidence of human habitation along this trail - look at the surrounding forest. Think about how quickly the forest grows and what other artifacts from the lives of the Fox family may have been lost for good.</p>",

One of the reasons Shenandoah is so lush, and how much of the vegetation here seems to grow faster than other places, is the prevalence of water sources like this one here.</p> <h3>Where does this water come from?</h3> <p>The groundwater here is under your feet. As water filters from the earth's surface down to the groundwater table it is purified by the rocks and nutrients it passes through. Water travels through the pores within and between individual rocks and pebbles, sometimes being stored for years, before eventually emerging as a mountain spring or stream. The water here will join the Shenandoah River, and from there flow into Chesapeake Bay, then finally into the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> The quality of water is directly related to air quality. Acidification is the primary threat to streams in Shenandoah. Acidification occurs when sulfur and nitric oxides produced from fossil fuel burning, especially from coal, react in the air to form acid compounds that then deposit onto the landscape. Think about all the ways this water could be used from the time it begins its journey on this mountain stream until it reaches the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> Though this hollow is at times a quiet, enclosed space, what happens here can affect people and ecosystems far outside these hills. Likewise, these hills and this forest are constantly impacted by outside forces. As you travel forward, continue to look for signs of the Fox family's home, but keep in mind the rapid pace of change all around.</p>",

Early park managers advocated for reforestation and creating a place with a natural aesthetic; they wanted it to look like a beautiful forest. To those ends, the Civilian Conservation Corps maintained nurseries with Table Mountain pine, pitch pine, bittersweet, Virginia creeper, and dogwood, just to name a few. The CCC planted trees and other vegetation in areas that had previously been cleared for farming or grazing livestock. When left to nature, black locusts, sassafras, and pines are the first trees to take over, soon to be followed by longer-lived species like oaks and hickories.<br /> Today, wilderness in the Park is crucial habitat to many plants and animals, along with providing recreational opportunities for people who may not be able to enjoy quiet mountain trails anywhere else. This is why Shenandoah National Park exists. This forest that surrounds you here is something to be cherished. Likewise, the family that lived and labored here during another time should not be forgotten.</p>",

The text reads, \"Home: Before this part of Virginia was called Shenandoah National Park, people lived here and called it home. This land is where they got their sustenance, made their living, raised their families, and buried their dead. You can still see evidence of former human habitation throughout the Park, including here in Fox Hollow. The daffodils and periwinkle you see are gone-wild descendants of plants nurtured by them; the cemetery, too, reminds us that they were here.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel shows 3 tombstones from the Fox family cemetery. The stone in the center of the picture reads, \"Gertrude Fox, Died June 22, 1904, Aged 21 Years\". That stone has been broken near its base and is lying on an angle among the green ground cover. The text reads, \"They Still Speak - There are more than 100 family cemeteries in Shenandoah. Some are still maintained by the descendants of those buried there and some are not. The cemeteries that are not as well maintained might surprise hikers who come across the weathered tombstones in the Park's backcountry. Whether or not they are kept up and taken care of, these cemeteries speak gently to us of the people who made their lives in the hollows and on the ridges of what is now Shenandoah National Park.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hikes to Fox Hollow Trail and Snead Farm Loop. The Fox Hollow Trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line.

The highest visible peak from the left is Blackrock. This peak descends down Roundhead Ridge and into the valley at the town of Stanley. To the right is a smaller ridge also descending towards the center of the view to the town of Stanley. Over the ridge to the right and further in the distance than Stanley is the town of Luray. Along the horizon is the long ridge of Massanutten Mountain. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Franklin Cliffs Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The title text reads \"Guarding the Past.\" Underneath the title text is an italicized quote that reads \" â€˜In the end, the character of a civilization is encased in its structures.' Frank Gehry, architect.\" The body text reads, \"Historic preservation honors and saves our past. Preservation, both natural and cultural, is a mission and mandate of the National Park Service (NPS). The NPS is obligated to preserve, restore, rehabilitate, and reconstruct the objects that link us to bygone times and our heritage-furnishings, buildings, even guardrails. When Skyline Drive was built in the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) constructed barriers at the edges of the road and overlooks. Here at Franklin Cliffs, CCC workers laid a log guardrail. Because it had rotted, the log guardrail was removed in the 1950s. In 2009, as part of a historic preservation project for Skyline Drive, log guardrails were rebuilt along 11 miles of the scenic highway, including here at Franklin Cliffs Overlook.\" Below the text is a photograph taken from Skyline Drive of a log guardrail. Behind the guardrail in the distance is a mountain on the left side of the page that is descending to the right and to the Shenandoah Valley below. A long mountain ridge is visible out to the horizon. In the upper right of the poster there is a transparent box with two photographs in it. The title of the box reads, \"Changing Guards.\" The upper photograph is a black and white images that shows three young men constructing a log guardrail. The text for this image reads, \"Architects used various materials, including stone walls and log guardrails, to protect motorists from Skyline Drive's steep slopes. Original log guardrails were made from the wood of the American chestnut tree.\" The lower photograph shows a color image of the overlook with no guardrail, just a parking area that drops off with the mountain. The text for this image reads, \"Franklin Cliffs Overlook had no safety barrier after the original guardrail was removed in the 1950s. In 2009 the log guardrail was rebuilt to adhere to current safety standards and to recapture the original 1930s look.\" In the lower left of the poster there is a transparent box with one color image. The image is an illustration with a white border of the overlook from above with a view of mountains beyond. The text, \"Franklin Cliff from the overlook on Skyline Drive,\" is posted to the upper left of the illustration. The text for this image reads, \"Souvenir postcards of Skyline Drive like this one of Franklin Cliffs Overlook are pleasant reminders of the past historic preservation seeks to save.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

The text reads, \"Gifts From the Land - Before the Park's establishment in the 1930s, Loft Mountain was home to farming people who settled here from Europe in the mid-1700s. They cleared the forest to provide pastureland for cattle and planted fruit trees-especially apples-for food. They brought plants with them from their home continent and planted them. When the National Park Service took possession of this land and these people had to move out, they left these plants behind. Many of them-especially apples-provide food for the deer, gray foxes, and bears that now call this land home.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a small bunch of blackberries, two of which are ripe for eating! The text reads, \"A Forest Growing Up - Since the Park's establishment, the forest has been allowed to grow back. Most of what you see here are pioneer species - the kinds of plants and trees that spring up in the early stages of forest succession: coralberry, blackberry, Virginia creeper, hawthorn, and black locust. Eventually, as years pass, taller trees will start to shade out the shrubs and smaller plants that are typical of a young forest. This area will look very different as oak, hickory, and other mature-forest trees move in and take hold.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the Frazieer Discovery Trail hike.

Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.",

Heavier settlement of the Manor began in the 1770s, with people leasing land from Fairfax.

    "audioDescription": "The Hawksbill Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken from the summit of the trail that shows lush green foliage, the blue haze of the mountains in the distance, and a gray, cloudy sky overhead. The text reads, \"We All Live Downwind...of the things we make and use. What will you see from Hawksbill summit today? Shenandoah sits downwind from major cities and industry, sources of pollution that impair the Park's air quality. Air pollution, especially in summer, can obscure the view from the Park's high points, including the highest peak, Hawskbill - at 4,051 feet. Shenandoah's scientists, as well as all of us, must work together to reduce pollution and preserve Shenandoah's beautiful views.\" The photograph on the lower left is the Shenandoah salamander. This close-up of the head and front half of its body shows the brownish, moist body, large dark eyes, and the distinctive orange/yellow stripe down the length of its back. The picture captures the salamander on a bed of lush green foliage. The text reads, \"Here and Only Here: The Shenandoah salamander - a rare and endangered species found only in this Park - has never existed anywhere else in the world! It can only live in certain environments, such as the relatively cool, moist, high elevation of Hawksbill Mountain. This small creature has been listed as Federally Endangered even though its range lies entirely within a National Park. The salamander faces many threats - acid deposition, climate change, and human use of the Park, which can be very disruptive to the places it lives. Scientists are working to better understand and protect the Shenandoah salamander.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hikes to Hawksbill Summit and Observation Platform.

    "audioDescription": "The Upper Hawksbill Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken at the summit of the trail that shows the gnarled tree and shrub growth between exposed boulders in these harsh conditions. The text reads, \"Hunkering Down: It's harsher - colder, icier, windier - up high, and to adapt, trees and shrubs on Hawksbill hug the warmer-than-air ground and grow gnarled, at a wedge-like angle. They've had to be tough to adapt to harsher conditions on this summit. But adaptation is stressful, so they are fragile - tread lightly. The balsam firs and red spruce you see on Hawskbill summit are boreal, or northern, trees; they thrive in New England-like climates. These species were more widespread in the Blue Ridge Mountains in the last ice age, but now that the climate is warmer, they have retreated to a few high-elevation spots, like Hawksbill.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a beautiful blue cerulean warbler on a a bare gray tree branch. The text reads, \"The Times They Are A-changin': Change may be the only constant, but in regards to climate, some change is natural and some is not. The retreat of these cold loving plants as the last ice ice segued into warmer times was organic - unrelated to any workings of humans. The same is not true of what we face today. Climate change over the past century owes much to humans and our waste-emitting cars and industry. Climate change begets other changes that affect sensitive animal and plant life. The cerulean warbler, whose numbers have decreased by 70%, depends on the delicately timed, weather driven balance of insect emergence. Reducing carbon emissions can't come too soon.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Hawksbill Summit and Observation Platform. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hike: Hike: Upper Hawksbill; 2.1 mile round trip, easiest, 1.5 hours hiking time, 520-foot elevation gain.

    "audioDescription": "This overlook faces east. In the foreground is shrubs and vegetation. Beyond the vegetation is a drop in elevation that leads to Nicholson Hollow. Mountains rise up past Nicholson Hollow. Pinnacle Ridge straight ahead is the highest mountain. Hazel Mountain is a small dome in the distance. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Hemlock Springs Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The poster is split horizontally with the title and body text in the lower third. The title text reads, \"Lost Treasures.\" The body text reads, \"The eastern hemlock tree holds a special place in the hearts of Appalachian dwellers. Birds such as the Blackburnian warbler and the winter wren find homes in hemlock forests. Brook trout thrive in cold mountain streams sheltered from sun by the hemlock's shade. Shenandoah residents and visitors treasured the enchanting old growth stands at Hemlock Springs, Limberlost, and Rapidan Camp (where some of the hemlocks were over 300 years old). We'll never experience that magic again. Ninety-five percent of Shenandoah's hemlocks are gone, killed by an invasive pest called the hemlock woolly adelgid. Park scientists use chemical and biological treatments to protect the remaining hemlock trees. The gray, broken tree trunks of Hemlock Springs remind us of the hundreds of thousands already lost and the ecosystems forever changed.\" Above the title are two images, one on the left half and one on the right half of the poster. The image to the left has the date \"1968\" printed on it and shows a sepia colored images with full, healthy Hemlock trees on it. The image to the right has the date \"2014\" printed on it and shows a sepia colored image of a slope covered with bare, dead trees. In the middle of the two is an orange box with a close up image of Hemlock needles covered near the branch with a white substance. The text for this image reads, \"The aphid-like hemlock woolly adelgid builds white cottony egg sacks at the base of hemlock needles, where it feeds on the tree's sap. This kills the needles, thereby starving the tree and killing it. A hemlock tree will live about three to five years after an adelgid infestation.\" On the lower third of the image to the right of the title is brown box with four photographs in it. The title for this small box reads, \"History Repeats Itself.\" Text under the title reads, \"Non-native blights, insects, and diseases, introduced into the ecosystem by human activity, have caused dramatic changes in the Shenandoah forest.\" Each of the four photographs is numbered with the corresponding text. Image one shows a shiny green beetle on a leaf with the text, \"1. The emerald ash borer threatens Shenandoah's ash trees today.\" Image two shows three creamy white flowers against a blue background with the text, \"2. Dogwood anthracnose disease has caused the number of dogwood trees to dwindle since the 1970s.\" Image three shows a fuzzy, brown, caterpillar with the text, \"Gypsy moths decimated white oak trees in the 1980s and 1990s.\" Image four is a black and white picture of a forest of dead, fallen trees with the text, \"A blight killed American chestnut trees in the early 1900s.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

In the distance is Massanutten Mountain, followed by the Valley and Ridge Appalachians. Further in the distance, on a clear day, the Allegheny Mountains stretch across the distant horizon. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Hogback Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The title text reads, \"On the Horizon.\" The body text reads, \"Shenandoah National Park's stunning vistas are the reason many of you are here. Unfortunately, these views are often marred by air pollution. Small particles of pollutants suspended in the atmosphere create haze-a white or brownish veil over the scene that smudges it and scrubs it of its colors, shapes, and textures, eroding your ability to see and enjoy it. Although dust, fog, wildfire smoke, moisture-emitting plants and trees, and natural atmospheric humidity create some of this haze, particles from human sources such as coal-fired power plants, agriculture, industry, and vehicle exhaust account for much of it. Air pollution at Shenandoah National Park has many sources, both local and-because of wind and weather patterns-from at least four other states besides Virginia: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Ohio. Here at Hogback Overlook, the quality of the air affects how well-or even if-you can see other ridges and hollows in the Park, the Shenandoah Valley, and the Massanutten and Allegheny Mountains beyond. The National Park Service monitors visibility conditions in Shenandoah and other parks, investigates the causes of haze, and works with air regulatory agencies and partners to lessen the effects of air pollution. These large-scale efforts have paid off: due to reductions in power plant emissions, Shenandoah National Park has seen fewer extremely hazy days. Small-scale, more personal efforts- reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and being more mindful of how we live-will do even more to help us see even farther.\" Behind the text is an image taken from a higher elevation looking down to the mountains below. It is a winter image, there is some snow on the ground and none of the trees have leaves. In the distance is the Shenandoah Valley below with haze into the horizon. To the right of the text is a blue box with two color photographs of an Air Quality Station and the title text, \"Tracking Changes Over Time.\" The image on the left shows a white, square building with scientific instruments around it. The image on the right shows a white table with buckets and scientific instruments on top of it. The text accompanying the images reads, \"Shenandoah's air quality monitoring programs have been providing data for 30 years, giving scientists some of the most valuable information available about trends in air quality over time. Scientists across the nation use Shenandoah's data to advise protection agencies and lawmakers. Historical records show that when strong regulations are in place, the quality of our air improves.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

The title text reads, \"Beneath the Treetops.\" The body text reads, \"From here, the forest looks peaceful. But underneath the treetops, Shenandoah is busy. Native oaks, hickories, maples, poplars, and other plant species provide food and shelter for Shenandoah's animals. With 1,325 plant species, over 340 vertebrates, and a multitude of invertebrates, this forest is a lively place!

In the distance is the Shenandoah Valley. On the lower third of the graphic are five circles, each with a photograph of an animal in it and text below it. From the left, the first image is a millipede crawls atop green vegetation. The text reads, \"American giant millipedes eat the decaying vegetation and organic matter that covers the forest floor. They are one of the thousands of species that \"clean\" the forest; millipedes are also a food source for turkeys, chipmunks, and bears.\" The second image is a chipmunk standing on a log with its hands together looking to the right. The text reads, \"Agile chipmunks dart up, down, and around tree trunks on their way between burrows, hiding places, and food caches. Chipmunks thrive in hardwood forests due to the variety of foods-seeds, nuts, and insects-found throughout the seasons.\" The third image shows the head of a black bear surrounded by ferns looking straight toward the viewer. The text reads, \"Black bears prefer the shelter of the hardwood forest to open fields because they can hide in the dense underbrush while they hunt for berries, nuts, and insects.\" The forth image shows the head of a deer with large antlers in an area of tall grass looking to the left. The text reads, \"White-tailed deer browse the tender leaves of dozens of grass and leafy plant species. They love acorns, something that is abundant in oak-hickory forests like Shenandoah.\" The fifth image shows a bird with a black head, white breast, and brown wings. The bird has its mouth open and head pointed up. The text reads, \"The Eastern towhee's song- \"Drink your tea-e-e-e-e\"-trills across Shenandoah's forest in the morning and evening hours. The ground-dwelling bird builds its nest in the underbrush from the abundant leaf litter.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

Over the vegetation there is Rocks Mountain descending from the left and Trayfoot Mountain descending from the right. Horsehead Mountain is a smaller mountain straight ahead.

The Horsehead Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The graphic is divided vertically with the title and body text on the left quarter of the graphic on top of a transparent gray background. The title text reads, \"Rock Rivers.\" The body text reads, \"The bare patches you see in the distance seem bleak and immobile. In fact, talus is an agent of change, a rock river flowing down the mountainside at an imperceptibly slow pace. Talus forms when the freeze and thaw cycle breaks off pieces of exposed bedrock. These pieces, some as big as cars, fall together into a stream of rock (see illustrations to the right). Additional weathering breaks the large chunks into smaller pieces, which continue falling downhill. When the rocks stop moving, soil accumulates and plants take root and cover the rocks.\" In the middle of the body text is an image with a white border of a slope covered in trees with a few bare gaps in the trees. The right section of the graphic contains a photograph of a person atop a rocky slope. The lower portion of the right section contains three illustrations on a transparent black background. The illustrations, from the left, show a group of large rocks, then the group of rock cracks and separates a bit, then the rocks are crumbled to pieces. The text accompanying the illustrations reads, \"Even without soil, talus supports an ecosystem. Lichen grows on rock surfaces. Reptiles and rodents find shelter in the crevices. Predators like bobcats stalk the rocks, waiting for a tasty meal to appear between the cracks.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

The plaque reads, \"Between 1933 and 1942 more than 10,000 young men served in the Civilian Conservation Corps Camps in Shenandoah National Park. These 'boys' created the form and fabric of the new park so that future generations could find recreation and re-creation here.

Flattop Mountain is straight ahead in the distance, Brokenback Mountain is to the right of Flattop and further in the distance, and Loft Mountain is rising off to the right. The flat Virginia Piedmont spans the horizon. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Ivy Creek Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The graphic is split vertically with the title and body text in front of a green background on the left side. The title text reads, \"Escape Route.\" The body text reads, \"Stretching over 2,180 miles, the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) crosses 14 states, five national parks, seven national forests, and numerous state parks and towns between Maine and Georgia. A physically daunting task, the climbing required in hiking the entire length of the A.T. is the equivalent of Mt. Everest-16 times. Hikers finish with strong legs and renewed spirits. Benton MacKaye, Myron Avery, and other hikers created the A.T. in the 1930s so that Americans could escape busy modern life for a minimalist adventure in nature. Whether hiking for one day or many, today's A.T. visitors enjoy the trail for the same reason. One hundred and one miles of the A.T. pass through Shenandoah National Park. This stretch forms the backbone of the Park's trail system. From the A.T., hikers of all abilities can access other Shenandoah trails to reach Wilderness, mountain peaks, waterfalls, adventure, and solitude.\" To the left of the body text is a photograph of an Appalachian Trail marker: a concrete post with an AT symbol engraved into it and a metal band around the top of it. The right side of the graphic has a photograph of a hiker walking along a trail in the woods wearing a large backpack. On the lower third of the right side of the image is a horizontal panel with three images. From the left the first image shows a woman holding a pickax about to hit the ground. The second image shows three people arranging a log on a trail. The third image shows a man sawing a fallen tree. The text accompanying these images reads, \"Volunteers built the A.T. using handsaws, shovels, and axes. They finished in 1937. Volunteers continue to form the core of the A.T. workforce. Over 30 hiking clubs and 6,000 individual volunteers donate over 200,000 hours of trail work every year, using the same hand tools as the first crew of volunteers. The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club takes care of the A.T. in Shenandoah, and assists with other Park trails as well.\" To the right of this text is the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club logo: a red, yellow, and turquoise symbol with trees in the foreground, mountains in the distance, and the decorative letters, PATC. A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

The title text reads, \"If These Walls Could Talk.\" Below the title is a quote that reads, \" The hand-cut walls have stories to tell for those willing to listen.' Reed Engle, The Greatest Single Feature... A Sky-line Drive.\" The body text reads, \"May 15, 1933 saw the first Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps established in Shenandoah at Skyland and Big Meadows. Young, strong men were now available to help turn the dream of Skyline Drive into reality. Under the leadership of National Park Service landscape architects, CCC enrollees and engineers helped build Skyline Drive's stone walls and overlooks, including the one where you stand now-Jewell Hollow. As you drive through Shenandoah National Park, you'll see plenty of the fruits of the CCC's labor-re-placed boulders, graded slopes, and transplanted trees and shrubs. While much of the boys' work blends seamlessly with the natural landscape, the walls stand out as visible testament to the quality and permanence of the CCC's work.\" Below the text is a close up image of a stone wall. To the right of the text is a black and white photograph of a dirt road with some stones laid out on the sides of the road, an old 1930s car off to the side, and two groups of workers standing around. The caption for the image reads, \"Jewell Hollow Overlook under construction, c. 1930.\" In the lower left of the graphic is an image and text over a transparent black background. The image shows a side view of a stone wall surrounded by grasses. The title of the text next to this image reads, \"Wall Construction.\" The body of the text reads, \"In the 1930s, stone walls in Shenandoah National Park were built in two styles of masonry: dry-laid and ashlar. Dry-laid walls, like those here at Jewell Hollow Overlook, could be built by less-experienced stone workers, like the young men of the CCC, since they require only moving and aligning heavy stones-more muscle than skill. Mortared ashlar masonry walls require more expertise and had to be built by experienced masons.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

    "audioDescription": "The Jones Run Falls Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken along the shores of the Chesapeake Bay...a destination of the water that flows from this area of Shenandoah National Park. The text reads, \"Keep It Clean - Jones Run is a source stream for the James River watershed, one of three major watersheds in Shenandoah National Park. Here is how the watershed works: Jones Run flows into the Doyles River, which flows into the Moormans River, which flows into the Rivanna River, which flows into the James River, which flows into the the Chesapeake Bay, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean. This means that what happens in Shenandoah's streams does not stay in Shenandoah's streams. Effects accumulate, good or bad, as the water travels to its final destination.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a handsome brook trout in its natural habitat. The text reads, \"Full of Life - Pick up a rock and take a look. You'll see small creatures underneath it, like crayfish and caddisfly cases, evidence that Jones Run, like all of Shenandoah's streams, is teeming with activity. You might also see stoneflies and mayflies, indicators of good water quality and evidence that Shenandoah is sending clean water downstream. This tiny, aquatic life is also food for brook trout.\" \"Brook trout thrive here in the mountains because they are cold water fish. Shenandoah's high elevation and shady forests keep the water cool. Brook trout are indicator species, so the fact that they're living in the Park means the streams are healthy and clean.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Jones Run Falls. The text reads, \"Suggested Hike: Hike #1: Jones Run Falls - (This trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line.) 3.2-mile round trip, moderate, 2.25 hours hiking time, 1,045-foot elevation gain, one stream crossing. Follow Jones Run Trail to Jones Run Falls, and return by the same route.\" \"Hike #2: Jones Run Falls and Doyles River Falls (The trail is marked in purple with a brown dashed line.) 6.5-mile circuit, moderately strenuous, 5 hours hiking time, 1,701-foot elevation gain, several stream crossings. Follow the Appalachian Trail north to Browns Gap parking. Without crossing Skyline Drive, walk several yards alongside the road until you reach Browns Gap Road on the right. Follow Browns Gap Road; turn right onto Doyles River Trail. Trail posts mark the location of Upper and Lower Doyles River Falls. Another trail post marks the end of Doyles River Trail and the beginning of Jones Run Trail. Follow Jones Run Trail. A trail post marks the location of Jones Run Falls. Continue uphill to return to the parking lot.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Do not attempt to cross streams during icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. Leave what you find. Artifacts are protected by law. It's dangerous and potentially deadly to climb on the rocks near waterfalls. Filter or treat water from streams before drinking.\"",

    "audioDescription": "The Limberlost Trailhead is and 36 by 54 inch color poster. The upper left has a title: Did You Know? There are two photos, one of the area when the hemlock trails were healthy. The photo is of a forest of very large evergreen trees with very straight trunks and feathery foilage. Caption: Limberlost was once known for its majestic hemlocks-the largest old-growth stand in the park. They were killed by an invasive insect. The second photo is of a section of trail that boasts a beautiful stand of mountain laurel. The photo shows a bench backed by the delicate pink blossoms of the laurel, a wide greenstone path curves into the distance flanked by more of the pink blooms in the understory and accented by green foliage overhead. Caption: The magic of Limberlost is revealed in June with a spectacular explosion of mountain laurel. Below is a title: Ever-Changing Forest Text: As you explore Limberlost, you'll see evidence of a constantly changing forest. Both human-caused and natural events impact what lives and dies in nature. An invasive insect, a hurricane, and several ice storms caused many of the bent, broken, and downed trees. But, look closely! You'll see that they all fill an important role in the ecosystem. Examine the fallen hemlock trees. You'll see that the decaying logs are being decomposed by fungi and insects, shredded by hungry bears, and used as shelter by chipmunks and squirrels. Notice that new growth-a multitude of black birch-is taking the place of the once-dominant hemlock. Below is a photo of the excellent example of columnar jointing along this trail. The photo is dominated by a large rock formation. The gray-green rocks are arranged in columns, very much like a vertical stack of posts. In the background the fog hovers in the forest. Caption: Imagine the forces that created this outstanding example of columnar jointing that you will see along the trail. Title: Rock of Ages Text: There is change even in the rocks. Look for an outstanding example of columnar jointing. Jutting from the earth like a giant crystal, it is the remains of an ancient lava flow that cooled, contracted, and solidified into an array of columns. Erosion claimed the rocks that used to surround it, but, like the rest of the forest, it reflects both change and resilience. The upper right has a map of the area with the suggested hikes outlined in pink and yellow. Title: Suggested Hikes Text: Hike #1 - Limberlost 1.3 miles, circuit; fairly level stroll. Take the trail to your right and follow the greenstone path back to your starting point. See the opposite side of this kiosk for accessibility information. Pets are not allowed on Limberlost Trail. Hike #2 - Upper Whiteoak Falls 4.5 miles, round trip; moderate. Take the Limberlost trail to your left. In about 200 yards, turn right onto Whiteoak Canyon Trail and follow it 1.5 miles to the upper falls viewing area. Retrace your steps to return. Title: Exploring Further There are several more falls farther down the Whiteoak Canyon Trail, but be sure to plan ahead if you want to see them. It's an additional 1.9 miles to the bottom of the canyon (making the round trip hike 8.3 miles total) in much steeper, rockier terrain. You'll need significantly more time, water, and stamina! To the right of the Suggested Hikes information is a box. The top fifth of the box is bright red. Text: Emergency: 1-800-732-0911 (Cell phone service is unreliable.)Other text below the red: Before you go!- Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen.- Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at Entrance Stations, Visitor Centers, and www.nps.gov/shen- Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour.- Pets are not allowed on Limberlost Trail.- When you return from your hike, check for ticks.- Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. The Limberlost Accessibility Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper right of the panel is a photograph of a \"resting interval\" along the trail. The text reads, \" The Limberlost area has been a favorite among visitors since before Shenandoah National Park was established. Skyland was a privately owned resort in the 1920s. The resort's owners, Addie and George Pollock arranged horseback excursions into the beautiful and mysterious \"Limberlost Swamp.\" Because of its proximity to Skyland and its relatively gentle grade, park staff proposed making the trail accessible to all visitors in 1996. Over the years, several organizations have donated labor, equipment, supplies and funding. Alongside volunteers, the park staff has worked to make the trail compliant with current ADA standards, adjusting the grade and adding benches and over 20 resting areas. As of fall 2015, the Limberlost Trail is fully accessible. Your fee dollars, funding from the Shenandoah National Park Trust, and other contributions have made this accessible trail possible.\" The center of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the",

    "audioDescription": "A rustic dark brown wood-sided building with dark green trim. A center double door divides the two sides. A sidewalk leads to the door. The interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The title text reads, \"Smarter Than Your Average Bear...\" The body text reads, \"... is pretty smart. Black bears are wily omnivores-quick learners who can easily destroy any tent or container to get at your food! Black bears thrive in Shenandoah National Park because the foods they need to eat-acorns, berries, grubs, honey-are plentiful. Human food is bad news for bears, and all Park wildlife. Bears that get human food lose their fear of humans. They are at a much greater risk for being illegally hunted and hit by vehicles. A \"good bear gone bad\" is dangerous to people and may have to be trapped and relocated or even killed by Park staff. Bears have an astounding sense of smell. They also have claws and strong teeth, which means they can make quick work of even a metal cooler. When you're picnicking in bear country, store your food properly and don't leave it unattended, even for a few moments. Remember to put all food and packaging inside your vehicle and dispose of garbage in bear-proof trashcans.\" The text is on top of a bright green background. To the left of the text is an image of a bear surrounded by green ferns, looking straight forward at the viewer. The caption for the image reads, \"Black bear.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\" The orientation shelter is a small roof supported by six brown beams. The beams are frames for six upright 36 inch by 54 inch posters in glass enclosures. Panel 1: Bulletin Board Bulletin boards contain seasonal information. Panel 2: Shenandoah Map This graphic is divided into two columns, the left has text and images and the right has a map. On the right column, title text reads, \"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park.\" Below the title is a color photograph of a man standing atop a rock outcrop and looking to the mountains in the distance on a sunny day. Layered on the image is the quote \" ...for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" -President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty. Please observe the 35 mph speed limit to see it all safely. - 75 Overlooks - Spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. - 500 Miles of Trails - Beautiful waterfalls, quiet forests, and mountain summits are just a hike away. - Visitor Centers - Films, exhibits, and Ranger-led walks and talks tell Shenandoah's stories.\" The map to the right shows the boundaries of, driving route through, and highlights in Shenandoah National Park. The map area is 30 miles wide by 150 miles long. Shenandoah National Park is shaded green. Highlights include entrance stations, visitor centers, campgrounds, lodging, restrooms, food services, and trailheads. At the bottom of the map is the park emergency number: (800) 732-0911.

The graphic is split into two horizontal sections with text and graphics in rectangles. The top section has the title, \"Spring\" with the subtitle \"Renewal.\" The rectangle is split vertically. The left side contains three color photographs with text descriptions. The first image is white flowers with four petals labeled \"Flowering Dogwood,\" and the accompanying text, \"Dogwood blossoms are well-known messengers of spring, but this understory tree has other jobs, too - like providing food and shelter.\" The second image shows a mother deer and two fawns walking in high grasses labeled \"White-tailed Deer\" with the accompanying text \"White-tailed deer hide their fawns under the dogwood's low-hanging branches and feed on its tender shoots, buds, and later, berries.\" The third image shows a dark blue bird with black tail feathers labeled \"Indigo Bunting.\" The view from this overlook looks southeast.",

    "audioDescription": "The Marys Rock Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a black and white photograph taken of a group of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) \"boys\" as they paused in their work on the trail near Marys Rock. The narrow trail that curves around a bend in the trail has a abrupt 10-foot drop off held in place with an impressive hand-laid stone retaining wall. The text reads, \"Value Added - The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), created in the early 1930s by President Franklin Roosevelt, helped ease the sting of the Great Depression. It put young men to work in public lands like Shenandoah National Park, and taught them skills like carpentry, landscaping, and masonry. CCC boys built the retaining walls along the Appalachian Trail south to Marys Rock. Those walls, like CCC work all over Shenandoah, endure as handsome reminders of the program that provided a depression-plagued nation with food, shelter, and trade skills.\" The bottom left of the panel has a photograph of a trail through lush, green forest. Downed trees span the trail, with the section over the foot path removed. The remainder of the trees lie on either side of the trail. The text reads, \"Life Out of Death - On the Appalachian Trail north toward Pass Mountain, you will see lots of fallen trees, downed by storms, disease, or simply old age. Trail crews have removed the sections of the downed trees blocking the trail, but have left the debris beside the trail on purpose. Trail maintenance in the Park works toward preservation and regeneration: dead trees will provide habitat and food for wildlife and will eventually return to the ground as rich soil from which living things can draw life.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Marys Rock Summit and Pass Mountain Loop. The Marys Rock trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Marys Rock Summit - 3.7 mile round trip, moderate, 2.75 hours hiking time, 1,210-foot elevation gain. Take the short connector trail to the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) south. Look for double blazes, indicating a change in the trail; the A.T. will make some sharp turns. Continue to a trail post; go right to Marys Rock viewpoint. Return by retracing your steps, being careful at the trail post to go left, to take the A.T. north back to Panorama.\" \"Hike #2: Pass Mountain Loop - (This trail is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 3.4-mile circuit, moderate, 2.5 hours, 670-foot elevation gain. Take the short connector trail to the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) north. Cross U.S. 211. Continue for another tenth of a mile to Skyline Drive; cross the Drive. Go right onto Pass Mountain Hut Road. Stay on the fire road to Pass Mountain Hut. To return, near Pass Mountain Hut, look for the blue-blazed Pass Mountain Trail leading back to the A.T. south. Take the A.T. south back to Panorama, first crossing Skyline Drive, then U.S. 211, to the starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.\"",

    "audioDescription": "This overlook faces north. The view looks down over a line of trees to the Shenandoah Valley below and to the left. To the right are mountains in Shenandoah National Park, descending to the left toward the valley. The orientation shelter is a small roof supported by six brown beams. The beams are frames for six upright 36 inch by 54 inch posters in glass enclosures. Panel 1: Bulletin Board Bulletin boards contain seasonal information. Panel 2: Shenandoah Map. This graphic is divided into two columns, the left has text and images and the right has a map. On the right column, title text reads, \"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park.\" Below the title is a color photograph of a man standing atop a rock outcrop and looking to the mountains in the distance on a sunny day. Layered on the image is the quote \" for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty. Please observe the 35 mph speed limit to see it all safely. 75 Overlooks. Spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. 500 Miles of Trails - Beautiful waterfalls, quiet forests, and mountain summits are just a hike away. - Visitor Centers. Films, exhibits, and Ranger-led walks and talks tell Shenandoah's stories.\" The map to the right shows the boundaries of, driving route through, and highlights in Shenandoah National Park. The map area is 30 miles wide by 150 miles long. Shenandoah National Park is shaded green. Highlights include entrance stations, visitor centers, campgrounds, lodging, restrooms, food services, and trailheads. At the bottom of the map is the park emergency number: (800) 732-0911. At the top and bottom of the graphic are black bars. The black bar at the top has the text, \"Shenandoah National Park,\" to the left, and \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior,\" on the right with the National Park Service arrowhead logo to the far right. The lower black bar has the Leave No Trace logo on the left with the text \"Leave No Trace Principe #6, Respect Wildlife,\" and on the right the text \"www.nps.gov/shen.\" Panel 3: Spring/Summer Plants and Animals. The graphic is split into two horizontal sections with text and graphics in rectangles. The top section has the title, \"Spring\" with the subtitle \"Renewal.\" The rectangle is split vertically. The left side contains three color photographs with text descriptions. The first image is white flowers with four petals labeled \"Flowering Dogwood,\" and the accompanying text, \"Dogwood blossoms are well-known messengers of spring, but this understory tree has other jobs, too - like providing food and shelter.\" The second image shows a mother deer and two fawns walking in high grasses labeled \"White-tailed Deer\" with the accompanying text \"White-tailed deer hide their fawns under the dogwood's low-hanging branches and feed on its tender shoots, buds, and later, berries.\" The third image shows a dark blue bird with black tail feathers labeled \"Indigo Bunting,\" and the accompanying text \"Indigo buntings often build their nests in dogwood trees and line them with deer hair. Birds love the berries' high fat content, a great trade-off for the dogwood, since its seeds are spread by those who eat them, ensuring the dogwood's renewal.\" The right side of the top panel contains the text, \"From the moment the first plant pushes up through the forest floor beginning its annual growth cycle, spring is renewal. Hungry black bears come out of their dens with winter-born cubs. Migratory birds return, butterflies emerge, and wildflowers herald the season. Every life, new and old, depends on another.\" There are nine color photographs under this text arranged in a 3 by 3 square. From the top left they are: a bush with clumps of white flowers labeled \"Mountain Laurel,\" a butterfly with white and yellow markings and blue tips on the wings labeled \"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,\" round mounds of fungus growing out of the forest floor labeled \"Morel Mushrooms\" a small curled up salamander labeled \"Red-backed Salamander,\" a bird with yellow, black, and white markings labeled \"Chestnut-sided Warbler,\" a single white flower with three petals and large green leaves labeled \"Large-flowered Trillium,\" a light brown toad on the ground labeled \"Spring Pepper,\" a set of three yellow and red bell shaped flowers labeled \"Wild Columbine,\" and a bird with a white chest and tan head and wings labeled \"Red-eyed Vireo.\" The bottom section has the title \"Summer\" and the subtitle \"Abundance.\"",

The text reads, \"Apple of Their Eye - Apples were a cash crop for the people who lived in what is now Shenandoah National Park. Former residents raised different types of apples - some of which were actually created here - including the Milam, for which this gap is named. The Milam apple was probably developed in an orchard very near where you stand right now.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a black and white photograph of President Herbert Hoover fly-fishing in one of the mountain streams that ran through his property. The text reads, \"Fit for a President. The Park's clear mountain streams host a variety of fish species, including native eastern brook trout. Fly-fisherman and U.S. President Herbert Hoover chose a site two miles east of here, at the headwaters of the Rapidan River, for his weekend retreat because of its proximity to these streams and their trout. Rapidan Camp was built in 1929 and gave the 31st President the perfect place to practice his favorite pastime.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Rapidan Camp. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Mill Prong - Rapidan Camp. 4-mile round trip, moderate, 2.75 hours hiking time, 870-foot elevation gain, 3 stream crossings. Go left on the Appalachian Trail south, and cross Skyline Drive. Go left on the blue-blazed Mill Prong Trail. Turn right on Mill Prong Horse Trail.

Pet owners have the special responsibility of following the park regulations for pets. The challenging terrain and unique habitat of Old Rag mountain make this trail unsuitable and dangerous for pets. If you have a pet, we recommend Hike #2.\" Beginning the second column on the upper right is a 20 by 20 inch north-oriented topographic map with two recommended hikes highlighted, Hike #1 in yellow and Hike #2 in pink. The text below reads, Hike #1: Old Rag Summit, 9.2-mile circuit, very strenuous, 7-½ hours hiking time, 2,380-foot elevation gain. From the parking area, make a left onto Route 600. Pass the Nicholson Hollow Trailhead and continue to the Ridge Trail. Make a left and continue on the Ridge Trail, crossing the rock scramble to the summit. Be very careful as the footing along the Ridge Trail is challenging, especially in the rock scramble area. Descend from the summit on the Saddle Trail. Continue to follow this path as you pass Old Rag Shelter and the trail becomes a fire road. At the trail intersection, make a right and immediately turn right again to follow Weakley Hollow Fire Road. Continue on this fire road and stay straight on the intersection with Route 600 back to this location. Hike #2: Robertson Mountain, 7.8 mile circuit, strenuous, 6 -½ hours hiking time, 2,130-foot elevation gain. From the parking area, make a left onto Route 600. Pass the Nicholson Hollow Trailhead and continue straight on to the Weakley Hollow Fire Road. Take Weakley Hollow Fire Road to Robertson Mountain Trail. Follow the Robertson Mountain Trail to the summit and descend to the Old Rag Fire Road. Turn left onto Old Rag Fire Road and then another left onto Weakley Hollow Fire Road. Continue on this fire road and stay straight on the intersection with Route 600 back to this location. This hike includes one of the steepest sections of trails in the park, but it is a good alternative for hikers in good physical condition who want a pet-friendly hike with excellent views.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets are not allowed on the Ridge and Saddle Trails. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. - Do not attempt this hike in wet or icy conditions. Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour. Be sure you know your route.

In order to ensure your safety and make the most out of your hike, be sure that you understand the basics of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hiking-basics.htm\">hiking safety</a> before you set out on your adventure. Aside from these basics, there are a few more things that you need to know before hiking Old Rag:</p> <h4>Know Your Limits</h4> <p>Be sure that you are physically able to complete the hikes on Old Rag Mountain. Most hikes in this area are long, and there is significant elevation change with a strenuous rock scramble that requires good upper body strength. Often, children and shorter adults need assistance navigating the rock scramble.</p> <h4>Bring a Map</h4> <p>There are several different <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hikes-oldrag.htm\">ways to hike Old Rag</a>, so make sure that you pick the best route for you. Compare the different options and print or download the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/upload/OldRag_RoadTrail.pdf\">Old Rag trail map</a> so that you have it with you while you're hiking.</p> <h4>Pack Lightly</h4> <p>Although you need to be sure you have plenty of water and food, it is a good idea to pack as lightly as possible. Most hikers prefer fanny packs to backpacks, which can be difficult to maneuver through the rock scramble.</p> <h4>Avoid the Crowds</h4> <p>Planning your hike on a weekday will likely enhance your experience since Old Rag can become very crowded on weekends. At times, the parking lot will be full, and there can be long lines and substantial waits at some of the narrow rock scrambles. During periods of peak visitation (summer and fall), you may want to consider a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hikes-nocrowds.htm\">less-crowded hike</a>.</p> <h4>Leave Your Pets at Home</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Pets</a> are prohibited on the Ridge, Saddle, Ridge Access trails, and from Post Office Junction to Old Rag Shelter. </p> <h4>Know the Camping Regulations</h4> <p>Legal overnight camping sites are very limited in the Old Rag area as camping is prohibited above 2,800', so be sure to properly <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/backcountry-camping.htm\">plan your backcountry trip</a>.</p> <h4>Note the Numbers</h4> <p>You will notice numbers beneath the trail blazes on Old Rag. These are reference numbers for Search and Rescue personnel, so take note of the numbers as you pass them. If you need to report an incident, referring to the number you are closest to will help Park staff respond to you more quickly.</p> <h4>Tread Lightly</h4> <p>Old Rag is host to many rare and endangered plants that live in the rocky environment of the granite boulders. These plants are particularly susceptible to trampling, so please stay on the trail and observe all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/learn/nature/romp.htm#CP_JUMP_5704545\">rock outcrop management closure areas</a>.</p> <h4>Hiking Old Rag in the Winter</h4> <p>Be sure to carry microspikes or traction coil devices for your boots with you when you hike Old Rag. Even when it's perfectly clear in lower elevations, trails can be be icy and snow-covered during colder weather, and these devices can protect you from a nasty fall.</p> <h4>Parking</h4> <p>Although Old Rag Mountain is within the boundaries of Shenandoah National Park, most people approach it from the Park's eastern boundary, instead of from Skyline Drive. You are still required to pay an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">entrance fee</a>, but parking at the lots operated by the National Park Service is free. Landowners with property adjacent to the Park are charging a fee for parking on their property, but <strong>paying a private citizen to park does not exempt you from the Park entrance fee. </strong>Parking is prohibited along the road shoulders.</p> <h4>Directions</h4> <p><em>Do not rely exclusively on your mobile GPS, Google Maps, or similar automated navigation systems to get to the Old Rag parking area. Routes can be misleading and incorrect, and cell service is unreliable</em></p> <p><strong>Sperryville to Old Rag Parking:</strong> From Route 211, turn onto Route 522 and follow it south for 0.8 mile.

    "audioDescription": "The Overall Run Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph taken of a view of the vivid green of the Wilderness, the blue-green of the mountains, and the powder blue of the sky with a line of white clouds bisecting the tranquil scene. The text reads, \"Border Crossing: To reach Overall Run Falls, you cross an invisible boundary into Wilderness. You will find all the things you expect to see in the woods: green plants, elusive animals, and water tumbling free over rocks and roots. You won't find many things built by human hands, such as campgrounds and roads. This is by design: Wilderness is specially designated land that is kept free of development to always be wild and natural. Such designation protects the ecosystem and provides enjoyment for those who wish to enter. Wilderness's primeval character offers you physical and mental challenges, solitude, and refreshment.\" \"Standing on the ledge above Overall Run Falls, you are surrounded by Wilderness. You won't hear much of anything except for the roar of the falls, the croak of the raven, and a breeze in the leaves. You delight in the journey that brought you here and the simplicity of nature. This is the Wilderness experience.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of 2 hikes: one to Overall Run Falls. That trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Overall Run Falls; 6.1 mile round trip, moderately strenuous, 4.75 hours hiking time, 1,694-foot elevation gain. Follow the Appalachian Trail south. Turn right on Tuscarora-Overall Run Trail. Follow the trail to a rock viewpoint from which Overall Run Falls is visible. Retrace your steps to return to the starting point.\" \"Hike #2: (The shorter round trip trail is marked in purple on the map.) Appalachian Trail North: 0.5 mile round trip, easiest, 0.5 hour hiking time, 114-foot elevation gain. Leave the parking lot from the south end and follow the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) north across the Skyline Drive. Continue on the A.T. north to the vista. Retrace your steps to return to the starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. ~ Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per. Pets must be on a leash at all times.

    "audioDescription": "Turning off Skyline Drive, Panorama is a parking area next to a building. The building has a stone base, brown wood walls, and slanted roof. The building is split into two sections with the roof extending between the two creating a sheltered area. Inside are bathroom doors, water fountains, and bulletin boards with seasonal information. There is an orientation shelter between the entrance from Skyline Drive and the restrooms. The orientation shelter is a small roof supported by six brown beams. The beams are frames for six upright 36 inch by 54 inch posters in glass enclosures. Panel 1: Bulletin Board Bulletin boards contain seasonal information. Panel 2: Shenandoah Map This graphic is divided into two columns, the left has text and images and the right has a map. On the right column, title text reads, \"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park.\" Below the title is a color photograph of a man standing atop a rock outcrop and looking to the mountains in the distance on a sunny day. Layered on the image is the quote \" ...for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" -President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty. Please observe the 35 mph speed limit to see it all safely. - 75 Overlooks - Spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. - 500 Miles of Trails - Beautiful waterfalls, quiet forests, and mountain summits are just a hike away. - Visitor Centers - Films, exhibits, and Ranger-led walks and talks tell Shenandoah's stories. \"The map to the right shows the boundaries of, driving route through, and highlights in Shenandoah National Park. The map area is 30 miles wide by 150 miles long. Shenandoah National Park is shaded green. Highlights include entrance stations, visitor centers, campgrounds, lodging, restrooms, food services, and trailheads. At the bottom of the map is the park emergency number: (800) 732-0911. At the top and bottom of the graphic are black bars. The black bar at the top has the text, \"Shenandoah National Park,\" to the left, and \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior,\" on the right with the National Park Service arrowhead logo to the far right. The lower black bar has the Leave No Trace logo on the left with the text \"Leave No Trace Principe #6, Respect Wildlife,\" and on the right the text \"www.nps.gov/shen.\" Panel 3: Spring/Summer Plants and Animals The graphic is split into two horizontal sections with text and graphics in rectangles. The top section has the title, \"Spring\" with the subtitle \"Renewal.\" The rectangle is split vertically. The left side contains three color photographs with text descriptions. The first image is white flowers with four petals labeled \"Flowering Dogwood,\" and the accompanying text, \"Dogwood blossoms are well-known messengers of spring, but this understory tree has other jobs, too - like providing food and shelter.\" The second image shows a mother deer and two fawns walking in high grasses labeled \"White-tailed Deer\" with the accompanying text \"White-tailed deer hide their fawns under the dogwood's low-hanging branches and feed on its tender shoots, buds, and later, berries.\" The third image shows a dark blue bird with black tail feathers labeled \"Indigo Bunting,\" and the accompanying text \"Indigo buntings often build their nests in dogwood trees and line them with deer hair. Birds love the berries' high fat content, a great trade-off for the dogwood, since its seeds are spread by those who eat them, ensuring the dogwood's renewal.\" The right side of the top panel contains the text, \"From the moment the first plant pushes up through the forest floor beginning its annual growth cycle, spring is renewal. Hungry black bears come out of their dens with winter-born cubs. Migratory birds return, butterflies emerge, and wildflowers herald the season. Every life, new and old, depends on another.\" There are nine color photographs under this text arranged in a 3 by 3 square. From the top left they are: a bush with clumps of white flowers labeled \"Mountain Laurel,\" a butterfly with white and yellow markings and blue tips on the wings labeled \"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,\" round mounds of fungus growing out of the forest floor labeled \"Morel Mushrooms\" a small curled up salamander labeled \"Red-backed Salamander,\" a bird with yellow, black, and white markings labeled \"Chestnut-sided Warbler,\" a single white flower with three petals and large green leaves labeled \"Large-flowered Trillium,\" a light brown toad on the ground labeled \"Spring Pepper.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>Looking west from an elevation of 2,460 ft (749 m), Pass Mountain Overlook gives you the chance to glance over Kemp Hollow and Neighbor Mountain, into the town of Luray below. The town of Luray was officially established of February 6, 1812. There are multiple stories about how the town of Luray got its name, but it is most likely named in honor of Luray, France, the ancestral homeland of the town's founder, William Staige Marye.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This overlook faces west. On the right is Neighbor Mountain descending to Shenandoah Valley with Kemp Hollow between Neighbor Mountain and the overlook. To the left is the town of Luray in the Shenandoah Valley with the ridge of Massanutten Mountain spanning the horizon. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Pass Mountain Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The title text reads, \"Gaps in the Story.\" The body text reads, \"Imagine it's 1740. You're traveling west, and you've arrived at this point on Pass Mountain. You have to cross that next mountain on the other side of the valley, and there are no roads to guide you. Where will you cross? Most people would choose the gap, or low spot in the mountain, you see about 16 miles off in the distance. Called New Market Gap today, that natural passageway makes traveling from one side of the mountain to the other easier, faster, and cheaper, even today. Look at your Park map. How many gaps can you find in Shenandoah? Consider how many people have traveled across those places through the centuries.\" Below the text is a photograph of the Shenandoah Valley in the foreground, with the river weaving through the agricultural landscape, and the Blue Ridge Mountains of Shenandoah National Park in the distance. Layered on the image is the text \"You Are Here\" with an arrow pointing to a tiny notch in one of the mountains. Under the text is more text \"Looking back at Shenandoah National Park from New Market Gap (west), you can see the notch of Thornton Gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the first obstacle westward travelers had to overcome on their way from the east to the Shenandoah Valley and beyond.\" To the left is another text overlay at a low point between two mountains labeled with the text, \"Thornton Gap.\" To the right of the main text are two black and white images on a black transparent background. The title text, \"Travelers and Commerce,\" is above the images. The top image shows a road leading through a gap in the mountains accompanied by the text, \"To get to New Market Gap from here, travelers first crossed Thornton Gap, a half mile south of here. The old footpath became a road, and then a turnpike in the 1700s. Travelers paid a toll to use smooth roads free of mud and ruts.\" The lower image shows a large house by a road with old fashioned gas pumps in front accompanied by the text, \"Turnpike owners and local residents profited from travelers through inns, and later, filling stations. Travelers that stopped by Ramey's filling station on Rt. 211 in 1935 could purchase ten-cent ham sandwiches, drinks, ice, cider, and handmade baskets.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

The title reads \"Wild Freedom.\" Under the title is a quote that reads, \"... where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.' The Wilderness Act of 1964\" The body text reads, \"Welcome, visitor. What do you see? Wilderness stretches before you in an unbroken wave of green and gray, cradled by the craggy heights of Old Rag and bounded by civilization beyond. Although in appearance the land is the same color and shape as the mountainsides seen from other overlooks, this land is different. This is Wilderness, a place set apart from other natural places. The impact of modern man and technology is absent in Wilderness. You won't find buildings, developments, or machines here. And you, the visitor who does not remain, can experience nature in its purest form-unconstrained and primitive-and find opportunities for solitude, refreshment, or adventure.\" Next to the text, but on the same panel, is the shape of Shenandoah National Park with a white fill and bright yellow fill in some places. Under the shape there is a key with a yellow block text explaining that the yellow is \"Federally Designated Wilderness within Shenandoah National Park.\" Under this graphic there is the text, \"Wilderness is public land that is managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act. Wilderness must be primitive, natural, untrammeled, free of human elements, and unique. Nearly 40% (79,579 acres) of Shenandoah is Wilderness. Experience Wilderness from above at the overlooks, or find a trailhead and start walking.\" The panel to the right contains a photograph of a single person walking along a narrow trail in the woods on a sunny day. A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

From the left is Jenkins Mountain, Pickerel Ridge, Keyser Moutain closer to the foreground, Old Rag out in the distance, Stony Man Mountain out in the distance, Pass Mountain, Mount Marshall Overlook on Skyline Drive, and then Hogback Mountain. There are two interpretive signs at Range View Overlook. They are both 36 by 24 inch color graphic panels on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The left wayside's title reads, \"Come Back When You Have More Time.\" There is a quote under the title that reads, \"Park roads are for leisurely driving only. If you are in a hurry you might do well to take another route now, and come back when you have more time. From an early National Park Service brochure.\" The body text reads, \"This is no place to rush. Skyline Drive was planned and built to be a scenic highway- not just a way to get you from one place to another.\" Originally billed as Shenandoah's \"greatest single feature,\" the Drive's 35 mph speed limit is just right for safety and taking in the beauty of the Blue Ridge. Skyline Drive is both a marvel and a conundrum. It's easy to see why it's marvelous, for this is one of the prettiest scenic drives in the world. And sometimes there is oddness in beauty: because of the way the Drive twists and turns-part of its design-there are places where, even though you're in the northbound lane and driving to Front Royal, you're actually headed due south. \"To the right of the text is a gray box with two black and white photographs in it. The left photograph shows a man with surveying equipment standing in an area where the ground has been cleared with some trees surrounding him. This images is accompanied by the text, \"(Left) Highway engineers and surveyors used tools like the transit to help them decide on Skyline Drive's route through the Blue Ridge.\" The other photograph shows a picture of the mountains with a white line drawn over the image following the contour of the mountains with the accompanying text, \"(Above) Planning the Skyline Drive was not as simple as building a roadway across the backbone of the mountain. Landscape architects studied the proposed Drive from high-elevation points, so they could get an idea of how the Drive would look from scenic lookouts and summits.\" Behind the text there is a photograph from a high elevation looking down to mountains in the distance. The text accompanying this photograph reads, \"Range View Overlook provides a singular view of the Park: from here you can see numerous peaks stretched along the mountain range. Skyline Drive winds around them on its way south from Front Royal to Rockfish Gap.\" The right wayside's title reads, \"A Skyline Drive for a Bird's-Eye View.\" There is a quote under the title that reads, \"It is a wonderway over which the tourist will ride comfortably in his car while he is stirred by a view as exhilarating as the aviator may see from the plane. Senator Harry F. Byrd, Virginia.\" The body text reads, \"When construction began on Skyline Drive in 1931, NPS landscape architects were challenged to design a new kind of road. Skyline Drive would, \"lay lightly on the land,\" that is, roll across the mountain without major changes to the landscape. The scenic highway should also provide opportunities for recreation and the simple pleasure of enjoying the view. To accomplish this, civil engineers devised clever ways to build a scenic-yet-stable road in steep and rocky terrain. This careful attention to the driving experience means that you hardly notice the road as you travel along, taking in the grand vistas before gliding into green tunnels of trees. It all melds together into a smooth memory: road, car, and scenery.\" To the right of the text is a gray box with two black and white photographs in it. One photograph shows the retaining wall of Skyline Drive under construction with exposed logs on the exterior side of the wall separating the drive from the trees down a mountain slope. The second photograph shows a picture of a newly constructed Skyline Drive weaving through the mountains. The text under these images reads, \"Engineers used toe walls and gabion (retaining) walls to shape the backbone of the Drive. These engineering accomplishments are largely hidden now by the landscape, which has reclaimed the scars left by road-building machinery.\" Behind the text there is a photograph from a high elevation looking down to mountains in the distance. The text accompanying this photograph reads, \"As you travel along Shenandoah's Scenic Byway, notice how often you can see Skyline Drive peeking in and out from the trees, beckoning you to the next overlook. There are nearly 70 overlooks in all, each offering a different view of what's beyond.\" A black bar on the top of each of the graphics reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol.",

    "bodyText": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/learn/photosmultimedia/virtual-brown-house.htm\">Take a Virtual Tour </a><br /> <br /> Nestled deep in a hollow at the headwaters of the Rapidan River is a little piece of history: Rapidan Camp. This National Historic Landmark was the beautiful, rustic getaway of President Herbert Hoover and First Lady Lou Henry Hoover during their time in the White House. This restful spot provided the couple respite and rejuvenation throughout a tumultuous presidency and was the backdrop for historic meetings during one of our nation's most difficult times: the Great Depression. A visit to the exhibits at Rapidan Camp will reveal a different perspective of the First Couple and provide you with the same respite and rejuvenation prompted by the beauty and serenity of this special place.</p> <h4><strong>A National Historical Landmark</strong></h4> <p>Rapidan Camp earned the distinction of being named a National Historic Landmark in 1988 as \"Camp Hoover,\" the common name of the camp during the years it operated as a government retreat. The camp was deemed nationally significant because of its association with the Hoovers and their presidential administration. In addition to providing the president and his family respite during tumultuous times, the camp is also significant because of the important meetings, conversations, and decisions made here. Hoover said, \"I have discovered that even the work of government can be improved by leisurely discussions of its problems out under the trees where no bells or callers jar one's thoughts.\"</p> <h4><strong>Getting Here</strong></h4> <p>Rapidan Road, which lies across from Byrd Visitor Center (mile 51.2) and leads several miles down to Rapidan Camp, is closed to all private vehicles. There are still several options for visiting the camp, however:</p> <ul> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Ranger-led Tour</strong><br /> Starting with a shuttle ride from Byrd Visitor Center, Ranger-guided tours of Rapidan Camp include time inside both the Brown House and the Prime Minister's Cabin, as well as time exploring the grounds and gardens within this historic landmark. Tours are available by reservation only and are typically offered during the spring, summer, and fall. Visitors may <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/ticket/facility/251745?q=Rapidan%20Camp%20Tours\">book a reservation</a> up to 6 months in advance and up to 4 hours before the tour.</li> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Hiking</strong><br /> We recommend the 4-mile <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/rapidan-camp.htm\">Rapidan Camp hike</a> from the Milam Gap parking area, although you may also choose to do the longer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/mill-prong-laurel-prong.htm\">Mill Prong - Laurel Prong Loop hike</a>, or the Mill Prong Horse Trail that is down Rapidan Road and to the right.</li> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Horseback Riding</strong><br /> Rapidan Camp is also accessible with a horse, by riding down Rapidan Road from the Rapidan parking area (mile 51.3) and returning the same way. Please take the time to review our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/horseback_riding.htm\">horseback riding rules and best practices</a> before taking this trip.</li> </ul> <h4><strong>Getting Around</strong></h4> <p>Within Rapidan Camp, each building, existing and obliterated, is marked with a sign, and most of them are on the main path. You can peruse the exterior interpretive panels year-round. When caretakers are here, (typically during the spring, summer, and fall) you can visit the exhibits in the Brown House and Prime Minister's Cabin.<br /> <br /> The Brown House is historically refurnished to reflect the Hoover era. The Prime Minister's Cabin houses an interpretive exhibit about the Hoover's and their life at Rapidan. If you're up for a walk, follow the trail up to the site of Five Tents and/or take the President's Walk, a beautiful stroll along the creek to the sluice built to divert the natural Laurel Prong to feed the Marine-built Hemlock Run.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "There are two color graphic, interpretive panels at this location. An introductory panel begins with a quote from Herbert Hoover: \"Here is peace and quietude.\" A black and white historic photo of President and Mrs. Hoover is flanked by text: Shortly after his election in 1928, Herbert C. Hoover and his wife, Lou Henry expressed the desire for a weekend retreat--a place where they could find respite from the demands of Washington life and be rejuvenated by \"the blessings of nature.\" Here among the trees and trout streams they established their rustic summer camp. An historic photo of the main building at the camp almost hidden among trees is explained with text: In the years since the Hoovers left Washington, Rapidan has undergone many changes, the most drastic in the early 1960s when 10 of the 13 original buildings were removed. In 1928, a dense canopy of trees covered the area. A modern photo of the same building taken in fall shows the drastic change with a lack of trees and foliage. Text: The shade provided the much cooler temperatures the Hoovers sought in the days before air-conditioning. The canopy was dominated by old-growth Eastern Hemlocks that were killed by an invasive, exotic insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid. Shenandoah National Park is working to save the remaining few hemlocks and restore the character and beauty of the Hoover-era Rapidan Camp. A color photo of the interior of the president's cabin shows the historic refurnishing--a beige and white stripped love seat in front of windows with a rustic wooden table holding a tray of cookies and tea. A second photo shows a woman studying an exhibit panel. Text: Today, visitors can see an exhibit in the Prime Minister's cabin and tour the president's cabin as part of a Ranger Program. The Brown House has been restored and refurnished to capture the atmosphere created by Mrs. Hoover for their many guests. The Creel cabin serves as housing for volunteer overseers. A wide black band at the bottom of the panel contain 3 historic photos: the first shows four large white tents on platforms with small front porches, the second is a historic photo of a long wooden building with a large porch, and the third shows a close up of one of the tents. Text: The Hoovers' first night in camp was May 18, 1929. The presidential accommodations were five army tents on wooden floors. Despite later becoming a wood-sided building, the name \"Five Tents\" stuck. Mrs. Hoover's original plan called for \"good board flooring and a roof, a boarded strip extending up from the floor perhaps three or four feet, with sides comprised of canvas curtains that let up and down.\" However, the Hoovers quickly became fond of the camp and decided to make the \"tent village\" more permanent, replacing the canvas with board siding. By early August the Hoover were already using the camp for official meetings. Their precious retreat soon became an outdoor extension of the nation's capital. The second panel shows a hand-drawn map of the camp, color-coded to show the existing buildings in brown and the obliterated buildings in blue. Streams, paths, trails, and other structures are also shown. A wide black band shows the outline of each building with a short description: Five Tents in blue-the first structure built; fireplace still visible today. Ishbel in blue-guest cabin, named for the Prime Minister's daughter who visited. Town Hall and Quarters are also in blue. The Brown House in brown-Hoovers' residence, now historically refurnished. The Creel in brown-cabin used by Hoover's physician. Other locations in blue are Trails End-guest cabin, the Slums, Duty Office-used by Secret Service and Marines, the Mess Hall, the Owl-guest cabin. Other sites in brown are the fountain, the outdoor fireplace, and the Prime Minister's Cabin-guest cabin named for the British Prime Minister who visited; now houses exhibit Between the two signs is a metal plaque mounted on a large rock near the ground. The raised inscription reads: Camp Hoover has been designated a National Historic Landmark. This site possesses national significance in commemoration the history of the United States of America. 1988 National Park Service United States Department of the Interior.",

Boone said, \"I never saw him happier than when he was on the Rapidan.\"<br /> <br /> As part of the construction of naturalistic water features throughout the camp, the Marines built this trout pond. Reports of its actual use vary somewhat; some calling the trout in the pond \"pets,\" others reporting it as a place to keep the non-native Rainbow trout, and still others describing it as a holding tank for trout intended for dinner. However, many who wrote of the pond remember daily feedings of beef hearts, a fact borne out by household receipts.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The Milam Gap Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a black and white photograph of a man in bib overalls standing by a roadside fruit stand selling apples and apple cider. The text reads, \"Apple of Their Eye - Apples were a cash crop for the people who lived in what is now Shenandoah National Park. Former residents raised different types of apples - some of which were actually created here - including the Milam, for which this gap is named. The Milam apple was probably developed in an orchard very near where you stand right now.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel is a black and white photograph of President Herbert Hoover fly-fishing in one of the mountain streams that ran through his property. The text reads, \"Fit for a President. The Park's clear mountain streams host a variety of fish species, including native eastern brook trout. Fly-fisherman and U.S. President Herbert Hoover chose a site two miles east of here, at the headwaters of the Rapidan River, for his weekend retreat because of its proximity to these streams and their trout. Rapidan Camp was built in 1929 and gave the 31st President the perfect place to practice his favorite pastime.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Rapidan Camp. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Mill Prong - Rapidan Camp. 4-mile round trip, moderate, 2.75 hours hiking time, 870-foot elevation gain, 3 stream crossings. Go left on the Appalachian Trail south, and cross Skyline Drive. Go left on the blue-blazed Mill Prong Trail. Turn right on Mill Prong Horse Trail. Explore the camp, and then retrace your steps to Milam Gap parking.\" \"Hike #2: Appalachian Trail - Tanners Ridge. The trail is marked in purple with a dashed line. 2.1-mile round trip, easiest, 1.5 hours hiking time, 175-foot elevation gain. Go right on the Appalachian Trail north to Tanners Ridge Road. Return by the same route to the starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Do not attempt to cross streams in icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitors centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Stay on the trail and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. Leave what you find. Artifacts are protected by law. Filter or treat water from streams before drinking.

It is being constructed by a group of at least 5 men who are on the top of the platform and have accessed it via a wooden ladder. The text reads, \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. In the early 1930s, fire suppression was an important duty of the Civilian Conservation Corps crews stationed here. They built fire towers and manned them around the clock, scanning the horizon for any hint of smoke. Fire crews attacked whenever fire was detected, in an attempt to stop the destruction.\" \"Meanwhile, local residents continued to annually burn their blackberry patches and meadows. They knew that fire regenerates many plants and keeps unwanted plants from choking out others.\" \"Today, we know that both the CCC and the residents were doing the right thing. Unwanted fires caused by lightning or careless people can be destructive. But under the right conditions, fire can encourage healthy, diverse ecosystems. As you explore this area, you are likely to see evidence of past fires, both prescribed and wild.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike on the Wildcat Ridge Trail and Riprap Loop past Chimney Rock and Calvary Rocks. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hike: Hike: Riprap Loop. 9.8 mile circuit, very strenuous, 8.25 hours hiking time, 2,365-foot elevation gain, several stream crossings. You can hike this circuit clockwise or counter-clockwise. There's plenty to see and do either way: Straight on Wildcat Ridge Trail, right on Riprap Trail, right on Appalachian Trail (A.T.) south, and left back to the parking lot; or right on A.T. north, left on Riprap Trail; left on Wildcat Ridge Trail, and back to the parking lot.\" \"The section between the Riprap - Wildcat Ridge intersection and Chimney Rock is especially beautiful: lush forest, showy rhododendrons in season (late May), and a wonderful series of streams with cascades and an \"ole swimming hole\" that's legendary.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets must be on a leash at all times. Do not attempt to cross streams during icy conditions or flooding. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at entrance stations, visitor centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return. Filter or treat water from streams before drinking.\"",

A black sedan is at the building and a Ranger stands beside a stop sign near the car.<br />Text beneath: Rangers welcomed visitors to the southern entrance to Shenandoah from a small rustic building that stood in the median just across the southbound lane of Skyline Drive. The Rockfish Gap Entrance Station was built by the \"boys\" of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the newly established style of \"Parkitecture.\"<br />In the right third of the box there are a photo and a text block. The photo is a historic black and white photo of a rectangular building, small and rustic with wood siding and a shingle roof.<br />Text: \"Parkitecture\" combines native wood and stone with native styles to create visually appealing structures that fit naturally within their specific landscapes. The first Rockfish Entrance Station was side gabled and wood framed with board and batten exterior walls. The roof had fire-resistant concrete shingles, developed for the remote park buildings that were far from localities with fire departments.<br />Over the years, the requirements of entrance stations and the role of their Rangers have evolved. In 2010, the classic entrance station was removed and a new building was put into service about a mile south.",

    "audioDescription": "This overlook faces west-northwest. There is a narrow field with grasses that descends into a valley below with mountains rising up in the distance. From the left is Patterson Ridge. Behind Patterson Ridge is a long ridge that includes Lewis Mountain far in the distance and Rockytop Mountain to the right of Lewis. From the right is Loft Mountain. At the point that the descending slopes of Loft and Rocktop intersect you can see the Shenandoah Valley out to the horizon. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Rockytop Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The title text reads, \"Rekindling Nature.\" The body text reads, \"A wildfire swept over this mountain in 1986, burning 4,475 acres in seven days. While dramatic, it certainly wasn't tragic. Fire is nature's way of cleaning house. It keeps the forest healthy by burning leaf litter, dead wood, and even living plants. Fire removes shade-making, fire-intolerant plants from the understory, giving other species sun and space to grow on the forest floor. Many native Appalachian plants, like fire-tolerant oak trees and woodland wildflowers, would disappear without fire in the forest. Fire is as much a part of the ecosystem as rain and sun.\" The text is on top of two images that are blended together. On the lower left of the graphic is a close up image of a pinecone surrounded by burnt debris on the ground. Text accompanying this image reads, \"The table mountain pine depends on fire for regeneration. Fire's heat melts the pinecone resin, allowing the table mountain pine's seeds to drop and germinate on the nutrient-rich forest floor.\" To the right of the image is a photograph of a fireman in uniform surrounded by smoke. Text accompanying this image reads, \"National Park Service fire managers use fire as a tool to help native ecosystems flourish. Wildland firefighters sometimes set small fires deliberately, as controlled burns. Small, controlled fires prevent flammable materials from piling up and creating conditions for large fires-dangerous to firefighters and nearby communities. \"A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

    "audioDescription": "The view from this overlook looks southwest. The view is overgrown with dense vegetation for much of the year. To the right there is Sawmill Ridge, a higher ridge that moves further from the view as it descends to the valley below. Straight ahead is Sawmill Run, where there is a low point in the mountains. Further in the distance are ridges of the mountains with the Shenandoah Valley along the horizon. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Sawmill Run Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The title text reads, \"A Cumulative Tale.\" The body text reads, \"Azalea, blueberry, mountain laurel, black huckleberry, and trailing arbutus-these are all members of the Heath family, plants that thrive in acidic, otherwise infertile soils. Think the heathers of the British Isles and the cranberry bogs of New England. Also think Shenandoah National Park, specifically at Sawmill Run Overlook, where you are now. Notice the plants that thrive here. Now think geology. The underlying rock here- metamorphosed sandstone and siltstone-is rich in quartzite. Quartzite breaks down into soil that is quite acidic. Acidic soil helps these Heaths flourish. Geologic history affects soil type which affects what kinds of plants grow in that soil. Like the fairy tale house that Jack built, it's a cumulative tale-in this case a geologic and ecologic one.\" In the background there is a close up image of pine needles and branches. The caption for this image reads, \"The area around Sawmill Run Overlook is a dry, oak-chestnut forest, but it is also good habitat for pines like the table mountain pine, Virginia pine, and pitch pine.\" On the lower right of the graphic there is a transparent black box. The title text in this box reads, \"A Habitat of Their Own.\" The body text reads, \"Since everything in an ecosystem is affected by everything else in that ecosystem, even one plant would be missed. Leave everything as you find it, including the wildflowers and plants which depend on this particular habitat to grow. This area hosts several rare, acid-loving plants.\" Below this text are six images. From the left, there is an image of a brown, drooping flower-type plant labeled, \"Sweet pinesap,\" an image of a cluster of bright green petals with several pink petals labelled, \"Goat's rue,\" an image of a purple flower with one large petal labeled, \"Butterfly pea,\" an image of a vertical cluster of small, white flowers labeled, \"Slender ladies' tresses,\" an image of a round cluster of star-shaped light pink flowers labeled, \"Trailing arbutus,\" and lastly, an image of a yellowish, brownish butterfly with a grey body perched atop a leave labeled, \"Elfin butterfly.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

On the right column, title text reads, \"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park.\" Below the title is a color photograph of a man standing atop a rock outcrop and looking to the mountains in the distance on a sunny day. Layered on the image is the quote \"...for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" -President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty. Please observe the 35 mph speed limit to see it all safely. - 75 Overlooks - Spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. - 500 Miles of Trails - Beautiful waterfalls, quiet forests, and mountain summits are just a hike away. - Visitor Centers - Films, exhibits, and Ranger-led walks and talks tell Shenandoah's stories.\" The map to the right shows the boundaries of, driving route through, and highlights in Shenandoah National Park. The map area is 30 miles wide by 150 miles long. Shenandoah National Park is shaded green. Highlights include entrance stations, visitor centers, campgrounds, lodging, restrooms, food services, and trailheads. At the bottom of the map is the park emergency number: (800) 732-0911. At the top and bottom of the graphic are black bars. The black bar at the top has the text, \"Shenandoah National Park,\" to the left, and \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior,\" on the right with the National Park Service arrowhead logo to the far right.

Spring/Summer The graphic is split into two horizontal sections with text and graphics in rectangles. The top section has the title, \"Spring\" with the subtitle \"Renewal.\" The rectangle is split vertically. The left side contains three color photographs with text descriptions. The first image is white flowers with four petals labeled \"Flowering Dogwood,\" and the accompanying text, \"Dogwood blossoms are well-known messengers of spring, but this understory tree has other jobs, too - like providing food and shelter.\" The second image shows a mother deer and two fawns walking in high grasses labeled \"White-tailed Deer\" with the accompanying text \"White-tailed deer hide their fawns under the dogwood's low-hanging branches and feed on its tender shoots, buds, and later, berries.\" The third image shows a dark blue bird with black tail feathers labeled \"Indigo Bunting,\" and the accompanying text \"Indigo buntings often build their nests in dogwood trees and line them with deer hair. Birds love the berries' high fat content, a great trade-off for the dogwood, since its seeds are spread by those who eat them, ensuring the dogwood's renewal.\" The right side of the top panel contains the text, \"From the moment the first plant pushes up through the forest floor beginning its annual growth cycle, spring is renewal. Hungry black bears come out of their dens with winter-born cubs. Migratory birds return, butterflies emerge, and wildflowers herald the season. Every life, new and old, depends on another.\" There are nine color photographs under this text arranged in a 3 by 3 square. From the top left they are: a bush with clumps of white flowers labeled \"Mountain Laurel,\" a butterfly with white and yellow markings and blue tips on the wings labeled \"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,\" round mounds of fungus growing out of the forest floor labeled \"Morel Mushrooms\" a small curled up salamander labeled \"Red-backed Salamander,\" a bird with yellow, black, and white markings labeled \"Chestnut-sided Warbler,\" a single white flower with three petals and large green leaves labeled \"Large-flowered Trillium,\" a light brown toad on the ground labeled \"Spring Pepper,\" a set of three yellow and red bell shaped flowers labeled \"Wild Columbine,\" and a bird with a white chest and tan head and wings labeled \"Red-eyed Vireo.\" The bottom section has the title \"Summer\".",

Lee’s advance to the Confederate “high tide” at Gettysburg, the Virginia Military Institute Cadets’ valiant charge at New Market, and U.S. General Philip H.

You can also explore the spectacular natural beauty of the Valley via historic roadways, winding mountain roads, leisurely walking tours, or challenging hiking trails to spectacular overlooks.  And you can enjoy the wide variety of other experiences that the Valley has to offer: natural wonders, history and heritage sites, arts and culture, and dining and lodging in the Valley’s historic towns.<br /> <br /> In 1996, Congress designated eight counties (Augusta, Clark, Frederick, Highland, Page, Rockingham, Shenandoah, and Warren) in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia as the <a href=\"http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/\">Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District</a>. The purpose of this <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/heritageareas/index.htm\">National Heritage Area</a> is to preserve and interpret the region’s significant Civil War battlefields and related historic sites. That effort is led by the <strong>Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation</strong>, which works with partners to preserve the hallowed ground of the Valley’s Civil War battlefields, to share its Civil War story with the nation, and to encourage tourism and travel to the Valley’s Civil War sites.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District is home to the following NPS units:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cebe/index.htm\">Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historic Park</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm\">Shenandoah National Park</a></p> </li> </ul>",

    "audioDescription": "This overlook faces north. From the left is Signal Knob, a part of Massanutten Mountain. Straight down is the Shenandoah Valley and to the distance is a faint mountain ranger, the Range-and-Valley Appalachians, with West Virginia on the other side. Skyline High School is a larger building closer to the overlook. Toward the right is the town of Front Royal. There is an orientation exhibit at this overlook: The orientation shelter is a small roof supported by six brown beams. The beams are frames for six upright 36 inch by 54 inch panels in glass enclosures. Panel 1. Bulletin Board Bulletin boards contain seasonal information. Panel 2. Park Map This graphic is divided into two columns, the left has text and images and the right has a map. On the right column, title text reads, \"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park.\" Below the title is a color photograph of a man standing atop a rock outcrop and looking to the mountains in the distance on a sunny day. Layered on the image is the quote \"...for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" -President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty. Please observe the 35 mph speed limit to see it all safely. - 75 Overlooks - Spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. - 500 Miles of Trails - Beautiful waterfalls, quiet forests, and mountain summits are just a hike away. - Visitor Centers - Films, exhibits, and Ranger-led walks and talks tell Shenandoah's stories.\" The map to the right shows the boundaries of, driving route through, and highlights in Shenandoah National Park. The map area is 30 miles wide by 150 miles long. Shenandoah National Park is shaded green. Highlights include entrance stations, visitor centers, campgrounds, lodging, restrooms, food services, and trailheads. At the bottom of the map is the park emergency number: (800) 732-0911.

The black bar at the top has the text, \"Shenandoah National Park,\" to the left, and \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior,\" on the right with the National Park Service arrowhead logo to the far right. The lower black bar has the Leave No Trace logo on the left with the text \"Leave No Trace Principe #6, Respect Wildlife,\" and on the right the text \"www.nps.gov/shen.\" Panel 3. Spring/Summer The graphic is split into two horizontal sections with text and graphics in rectangles. The top section has the title, \"Spring\" with the subtitle \"Renewal.\" The rectangle is split vertically. The left side contains three color photographs with text descriptions. The first image is white flowers with four petals labeled \"Flowering Dogwood,\" and the accompanying text, \"Dogwood blossoms are well-known messengers of spring, but this understory tree has other jobs, too - like providing food and shelter.\" The second image shows a mother deer and two fawns walking in high grasses labeled \"White-tailed Deer\" with the accompanying text \"White-tailed deer hide their fawns under the dogwood's low-hanging branches and feed on its tender shoots, buds, and later, berries.\" The third image shows a dark blue bird with black tail feathers labeled \"Indigo Bunting,\" and the accompanying text \"Indigo buntings often build their nests in dogwood trees and line them with deer hair. Birds love the berries' high fat content, a great trade-off for the dogwood, since its seeds are spread by those who eat them, ensuring the dogwood's renewal.\" The right side of the top panel contains the text, \"From the moment the first plant pushes up through the forest floor beginning its annual growth cycle, spring is renewal. Hungry black bears come out of their dens with winter-born cubs. Migratory birds return, butterflies emerge, and wildflowers herald the season. Every life, new and old, depends on another.\" There are nine color photographs under this text arranged in a 3 by 3 square. From the top left they are: a bush with clumps of white flowers labeled \"Mountain Laurel,\" a butterfly with white and yellow markings and blue tips on the wings labeled \"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,\" round mounds of fungus growing out of the forest floor labeled \"Morel Mushrooms\" a small curled up salamander labeled \"Red-backed Salamander,\" a bird with yellow, black, and white markings labeled \"Chestnut-sided Warbler,\" a single white flower with three petals and large green leaves labeled \"Large-flowered Trillium,\" a light brown toad on the ground labeled \"Spring Pepper,\" a set of three yellow and red bell shaped flowers.",

    "audioDescription": "This overlook faces west-northwest across the Shenandoah Valley. From the left is Gimlet Ridge, descending to the valley floor. The Shenandoah River weaves through the landscape. Across the valley is the Massanutten Mountain Range that ends at Signal Knob, toward the right. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Signal Knob Overlook interpretive sign is a 48 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. The title text reads, \"No Park is an Island. The body text reads, \"Skyline Drive was conceived and built so that people could enjoy views of the rural Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. Indeed, the Valley looks like a folk art painting from up here-brush strokes of farms, homes, forests, and small businesses. Though the landscape you see from Signal Knob Overlook is mostly rural, it's less rural than it was 20, 30, 50 years ago. More houses have been built, and more businesses. This view is losing its folk art character. Shenandoah National Park is not an island. What happens outside its boundaries-expansion, industrialization, the building of cell phone towers-affects the park and views from Skyline Drive. Park management can make decisions on how to best protect and preserve the resources inside Shenandoah. But because many of the views from our overlooks and peaks lie in towns and cities outside Park boundaries, surrounding communities also have a role in protecting the Park's views. There is a delicate balance between development and preservation.\" In the background there is a photograph from a high elevation looking down to the Shenandoah Valley below and out to mountains in the distance. On the lower right there is a river weaving through the image with the label, \"South fork of Shenandoah River.\" Above the river there is a peak that is labeled, \"Signal Knob.\" On the right side of the photograph is the text, \"From this overlook you can see Signal Knob, the northernmost peak of Massanutten Mountain. Much of the Massanutten remains undeveloped because it too is public land, protected as part of the George Washington National Forest. You can also see the Shenandoah River flowing north to its confluence with the Potomac before emptying into the Chesapeake Bay.\" On the lower left of the graphic is a transparent black box. The title text of the box reads, \"A Landscape Forever Changing.\" To the right of the title are three photographs labeled with different years, taken from the same location. The first photograph is black and white and shows old cars in the overlook's parking lot with a view of farmland and the river below. This image is labeled \"1940,\" and accompanied by the text, \"The view from Signal Knob Overlook when the Drive was much newer was only dotted with development.\" The second image is a color photograph of the view with more human structures visible in the distance. This image is labeled, \"1965,\" and accompanied by the text, \"By 1965 visitors to Shenandoah could see the beginnings of construction and expansion in the Valley.\" The third image is also a color photograph and shows the view with even more cleared land. This image is labeled, \"1997\" and accompanied by the text, \"More houses and small businesses encroach upon the view.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

    "audioDescription": "Outdoors in front of a building a sign hangs from the roof with text \"Skyland Office.\" There are closed double doors with many glass panes. Through the panes is the registration area for Skyland visitors. There is a sidewalk leading up to the office. Just outside the registration building there is an orientation kiosk: The orientation shelter is a small roof supported by six brown beams. The beams are frames for six upright 36 inch by 54 inch posters in glass enclosures. Panel 1. Bulletin Board Bulletin boards contain seasonal information. Panel 2. Park Map. This graphic is divided into two columns, the left has text and images and the right has a map. On the right column, title text reads, \"Welcome to Shenandoah National Park.\" Below the title is a color photograph of a man standing atop a rock outcrop and looking to the mountains in the distance on a sunny day. Layered on the image is the quote ‘...for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" -President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty. Please observe the 35 mph speed limit to see it all safely. - 75 Overlooks - Spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. - 500 Miles of Trails - Beautiful waterfalls, quiet forests, and mountain summits are just a hike away. - Visitor Centers - Films, exhibits, and Ranger-led walks and talks tell Shenandoah's stories.\" The map to the right shows the boundaries of, driving route through, and highlights in Shenandoah National Park. The map area is 30 miles wide by 150 miles long. Shenandoah National Park is shaded green. Highlights include entrance stations, visitor centers, campgrounds, lodging, restrooms, food services, and trailheads. At the bottom of the map is the park emergency number: (800) 732-0911. At the top and bottom of the graphic are black bars. The black bar at the top has the text, \"Shenandoah National Park,\" to the left, and \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior,\" on the right with the National Park Service arrowhead logo to the far right. The lower black bar has the Leave No Trace logo on the left with the text \"Leave No Trace Principe #6, Respect Wildlife,\" and on the right the text \"www.nps.gov/shen.\" Panel 3. Spring/Summer. The graphic is split into two horizontal sections with text and graphics in rectangles. The top section has the title, \"Spring\" with the subtitle \"Renewal.\" The rectangle is split vertically. The left side contains three color photographs with text descriptions. The first image is white flowers with four petals labeled \"Flowering Dogwood,\" and the accompanying text, \"Dogwood blossoms are well-known messengers of spring, but this understory tree has other jobs, too - like providing food and shelter.\" The second image shows a mother deer and two fawns walking in high grasses labeled \"White-tailed Deer\" with the accompanying text \"White-tailed deer hide their fawns under the dogwood's low-hanging branches and feed on its tender shoots, buds, and later, berries.\" The third image shows a dark blue bird with black tail feathers labeled \"Indigo Bunting,\" and the accompanying text \"Indigo buntings often build their nests in dogwood trees and line them with deer hair. Birds love the berries' high fat content, a great trade-off for the dogwood, since its seeds are spread by those who eat them, ensuring the dogwood's renewal.\" The right side of the top panel contains the text, \"From the moment the first plant pushes up through the forest floor beginning its annual growth cycle, spring is renewal. Hungry black bears come out of their dens with winter-born cubs. Migratory birds return, butterflies emerge, and wildflowers herald the season. Every life, new and old, depends on another.\" There are nine color photographs under this text arranged in a 3 by 3 square. From the top left they are: a bush with clumps of white flowers labeled \"Mountain Laurel,\" a butterfly with white and yellow markings and blue tips on the wings labeled \"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,\" round mounds of fungus growing out of the forest floor labeled \"Morel Mushrooms\" a small curled up salamander labeled \"Red-backed Salamander,\" a bird with yellow, black, and white markings labeled \"Chestnut-sided Warbler,\" a single white flower with three petals and large green leaves labeled \"Large-flowered Trillium,\" a light brown toad on the ground labeled \"Spring Pepper,\" a set of three yellow and red bell shaped flowers labeled \"Wild Columbine,\" and a bird with a white chest and tan head and wings.",

    "audioDescription": "The Fox Hollow Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a photograph of a single purple periwinkle blossom amid glossy green leaves. The text reads, \"Home: Before this part of Virginia was called Shenandoah National Park, people lived here and called it home. This land is where they got their sustenance, made their living, raised their families, and buried their dead. You can still see evidence of former human habitation throughout the Park, including here in Fox Hollow. The daffodils and periwinkle you see are gone-wild descendants of plants nurtured by them; the cemetery, too, reminds us that they were here.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel shows 3 tombstones from the Fox family cemetery. The stone in the center of the picture reads, \"Gertrude Fox, Died June 22, 1904, Aged 21 Years\". That stone has been broken near its base and is lying on an angle among the green ground cover. The text reads, \"They Still Speak - There are more than 100 family cemeteries in Shenandoah. Some are still maintained by the descendants of those buried there and some are not. The cemeteries that are not as well maintained might surprise hikers who come across the weathered tombstones in the Park's backcountry. Whether or not they are kept up and taken care of, these cemeteries speak gently to us of the people who made their lives in the hollows and on the ridges of what is now Shenandoah National Park.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hikes to Fox Hollow Trail and Snead Farm Loop. The Fox Hollow Trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Fox Hollow Trail, 1.2 mile circuit, easiest, .75 hours hiking time, 310-foot elevation gain. Turn left onto Dickey Ridge Trail, then right onto Fox Hollow Trail. Stay on Fox Hollow Trail - past rock piles and the Fox family cemetery - back to the starting point.\" \"Hike #2: Snead Farm Loop, (This hike is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 3.7 mile circuit, moderate, 2.5 hours hiking time, 580-foot elevation gain. Go right onto the Dickey Ridge Trail. Go left on the Snead Farm Road, which will take you to Snead Barn. Continue on the Snead Farm Loop Trail to its intersection with the Dickey Ridge Trail. Turn right and follow it back to your starting point.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Pets are not allowed on Fox Hollow Trail. Where allowed, pets must be on a leash at all times. Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Take plenty of water - at least a quart per hour Be sure you know your route.

In 1989 Shenandoah first tried to bring endangered peregrine falcons-once permanent residents-back to this part of the Appalachians. Young birds were released from several spots, in hopes that some would return to the Park to live. So you might find this once-endangered bird of prey soaring over Stony Man!\" The photograph on the bottom left of the panel is a view of the Passamaquoddy Trail showing a large rock outcropping, the lush mountain foliage, and a portion of the Valley to the west. The text reads, \"Abounding in Pollock' - Passamaquoddy Trail meanders under Stony Man Cliffs, past alluring geology and, in winter, amazing drapery-like ice formations. George Pollock had the trail built in 1932 and so named it because, he said, Passamaquoddy' is a Maine Indian word for abounding in Pollock' (a kind of fish)-and more or less after himself, since it's not likely there were any fish on this streamless trail!\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Stony Man. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Stony Man Trail - 1.6-mile lariat, easiest, 1 hour hiking time, 340-foot elevation gain.

It's not.\" -The Lorax, Dr. Seuss. Below the title is the text, \"Every living thing is affected by what's in the air. To protect and improve air quality, it's vital to know what's in the air, how it got there, and how it affects plants, animals, and humans. The Big Meadows air quality station does exactly that. This equipment collects data on weather, visibility, ozone levels, and pollutants in the air. Scientists across the nation use the data to advise protection agencies and lawmakers about regulations that will help reduce pollution and protect the air we breathe. This monitoring station has been providing data for 30 years, giving scientists some of the most valuable information available about trends in air quality over time. The data shows that when strong regulations are in place, the quality of air improves. Cleaner air means cleaner water, healthier lives for plants, animals, and humans, and more beautiful views from the peaks and overlooks of Shenandoah. Learn more about air quality monitoring and what you can do at Byrd Visitor Center, or visit out website: www.nps.gov/shen.\" To the right of the text is a large color photograph with three color photographs below it. The large image shows a view over mountains and out to a valley in three different days with decreasing visibility and haze over the valley. The text below this image reads, \"Spectacular views in Shenandoah's overlooks and mountains draw visitors from around the world. Protecting the views is part of the responsibility of being a national park. Scientists estimate that without pollution you could see 115 miles. But these days, increased haze limits your view to just 23 miles on average. Clear days are a rare treat, with moderate days being the norm. A string of hot, humid days can produce poor visibility that obscures even the closest range. Below, the first image is a photograph of a single green leaf with small spots on it. A caption reads, \"Among national parks, Shenandoah experiences some of the highest ground-level ozone. One of the first signs of damage appears as brown spots on milkweed leaves.\" The second image is a photograph of a waterfall cascading over rocks and into the stream below with the caption, \"Acid rain pollutes our streams and endangers fragile aquatic life. What appear to be clear mountain streams can be lethal to the acid-sensitive fish that live here.\" The third image is a close up photograph of one of the scientific instruments at the air quality station. The caption reads, \"Each piece of equipment collects information that helps scientists understand and fight for what's needed to protect Shenandoah's vital resources. You can help!\" At the bottom of the poster is the note, \"Funded in part by the Shenandoah National Park Trust.\"",

    "audioDescription": "The Piney River Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54-inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a black and white photograph of one of the original Civilian Conservation Corps buildings. The foreground is a 1930s era pick-up truck. The text reads, \"Camp Red Bird - The Piney River area was home to NP-12, \"Camp Red Bird,\" of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a work-relief program during the Great Depression. From 1935 to 1942, the camp housed hundreds of young men who learned skills, earned much-needed money, and helped build Shenandoah National Park. The building to your right is one of the few remaining original CCC buildings.\" The photograph on the bottom left is a black and white historic picture of Range View Cabin with a man sitting on a stump just beyond the overhang of the shelter. The text reads, \"Range View Cabin - Just down the trail is Range View Cabin, one of six cabins operated by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC). With the exception of the stonework, PATC volunteers built the cabin in 1932. The club hired local stonemason, Charlie Sisk, whose skills were also frequently used at Skyland.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20-inch topographic map of the hikes at Piney River. The trail to Range View Cabin is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Range View Cabin - 1.8-mile round trip, easiest, 1-¼ hours hiking time, 150-foot elevation gain. Follow the Piney Branch Trail to your left. At the junction with the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) turn right to head south. Turn left onto the Range View Service Road and follow this road to the cabin. Retrace your steps to return to the parking lot.\" \"Hike #2 - Sugarloaf Loop - (This trail is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 4.9-mile circuit, moderate, 3-½ hours hiking time, 956-foot elevation gain. Follow the Piney Branch Trail to your left. At the junction with the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) stay left to follow the Piney Branch Trail for another 1.5 miles. Turn left onto the Pole Bridge Link Trail and follow this trail for .4 miles to the Sugarloaf Trail. Turn left onto the Sugarloaf Trail and continue for 1.4 miles to the intersection with the A.T. Make a left to head south on the A.T. for 1.2 miles to the intersection with the Piney River Branch Trail. Turn right to return to this parking area.\" \"Exploring Further. This trailhead also leads to a network of many trails and former road traces. If you are not familiar with the area, you should get a map. See the opposite side of this kiosk for a detailed map of the Mathews Arm and Overall Run Falls area.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need. The text reads, \"Emergency 1-800-732-0911 (cell phone service is unreliable.) Before You Go! Be sure you are physically able to complete the hike you've chosen. Be sure you know your route. Free maps are available at Entrance Stations, Visitor Centers, and www.nps.gov/shen. Take plenty of water-at least a quart per hour. Pets must be on a leash no longer than six feet. When you return from your hike, check for ticks. Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect your return.\"",

Layered on the image is the quote \" â€˜...for the recreation and the re-creation they shall find here.\" -President Franklin Roosevelt, Shenandoah's Dedication.\" Text below the image reads, \"Shenandoah National Park was established in 1935 to bring the western national park experience to the urban east. Here, within a few hours' drive of millions, you will find \"recreation and re-creation.\" Experience the wonder of nature, the power of shared heritage, and the inspiration that is the future of our national parks.\" Below there is the subheading \"Shenandoah Highlights,\" and the text \"- Skyline Drive - 105 miles of beauty. Please observe the 35 mph speed limit to see it all safely. - 75 Overlooks - Spectacular views of the Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont. - 500 Miles of Trails - Beautiful waterfalls, quiet forests, and mountain summits are just a hike away. - Visitor Centers - Films, exhibits, and Ranger-led walks and talks tell Shenandoah's stories.\"The map to the right shows the boundaries of, driving route through, and highlights in Shenandoah National Park.

Spring/SummerThe graphic is split into two horizontal sections with text and graphics in rectangles. The top section has the title, \"Spring\" with the subtitle \"Renewal.\" The rectangle is split vertically. The left side contains three color photographs with text descriptions. The first image is white flowers with four petals labeled \"Flowering Dogwood,\" and the accompanying text, \"Dogwood blossoms are well-known messengers of spring, but this understory tree has other jobs, too - like providing food and shelter.\" The second image shows a mother deer and two fawns walking in high grasses labeled \"White-tailed Deer\" with the accompanying text \"White-tailed deer hide their fawns under the dogwood's low-hanging branches and feed on its tender shoots, buds, and later, berries.\" The third image shows a dark blue bird with black tail feathers labeled \"Indigo Bunting,\" and the accompanying text \"Indigo buntings often build their nests in dogwood trees and line them with deer hair. Birds love the berries' high fat content, a great trade-off for the dogwood, since its seeds are spread by those who eat them, ensuring the dogwood's renewal.\" The right side of the top panel contains the text, \"From the moment the first plant pushes up through the forest floor beginning its annual growth cycle, spring is renewal. Hungry black bears come out of their dens with winter-born cubs. Migratory birds return, butterflies emerge, and wildflowers herald the season. Every life, new and old, depends on another.\" There are nine color photographs under this text arranged in a 3 by 3 square. From the top left they are: a bush with clumps of white flowers labeled \"Mountain Laurel,\" a butterfly with white and yellow markings and blue tips on the wings labeled \"Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,\" round mounds of fungus growing out of the forest floor labeled \"Morel Mushrooms\" a small curled up salamander labeled \"Red-backed Salamander,\" a bird with yellow, black, and white markings labeled \"Chestnut-sided Warbler,\" a single white flower with three petals and large green leaves labeled \"Large-flowered Trillium,\" a light brown toad on the ground labeled \"Spring Pepper,\" a set of three yellow and red bell shaped flowers labeled \"Wild Columbine,\" and a bird with a white chest and tan head and wings labeled \"Red-eyed Vineo.\" The bottom section has the title \"Summer\" and the subtitle \"Abundance.\"",

You can easily add a bit of joy to your day right here at The Point Overlook. Notice the break in the stone wall and the steps leading to a path. The path takes you just beyond the trees you see ahead to a large boulder just perfect for sitting and contemplating the horizon. It's a beautiful view! Along with the pleasure of a leisurely ride on Skyline drive, Shenandoah's many gifts include numerous \"leg stretcher\" trails-short walks to beautiful vistas or cool streams. Ask for recommendations at a visitor center and add a little joy to your pleasure.\" Behind the text is a photograph of a man sitting atop a rock outcrop looking over the landscape to the mountains beyond. A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>Thornton Gap was named for Francis Thornton (1711-April 14, 1749), owner of the land to the east and the \"F.T. Valley.\" In 1740, he built a mansion in the Piedmont region near Nethers in Rappahannock County. The privately-owned Thornton's Gap Turnpike Company was formed to build a road over the mountains at Thornton's Gap. The toll road opened in 1806.<br> <br> During the Civil War, the Great Valley of Virginia was known as the \"breadbasket of the Confederacy\" and so was the scene of intensive military action and much destruction. But the Blue Ridge Mountains witnessed only limited military actions and few depredations as the contending armies merely passed through on their way to larger confrontations.<br> <br> Thornton was one of many passageways that led across the Blue Ridge. Two others were the Gordonsville Turnpike that crossed the Blue Ridge at Fishers Gap and Swift Run Gap Turnpike that crossed at Swift Run Gap. But when Skyline Drive was completed in the 1930s, the National Park Service chose to limit vehicular access to the mountaintop and closed the many roads that crossed the ridge. Today, many of these historic routes are maintained as fire roads or provide limited access for administrative purposes.<br> <br> Prior to the building of Skyline Drive by the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) during the Great Depression, the lost town of Beahm was located at Thornton Gap.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "This overlook faces east across a field to a line of trees. Above the trees are mountains in the distance. From the left the mountains visible are North Marshall, The Peak, Fork Mountain, and Oventop Mountain. Straight ahead, when two hills create a v-shape is Thornton Hollow. There is an interpretive sign at this overlook. The Thornton Hollow Overlook interpretive sign is a 36 by 24 inch color graphic panel on a dark metal frame angled towards the viewer. This graphic is split horizontally in two. The upper portion displays the title text, \"The Many Moods of an Overlook,\" with the quote below, \" â€˜No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.' Heraclitus of Ephesus, Greek philosopher.\" Behind this text is an image from an overlook of the sun rising over the mountains in the distance. The rays of the sun cover the landscape with warm fall colors. The lower portion of the graphic is layered on a warm gray transparent background. The body text reads, \"Changes in seasons, time of day, light, weather, and temperature - all of these changes and more affect what you see when you gaze out from any viewpoint in Shenandoah. You could stand in the exact same spot at different times of the year or at different times of day and never see the same thing twice. It's similar to how colored glass beads inside a kaleidoscope can never land in precisely the same arrangement twice; a view can never repeat itself because there will never again be the same combination of sunlight, humidity, temperature, precipitation, or fog there is in the one moment you stand here and take your picture, mental or real, of the landscape below.\" To the right of the text is a collage of six color photographs with thin white borders of the same overlook at different times of year and times of day. From the upper left is, a spring day with color staring to sprout on a tree in the foreground and yellow flowers popping up, a winter day with some snow on the ground and bare trees, a sunrise with fog forming an ocean on the mountains, a lush summer day with green everywhere, and lower, a sunset in winter with a deed red sun and dark mountains, and finally a fall sunrise with a pale colored sky and neutral autumn colors in the mountains. To the side of these images is the caption, \"One of the main reasons for creating Shenandoah National Park and Skyline Drive was so that you, the visitor, could take in scenic views and marvel at the landscapes spread out below you. Skyline Drive has nearly 70 overlooks and it leads to starting-off points for hikes to peaks and summits, all of which offer dramatic vistas.\" A black bar on the top of the graphic reads \"Shenandoah National Park\" on the left and on the right is the National Park Service Arrowhead symbol with the text \"National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior\"",

This image is followed by the subtitle, \"Gushing Over Waterfalls\" with text underneath \"If you want to see some waterfalls, you have come to the right place. Whiteoak Canyon boasts not one, not two, but a whole series of waterfalls and cascades! They range in height from 35 to 86 feet. Whiteoak Canyon's steep gorge and sheer rock walls make the perfect home for the rush of the trail's pools and cascades. Want even more waterfalls? Head on up the Cedar Run trail to see another three waterfalls gently flowing into deep green pools.\" Below this are two vertical images, one of a foggy path surrounded by trees, the other of a tall waterfalls surrounded by lush green vegetation. Another subtitle reads, \"A Trail for All Seasons.\" The text below reads, \"Each season brings a new level of appreciation for the waterfalls in Whiteoak Canyon. Springtime ushers in a canyon that is overflowing with an abundance of rushing water. In the summer, the cool, clear water offers relief from the season's heat. In autumn, the waterfalls make for a vivid backdrop to the canyon's spectacular foliage. In the winter, the falls form frozen cascades of ice that are suspended in air. And the waterfalls only tell a portion of this trail's annual story. Depending upon the season, Whiteoak Canyon is also home to an abundance of wildflowers, migrating butterflies, lush, moss-covered cliffs, and shy winter residents like bobcats and crayfish. No matter when you visit, there is so much to see and appreciate in White Oak Canyon!\" Beginning the second column on the upper right is a 20\"x20\" topographic map oriented west. There is one trail highlighted in yellow on the map. Below the maps is the title \"Suggested Hike\" with the following text, \"Hike: Whiteoak Falls 6.0-mile round trip, moderately strenuous, 4Â½ hours hiking time, 1600-foot elevation gain. Begin at Whiteoak Falls Trail and keep right at the intersection with Cedar Run Trail. Continue on past a series of falls and cascades.

    "audioDescription": "The Whiteoak Canyon Trailhead panel is a 36 by 54 inch color poster. On the upper left of the panel is a black and white historic photograph of a group of more than 30 early Skyland Resort visitors taken near the head of the falls. The text reads, \"A Popular Playground - The waterfalls of Whiteoak Canyon may well be the reason that Shenandoah National Park even exists. Long before this area was a national park, it was a popular playground for the early visitors to Skyland Lodge. There was even a lodge in the area near the first falls complete with a bridge, a dam, a swimming pool, and bath houses! Fortunately, White Oak Canyon has returned at least partially to its natural state, but remnants of the lodge can still be seen in the stone staircase between the first and second waterfalls.\" The picture on the bottom left of the panel shows a hiker on a large boulder overlooking the cascading stream. The text reads, \"A Walk on the Wild Side - White Oak Canyon is home to impressive waterfalls and cascades that range in height from 35 to 86 feet. As you make your way toward the falls, be sure to take in the rugged and wild scene unfolding before you. The canyon's steep gorge and sheer rock walls soar upward from the water while the falls start as a trickle and build into a rush of water that tumbles into the pools below.\" The top right of the panel is a 20 by 20 inch topographic map of the hike to Whiteoak Canyon. The trail is marked in yellow with a brown dashed line. The text reads, \"Suggested Hikes: Hike #1: Upper White Oak Falls - 4.6-mile round trip, moderate, 3Â½ hour hiking time, 1,040 foot elevation gain. Follow the White Oak Canyon Trail and stay on this trail as you pass the junctions for the Old Rag Fire Road and the Limberlost Trail. About 2.3 miles from the start you will come to a rocky ledge that offers an excellent view of the upper falls. Retrace your steps to return to the parking lot. Remember that the return trip will be very steep.\" \"Hike #2: White Oak Canyon - (This trail is marked in purple with a dashed line.) 7.3-mile round trip, strenuous, 6 hours hiking time, 2,150 foot elevation gain. Please consider your physical condition and available time before embarking on this hike. Follow the White Oak Canyon Trail past the upper falls for another 1.3 miles down the canyon to the lower falls. Return via the same route. The trail on this section is narrow, rocky, and steep.\" A red text box below the map gives important information that hikers need.

Mostly level or with a slight incline. Generally less than 3 miles. Moderate - A moderate hike generally suitable for novice hikers seeking a bit of a challenge. The terrain will involve a moderate incline and may have some steeper sections. Generally 3 to 5 miles. Moderately Strenuous - Generally challenging for an unconditioned person. The terrain will involve a steady and often steep incline. Generally 5 to 8 miles. Strenuous - Will challenge most hikers. The hike will generally be longer and steeper, but may be deemed strenuous because of the elevation gain. Generally 7 to 10 miles. Very Strenuous. Only well-conditioned and well-prepared hikers should attempt. Generally long and steep, and may include rock scrambling, stream crossings, and other challenging terrain. Generally 8 miles and over.\"",

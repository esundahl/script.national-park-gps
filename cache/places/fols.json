    "bodyText": "<h2>Enlisted Barracks</h2> <p>The two barracks buildings, completed in 1867, were designed to hold two companies each of enlisted men. They were divided in half and each side had a squad room, first sergeant's room, mess hall and kitchen. The average company size was 80 men, so quarters were definitely cramped. Four men slept on each bunk, two on each level lying head to foot. The first sergeant, the company's senior enlisted man, got a room to himself. <br /> <br /> There was no central mess hall on post for the soldiers. Soldiers ate with other men of their company in the barracks mess hall. The army didn't have trained cooks, so the job rotated among the men in the company as an extra duty. This meant the quality of the food preparation depended on how well each man could cook. <br /> <br /> In this building, the left (west) side has been restored as infantry barracks, the right (east) side as the post hospital. The east side had originally been for a cavalry company but when the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/10th-cavalry-at-fort-larned.htm\">10th Cavalry</a> left in 1869 it was converted into a new Post Hospital in 1872.   </p> <h2>Hospital </h2> <p>The new <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fort-larned-post-hospital.htm\">post hospital</a> in the east half of the barracks building was a big improvement over the former adobe hospital building that leaked mud from the ceiling when it rained. Even with a solid roof overhead, medical care was crude by today's standards, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Army doctors were some of the best trained and qualified doctors in the country, but they were still limited by the medical knowledge of the day. There were few medicines at the time to cure people and doctors had very little understanding of how diseases spread. Still, the doctors stationed at Fort Larned did the best they could to heal the soldiers under their care.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Enlisted Barracks and Post Hospital 649 words The Enlisted Barracks and the Post Hospital are in the second of the two barracks building on the north side of the Parade Ground. It is a one-story sandstone block building facing the Parade Ground. The building is 172 feet long with an 11-foot-deep wood porch running the length of the building. The porch roof is an extension of the building roof and is supported by 18 white square wood columns, nine feet apart. The building has a gable roof covered with brown wood shingles. There are five brick chimneys and two white square wooden cupolas covering ventilation shafts across the ridge line at the top of the roof. From left to right are three chimneys, a ventilation cupola, a chimney, a ventilation cupola, and a chimney. The chimneys are between 30 and 40 feet apart across the top of the roof. The first ventilation cupola is between the third and fourth chimney, the second one is between the fourth and fifth chimney. The first and last chimney are two feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has 10 windows and three doors with both the window frames and the doors painted white. From the left as you face the building are: three windows, a double doorway, four windows, a double doorway, two windows, a single doorway, and one window. The windows are five feet tall by three feet wide. The double doorways are eight and a half feet tall by four and a half feet wide and are recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. The doors are six and a half feet tall by four feet wide. There is a row of five glass panes, one foot high by eight inches wide, above both sets of double doors. The glass panes are recessed one foot from the front of the doorway. The single doorway is eight and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide and is recessed one foot from the front of the building. The door is six and a half feet tall by three feet wide. There is a row of two glass panes, one foot tall by eight inches wide above the door. The glass panes are recessed one foot from the front of the doorway. The windows and doors are spaced eight to ten feet apart across the front of the building with the first and last windows six feet from their respective ends of the building. The porch is six inches above the ground. Wheelchairs can access the porch from the west end where an eleven-foot wide, 16-foot-long brown asphalt path, parallel to the main Parade Ground path, connects the porches of the two barracks buildings. The path slopes down gently to ground level from the east end of the Visitor Center porch, then gently back up to the west end of the Barracks/Hospital porch. The porch is level with the doorway, allowing for wheelchair access into the building. The two double doorways are open, the single doorway is closed and is not used as a public entrance. The first doorway on the left leads into the restored barracks area of the building, which is furnished to represent the enlisted men's quarters in an Indian Wars-era frontier fort. It has a squad room, first sergeant's room, mess hall and kitchen. The squad room, first sergeant's room and kitchen are not accessible to the public and are blocked by plexiglass barriers. The next doorway, near the center of the building, leads into the restored hospital area of the building, which is furnished to represent the fort's hospital. There are a surgeon's office and operating room, storage area and attendant's sleeping quarters, two hospital wards, and a kitchen and mess hall. Only the two hospital wards are accessible to the public, the other rooms are blocked by plexiglass barriers. End of description.",

A typical company's officers included two lieutenants and one captain. As such, each of the one-story buildings housed two captains and four lieutenants. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4cd17922-46fb-4c45-bd1f-b6debd7b3e58}{188}\" paraid=\"1812212979\">The captain’s quarters were on each end of the building. They had two rooms and a kitchen, which extended out from the back of the building. Lieutenants had one room each with no kitchen until 1870. At that time, wooden lean-to structures were added at the back of each building to give the lieutenants kitchens and servant space. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "North Officers’ Quarters 889 words The North Officers' Quarters is a one-story sandstone block building 84 feet long, facing the Parade Ground with eight windows and two doors in the front. From the left as you face the building are: two windows, a single-entry doorway, four windows, a single-entry doorway, and two windows. The windows are six and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide, the single doorways are eight and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The doors are seven and a half feet tall by three feet wide and recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. The window frames and doors are painted white. At the top of each door is a row of four windowpanes, one foot tall by eight inches wide, recessed one foot from the front of the door. The windows have 17-inch-wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame the windows on each side. The windows and doors are five feet apart, with the first and last windows three feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has a gable roof covered with wood shingles. There are three brick chimneys spaced 38 feet apart with the first and last chimney about two feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has a 10-foot-deep wood porch running its entire length. The porch roof is separate from the building roof, extending out from just beneath the building's roof line. The roof is covered with wood shingles and is supported by 13 white square wood columns, just over seven feet apart. The porch is two feet above the ground and accessible by two eight-foot-wide sets of three steps without railings, one set on each side of the porch in front of the two doorways. There is a three-foot-high wooden railing around the porch with spindles three inches apart between the top and bottom rails. The railing and spindles are both painted white. A four-foot-wide, seven-foot-long wood walkway leads from the boardwalk in front of the house to the steps on both sides of the porch through a four-foot-wide opening in the railing. Inside are the restored officers' quarters with housing for one captain and two lieutenants on each side of the building. Each side has a six-foot-wide central hallway with two doorways on each side of the hall, and a door at the end of the hallway opposite the front door. All the interior doors are seven and half feet tall by three feet wide. The back door has a row of two glass panes, nine inches high and one foot wide, above the door. The glass panes are flush with the front of the door. The doors and doorframes are painted brown. Each door is two feet wide with an eight-inch frame around it. The doors are recessed 6 inches from the front of the interior wall. The doors are 11 feet apart and each door is five feet from their respective ends of the hallway. None of the interior rooms are open to the public and are blocked by plexiglass barriers. On both ends of the building a third room extends out 21 feet past the back door of the hallway with a seven-and-a-half-foot-wide wooden porch extending out to the end of the extension. The porch is approximately six inches above the ground. The porch roof is an extension of the building roof and is supported by four square wooden columns nine and a half feet apart. There is a brick chimney on the ridge line in the center of the extension’s roof. This extension has two windows and a door. From left to right as you face the porch are a window, the door, and another window. The windows are five feet high by three feet wide and the doorway is seven and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The door is six and a half feet high by three feet wide and is recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. There is a row of three glass panes above the window, eight inches high and ten inches wide. The glass panes are flush with the door. The door and window frames are painted white. The windows have 17-inch-wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame both sides of the windows. The door and windows are spaced approximately four and a half feet apart with the first window four and a half feet from the end of the extension and the second window four and a half feet from the back wall of the main building. This building is wheelchair accessible through the back doors. Follow the boardwalk around to the north side of the building until it meets a gravel and dirt path extending from the main path on the north side of the parade ground. This will lead you to a path behind Officers' Row, 160 feet from where the boardwalk meets the path to the back of Officers' Row. Once on the path behind Officers' Row there is a six-foot-wide opening in the back of the fence approximately 53 feet from the northwest corner of the fence. A six-and-a-half-foot wide gravel and dirt path leads from the fence to the back porch of the captain's quarters' extension. End of description.",

The majority, approximately 70 percent, died from such illnesses as cholera, typhoid fever, gonorrhea and dysentery. The rest died from accidents in and around the fort.</p> <p>Along with the soldiers, about 40 civilians who died at or near the fort between 1859 and 1872 were also buried there.  Fort Larned also served as an Indian Agency, and as a result of an unfortunate incident, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/little-heart.htm\">there is one Indian buried in the post cemetery</a>. <br /> <br /> Also in the cemetery is a single brown pointed obelisk that stands taller than the other headstones. This monument, made of native stone, was placed in the cemetery in 1867 by soldiers of the 3rd U.S. Infantry stationed here at that time. The inscription reads:  “J.B. MacIntyre Col. USA Died at Fort Larned Kansas, May 9 1867. Was one of the officers, of Extra Duty, Maintained the Honor of his Country G. [Gallantly] the Days of the Recent Rebellion”</p> <p>Following the fort’s closing in 1878, the military bodies were exhumed and reburied at the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery in 1888.</p> <p>On September 19, 2009, those soldiers who were reburied at the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery were recognized. A bronze monument was dedicated in Section B with the names of 62 soldiers, giving them recognition for their service. The identities of three soldiers still remain unknown.<br />  </p>",

There would have been wagons coming and going, and men outside working on various projects, none of which were suitable activities to be carried out on the parade ground.</p> <h2>Bakery</h2> <p>All frontier military posts needed a bakery to supply the soldiers with their daily ration of bread. Each soldier got one loaf of bread per day, along with other food items such as beef, bacon, coffee, beans and condiments like salt, sugar and vinegar.<br /> <br /> The bakery operated seven days a week with a chief baker on duty at all times. He would be assisted by either soldiers assigned to the duty or civilians contracted for the job. At the height of the fort's operation there were an average of 275 soldiers stationed at Fort Larned, meaning the chief baker and his assistants baked at least that many loaves of bread per day.</p> <h2>Saddlery, Carpentry & Wheelwright Shop</h2> <p>The saddler was responsible for repairing, or making, anything made of leather. This included repairs to leather equipment for cavalry horses, the horses and mules who pulled wagons, as well as the leather equipment used by soldiers. He also made leather items such as looped cartridge belts, or dispatch cases.  </p> <p>The carpenter and wheelwright took care of all woodwork and wagon repair for the post. The carpenter was responsible for all lumber repair work, built and repaired wagon wheels and wagon boxes, as well as any other work with wood. The wheelwright maintained the wagons, and as the post sail maker, repaired the wagon covers and army tents.</p> <h2>Blacksmith Shop</h2> <p>A blacksmith shop was essential for any frontier military post. This shop had two forges and all the equipment a blacksmith needed to do his job properly. Fort Larned had two main blacksmiths with several apprentices/helpers. Extra help, if needed, came from enlisted men brought in for extra pay.</p> <p>The post blacksmith was a civilian contractor who worked for the Quartermaster Department. His job was to repair or manufacture any hardware needed at the post. He was also responsible for wagon repairs, which was usually the biggest part of his job. At a large post blacksmiths could specialize. At a small post like Fort Larned, the blacksmith was a generalist who had to be able to do a lot of different jobs.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Shops Building 865 words The Shops Buildings is the first building on the left as you face the east side of the Parade Ground. It is a one-story sandstone block building, 84 feet long. The front of the building faces away from the Parade Ground and the back faces the Parade Ground. The building has a gable roof covered with brown wood shingles. There are three chimneys spaced unevenly across the ridge line at the top of the roof. The first and third chimney are both two feet from their perspective ends of the building; the middle chimney is about eight feet to the left of the center of the roof. Since this building faces away from the parade the back of the building is presented first as you approach it. The back of the building has eight windows, six feet tall by three feet wide with white painted window frames. The windows are spaced between seven and nine feet apart across the back of the building with the first and last windows seven feet from their respective ends of the building. In the front of the Shops Building, the roof extends 10 feet out in front of the building and is supported by 10 white, square wood columns, nine feet apart. The ground in front of the building is dirt. The front of the building has three windows and four doors, with both the window frames and the doors painted white. From the left as you face the building are: a window, a double doorway, a window, another double doorway, a single doorway, a window, and another single doorway. The windows are four feet tall by three feet wide. The double doors are six and a half feet tall by eight feet wide, and the single doors are six and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The doors are all recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. Both the doors and the window frames are painted white. The doors and windows are unevenly spaced across the front of the building with the single doorway on the right almost 14 feet from the end of the building and the window on the left just five feet from the end of the building. There is also a chimney on the front, sloping part of the roof that is three feet from the left end of the building, 10 feet from the ridge line at the top of the roof and 13 feet from the lower edge of the roof. All the doors are level with the ground, allowing for wheelchair access into the building. The single doorway on the right end of the building is open, the next single doorway is closed and is not used as a public entrance. The double doorways in the middle and on the left end are both open. The first single door on the right leads into the restored bakery, which is furnished as a bakery for an 1860s army post. It has a bake oven, storage room for the baked bread, a bedroom for the baker, and a work area for preparing the dough. The double doorway in the middle leads into the restored saddler, carpenter and wheelwright workshop, which is furnished as a multi-use work room with work benches and tools. There is also a restored 1870's army ambulance to the left as you enter the building. The ambulance is painted yellow and has a small Red Cross symbol in the middle of the side facing the entry area. The back/workroom area is not accessible to the public and is blocked by three-foot-high wooden barrier eight feet from the door. The barrier extends out 10 feet from the north wall where it turns towards the east wall, extending back just over four feet until it meets the end of the open left door, which forms the remaining barrier on the south side. The end of the door is locked to the end of the barrier with a latch and padlock. A five-foot high plexiglass barrier is mounted on top of both sides of the barrier. The double doorway on the left end of the building leads into the restored blacksmith shop, which is furnished as an 1860's post blacksmith shop. It has two forges on the south side, and various blacksmith tools in the rest of the shop. The back/workroom area of the room is not accessible to the public and is blocked by a four-and-a-half-foot high U-shaped wooden barrier, painted black. Both the left and right sides of the barrier start four feet from the east wall on either side of the doorway, extending into the building until they intersect with another section, just under seven feet from the doorway. The space between the doorway and the start of the barrier on both sides is blocked by the open doors. The ends of the doors are locked to the ends of the barrier by a latch and padlock. The left side of the barrier has a five and a half foot tall, three-foot-wide plexiglass barrier framed by wood extending from the top. End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Just as the barracks were designed with four companies in mind, the company officers' quarters were also designed to house four companies' worth of officers. A typical company's officers included two lieutenants and one captain. As such, each of the one-story buildings housed two captains and four lieutenants.<br /> <br /> The captain’s quarters were at the ends of the buildings and had two rooms, a kitchen, and servant’s room. Lieutenants had one room each with no kitchen until 1870. At that time, wooden lean-to structures were added at the back of each building to give the lieutenants kitchens and servant space.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "South Officers' Quarters 834 words The South Officers' Quarters is a one-story sandstone block building 84 feet long, facing the Parade Ground. It has eight windows and two doors in the front. From the left as you face the building are: two windows, a single entry doorway, four windows, a single entry doorway, and two windows. The windows are six and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide, the single doorways are eight and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The doors are seven and a half feet tall by three feet wide. The window frames and doors are painted white. The doors are recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. At the top of each door is a row of four window panes, one foot tall by eight inches wide. The glass panes are flush with the front of the door. The windows have 17 inch wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame the windows on each side. The windows and doors are spaced five feet apart, with the first and last windows three feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has a gable roof covered with wood shingles. There are three brick chimneys spaced 38 feet apart with the first and last chimney about two feet from their respective ends of the their buildings. The building has a 10 foot deep wood porch running its entire length. The porch has a low, sloped hip roof, separate from the building roof and extending out from just beneath the building's roof line. The roof is covered with wood shingles and is supported by 13 white square wood columns, just over seven feet apart. The porch is two feet above the ground and accessible by two eight foot wide sets of three steps without railings, one set on each side of the porch in front of the two doorways. There is a three foot high wooden railing around the porch with spindles three inches apart between the top and bottom rails. The railing and spindles are both painted white. A four foot wide, seven foot long wood walkway leads from the boardwalk in front of the house to the steps on both sides of the porch through a four foot wide opening in the railing. Inside are the restored officers' quarters with housing for one captain and two lieutenants on each side of the building. Each side has a six foot wide central hallway with two doorways on each side of the hall, and a door at the end of the hallway opposite the front door. All the interior doors are seven and half feet tall by three feet wide. The back door has a row of two glass panes, nine inches high and one foot wide, above the door. The glass panes are flush with the front of the door. The doors and doorframes are painted brown. Each door is two feet wide with an eight inch frame around it. The doors are recessed 6 inches from the front of the interior wall. The doors are 11 feet apart and each door is five feet from their respective ends of the hallway. None of the interior rooms are open to the public and are blocked by plexiglass barriers. On both ends of the building a third room extends out 21 feet past the back door of the hallway with a seven and a half foot wide wooden porch extending out to the end of the extension. The porch is approximately six inches above the ground. The porch roof is an extension of the building roof and is supported by four square wooden columns nine and a half feet apart. There is a brick chimney on the ridge line in the center of the extension’s roof. This extension has two windows and a door. From left to right as you face the porch are a window, the door, and another window. The windows are five feet high by three feet wide and the doorway is seven and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The door is six and a half feet high by three feet wide and is recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. There is a row of three glass panes above the window, eight inches high and ten inches wide. The glass panes are flush with the door. The door and window frames are painted white. The windows have 17 inch wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame both sides of the windows. The door and windows are spaced approximately four and a half feet apart with the first window four and a half feet from the end of the extension and the second window four and a half feet from the back wall of the main building. There is no wheelchair ramp so the building is not wheelchair accessible. End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<h4>11 - Fort Larned Sutlers' Complex</h4> <p>The post sutler was a merchant or trader licensed by the Army to sell goods on military land. They were an important part of fort life, providing goods and services not available to soldiers through the regular army supply system. Soldiers and officers could get such things as food, clothing, tobacco, and personal items from the sutler's store. <br /> <br /> Army regulations provided for one sutler per post so the trader who got the license had, in effect, a captive market. However, there were restrictions imposed by the Army for this privilege.  They were supervised by a post Council of Administration, which assessed a fee every few months  of several cents for each officer and enlisted man on the post. The Council also determined  “the quantity and kind of clothing, small equipment, or soldiers’ necessaries, groceries, etc.” the sutler had to have available for sale.  In order to keep soldiers from overspending their meager pay, the sutler was not allowed to extend credit to a soldier for over half of his monthly salary.  He also could not sell alcohol to them without the permission of their officers.<br /> <br /> Due to a mix up, Fort Larned had two posts sutlers for several years. The two areas circled on the picture indicate the location of each sutler's operation. The red frame building to the west is where the original sutler's store was located. The building is a reconstruction of the sutler's quarters. The store itself was a sandstone building constructed in 1863. Where you are standing is the site of the second sutler's store. This second complex had a restaurant, general store, recreation hall, billiards, and a one-lane bowling alley for military and civilians.<br />  </p>",

A grassroots network of willing partners, volunteers, and locations serve as the Freedom’s Frontier Board of Trustees, the coordinating entity for the heritage area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{245}\" paraid=\"8\">Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area has a distinct landscape of rivers, hills, valleys, soils, and vegetation. In the 1800s, before the nation expanded across the continent, the western border of Missouri was the American frontier. To its west, Kansas was known as a permanent Indian Territory for both the Plains Indians and other tribes who were forcibly sent to the region following decades of land disputes. Since river travel ended at the Kansas border, this area became a major jumping-off point for pioneers heading west on extensive networks of trails. Traders, miners, and emigrants secured necessities and purchased provisions, and prepared for long overland treks.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{251}\" paraid=\"9\">In 1854, political tensions between Missouri and Kansas resulted in a violent border war as the Kansas territory sought statehood and debated the legality of slavery. At the time, Missouri was a slave state, and the issue of Kansas entering the Union as a potential “free state” ignited years of turmoil. The violent conflict between slavery proponents and abolitionists in the war known as “Bleeding Kansas” (or “Border War”) focused national attention on Kansas sovereignty and territorial law. This was one of the nation's most widely debated political crises in the years leading up to the Civil War. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed in 1854 left the territory's future status in the hands of settlers. The struggle for freedom was at the forefront of the Border War, and in the Civil War that followed. Although the Fugitive Slave Law made assisting runaway slaves a hanging offense in Kansas Territory, abolitionists continued to help slaves escaping from Missouri by the Underground Railroad.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{16}\" paraid=\"10\">After the Civil War, hundreds of African Americans came to settle in Kansas as part of the \"Exoduster Movement\" in the 1870s. Through the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, African Americans in both states continued the struggle for freedom from inequality and segregation during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights eras. One of the heritage area’s most well-known civil rights stories is found in the landmark Supreme Court case known as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas which ended legal racial segregation in public schools in 1954. Today, Freedom’s Frontier National Heritage Area continues to advocate for equal freedoms for all Americans.  Visit, explore and learn about the nation’s enduring legacy and struggle for freedom through the shared stories of courage, conflict, and hope for reconciliation as told across their broad landscape.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{69}\"

McFerran, 1865. </p> </blockquote> <p>One of the most important roles for any frontier fort is amassing and securing the supplies that kept the Army functioning, including food, ammunition, and clothing. The army had to be able to supply itself in order to maintain a permanent presence on the plains. To that end, the first sandstone buildings completed at Fort Larned after the blockhouse was finished were made to store food, ammunition, and supplies. <br /> <br /> Fort Larned has three warehouses - the Old Commissary, the Quartermaster Storehouse, and the New Commissary. The first two warehouses were built in 1866 and 1867, this warehouse was added in 1868 to accommodate the additional supplies needed when the fort's troop levels surged to their highest. <br /> <br /> The New Commissary was the last sandstone building completed at the fort since troop levels continued to go down over the next decade. As the need for storage space declined, the New Commissary was turned into a multipurpose building, including the post library and schoolroom.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "New Commissary & Post School 383 words The New Commissary and Post School is the second building as you face the east side of the Parade Ground. It is a one-story sandstone block building, 80 feet long, facing the Parade Ground. The building has three windows and two single doorways, with both the window frames and doors painted white. From the left as you face the building are: a single doorway, three windows, and single doorway. The first doorway is two feet above the ground and is at the top of three four-foot-wide stairs without a railing. The bottom step is the extended end of a four-by-four-foot square platform five inches off the ground that the other steps are mounted on. The second doorway is three feet above the ground at the top of four four-foot-wide steps. The bottom step is the extension of a four by four foot square wooden platform five inches off the ground that the other steps are mounted on. The doors are six and a half feet tall by four and a half feet wide and are both recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. The two doors are about eight feet from their respective ends of the building. The windows in between the doors are approximately 16 feet apart with the first window on the left about four feet from the door, and the last window on the right about six feet from the door. The building has a gable roof covered with wood tiles. There are two brick chimneys and a ventilation cupola across the ridge line at the top of the roof. From the left to right are: a chimney, a ventilation cupola, and a chimney. The first chimney is about two feet from the left side of the building, the second chimney is 18 feet from the right side of the building; the cupola is in the middle of the building. The only part of the building open to the public is the room on the left side, accessed by the steps to the single door. It has been restored as the post schoolhouse and is furnished with tables for students, a desk for the teacher, a chalkboard and bookcases. There are no ramps available for wheelchair access to this building. End of description.",

As troop levels went up the fort needed a better place to store food supplies. This building would serve as the Commissary Warehouse until the fort closed in 1878. <br /> <br /> Both \"issue\" and \"non-issue\" food supplies were stored here. The enlisted soldiers didn't pay for their food but were \"issued\" daily rations instead. Officers were given a food allowance and could purchase \"non-issue\" items at cost. A Commissary Officer was responsible for keeping track of all the supplies in the warehouse. He was assisted by several clerks, usually enlisted men who were assigned to the duty. </p> <h2>Arsenal </h2> <p>Although the main purpose of this building was food storage, as soon as it was completed in 1866 the west end was used to store ammunition. It wasn't a safe place to store the ammunition, but the fort didn't have a proper magazine, and it was better than the blockhouse, which had a leaky roof. <br /> <br /> Weapons, rounds of ammunition, and gunpowder were stored in the Arsenal. These included cartridges, for both the infantry and cavalry stationed here, as well as rounds and accouterments for the artillery. Ammunition would be stored in this building until 1872 when the old adobe hospital was converted to magazine. An Ordnance Sergeant supervised this area.</p> <p> </p>",

It's a one-story sandstone block building, 154 feet long, facing the Parade Ground. It has 12 windows and three doorways, with both window frames and doors painted white. From the left as you face the building are: two windows, a double doorway, four windows, a double doorway, four windows, a double doorway, and two windows. The windows are seven feet tall by three and a half feet wide, the doors are six and a half feet tall by four and a half feet wide. All the doors are recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. The windows extend from just below the roof line to just above the bottom of the building. The windows and doors are spaced six feet apart across the front of the building with the first and last window about six feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has a gable roof covered with wood shingles. There are two brick chimneys and three square white wooden ventilation cupolas across the top ridge line of the roof. From left to right are: a ventilation cupola, a chimney, a ventilation cupola, a chimney, and a ventilation cupola. The chimneys and the cupolas are spaced approximately 21 feet apart with the first and last cupola 23 feet from their respective ends of the building. All the doors are level with the ground and are wheelchair accessible. The first set of double doors on the left are closed and this section of the building is not open to the public. The second and third set of double doors are open. Inside the second doorway is the restored Commissary area, which is furnished with barrels and shelves of reproduction food items behind a three and a half foot tall, two-foot-deep L-shaped wooden counter to the front and right of door as you enter. The counter is 12 feet from the door and just over 11 feet from the wall on your left as you enter. To the left of the entryway is an office with the doorway blocked by a plexiglass barrier. Inside the third doorway is the restored arsenal area, furnished to look like an army arsenal. There are two reproduction Mountain Howitzer artillery pieces in the back left area of the room. On the right are boxes of ammunition for rifles stacked on the floor, as if being stored there for use by the soldiers when needed. There is a 14-foot-wide wooden addition on the east end of the building. It has a sloping shed-style roof covered in wooden shingles. The roof slopes from a height of sixteen feet where it's level with the stone building's roof line down to a height of nine feet on the east side of the addition. It has one door, six feet tall by three feet wide, a little to the right of center in the front. This addition is not open to the public. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Post Commander's Quarters 562 words The Post Commander's Quarters is a one-and-a-half-story sandstone block house 51 feet wide, facing the Parade Ground. It has four windows and one door in the front. From the left as you face the building are: two windows, a single-entry doorway, and two windows. The windows are six and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide, the single doorway is ten and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The door is seven and a half feet tall by three feet wide. The door is recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. There are four narrow windowpanes, six inches tall by two inches wide, on each side of the door and a row of five windowpanes, two feet tall by five inches wide above the door. The glass panes are flush with the front of the door. The windows have 17-inch-wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame the windows on each side. The window frames, windowpanes, and door are all painted white. The building has a gable roof covered with wood shingles. There are two square brick chimneys on the ridge line at the top of the roof on either end of the building. Both chimneys are two feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has an 18 by 10-foot porch centered in the front of the building. The porch has a low, sloped hip roof, separate from the building roof and extending out from just beneath the building's roof line. The roof is covered with wood shingles and is supported by six white square wood columns, seven feet apart. The porch is two feet above the ground and accessible by an eight-foot-wide set of three steps without railings in the center of the porch. There is a three-foot-high wooden railing around the porch with spindles three inches apart between the top and bottom rail. The top and bottom rails are painted white, the spindles are painted green to match the shutters. A four-foot-wide, seven-foot-long walkway leads from the boardwalk in front of the house to the steps from a four-foot-wide opening in the white railing in the front. The half story is on the left side of the building, which is 54 feet long, with four windows on the ground level and two windows on an upper half-story level. The ground level windows are six feet tall by three and a half feet wide; the upper story windows are four and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The window frames and windowpanes are painted white; none of these windows have shutters. Facing the left side of the building, from right to left, the first lower story window is 21 feet from front of the building, the other three windows are approximately 5 feet apart with the last window four feet from the back of the building. The two upper story windows are four and a half feet directly above the last two lower story windows. There is a third chimney at the back of the house, two feet from the back edge of the roof on the left side of the building. This building is not open to the public because the interior has not been restored to its historic appearance. The opening through the railing is roped off. End of description.",

Fort Larned National Historic Site protects a small area of grassland, offering a window into this now radically altered ecosystem.</p> <p>Today, mule deer and white-tail deer are the only hoofed mammals still here. You can still find many small mammals, though. Fox squirrels, thirteen-lined ground squirrels, prairie dogs, pocket gophers, beavers, skunks, raccoons, opossums, coyotes, muskrats, weasels, and badgers all make their home here. Occasionally, you might even see an armadillo in the northern extreme of their range.</p> <p>Several species of reptiles may also be found at Fort Larned like lizards, toads, turtles, bullsnakes, blue racers, hog-nosed snakes, and garter snakes.<br /> <br /> The nature trail’s variety of habitats provide for numerous species of birds such as hawks, orioles, kingbirds, blue jays, and red-headed woodpeckers, among many others. Fort Larned is located on the Central Flyway, a major bird migration corridor. White-fronted geese, sandhill cranes, and many other species pass over Fort Larned during spring and fall migrations.</p> <p>Dozens of species of grasses, forbs, and shrubs constitute the plant life of the grasslands, providing food and shelter for animals as well as impressive wildflower displays.</p> <p>Cottonwood trees, dependent on the water available in the river, line the banks of the Pawnee Fork. Historic photos show far fewer trees than today, largely because the trees were susceptible to naturally-occurring prairie fires and were also used for fuel.<br />  </p>",

The first window is approximately 18 feet from the left end of the building, the next window, double doorway and three windows beyond that are approximately 18 feet apart. The fifth window, single door and sixth window are approximately seven and a half feet apart. The sixth window is seven and half feet from the right end of the building. The building has a gable roof covered with wood shingles. There are three square wood ventilation cupolas, painted white, and one brick chimney across the ridge line at the top of the roof. From left to right are the three cupolas and then the brick chimney. The cupolas are about 30 feet apart and the chimney is 25 feet from the third cupola. Both the chimney and the first cupola are 25 feet from their respective ends of the building. The one double doorway in the front of the building is at ground level and is wheelchair accessible. The doorway leads into the warehouse portion of the building, which takes up the east three quarters of the building. The warehouse is partially stocked with reproduction boxes, barrels and other items that might be used on a frontier fort. They are not in display cases but set out as if you are entering a real warehouse. The issue room is in the west quarter of the building, accessible by a single doorway on the west side of the building. To get to the Issue Room doorway, turn left at the west end of the building and proceed down a five-foot wide, 22-foot-long wooden walkway to a single doorway. The doorway is level with the walkway and is wheelchair accessible. This end of the building is 40 feet wide with two windows and the single doorway, with both the window frames and door painted white. The two windows are on either side of the doorway. The windows are five and a half feet tall by three feet wide, the door is six and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The door is recessed a foot from the front of the exterior wall. The windows and door are spaced approximately seven and half feet apart with the windows seven and a half feet from their respective ends of the building. Inside is the restored issue room with a three-and-a-half-foot high counter, two and a half feet deep. The counter is 22 feet long and spans the width of the room; it's eight and a half feet from the door. There are two windows on the south wall, five feet high by three feet wide. One is on the west side of the counter, the other is on the east side of the counter. There are shelves on the three walls behind the counter with items that would have been issued to Army personnel. A doorway on the back wall, opposite the entrance doorway leads into the warehouse. On the left, just past the counter is a doorway to an office. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "South Officers' Quarters 803 words The South Officers' Quarters is a one-story sandstone block building 84 feet long, facing the Parade Ground. It has eight windows and two doors in the front. From the left as you face the building are: two windows, a single-entry doorway, four windows, a single-entry doorway, and two windows. The windows are six and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide, the single doorways are eight and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The doors are seven and a half feet tall by three feet wide. The window frames and doors are painted white. The doors are recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. At the top of each door is a row of four windowpanes, one foot tall by eight inches wide. The glass panes are flush with the front of the door. The windows have 17-inch-wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame the windows on each side. The windows and doors are spaced five feet apart, with the first and last windows three feet from their respective ends of the building. The building has a gable roof covered with wood shingles. There are three brick chimneys spaced 38 feet apart with the first and last chimney about two feet from their respective ends of their buildings. The building has a 10-foot-deep wood porch running its entire length. The porch has a low, sloped hip roof, separate from the building roof and extending out from just beneath the building's roof line. The roof is covered with wood shingles and is supported by 13 white square wood columns, just over seven feet apart. The porch is two feet above the ground and accessible by two eight-foot-wide sets of three steps without railings, one set on each side of the porch in front of the two doorways. There is a three-foot-high wooden railing around the porch with spindles three inches apart between the top and bottom rails. The railing and spindles are both painted white. A four-foot-wide, seven-foot-long wood walkway leads from the boardwalk in front of the house to the steps on both sides of the porch through a four-foot-wide opening in the railing. Inside are the restored officers' quarters with housing for one captain and two lieutenants on each side of the building. Each side has a six-foot-wide central hallway with two doorways on each side of the hall, and a door at the end of the hallway opposite the front door. All the interior doors are seven and half feet tall by three feet wide. The back door has a row of two glass panes, nine inches high and one foot wide, above the door. The glass panes are flush with the front of the door. The doors and doorframes are painted brown. Each door is two feet wide with an eight-inch frame around it. The doors are recessed 6 inches from the front of the interior wall. The doors are 11 feet apart and each door is five feet from their respective ends of the hallway. None of the interior rooms are open to the public and are blocked by plexiglass barriers. On both ends of the building a third room extends out 21 feet past the back door of the hallway with a seven-and-a-half-foot wide wooden porch extending out to the end of the extension. The porch is approximately six inches above the ground. The porch roof is an extension of the building roof and is supported by four square wooden columns nine and a half feet apart. There is a brick chimney on the ridge line in the center of the extension’s roof. This extension has two windows and a door. From left to right as you face the porch are a window, the door, and another window. The windows are five feet high by three feet wide and the doorway is seven and a half feet tall by three and a half feet wide. The door is six and a half feet high by three feet wide and is recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. There is a row of three glass panes above the window, eight inches high and ten inches wide. The glass panes are flush with the door. The door and window frames are painted white. The windows have 17-inch-wide green slatted shutters. The shutters are open and frame both sides of the windows. The door and windows are spaced approximately four and a half feet apart with the first window four and a half feet from the end of the extension and the second window four and a half feet from the back wall of the main building. There is no wheelchair ramp, so the building is not wheelchair accessible. End of description.",

Instead, they built blockhouses, which provided a defensive structure in case of Indian attack.<br /> <br /> Fort Larned's blockhouse was built in the of winter 1864-65 to strengthen the fort's defenses after a Kiowa raid in June of 1864. The Kiowas were able to steal 172 of the fort's horses and mules. This hexagonal stone building contained a powder magazine, two levels of rifle slits or loopholes, an underground passageway, and well. However, it was not needed for defense, so in 1867 it was converted into a guardhouse and served as the post jail.<br /> <br /> The original structure was dismantled around 1900 by civilian owners who used its sandstone blocks to build other structures and to shore up the wooden porches on officers' row. When the building was rebuilt in in 1986, at least 200 of the original stones were used in the reconstruction.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Blockhouse 433 words The Blockhouse is located outside the northeast corner of the Parade Ground at the end of a seven-foot wide, 94-foot-long pathway extending out from the path on the south side of the parade ground. Approximately 50 feet before the building, the path curves slightly to the right, ending at the doorway. The Blockhouse is a one-story, six-sided sandstone block building. Each side of the building is 21 feet long. It has no windows, just a double row of loopholes, or rifle slits, on all six sides. The first row of loopholes is three and a half feet from the ground, the second row of loopholes is six feet above the first row. The loopholes are seven inches tall by five inches wide on the outside, and one foot tall by 10 inches wide on the inside. They are 18 inches long from the outside of the wall to the inside. The building has a low-sloping conical roof covered with wood shingles. There is a seven-foot-tall wooden sentry box, painted white, extending up from the center of the roof. Each side of the sentry box is approximately 5 feet. The building has one double doorway, five feet wide by six and a half feet tall located in the center of the wall facing the path. The doors are painted white and are recessed one foot from the front of the exterior wall. The doorway is level with the ground and is wheelchair accessible. The building has a dirt floor that slopes down slightly towards the middle where a wood support pole, three and a half feet in circumference extends from the floor to the roof. The building was originally constructed for defensive purposes but was later used as the post's guardhouse and jail. The inside of the building has been restored to reflect both of those uses. There is a wooden platform extending three feet out from the wall seven and a half feet from the floor to allow soldiers access to the top row of loopholes. The platform extends from the left side of the doorway all the way around the interior wall to the right side of the doorway. It's supported by four and a half foot long two-by-fours angling out from the wall about three and a half feet below the platform and up to its outer edge. The support boards are spaced approximately seven and a half feet apart all the way around. There are also two reproduction iron ball and chains lying on the floor to reflect the building's eventual use as the post jail. End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Ceremonies and drills were part of the daily routine at military posts throughout the Indian Wars period. Reveille and Retreat were the two most important ceremonies performed on the parade ground. The flag was raised at Reveille and lowered at Retreat. In both cases all the soldiers at the post stood in formation by company as the color guard performed the ceremony. Other ceremonies could include inspections and troop reviews.<br /> <br /> Military drills were how soldiers learned, and reinforced, the maneuvers they would use in combat, including marching in formation and responding to the various bugle calls that signaled different movements. This important practice took place on the parade ground.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Fort Larned Parade Ground 222 words The Parade Ground is a square open grassy area just over four acres in size. A 14-foot-wide gravel and dirt walkway runs around the perimeter. The Parade Ground is divided into four equal sections by two six-foot-wide dirt pathways. One pathway crosses in the center from north to south, the other crosses perpendicularly from east to west; they intersect in the middle. A 99-foot-tall flagpole resembling a ship's mast stands in the middle of a circular dirt area, 31 feet in diameter, 48 feet west of where the two interior paths intersect. A 25 foot long, six-foot-wide path leads from the point where the two interior paths intersect to the outside edge of the circular dirt area surrounding the flagpole. There is a Mountain Howitzer artillery piece sitting on a wooden platform on the inside of the northwest corner of the intersecting interior paths. The historic sandstone block buildings sit on all four sides of the Parade Ground. On the north side are the two enlisted barracks, on the east side are the shops building and new commissary, on the south side are the old commissary and the quartermaster warehouse, and on the west side are the two junior officers' quarters on each end with the post commander's quarters in the middle.

    "bodyText": "<h4>12 - The Indian Agency at Fort Larned</h4>   <p>From 1862 to 1868 Fort Larned served as an Indian Agency for the Indian Bureau. Agencies were set up as part of a formal relationship when the U.S. government signed a treaty with an Indian tribe. In exchange for their land the government promised them goods, food and annuities. Indian Agents maintained a relationship with the tribes to coordinate the distribution of those goods, as well as to make sure they were following the terms of the treaty.<br /> <br /> Agents were assigned regionally and usually located in communities or forts close to the tribes they were responsible for. Noted Indian Bureau agents Edward W. Wynkoop and Jesse Leavenworth were among those who served the tribes from Fort Larned. Edward Wynkoop rented the sutler's quarters at the original post sutler's complex to serve as his office. <br /> <br /> The Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche and Plains Apache were assigned to the agency here. The annuity goods they received from the government were most often distributed in the Autumn. For the years that Fort Larned served as an agency for the Indian Bureau, post residents watched in fascination as the scattered bands of these Plains Indian tribes assembled at the fort. Pitching their tipis on nearby prairie, the tribes settled in to locate their friends and kin among their neighbors, to trade, and to await distribution of their annuities.<br /> <br /> Annuities included staples like bacon, wheat flour, coffee, sugar, fresh beef, and tobacco. Usually clothing, beads, blankets, metal tools and cooking utensils, gunpowder, and lead for bullets were also provided. The annuity system was designed to pacify and transform roaming tribes of warlike Indians into sedentary, peaceful farmers. But they were reluctant to give up their traditional way of life and continued to fight against the U.S. government’s attempts to place them on reservations. <br />  </p>",

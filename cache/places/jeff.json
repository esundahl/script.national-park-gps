Eero Saarinen won the 1947-1948 competition for a monument to memorialize Thomas Jefferson and the pioneers who went west with his Gateway Arch, a classic shape in a revolutionary material. Today, visitors can journey to the top in the unique tram system, learn about the history of St. Louis' role in westward expansion, see a film, shop and eat inside.",

It was also where Virginia Minor's case for a woman's right to vote came to trial in the 1870s. An important building in the history of St. Louis and the history of Civil Rights, the Old Courthouse is currently closed to the public. <br /> <br /> St. Louis' Old Courthouse is listed in the National Park Service's National Underground Railroad <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/index.htm\">Network To Freedom.</a> The Network to Freedom recognizes sites, programs and facilities with verifiable associations to the Underground Railroad. The phenomenon popularly known as the Underground Railroad has been broadly defined by the National Park Service as the \"historic resistance to enslavement through escape and flight.\" The Old Courthouse is linked with the story of the Underground Railroad, and with that of slavery, as a property associated with legal challenges to slavery. It was a public forum as well as a courthouse. Enslaved people were auctioned from its steps in estate settlements, while one man's suit for freedom helped plunge the country into Civil War. The Old Courthouse was the site of over 300 suits for freedom, but one gained notoriety. In 1847, Dred Scott, with his wife Harriet, sued for, and were granted, their freedom. After many appeals, the case was decided upon by the Supreme Court. The decision stated that slaves were property, and as such, had no right to sue. The Dred Scott Decision hastened the start of the Civil War.",

The Old Courthouse appears to be centered in the Gateway Arch span when viewed from a distance and the Arch looms overhead when viewed from the west.

    "bodyText": "Commissioned by the Greater St. Louis Community Foundation to mark the bicentennial of the end of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, this 22 foot tall bronze statue shows the return of William Clark and Meriwether Lewis to St. Louis in 1806.<br /> <br /> After its initial placement in 2006, flooding of the Mississippi River often led to the sight of the partially submerged statue with Clark waving his hat as in distress. In 2014, the statue was removed and restored to fix damage from the floods. In 2016, the statue was returned to the riverfront to a location slightly south and about 17 feet higher than before.  <br /> <br /> The sculptor, Harry Weber's work is a familiar sight for St. Louisians with thirty-one works in the city, including the statues of Dred and Harriet Scott at the Old Courthouse, the Plaza of Champions at Busch Stadium and Malcom Martin at Malcom W. Martin Memorial Park across the Mississippi River. ",
    "audioDescription": "A 22 foot tall bronze statue, the heroic scale of the statue towers above the viewer. One figure, Clark, waves his hat above his head. The other figure, Lewis crouches next to his Newfoundland dog, Seaman.",

    "audioDescription": "The Mississippi River flows past the Gateway Arch, marking the edge of the city and the state. The river is wide, flows swiftly and is mostly brownish in color. Looking across into Illinois visitors can see the observation platform at Malcom W. Martin Memorial Park and at noon from Memorial Day till Labor Day see the Gateway Geyser shoot a jet of water into the air 630 feet high for ten minutes. Barges and tugboats move up and down the river frequently and manuever under the bridges - the historic arches of the Eads Bridge to the north and the modern structure of the Poplar street bridge at the south. Riverboats and a helicopter pad barge are moored in the river nearby.",

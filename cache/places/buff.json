The Collier family homesteaded one of the last parcels available along the Buffalo River in 1932, moving from Kentucky.<br /> <br /> The Homestead Act of 1862 allowed vast amounts of the public domain to be claimed by private citizens and was an attempt to encourage westward expansion. A homesteader had only to be the head of a household and at least 21 years of age to claim a 160 acre parcel of land. The homesteader had 5 years to make improvements to make a living on the land.<br /> <br /> Solomon “Sod” Collier, his wife Ida Mae and two of their seven children built the cabin and a life here. The family succeeded in fulfilling the homsteading requirements and received the \"patent\" on 40 acres in 1937. Sod and Ida Mae stayed until 1962. A brochure about the Colliers and the homestead is available at the Tyler Bend Visitor Center. ",

The gravel parking area is about 1 mile from Highway 65 on the Tyler Bend entrance road. The walking path to the cabin is about 4 feet wide, mostly grass covered with woods on the left and field on the right. Several walnut trees are scattered in front of the fenced yard of the cabin. The picket fence is grey weathered boards with an opening directly in front of the cabin. A small log shed and large oak are at the left. The cabin is straight ahead about 30 feet. The left half of the cabin is hand-hewn logs and the door leads into the main room. A stone fireplace is in the center of the right side wall and a window opening is in the center of the left side wall. The ceiling is low and made of dark wood planks. The right half of the cabin has some rough sawn boards forming the porch. The opening for this side of the cabin is the porch with a door into another room on the left. An opening at the left of this doorway leads into a small room with shelves and a rough cupboard. The stone chimney structure dominates the center of this small room.",

    "audioDescription": "We stand on a dirt path among enormous boulders at the base of a beautiful waterfall: Eden Falls. Above our heads, the 53-foot-tall waterfall tumbles over a narrow, horseshoe-shaped rock ledge formed where the box canyon's walls come together. The water free-falls for about 35 feet and then hits a rocky slope and cascades the rest of the way down into a bright blue pool strewn with large rocks. High above the waterfall on a steep hillside, there is a large cave opening: Eden Falls Cave. The water that forms Eden Falls spills out of that cave and cascades down in a series of tiers before it tumbles over the edge right in front of us.",

    "bodyText": "Immigrating from Tennessee in the 1830s, the Parker brothers built their farmstead on 195 acres in the bottomlands of the Buffalo River in the Ozarks. Using techniques similar to the built log homes back in Tennessee, the Parker brothers utilized the local red cedar logs to construct their home. These logs date back to the 1840s, indicating that this is the oldest log structure in the Buffalo National River area. <br /> <br /> This farmstead was continuously occupied for nearly 130 years by 9 different owners, starting with the Parkers and ending with the Hickmans in the early 1980s. Through the years, additions were made to the original cabin, and several outbuildings and farming structures were built around it, arranged roughly in a rectangle. An exhibit panel on-site maps the property and explains the purpose of each building.<br /> <br /> The Parker-Hickman Farmstead, located near Erbie Campground in Buffalo National River's Upper District, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 1987. The farmstead preserves a significant cultural landscape that reflects pioneer settlement and the evolution of farming and subsistence in the Ozarks over a period of 130 years.",
    "audioDescription": "In front of us and behind a wooden gate stands a two-story log home with a steep pitched tin roof, a covered front porch, and a large sandstone chimney on the right side. The home is surrounded by small, fenced-in fields bordered by hardwood forest. Behind the home and beneath a tree is a wooden shed. A small spring flows from the hillside to our right, crossing a gravel drive that leads up the hill into the woods. As we continue turning to our right, there are several other wooden outbuildings scattered around the property, including two large log barns, a corncrib, a smokehouse, and a privy.",

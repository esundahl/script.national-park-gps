Got Water? 313 words. 4 sections. This exhibit emphasizes the importance of drinking water and reusable bottles. Two panels are located on each side of the first display partition on your left as you enter. The front panel, which overlooks the parking lot, features a large photo of a female hiker outfitted in hiking gear and a pack, sitting in profile on red rocks. Behind her, a vista of rocks and arches glow against snow-covered peaks in the distance. She drinks from a reusable water bottle. Caption reads: The view from the Garden of Eden. End of section. The panel, located above two spigots for filling water bottles, titled Got Water? reads: Bottle Filling Station. Get it here. Carry and drink a gallon a day, especially in hot weather. Please carry a reusable water bottle and keep plastic out of the landfill. Our water has been treated to exceed federal and state standards for safe drinking water. Every time you fill your reusable bottle you keep a disposable bottle out of the landfill, and you save money. You can refill an average reusable bottle with tap water once a day for ten years, five months, and 21 days before it would cost as much as one quart of bottled water. End of section. A small inset section, titled By the Numbers, reads: Americans use about 50 billion plastic water bottles yearly. 167 for each person. About 38 billion bottles end up in landfills. End-to-end, they would circle the equator 217 times. Making these bottles uses around 20 million barrels of oil and creates more than 2.5 million tons of CO2. End of section. The water spigots on this side may be turned off during winter. If so, use the spigots on the other side. Move to the opposite side of the partition to learn more about water and its importance. End of description. [1b] Water: Our Essence Water: Our Essence. 492 words. 6 sections. In front of this panel and slightly to the right is a frost-free faucet at the top of a pipe rising from ground level over a grate. The left side of this panel is dominated by a cartoon image of a grave and headstone with rock formations in the background. A vulture is perched on the headstone. The stone is carved with the words: Here lies Peter. He drank only one liter. The cartoon caption reads: Drink more water! Below is a photograph of a variety of beverages, a cup of coffee, two beer bottles, and three cans, all set against red stone. The accompanying text reads: Warning! Caffeine and alcohol actually deplete your body of water! End of section. The panel, titled Water: Our Essence, begins with text: During the course of a day, a healthy adult can lose 8 to 10 cups of water, and that’s without hiking in the hot sun. We must keep replenishing our most important nutrient: water. Water makes up about 75% of our muscles, brains, and blood. Though the plants and animals here are well adapted to a life with little moisture, humans react with serious symptoms after losing only two percent of our body’s water. Total collapse occurs with only a seven percent water loss. End of section. A subtitled section, titled Dehydration: Early Symptoms, reads: Headache, stomachache, weakness, dizziness, dry lips, and thirst are all early symptoms of dehydration. Thirst is not always the first sign, so drink water even if you’re not thirsty. An inset section asks: How much is enough? On average a person needs one gallon of water per day. You may need more if you’re doing strenuous exercise in hot weather. Can I drink too much? Yes, but it takes a lot. While drinking too much can be a problem, not drinking enough is a bigger problem! End of section. A highlighted section of the panel announces: Drinking water is available only at two locations in this park. Here at the visitor center, from the spigots below or on the other side of the pillar, and at Devils Garden, near the end of the road 18 miles from here. Fill your water bottles, canteens, and jugs now. End of section. To the right is a list of Water Facts: 1. The largest number of preventable park medical emergencies stem from dehydration. 2. Early signs of dehydration include headaches, nausea, lethargy, and fatigue. 3. Water is available only at two locations within the park: here and Devils Garden. 4. Two percent water loss is serious dehydration. 5. Seven percent water loss is total collapse. End of section. A set of accompanying graphics depict gallons, quarts, and liters. Pictures show the relationships of those quantities, mirroring the text: One gallon equals four 32-ounce water bottles or eight 16-ounce water bottles. One gallon equals 3.6 one-liter bottles. One quart equals 0.91 liter. End of description. [1c] Navigation to Exterior Zone 2, Park Features Navigation to Exterior Zone 2, Park Features. 54 words. From the Water exhibit, move back to the walkway and proceed past the Park Identity partitions on both sides. The next partition on your left begins Exterior Zone 2, Park Features. A bench may be available adjacent to the partition facing this exhibit. End of description.",

Plants capture particulate dust in the air, filter gaseous pollutants, convert carbon dioxide to oxygen, provide animal habitat, and possess many raw materials useful to humans.<br /> Diverse plant communities thrive in patches of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/seug-soil-crust.htm\">biological soil crust</a>, while others seem to grow right out of cracks in the rock. Many adaptations enable desert plants to survive the extremes of temperature and aridity found in Arches. <br />  </p>",

The exposure of these two <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/nature/rock-strata.htm\">rock strata</a> layers are ideal for the formation of arches and balanced rocks.</p> <p>Balanced Rock defies gravity but this won’t always be the case. Eventually, the 3,600 ton (over 4 million kg) boulder will come tumbling down as the erosional process continues to shape the landscape. In the winter of 1975-76, Balanced Rock’s smaller sibling “Chip-Off-the-Ol'-Block” collapsed (view <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/photosmultimedia/then-and-now.htm\">Then and Now</a> photos), proving that there is no better time than the present to see this awe-inspiring giant.</p> <p>At sunset, Balanced Rock becomes saturated in a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=70CE719D-F80B-03DE-5DDC6AD02AA64563\">deep red-orange</a> making it a great place to end a fun-filled day in the park.

Its location is just far enough from the city lights of Moab, Utah and provides whimsical rocky spires in the foreground.<br /> <br /> A picnic area is located across from Balanced Rock to the west down a gravel road. The picnic area offers multiple picnic tables, covered canopy, vault toilet, and spectacular views of Salt Valley. We encourage you to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/planyourvisit/leave-no-trace.htm\">leave no trace</a> by using trash/recycling bins in the picnic area.

Service animals are allowed in national parks. <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/planyourvisit/service-animals.htm\">What is a service animal?</a>  </p> </li> </ul> <p>Historically, the Colorado River could be crossed here on foot, which made it an incredibly important site for travel and trade. This large and colorful panel of pictographs (painted) and petroglyphs (carved or pecked) displays evidence of people's passage for thousands of years. </p> <p>Archeologists think that Archaic-era Indians first painted the long, tapered figures of this panel (the \"Barrier Canyon Style\") between 1,500 and 4,000 years ago. The bright white circular forms that resemble shields were added later, possibly by ancestral Puebloan or Fremont-era peoples up to 2,000 years ago, or Paiute, Ute, or Navajo groups within the last 700 years. Petroglyphs—images pecked, incised or abraded on stone—appear elsewhere on the wall and adjacent boulder, and on the walkway below.</p> <p>In 1980, this ancient rock markings panel was vandalized. The National Park Service cleaned the panel, and restoration work revealed older pictographs beneath the white shields. While the original brilliant pigments are gone forever, their absence provided an opportunity to use new technologies to gather additional information about the panel. In 2008, as part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/cany-rock-markings-photo.htm\">Multi-Spectral Imaging Project</a>, the panel was photographed in the infrared spectrum, and a comparison with a regular photograph revealed figures not previously visible to the naked eye. Archeologists are using this exciting information to establish a new baseline from which to monitor change in the panel and analyze the order in which individual elements were painted.  </p> <p><strong>Remember</strong>: Archeological sites are fragile, irreplaceable resources. Never touch rock markings, as oils from your hands can damage panels. Leave all artifacts where you find them, and watch your step to avoid damaging sites. Practice <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/planyourvisit/leave-no-trace.htm\">Leave No Trace</a> principles throughout your visit to Arches.</p>",

Here you’ll find arches, spires, and a large concentration of narrow rock walls called “fins.” Fins form when rainwater erodes parallel fractures caused by the uplift of salt deposits below the surface. Fins eventually erode and give way to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/nature/arches.htm\">formation of arches</a> like Landscape Arch, the crown jewel of Devils Garden. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/arch-rock-stars.htm\">Landscape Arch</a> is the longest arch in North America with a light opening of 306 feet (93.3 meters). This awe-inspiring expanse is only 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter at its narrowest. Large segments of the arch came crashing down in the 1990s – proof that the park’s landscape can change dramatically in a instant. Although other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/arch-fallen-arches.htm\">arches have fallen</a>, Landscape Arch still hangs on by a very thin thread. </p>",

Here you’ll find arches, spires, and a large concentration of narrow rock walls called “fins.” Fins form when rainwater erodes parallel fractures caused by the uplift of salt deposits below the surface. Fins eventually erode and give way to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/nature/arches.htm\">formation of arches</a> like Landscape Arch, the crown jewel of Devils Garden. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/arch-rock-stars.htm\">Landscape Arch</a> is the longest arch in North America with a light opening of 306 feet (93.3 meters). This awe-inspiring expanse is only 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter at its narrowest. Large segments of the arch came crashing down in the 1990s – proof that the park’s landscape can change dramatically in a instant. Although other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/arch-fallen-arches.htm\">arches have fallen</a>, Landscape Arch still hangs on by a very thin thread. </p>",

Dogs are predators that can chase, scare and transmit diseases to local wildlife. Even their lingering scent can disrupt an animals’ natural movement and behavior. In such a harsh desert environment, expending energy in this way threatens the survival of species that the park aims to protect.</li> <li>Pets can disturb or destroy natural resources, such as native plants and fragile desert soils. Sensitive cultural and archeological sites may be inadvertently damaged by inquisitive pets.</li> <li>The safety of your pet should be a top priority. Arches is a harsh desert environment with many hazards, including sharp rocks, cliff edges, rattlesnakes and scorpions that can harm your pet. Dogs can easily become the hunted. Your pet may become prey for wildlife like coyotes and mountain lions.</li> <li>Not all visitors are comfortable around pets. Dogs can bite humans. Even if your pet follows instructions and is well behaved, others do not know this and may feel uneasy when encountering you. Park visitors should be able to enjoy the park without the disruptions caused by others’ pets.</li> </ul> <h4>Service Animals and Emotional Support Animals</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/service-animals.htm\">Service animals</a> that have been individually trained to perform specific task(s) for the benefit of an individual with a disability are allowed in the park. The tasks performed by the animal must be directly related to the person’s disability.</p> <p>Therapy, companion, or comfort animals are not service animals under the Americans with Disabilities Act and may not access visitor centers, trails or other non-motorized areas. Owners of service dogs must comply with pet waste and restraint regulations, unless restraint specifically interferes with the task the dog is trained to perform.</p> <p>Pet owners violating park regulations may be <u>cited, fined, and/or issued a mandatory appearance before the United States Magistrate Court</u>.</p> <h4>Pet Friendly Alternatives Outside of Arches National Park</h4> <p>If you'd like to hike on trails with your pets, there are many options outside Arches National Park, including:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/dead-horse/traveling-with-pets/\">Dead Horse Point State Park</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/Moab%20BLM%20Visitior%20Guide_pub_2019_all%20vertical%20pages.pdf\">Bureau of Land Management</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/mantilasal/recreation/hiking/?recid=72816&actid=50\">La Sal National Forest</a></li> <li>Other options for <a href=\"https://www.discovermoab.com/hiking/\">pet-friendly hikes</a> outside Arches National Park.</li> <li>Visit <a href=\"https://www.discovermoab.com/pet-information/\">discovermoab.com</a> for a listing of nearby kennels, veterinarians, and other pet services.</li> </ul>",

As a result, the park has experienced issues of roadway congestion, facility overuse, and associated safety hazards; reduced quality and predictability of visitor access to the park; overcrowding at sites and along trails that diminishes visitor experience; competition for parking and visitor conflicts; and impacts to natural and cultural resources.</p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{243b6b13-1e41-4bc8-9e51-61632a54a6b4}{153}\" paraid=\"222556028\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In 2022, after reviewing comments from members of the public, stakeholders, and elected officials, the NPS implemented a pilot timed entry system to proactively pace visitation into the park. Preliminary data and visitor survey results from the 2022 pilot demonstrate that timed entry reservations better distribute vehicles and visitors throughout the day, provide more reliable and enjoyable access to the park, and help protect Arches’ extraordinary landscape.<br /> <br /> Have more questions?

    "bodyText": "<p>This humble, one-room cabin sits near the present-day trailhead for the hike to Delicate Arch. Visitors regularly peer through the doorway and wonder aloud, \"Who lived here... and how?... And <strong>why</strong>?\"</p> <h3>Starting Over</h3> <p>In 1898, a nagging leg injury from the Civil War prompted 69-year-old John Wesley Wolfe to leave his wife and three of his children in Etna, Ohio, and seek a drier climate. He brought his oldest son, Fred, with him, and the two settled a 100+-acre property along Salt Wash, just north of the village of Moab and close to a fresh water spring. For nearly a decade, they lived and worked alone on the remote \"Bar DX\" ranch, eventually grazing more than 1,000 head of cattle on native grasses that once covered this area.</p> <h3>Making a Home</h3> <p>The first cabin that John and Fred built was not elaborate, but provided basic shelter from spring winds, summer heat, fall rains, and winter cold. A dam on Salt Wash (no longer visible) captured water for root vegetables, pumpkins, and melons raised in their garden. They ordered staple groceries from the Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog about once every three months and picked them up at the Thompson Springs railroad station, which was a full day’s wagon trip away.</p> <p>The scene changed in 1906 when John's daughter, Flora, made the westward trek with her husband, Ed Stanley, and two young children, Esther and Ferol. Appalled by the condition in which her father and brother lived, Flora demanded they build a new cabin with a wooden floor and real windows. John obliged, creating the sturdy cabin that remains in the park to this day. All six family members lived and slept in the one-room cabin, measuring just 17 feet by 15 feet (5.2 m by 4.6 m). John Wolfe also constructed a root celler, irrigation dams, and a corral.</p> <h3>Traditions of Survival</h3> <p>People survived here long before the Wolfes. For centuries, people from Zuni, Hopi, Ute, Paiute, and many other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/historyculture/american-indians.htm\">American Indian tribes</a> traveled through and camped in these landscapes. Even if they didn’t live here year-round, they knew of its many resources—most importantly, water. They hunted wild game, like bighorn sheep, on horseback, and some of them pecked images into the rock walls. They also gathered plants that are edible, medicinal, or can be used to make dye. A sparkly rock called selenite (visible from the park road near the cabin) and the blue-green Mancos Shale can be made into paint for ceremonies, and the hard white rock called chert (visible further down the trail to Delicate Arch) makes sharp-edged stone tools. Utes camped nearby during John Wolfe's stay here and traded their handmade blankets for garden produce and meat.</p> <p>Flora spent two lonely years at the ranch. Wolfe tried to make her more comfortable in what must have seemed a desolate place. Because Flora disliked eating on tin plates, Wolfe ordered a one-hundred-piece set of blue china dishes from Sears. Wolfe also surprised his daughter with a camera and developing kit. Flora took a photograph of <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/arch/planyourvisit/delicate-arch.htm\">Delicate Arch</a>, one of the earliest pictures taken of the now-famous feature.</p> <p>In 1908, Flora and Ed moved to nearby Moab so the children could attend school. (That house also remains, a few blocks off Main Street in the center of town.) John and Fred Wolfe stayed at the ranch for two more years before joining them in Moab. John Wolfe and the Stanleys left Moab in 1910 and eventually moved back to Ohio where John died in 1913 at the age of 84.</p> <h3>After the Wolfes</h3> <p>Wolfe sold the ranch to Tommy Larson in 1910. Four years later, J. Marvin Turnbow, the first custodian of Arches National Monument, bought it. The Turnbows used the cabin sporadically until selling the ranch to Emmit Elizondo, who then sold the property to the US government for inclusion in Arches National Monument.</p> <p>In 1975, Wolfe Ranch and surrounding acreage were listed on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/Nr/index.htm\">National Register of Historic Places</a> . The nomination reads: “Historically, the activities of man on the Colorado Plateau have been a function of his ability to exploit and control its meager water resources. Wolfe’s ranching operation on Salt Wash is an excellent example of early subsistence farming and grazing in a marginal environment.\"</p> <p>It was indeed a marginal environment, and years of cattle and sheep grazing have had a significant impact on the natural vegetation of the region. No grazing has occurred for decades, but native grasses are still sparse and in some localized areas have disappeared completely. Today, we may admire the perseverance and determination of early ranchers, but we also realize that the impacts of their actions went far beyond their brief stay. It will be years—if ever—before the ranch and surrounding area look like they did when American Indians or John Wesley Wolfe first saw it.</p>",

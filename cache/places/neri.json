    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 8: African American Fraternal Organizations</h3> <p>African American fraternal organizations, like Bright Hope Lodge #9 in Montgomery, WV began as a means of meeting the economic and social needs of the African American community. They shaped African American identity through rituals of brotherhood and protected members against poverty and other hardships. Although fraternal organizations originated in free black communities before the Civil War, thousands were founded during Reconstruction.<br /> <br /> Fraternal organizations for black and white residents began before governmental aid and other assistance programs existed for the poor. Segregation and discriminatory practices made obtaining what little help that was available even more difficult for African Americans. African American fraternal organizations became a back-up plan for their communities. By collecting membership dues, they were able to aid the poor, the unemployed, orphanages, and widows, often providing burial funds.<br /> <br /> Bright Hope Lodge was organized on January 22, 1889 in Coal Valley, Fayette County.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/african-american-fraternal-organizations-bright-hope-lodge-9-montgomery-wv.htm\">African American Fraternal Organizations: Bright Hope Lodge #9; Montgomery, WV</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Other nearby places of interest:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/simmons-high-school.htm\">Simmons High School</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/booker-t-washington-boyhood-site-and-monument.htm\">Booker T.

Throughout the late 19th to early 20th century, a large-scale commercial logging boom swept across the forests of Appalachia. New advancements in sawmill technology and rapid development of urban areas across the country created a higher demand for lumber, resulting in millions of acres of forests being clearcut within a few decades. It is estimated that less than 1% of the original forests remain throughout the eastern United States and West Virginia, usually in small patches of a few dozen acres or less.</p> <p>The forest along this trail was a small tract of private property owned by the Laing family. Evidence along the trail reveals part of the land was cleared for pasture and a homestead, but some of the forest was left to grow naturally with minimal human impact.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Old-Growth Forest Hike Stop 2 - Defining Old-Growth</strong></p> <p>What determines old-growth? Generally, old-growth forests are considered primary forests, or forests that haven’t been cleared by humans and natural processes have been allowed to shape the ecosystem. A forest that has had major human clearing is referred to as a secondary forest, highlighting that the second forest has grown to replace the original that was cleared. However, some forests naturally don’t reach old-growth age due to frequent disturbances that naturally keep the ecosystem young.</p> <p>In the New River Gorge, riverscour prairies naturally have frequent flooding that keeps vegetation from reaching old age. A riverscour prairie could theoretically be a primary ecosystem that humans haven’t disturbed, but it isn’t old-growth since flooding naturally keeps most of the species from achieving old age. A forest could also have been cleared by humans 200 years ago and enough time has passed to where old-growth features are coming back, but this wouldn’t be considered a primary forest due to the history of human clearing. A 200-year-old forest in the eastern United States could be considered old-growth, but a 200-year-old forest may not classify as old-growth in the Pacific Northwest where trees can live for over 1,000 years.</p> <p>Despite all the subjectivity surrounding the definition of old-growth, there are many features that are unique to old-growth deciduous forests that can be scientifically measured and classified.</p>",

Tulip poplars are not tolerant of shade and are quick to establish in open areas with high sunlight.</p> <p>This young forest is an example of a secondary, early successional forest that is in the beginning stages of development. Succession is the process by which vegetation communities change in species composition and structure through time as the ecosystem matures. This forest is considered even-aged, where all of the trees began growing at the same time after mowing stopped. Old-growth forests are late-successional and uneven-aged, where trees naturally grow to their upper age limits and larger overstory trees are of numerous ages. The uneven-age of older forests is evidence that the trees didn’t all establish after a large disturbance that cleared the entire area, but from numerous smaller events that created small gaps in the canopy and allowed for new growth to establish.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Old-Growth Forest Hike Stop 4 - Decoding the Old-Growth</strong></p> <p>How do we know that the Burnwood forest is old-growth? The presence of numerous species of large trees made park rangers at New River Gorge National Park & Preserve believe that the forest could be considered old-growth. During the fall of 2022, the National Park Service partnered with Dr. Tom Saladyga, Professor of Geography at Concord University in Athens, West Virginia. Dr. Saladyga is a dendrochronologist, or a scientist who specializes in using the annual growth rings to accurately date trees and study changes in the environment, such as past fire, climate, storms, and human activities.</p> <p>Dr. Saladyga led eight of his students for a class project to classify Burnwood as an old-growth forest and write a research report published by the National Park Service titled, <a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/685261\">Documenting Remnant Old Growth at New River Gorge National Park & Preserve: A Pre-Industrial Legacy Forest at the Burnwood Area</a>.</p> <p>The study confirmed that the forest should be considered old-growth. Fourteen of the fifty trees that were sampled were at least 250 years old, with five individuals dating to the 1670s, indicating the forest has had minimal human disturbance and escaped the industrial logging period of the early 20th century.</p> <p>The team posed in the old-growth forest of Burnwood in the above image. From left to right: Ricardo Chinea-Pegler, Thomas Saladyga, Alexis Foster (documentarian), Joseph Duffer (in front), Mitchell Roush, Madison Cook, Haidyn DePinho, Madison Cornett, and Andrew Trump.

Many older trees will have a mix of balding and protruding bark patterns up and down the entire trunk and the bark on old-growth trees can be strikingly different in appearance compared to younger trees of the same species. Old-growth trees also have very little stem taper, with minimal change in diameter from the base of the tree to the top near the crown.</p> <p>Perhaps the best clue to determine if a tree is old-growth lies within the branches and the crown. Older trees usually have only a few large diameter branches that are high up into the crown, resembling a stalk of celery that has only a few leaves at the top of the tall stem.

Oftentimes, the oldest trees are rather small; the oldest tree in this forest is a blackgum off-trail that dated to 1671 but was less than 19 inches in diameter.</p> <p>The large, spreading branches on this American beech indicates that it could have been growing in more open conditions free of neighboring trees competing for sunlight, allowing for multiple decades of rapid growth. Two American beech trees smaller than this individual were sampled in this forest, each with inner ring year dates of 1829 and 1755 respectively, and the age of this large tree is probably within that range.</p>",

Large fallen trees on the forest floor, also called coarse woody debris, are a key feature researchers use to determine if a forest truly is old-growth. When a large tree falls, it can take decades if not over a century for the wood to fully decompose. This wood does not go to waste. The decomposition of wood recycles nutrients and carbon back into the forest soils which act as large, long-term carbon sinks for greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. Coarse woody debris provides habitat for many species that grow and feed on moist, decomposing wood such as moss, lichen, mushrooms, and insects.</p> <p>Many species of wildlife are more abundant or even rely on old-growth forests for their habitat. The moisture retained in the shaded forest floor and in the coarse woody debris creates the perfect conditions for salamanders to flourish. Coarse wood debris can also be used as denning habitat for smaller mammals such as foxes, skunks, and opossums. Many species of birds, like the cerulean warbler, prefer the large trees and multi-layered canopies that old-growth forests provide.</p>",

These two large white oaks on the right side of the trail had the top of their crowns blown over during a windstorm in the summer of 2021. Infrequent disturbances like windstorms, ice storms, and wildfires that may kill a few trees within a larger forest stand are some of the dynamic processes that shape the Appalachian forests.</p> <p>The windstorm may have killed these two white oaks, but these trees still provide a vital ecological role by serving as habitat for many species of wood eating insects, mushrooms, moss, and birds. The large crowns will slowly decompose on the ground, providing habitat for decades to come and recycling nutrients back into the soil. A beam of light now shines through the opening in the canopy, allowing for young tree seedlings to grow. The deciduous forests of Appalachia are self-sustaining and in a constant state of change, where the end of one organism means new beginnings for others in the cycle of life and death.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 2: Camp Washington Carver</h3> <p>Camp Washington-Carver was named after Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver. It was built by the Civilian Conservation Corp in the early 1940s. Camp Washington Carver opened in 1942 as the first 4-H camp in the country that was for the African-American youth. Today, Heritage Arts Camp, the Appalachian String Band Festival, and the Great Chestnut Lodge, the largest log structure of its kind in the world, make this site a favorite place for festivities.<br /> <br /> On July 26, 1942 the first African American 4-H camp in the United States was opened here in Fayette County. A 1929 report showed that 44 of the state’s 55 counties had 4-H camps for white children, but none for black children. Fleming Adolphus Jones, a black member of the WV House of Delegates presented to the legislature the importance of Camp Washington Carver:“For the purpose of teaching Negro boys and girls the 4-H standard of living, and to inspire them to lift themselves toward these standards, and to discover and train Negro boys and girls for leadership, and for the purpose of teaching standards of excellence in agriculture, soil conservation, vocational agriculture, and home economics.”</p> <p>Use of the camp began immediately, even before construction was fully completed. The peak years of use occurred during the 1950s when the camp accommodated approximately 1,600 campers annually. A camper’s day included nature study, music, drama, crafts, swimming, play time, and evening vespers. Today the site is used for many different purposes, weddings, reunions, festivals, and other gatherings. Local historian Norman Jordan said it best, “Regardless of what it [the camp] becomes, its roots will always represent a landmark for African American unity and achievement.”<br /> <br /> <br /> For the full story go to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/camp-washington-carver-clifftop-wv.htm\">Camp Washington Carver: Clifftop, WV</a></p> <h4>Driving Directions:</h4> <p><b>From Beckley, WV</b> Take Highway 41 north and travel 28.5 miles to Clifftop Road (Route 11).

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Fayette Station Road audio Chapter 1: Intro - Canyon Rim Visitor Center parking lot to Lansing-Edmond Road</strong></p> <p>Chapter 1 [Music starts, and fades out slowly] <i>Narrator</i>: Welcome to New River Gorge National River and the National Coal Heritage Trail. You are about to embark on a drive down Fayette Station Road, a small, winding road that takes you to a bridge at the bottom of the New River Gorge. For about 100 years, this route was the only way to cross the New River in this immediate area without getting wet. In 1977 the arching, modern, New River Gorge Bridge was built up on Route 19, and Fayette Station Road lost its importance as a vital link in the area. Before starting your drive and beginning your adventure…please take a moment to listen to a few tips that will make your experience safer and more enjoyable along the way.</p> <ul> <li> <p>First, to keep in sync with the interpretive story, please maintain a speed between 15 and 25 mph after you get on Fayette Station Road.</p> </li> <li> <p>*REMOVE* The second tip is for those listening to a CD instead of an audio tape. Whenever the program says to stop the recording, just turn off your CD player. When you turn it back on, the CD will resume playing at the correct point.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you take this route without stopping along the way, this trip will take you about 30 minutes—a far cry from the 30 seconds or less it takes to cross the river on the highway today. If, however, you stop along the way to read the interpretive exhibits at each pull-off, plan on taking an hour to enjoy the tour.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Before leaving the parking lot of Canyon Rim Visitor Center, you may want to set your car’s trip meter to zero. This will help you find your way on the map that accompanies this program. [pause here before giving out directions]</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now let’s begin the journey… As you leave the parking lot, [pause…] turn left to get back on to Route 19. [pause..] Take a right on Route 19 and go north, approximately three tenths of a mile, [pause…] to the first road on the right. Take this right, onto Lansing-Edmond Road. You will see signs that point out the route as you drive along. [music begins by fading in] Stop the recording now until you turn onto Lansing-Edmond Road. [music fades out quickly] [after a pause, music starts, and fades out slowly]</p> <p> </p>",

A series of elevators lifted coal into the tower. Tracks on either side of the tower allowed locomotives to move close to the chutes. The coal fell down the chutes into the waiting tenders of the locomotives.</p> <p>The cement building next to the coaling tower is the sanding house. Locomotives used sand to grip slippery rails. In the wet and sometimes steep New River Gorge, sand was useful to help locomotives up the grades. At the coaling tower, as locomotives filled up with coal, they also resupplied their sand.</p> <p>After the switch to diesel electric locomotives, the coaling tower was not needed. The C&O Railway abandoned the coaling tower in 1960. It is still owned by modern day CSX Transportation.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Between the banks of the New River and the railroad tracks that goes through town sits a large cement structure. The square tall tower about four-stories tall has a slanted roof with metal ladders coming out of it. Wheels on the side are all that’s left of the elevator system used to fill the tower with coal. The top two thirds are solid cement. Near the bottom of the solid por-tion are square slanted openings where chutes used to pour coal into the tenders of steam locomotives. Eight cement legs hold the structure up with four on the east side and four on the west side. The center is hollow allow-ing a north to south path underneath the tower. The legs have bits of metal rebar exposed as the building deteriorates. A small carving on the south side of the building says C&O 1922. Vegetation grows all around the base of the coaling tower. To the north of the tower is a ruined cement building without a roof and collapsing walls. The former sanding house is only about ten feet high and is covered in graffiti. CSX sometimes has some railroad equipment nearby.",

Unlike the stores of the coal company towns, this was optional. Workers were not forced to buy from the commissary.</p> <p>The first post office in Thurmond opened in 1888. For years it operated out of the Thurmond Hotel. In 1963, after fire destroyed the hotel, the U.S. Post Office moved into the old commissary building. The post office served the town of Thurmond until 1995 when it finally closed its doors. In the late 1990s, the last business in Thurmond operated out of the old post office. Thurmond Supply rented bicycles and sold ice cream to visitors. It closed after only a few years. The building is currently privately owned.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 11: Integration of West Virginia Schools</h3> <p>In 1906 a levy was passed in Fayette County to establish the county’s first high schools, one for white children and one for black children. Eleven years later, this became a reality for African American students when an eight room brick building was erected in 1917 on the hill above Dunloop Creek, across from the present day Mount Hope High School. The school was named after Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, an educator and civil rights leader on the staff of Howard University in Washington, DC.<br /> <br /> DuBois High School offered many classes such as home economics, French, chemistry, world history, math, and English. Students could participate in the band that performed at football games and competitions. Boy’s football and basketball were the school’s main team sports. Girls could join the cheerleading squad, but there were no other sports for girls.<br /> <br /> Tragedy struck in 1950, when the original schoolhouse was destroyed by fire. On January 30, 1954, the new DuBois High School opened its doors, again as an all-black high school. Two years later, in the fall of 1956, DuBois High School and the all-white high school in Mount Hope integrated and the school was renamed Mount Hope High School.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/integration-of-schools-dubois-high-school-mount-hope-wv.htm\">Integration of Schools: DuBois High School; Mount Hope, WV</a></p> <h4><strong>Other nearby places of interest:</strong></h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/dubois-on-main-museum.htm\">DuBois on Main Museum</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/mount-hope-wv.htm\">Mount Hope</a></p> <h4>Driving Directions:</h4> <p>Physical Address: 110 High School Drive, Mount Hope, WV 25880<br /> GPS Coordinates: N37.898051 -W81.157067<br /> <br /> <b>From Beckley, WV: </b>Take Highway 19 north to the exit for Mount Hope, WV.

    "audioDescription": "A paved pull-off on a narrow, paved road sits next to a large rock jutting out towards a creek several yards wide. The creek flows between a short rock cliff and the road with trees and green plants around it. The water reaches a drop off over the rocks and plunges 20 feet down in a wide, large cascade. A large pool forms at the bottom with a small path leading from the pull-off down to it. On the top of the opposite bank sits a single set of railroad tracks. A diesel locomotive with coal cars sometimes drives by and looks as if it's driving across the top of the waterfall.",

    "bodyText": "<h4>Thurmond Walking Tour Stop 9</h4> <p>Throughout its history, many of Thurmond's residents worked for the C&O Railway. The Engine House was the heart of the railroad. Although rectangular in shape, it was the same as a roundhouse. It served as the repair shop for locomotives and railcars.</p> <p>Built in 1905, the Thurmond Engine House was the workplace of 50 to 70 men. At its peak, 175 men worked round the clock in 3 shifts. Each shift lasted 8 hours. At peak operation, the Engine House serviced 60 to 100 railcars daily. Machinists, boilermakers, and steam fitters worked hard to maintain locomotives. At any given time, 2 to 3 locomotives were being serviced. The Engine House kept 2 to 3 more locomotives steamed up, ready to go at a moment's notice.</p> <p>The switch to diesel electric locomotives made the Engine House obsolete. In 1963, the Engine House closed and an auto repair shop opened in its place until 1985. The abandoned Engine House burned in 1993.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 7: African Americans and the Railroad</h3> <p>Construction of railroads and stations brought thousands of people to the coal-rich region of Appalachia. Three railroads opened the vast coalfields of Southern West Virginia to mining: the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway along the New and Kanawha rivers, the Norfolk & Western Railway through the Pocahontas coalfield, and the Virginian Railway into the Winding Gulf fields. This meant jobs building and maintaining the railroads as well as jobs in the coal mines.   <br /> <br /> African Americans made up the majority of workers whose sweat, muscle, and blood carved the C&O Railway, its branch lines, and other railroads through the mountainous landscapes. Constructed between 1869 and 1873, it employed thousands of black laborers. Jobs in these industries provided the opportunity for African American families to escape the “Jim Crow” segregated society of the Deep South. African American men were able to build new lives as vital, more respected, and better-paid workers.<br /> <br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/african-americans-and-the-railroad-gauley-bridge-depot-gauley-bridge-wv.htm\">African Americans and the Railroad: Gauley Brige Depot; Gauley Bridge, WV</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Other nearby places of interest:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cathedral-falls.htm\">Cathedral Falls</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/kanawha-falls.htm\">Kanawha Falls</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/gauley-bridge.htm\">Gauley Bridge</a></p> <h4>Driving Directions:</h4> <p>Physical Address: 278 Railroad Street, Gauley Bridge, WV 25085<br /> GPS Coordinates:  N38.164560 -W81.196938<br /> <br /> <b>From Beckley and Fayetteville, WV:</b> Take Highway 19 north to Highway 60.

A number of cascades and small waterfalls add to the trail's attraction. The lower part of Glade Creek is also a WV Catch & Release trout stream, so bring your fly rod or fishing pole along with you. A footbridge crosses Glade Creek three miles up from the New River. Below the footbridge the trail can be narrow and rocky.</p> <h4><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\">Note</span></h4> <p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\">There is currently a wash out in the trail at the junction with Kates Falls Trail. This may be impassable when creeks are running high. </span></p> <h4><strong>To reach trailhead from Beckley</strong></h4> <p>From Route 19 (Eisenhower Drive), take Route 41 north toward Prince. Turn right onto the Glade Creek Road, just before the bridge at Prince. Follow the gravel road seven miles; it ends at the Glade Creek trailhead.</p> <h4><strong>To reach trailhead from Fayetteville</strong></h4> <p>Follow Route 19 south; take the Glen Jean exit. Turn right onto Route 61 south; follow Route 61 for 2.8 miles. Turn left, staying on Route 61, and continue for another 4.6 miles.

Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Exchange Company had its office there as well.</p> <p>In Thurmond, there wasn't much flat land at the bottom of the gorge. The railroad used most of this land for tracks, rail yards, and other infrastructure. Building houses on the side of the gorge was difficult. With a population of 300 to 500 people, most residents didn't live in houses. Instead, they lived in apartments over the businesses. Most of the upper floors of the Goodman-Kincaid building were apartments.</p> <p>The first floor had several restaurants and shops over the years. The most famous restaurant was the Homestead Restaurant. Mrs. Ida McClure owned the Homestead and cooked meals for railroad workers. During World War II, she did her part for the war effort by serving free meals to soldiers on troop trains. Her restaurant closed in 1945 at the end of the war.</p>",

A narrow gravel path a few yards wide sepa-ratees the tracks from the building. Between the center building and the other two are narrow allies only a few feet wide. The building itself is very wide with nine narrow well-spaced windows across the upper two floors. The windows are boarded up with green painted wood. On the first floor is a line of large shopping windows and entry doors spanning the entire width of the building. Columns and trim around the doors and windows are dark green painted wood.

    "bodyText": "Grandview provides some of the most dramatic scenery found in the park and is a popular place for hiking, picnicing, and sight seeing.<br />   <p>Grandview is a peaceful place to relax and unwind while enjoying outstanding views of the New River. From 1400 feet above the river at Main Overlook, visitors are rewarded with one of the most outstanding views in the park. On a clear day you can see directly into the heart of New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, including seven miles of the New River and its watershed. From Main Overlook visitors can also get a glimpse of some of the gorge's unique cultural history. From here you see an active railway and the town of Quinnimont, where the first coal was shipped out of the gorge in 1873. Don't miss the views from Turkey Spur Overlook, and be sure to walk the woodland trails.<br /> <br /> Grandview is a great place to see the spectacular displays of Catawba rhododendrons that bloom here every spring. The purple Catawba rhododendrons bloom in mid May, while the white great rhododendrons bloom in July. The exact bloom times are not always consistent year to year, so check with a ranger at one of our visitor centers or check our facebook page for updates.</p> <p>The Grandview section of the park includes overlooks of the New River, a visitor center (open seasonally), five hiking trails, ranger-led walks and talks, summer outdoor dramas, and picnic areas with playgrounds. Information about renting picnic shelters at Grandview can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/permitsandreservations.htm\">Permits and Reservations</a> page of the New River Gorge website. Grandview is home to <a href=\"http://www.theatrewestvirginia.com/\">Theatre West Virginia</a>, which features outdoor drama presentations from June through August.<br /> <br /> Grandview was originally a part of the West Virginia State Park system. In 1939, the state of West Virginia purchased 52 acres of land at Grandview to develop a day use park. The Civilian Conservation Corps built roads, shelters, and a picnic area, all still in use today. Construction began in 1960 on the 1200-seat Cliffside Amphitheater. The children’s playgrounds, recreation area, and additional walkways were built from 1961 to 1964. After more than 50 years as one of West Virginia’s most popular state parks, Grandview was transferred to the National Park Service in 1990.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Directions</strong></p> <p>To reach Grandview from Beckley follow I-64 East five miles to Exit 129 B. From Lewisburg follow I-64 West forty miles to Exit 129. From either exit, turn right and follow Route 9 North six miles to Grandview.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 9: The Community of Harlem Heights</h3> <p>Harlem Heights, a historic African American community within the city of Oak Hill, was different than most communities in the New River region. Black residents worked in a variety of occupations as teachers, mining inspectors, seamstresses, and ministers. Although there were a few coal miners, they did not represent the majority. Unlike a coal town where homes were owned by the company, most of the residents of Harlem Heights were homeowners.<br /> <br /> The people of Harlem Heights took pride in their community by keeping it clean and attractive. They actively supported their churches, civic clubs, and fraternal organizations. Through all of these efforts, it grew to become a rather upscale African American community, eventually gaining its own voting precinct. Today, the community has a Masonic Lodge and three churches.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/the-community-of-harlem-heights-oak-hill-wv.htm\">The Community of Harlem Heights</a></p> <h4>Other nearby places of interest:</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/first-baptist-church-of-harlem-heights.htm\">First Baptist Church of Harlem Heights</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/russell-e-matthew-park.htm\">Russell E.

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 5: The Hawk's Nest Tunnel Disaster </h3> <p>Throughout the years, West Virginia has suffered many a tragedy that left hundreds of workers injured or dead. The Hawk’s Nest Tunnel disaster became one of the worst industrial tragedies in the history of the United States.<br /> <br /> In 1930, construction began on a three-mile tunnel through Gauley Mountain located between Ansted and Gauley Bridge, West Virginia. When finished, the Hawk’s Nest Tunnel would divert water from the New River to a hydroelectric plant downstream. In order to build the tunnel through solid rock, hundreds of unemployed men were recruited for construction jobs on the project. At least two-thirds of these workers were African Americans. As the men drilled and blasted the tunnel through the mountain, they drilled through rock that contained high levels of silica. The dry drilling techniques that was used released large amounts of silica dust into the air, which made working in the tunnel very dangerous. Workers emerged from the hole in the mountain covered with layers of white dust. The interior of the tunnel was a white cloud of silica, impairing vision and clogging the lungs of workers.<br /> <br /> Excavation of the Hawk’s Nest Tunnel lead to the greatest death toll ever from silicosis in the United States. At least 764 tunnel workers died of silicosis. A majority of the dead were African Americans. In the years after the project was completed, many more would die due to their exposure to silica dust while working in the tunnel.<br /> <br /> With the death of so many black workers, the problem of where to bury them became an issue. There were a limited number of burial sites for blacks nearby. To solve the issue, a funeral parlor in Summersville, West Virginia located an open field on Martha White’s farm. This field became the burial grounds for many of the African Americans who died working on the tunnel project.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/the-hawks-nest-tunnel-disaster-summersville-wv.htm\">The Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster </a></p> <h4>Driving Directions:</h4> <p>Physical Address: 98 Hilltop Drive, Lookout, WV 26679<br /> GPS Coordinates: N38.234467 -W80.852690<br /> <br /> <b>From Beckley and Fayetteville, WV:</b> Take Highway 19 north toward Summersville, WV.

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 13: African American Coal Miners</h3> <p>In the 1910s, the East Gulf Coal Company opened what came to be known as the Helen Mine and Coal Camp. Realizing their need to attract a more reliable and family-oriented workforce, the coal operators began constructing “model towns.” Here in the model town of Helen there was a boarding house, company store, clubhouse, movie theater, and even a telephone exchange. <br /> <br /> Although Helen had separate and segregated residential areas and businesses, equality for the black coal miner did exist in the coalfields of southern West Virginia.  African Americans could vote, hold public office, and send their children to school. In the mines, blacks were provided equal wages for equal work. About 75 percent of black workers became coal loaders. Others were daymen and coke workers. Picking and loading coal was hard, dangerous, back-breaking work, but provided the most opportunity for earning money. Loaders were paid by the ton, rather than by the hour. A coal loader performed the laborious task of cutting, drilling, blasting, and loading the coal. A dayman hauled the loaded coal from the rooms to the mine face where the coal was weighed and the miner credited for payment. Coke workers performed the hot and laborious job of tending the “beehive” ovens. They filled the ovens with coal and unloaded the finished coke into train cars.<br /> <br /> Helen’s population began to decline, especially for African Americans, in the 1950s with the advent of new machinery. After 1953, the services of hand loaders or unskilled laborers were no longer needed. The town, like so many, began its long decline in population and vitality. Helen’s rich heritage lives on in its citizens and in the community’s coal-related street names: Lantern, Check, and Scrip Alleys. <br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/african-american-coal-miners-helen-wv.htm\">African American Coal Miners: Helen, WV</a></p> <h4><strong>Other nearby places of interest:</strong></h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/byrd-prillerman-school.htm\">Byrd Prillerman High School</a></p> <h4>Driving Directions:</h4> <p>Physical Address: Tams Highway (Highway 16), Helen WV 25853<br /> GPS Coordinates: N37.636248 -W81.314486<br /> <br /> <b>From Beckley, WV:</b> Travel on I-77 north or south to Exit 42.

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 17: Migration of African Americans to WV</h3> <p>Hinton and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway became an important migration corridor for thousands of African Americans. For nearly sixty years, 1870 to 1930, African Americans traveled to West Virginia through major rail centers like Hinton.  They came in search of jobs as well as economic and political opportunities denied to them in other states.<br /> <br /> Beginning in 1869, African Americans poured into the state to fill hundreds of jobs building the C&O Railway, its branch lines, and other railroads through the mountainous landscapes. Once the railroads opened up the large coalfields of Central Appalachia, even more journeyed to West Virginia. <br /> <br /> Hinton became an integral stop for African American men and their families who came to fill hundreds of jobs in the coal mines. Although some remained in Hinton to work for the railroad, some became buisnessmen, teachers, and ministers, but the majority passed through on their way to new jobs and new lives in the coal camps of the New River Gorge and southern West Virginia.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hinton Railroad Depot</strong><br /> The Hinton station was built for the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway (C&O) in 1905 as a division terminal. The station and tracks lie along a bend in the New River; in a quirk of engineering, the eastbound trains pass southwest through the station and westbound trains pass northeast. The otherwise two-story depot has a middle section that stands at three stories and is built entirely from red brick with a rock-faced stone belt course that runs at the window heads. The porch coverings are supported by heavy wooden brackets that feature a wood-fan pattern trim. Currently, the station is largely unoccupied except for an Amtrak waiting room opened and closed by a caretaker. Along the hillside bordering the platform, a neighbor maintains a lush garden for the enjoyment of rail passengers.</p> <h4>Other nearby places of interest:</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hinton-wv.htm\">Hinton, WV</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hinton-railroad-museum.htm\">Hinton Railroad Museum</a></p> <h4>Driving Directions</h4> <p>Physical Address: 100 2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue, Hinton, WV 25951<br /> GPS Coordinates: N37.675011 -W80.892184<br /> <br /> <b>From Beckley, WV: </b>Take I-64 East to Exit 139 (Hinton/Sandstone, WV).

    "bodyText": "Had it not been for the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Company, Hinton would have had no reason to exist. The aftermath of the Civil War had left the railroad in shambles, its goal to reach the Ohio River on the verge of collapse. While struggling to obtain capital, in early 1869, then president Gen. Williams C. Wickham, recruited railroad capitalist Collis P. Huntington. After making a tour of the whole line, Huntington, fresh from his work building the Central Pacific, became interested in the C&O as a link in a true coast-to-coast rail line.<br /> <br /> The tour took him through what would later become Hinton and Summers County. At that time the territory was entirely in timber and farm land, owned by the Ballengee family and the Hinton family. The Ballengee family located here first, before 1778, and owned all the land that would later become Hinton. It wasn't until 1835 that John Hinton (1788-1858) moved his family to the area of Hinton, a 175 acre tract that had been purchased from Henry and Rachel Ballengee and now known as Avis, after his second wife. They were married on July 4, 1843.<br /> <br /> When Huntington and Gen. Wickham reached Hinton's Ferry they engaged two of John and Avis Hinton's sons, William and Joe, and Parker Adkins to take them down the River for a view of the proposed route. Even Hinton, a half-brother, was among the few that knew the railroad would be following the river; and, with Virginia attorney, James Furgeson, the two went to Charleston in 1871 when the Legislature was in session and lobbied for the creation of the new county. His argument and with some boundary line adjustments was successful and the new County of Summers was created on Feb. 27, 1871. In 1871 about six families lived in the vicinity of what would become Hinton and only three houses existed in the Hinton/Avis/Bellepoint area. These were the homes of the Isaac and George Ballengee family and John Hinton's family.",

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 11: Integration of Schools: DuBois High School, Mount Hope, WV</h3> <p>On May 17, 1954, “Separate but Equal” became “Unequal.” That day, the United States Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools were unconstitutional. In West Virginia, school segregation was mandated by the state constitution. West Virginia was one of seventeen states that had a dual school system; schools for whites students and schools for black students. At the time of the decision, there were 420,000 white and 26,000 black students attending school in West Virginia. Black students were not receiving an equal education. They were using outdated, second-hand books as well as band and school equipment passed down from white high schools.</p> <p><br /> The ruling did not come with specific recommendations; desegregation was left up to the individual states and often to the individual county school systems. By June of 1954, the institutes of higher learning in West Virginia had begun the process of desegregation. By September, twenty-nine of the forty-six West Virginia counties with African American students had also begun the process of integrating their K-12th grade schools.<br /> <br /> Some counties were reluctant and slow to integrate their schools. A few remained segregated until the mid-1960s. Other school systems maintained their dual school system allowing black students to attend an integrated school or continue to attend an all-black school. In most counties, desegregation went fairly smoothly; however, there were students and parents who protested against integration or boycotted efforts to integrate. None of these activities led to major violence.<br /> <br /> In Fayette County, school officials announced that all schools would be integrated at the beginning of the 1956-57 school year. Here in Mount Hope, the older white high school was converted to a middle school. The white students were moved to the all-black DuBois High School which was the newer and nicer of the two high school buildings. DuBois was renamed Mount Hope High School.<br /> <br /> The results of integration affected each person differently. African American principals before desegregation were demoted to teachers after integration. Many black teachers were the first to lose their jobs if there were not enough teaching positions at the combined schools. In some integrated schools, male black students were allowed to play on the football and basketball teams, but they could not play other team sports. African American girls were not allowed to be on the cheerleading squad. Throughout the region, black students were treated differently. At some schools they could not participate in the band or chorus, or join white-only school clubs and organizations; at others they could.<br /> <br /> Artifacts, trophies, yearbooks, and records from many of the black high schools were burned or placed away in boxes and forgotten. Kathleen Scott attended the segregated DuBois High School. For her, the most significant effect of integration was losing many of her friends who lived in more distant communities. “Our friends from other parts of the county began going to high schools closer to where they lived,” she said. “And we didn’t get to see them anymore.” It took West Virginia school districts almost a decade to become fully desegregated, and the closing of the African American schools resulted in a loss of community identity for black residents.</p>   <h4>Driving Directions</h4> <p>Physical Address: 110 High School Drive Mt.

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 15: John Henry, The Steel Drivin' Man</h3> <p>In the early 1870s, construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway along the Greenbrier and New rivers employed thousands of workers. Many of these men were African Americans who migrated to West Virginia in search of jobs. Jobs on the railroad were labor intensive and low paying, required long hours, and were at times dangerous.<br /> <br /> Railroad workers primarily used shovels, wheelbarrows, mules, and black powder to move millions of tons of rock and dirt to prepare the railroad bed. Workers used axe and adz to cut and shape hundreds of trees into ties, bridge timbers, and lumber for railcars. They sweated in the hot summer sun and froze in the cold mountain winters as they worked to connect Tidewater Virginia with the Ohio Valley.<br /> <br /> As the C&O Railway stretched westward along the Greenbrier River, <i>The Legend of John Henry</i> was born at Big Bend Mountain near Talcott, West Virginia. <i>The Legend of John Henry</i> is just that, a “legend,” and through the legend, John Henry became a symbol. He symbolized the many African Americans whose sweat and hard work built and maintained the rails across West Virginia. He was a symbol for the black workers who gave their lives in these dangerous occupations. The legend, as told through ballads and work songs, has kept the story of John Henry and the black railroad workers alive.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/the-legend-of-john-henry-talcott-wv.htm\">The Legend of John Henry; Talcott, WV</a></p> <h4>Driving Directions</h4> <p>Physical Address: 3262 West Virginia 3, 25951<br /> GPS Coordinates: N37.652038 -W80.762975<br /> <br /> <b>From Hinton, WV:</b> Travel south on Highway 20 to the New River bridge at the Bluestone Dam.

The state’s economic base and identity was built on and around coal mining, and a third of those miners were black. When the C&O Railway opened the state for the mining and timber industries, the sparse rural medical services were quickly overwhelmed. With the establishment of West Virginia’s three state “miners” hospitals in 1891, healthcare for all coal miners and railroad workers became available.<br /> <br /> Miner’s hospitals 1, 2 & 3 would be named for the towns where they were located; #1 the southern coalfields in Welch, #2 at the small mining town of McKendree in the heart of the New River Gorge, and #3 in the northern coalfields at Fairmont. McKendree Miners Hospital provided free medical care for coal miners and railroad workers, and charged $1.59 per day<br /> for all other patients. The patients were divided into segregated wards; there were larger wards for males, smaller wards for females, and private rooms available only to pregnant women for deliveries. A segregated whites only two-year nurses’ training program was established at the hospital in 1910.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/the-mckendree-miners-hospital-mckendree-wv.htm\">The McKendree Miner's Hospital; McKendree, WV</a>.</p> <h4>Other nearby places of interest: </h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/thurmond.htm\">Thurmond</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/thurmond-black-church.htm\">Thurmond Black Church</a></p> <h4>Driving Directions:</h4> <p><strong>Note: Tour stop is at Thurmond</strong><br /> Physical Address: Hwy 25/2, Thurmond, WV 25936<br /> GPS Coordinates: N37.957095 -W81.078851<br /> <br /> <b>From Beckley, WV: </b>Take Highway 19 north to the exit for Glen Jean.

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 6: Church and the African American Community</h3> <p>Coal mining and railroading jobs brought workers into this part of West Virginia from other parts of the country an the world including many African American laborers. The first African American industrial workers were employed in the region in the early 1870s with the construction of a branch of the C&O Railway and the opening of the Gauley-Kanawha Coal Company in Hawk’s Nest. In 1889, entrepreneurs and investors dissolved that company and created the Gauley Mountain Coal Company (GMCC), shifting coal mining from Hawk’s Nest to nearby Ansted.<br /> <br /> Consistent with the traditional establishment of African American communities, Ansted residents soon began to address their religious and spiritual needs by congregating in homes for prayer meetings. In October of 1891, a revival took place and approximately twenty candidates were received for baptism. State Missionary Reverend Coleman agreed to administer baptism and organize a church. The community soon petitioned the Gauley Mountain Coal Company to construct a church building. As in many African American communities, the Ansted African American church became the center of the community’s existence.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/church-and-the-african-american-community-mt-chapel-baptist-church-ansted-wv.htm\">Church and the African American Community: Mt.

For the first 6 years, the Bank Building was home to a jewelry store and clothing store. The upper floors were offices and apartments for Thurmond residents. For several years, Western Union Telegraph Company had its office in the building.</p> <p>In 1923, as the name suggests, the Bank of Thurmond moved into the Bank Building. For years the bank operated in the Hotel Thurmond before moving into its final location. Only a few years later, in 1931, the bank failed during the Great Depression. After the bank closed, a dry good store opened and operated for many years.</p> <p>In the 1970s, Thurmond residents Erskine and Jacqueline Pugh bought the Bank Building. Together with the other buildings on Commerical Row, they created the Banker's Club. The Banker's Club was a hotel, restaurant, and club which served whitewater rafters. People from all over the world came to raft the New River and stay in Thurmond. The Banker's Club closed in 1988.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A tall brick building sits at the far north end of a row of three buildings next to railroad tracks. A narrow gravel path a few yards wide separates the tracks from the building. This four story tall building is wide enough for six well spaced windows on the upper three floors. The first floor has two entrances. The first entrance closest to the Goodman-Kincaid build-ing is a small storefront window flush with the rest of the building and to its right a recessed door leads inside. The entrance is outlined in dark green painted wood trim. The second entrance is grand and ornate. A cement façade spans two thirds of the width of the Bank Building. The design of the façade mimics a design of equally sized marble blocks. The top says National Bank of Thurmond spanning almost the entire width of the façade. On the far right side of the façade, closest to the first entrance, is a door trimmed in dark green painted wood. Over the door is part of the cement façade with circular design that artistically places the letters NBT in a de-sign with the letters standing for National Bank of Thurmond. To the left of the entrance is a tall ornate pillar about a foot wide. A large glass win-dow trimmed in dark green painted wood says National Bank of Thur-mond. It also has other bank related symbols include a logo for Ford Mo-tor Company. To the window’s left is another ornate pillar the same de-sign as the first. To the second pillar’s left is another window with dark green painted wood trim. Words and slogans related to banking are writ-ten on the window including three percent interest on savings. The façade ends and a small portion of brick finish the building. A large grass field is to the left of the Bank Building.",

    "bodyText": "<p>At time of construction, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/nrgbridge.htm\">New River Gorge Bridge's</a> arch made it the longest steel arch bridge in the world, a title it held until 2003 with the construction of China’s Shanghai’s Lupu Bridge. It is currently the longest single-span steel arch bridge in the United States and the third highest bridge in the country. Though the bridge itself employs a fairly conventional design, its construction represents a number of construction achievements. The engineers and ironworkers overcame major obstacles due to its enormous scale and the then-remote Appalachian location.<br /> <br /> The New River Gorge Bridge is located in a once remote area of West Virginia just north of Fayetteville in Fayette County, West Virginia. The bridge is situated in the northern section of the 53-mile long New River Gorge National Park and Preserve – a unit of the National Park Service – and is surrounded by lush Appalachian Mountain forest. It carries U.S. Route 19 across the deep gorge of the New River which runs 876 feet below. A rail line runs along each side of the river at the bottom of the gorge while Fayette Station Road (State Route 82) winds its way down the steep terrain and under the bridge on both the north and south sides.<br /> <br /> The bridge is a continuous-span, open-spandrel, arch truss bridge constructed of steel. The overall length of the bridge is 3,030 feet, 6 inches (measured from center-to-center of end bearings) and the arch, the longest steel arch in the United States2 , measures 1,700 feet. The width of the bridge is 73 feet 5 inches to the outside of the parapet walls. In total, the massive structure weighs in at 88 million pounds including 21,000 tons of structural steel, 1,700 tons of reinforcing steel, 17,000 cubic yards of substructure concrete, and 6,000 cubic yards of superstructure concrete.<br /> <br /> The bridge includes four 12 foot vehicular lanes, a 6 foot 10 inch median with barrier, and two 8 foot wide shoulders with safety parapets. All structural steel for the bridge is \"COR-TEN B,\" a weathering steel that rusts when exposed to the elements for several years and eliminates the need for painting. Its chemical makeup also increases its resistance to corrosion. High-strength bolts, conforming to the standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials, were used in connections. <br /> <br /> The bridge was not only an engineering feat but also a great improvement for the economy and lives of local residents. The drive across the gorge at this location was reduced from a 45 minute drive on winding and often treacherous roads to less than a minute. Once it opened to regular traffic, the bridge completed the link to connect areas north and south of the gorge. Traffic along the route increased 140 percent with the opening of the bridge.<br /> <br /> The bridge opening had almost an immediate impact. For example, by April 1978, one trucking company reported an estimated savings in fuel and wages of approximately $3000 a day by cutting off 500 miles a week. Area hospitals located south of the bridge reported an increase in patients from north of the gorge including a 21% increase at Oak Hill Hospital, located about 15 minutes south of the gorge. Without the New River Gorge Bridge, such a trip would have taken about an hour. Prior to its opening, patients north of the gorge found it faster to get to Montgomery or Charleston for their health care needs.<br /> <br /> Every fall since 1980 festival goers converge on the small community to attend Bridge Day, the only day of the year when it is legal to walk on, as well as jump and rappel from the bridge. The festival has grown from its humble beginnings with five parachutists and a few thousand onlookers to welcome an average of 80,000 spectators every year watching nearly 400 B.A.S.E. jumpers and 300 rappellers.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 4: African American Life in a Coal Camp</h3> <p>In the late 1800s, coal became King in West Virginia. Over a sixty-year period, hundreds of coal mines were opened throughout southern West Virginia. To dig the coal, thousands of native Appalachians, African Americans, and immigrants from Europe migrated to the coal fields to work in the mines. To support the mining operations and their workers, “coal camps” became as numerous as the coal mines. Company towns, or “coal camps” as they were commonly known, were built and owned by the coal companies themselves. They provided miners and their families a place to live, a place to buy goods and services, as well as opportunities for personal and recreational activities. In 1930, there were nearly 500 coal company towns in West Virginia.</p> <p><br /> John Nuttall purchased a large tract of land in 1870 on the New River along Short Creek. With the completion of the C&O Railroad in 1873, he opened the Nuttallburg mine and began building his company town which came to be called Nuttallburg. After John Nuttall died in 1897 his heirs ran Nuttallburg until Henry Ford leased the town’s mines to provide coal for his company steel mills in the 1920s. Nuttallburg passed through three more owners after Henry Ford, then ceased production in 1958. <br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/african-american-life-in-a-coal-camp-nuttallburg.htm\">African American Life in a Coal Camp: Nuttallburg </a></p> <h4>Driving Directions:</h4> <p>Use caution when driving to Nuttallburg.

    "bodyText": "<p>Nuttallburg was one of almost fifty towns that sprang up along the New River in response to a growing nation's need for coal.</p> <p>In 1870, England-born entrepreneur <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/historyculture/john-nuttall.htm\">John Nuttall</a> saw opportunity in the coal rich New River gorge and began buying land and building infrastructure along the Keeneys Creek drainage. When the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway was completed through the gorge in 1873, the town was ready for its arrival. Nuttallburg became the second mining town in the New River gorge to ship the \"smokeless\" coal, processed from a mineral seam hundreds of feet above the river corridor and shipped to industrial cities hundreds of miles away.</p> <p>Nuttallburg was a bustling mining community by the turn of the century, continuing to thrive after Nuttall's death in 1897 under the direction of his heirs. The town became the focus of national attention in the 1920's when, in an effort known as \"vertical integration\" to gain control of all aspects of production, automobile industrialist Henry Ford leased the town's mines to provide coal for his company steel mills. The Fordson Coal Company made many improvements to the mine and town during the eight year tenure, but Ford's plan for \"vertical integration\" failed when it became evident he could neither control, nor afford to buy, the railroad that was responsible for transportation of the coal his mines produced. He sold interests in the Nuttallburg mines in 1928.<br /> <br /> The mines of Nuttallburg passed through three owners after Henry Ford, with production limited to primarily local use in later years as the market for New River coal declined. Production ceased in 1958 and Nuttallburg became like so many other riverside communities that rose and fell due to changes in the industry. A collection of empty buildings and structure-less foundations, concealed beneath trees and vines, is all that remains.</p> <h4>Nuttallburg Today </h4> <p>In 1998 the Nuttall family transferred ownership of Nuttallburg to the National Park Service. The site was inventoried, documented, and in 2005, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2011 the National Park Service completed a multi-year project that involved clearing vegetation and stabilizing structures. Today it is considered one of the most intact examples of a coal mining complex in West Virginia and one of the most complete coal related industrial sites in the United States.</p> <h4>Visiting Nuttallburg</h4> <p>Use caution when driving to Nuttallburg. The road to Nuttallburg (Kenneys Creek Road) is narrow, winding, and steep. Some places are paved while some places are gravel. Much of the road is one lane, meaning that drivers will need to pull off the side of the road to allow for passing vehicles. Large vehicles and trailers are not advisable.<br /> <br /> <br /> From Canyon Rim Visitor Center, go north on US 19 0.3 miles to the next intersection, and turn right onto Lansing-Edmond Road (County Route 5/82). Follow Lansing-Edmond Road (becomes CR 82) 6.0 miles to Winona. Turn right onto Keeneys Creek Road (CR 85/2), continue past the houses (do not cross the creek) and the road turns to gravel. Travel 4.1 miles to the main Nuttallburg parking area and restroom. Parking for disabled visitors is located an additional 0.1 miles beyond the main parking area, closer to the tipple.Winona can also be reached from the Canyon Rim Visitor Center by traveling north on US 19 to Hico 5.0 miles. Go east on US 60 (Midland Trail) 4.4 miles to Lookout, turn right onto Lansing-Edmond Road (CR 82) and go 2.1 miles to Winona, then follow the directions above for Keeneys Creek Road (CR 85/2).</p>",

The main line of the C&O Railway was completed through the gorge in the spring of 1873, and by fall the first shipment of coal was transported out of Quinnimont, making it the first mining town of New River Gorge. The town boasted a general store, post office, baseball field, hotel, jail, and railroad boarding houses. Due to segregation, there were separate churches and schools that served the black and white communities. Housing of residents was strategically segregated between racial and ethnic groups: black from white, Welsh and English from Irish, and Italians from Polish. </p> <p>As a direct result of the increasing numbers of African Americans in the New River Gorge vicinity, the New River Baptist Association was formed in 1884. A huge component of the African American community was organizing a church. Members were enthusiastic about attending Sunday services and other events. Black churches, like Quinnimont Missionary Baptist Church, served the spiritual needs of individuals within the community through regular Sunday meetings, by providing care and comfort for those in need, and supporting the significant cultural milestones of their members such as births, baptisms, marriages, and funerals.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/life-in-an-african-american-community-quinnimont-missionary-baptist-church.htm\">Life in an African American Community: Quinnimont Missionary Baptist Church</a></p> <p><br /> <u><strong>Other Nearby Places of Interest:</strong></u><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/beury-monument.htm\">Buery Monument</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/prince-depot.htm\">Prince Depot</a></p> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">Driving Directions: </span> <p><b>From Beckley, WV</b> Take Highway 41 north to Prince, WV.

The Island had swimming holes, a baseball diamond, dance platform, and most notably, a cemetery.<br /> <br /> In the mid 1890s, the island was first utilized as a pesthouse for those afflicted with smallpox. Patients who succumbed to the illness were buried on-site. Gravesites were added in the subsequent years after mining disasters and an influenza outbreak.

This trail runs parallel with Dunloup Creek on the Thurmond end of the trail, where a few foundations of the town of South Boyd can be seen. Arbuckle Creek runs parallel with the trail at the Minden end.<br /> <br /> This trail was originally constructed in 1906, as a railroad line to haul coal from the mines in Minden to the main line tracks in Thurmond.

    "bodyText": "<h3>Make Do or Do Without</h3> <p><br /> The upstream section of the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve is a different landscape from the more iconic lower gorge. This is the transition zone of the New from a broad river bordered by wide, flat bottomlands, to a narrow mountain river roaring through its deep, boulder strewn gorge. This section offered early peoples more than a transportation corridor and exposed coal seams; these flat river bottoms provided rich farmlands.<br /> <br /> American Indian archeological sites are common throughout this area, but it is the heritage of European and African settlers, specifically the Richmond family which lends the name to these lands. This side of the river has traditionally been known as “Richmond’s Bottom” and many direct descendants still live on these lands.<br /> <br /> This site offers a glimpse into the traditional lifestyle of early settlers in the New River Gorge area before the coming of the railroad, a life of self-sufficiency.<br /> Subsistence farming, “living of the land,” was a full-time job. The basic needs of food, shelter, and water were not bought; they were produced by all members of the family and guided all aspects of daily life. Chopping wood, carrying water, tending the crops and farm animals, preserving and curing food, spinning, weaving, and sewing raw flax and wool into clothing were everyday activities. Hunting wild game and gathering seasonal wild plants for food and medicinal use was a way of life. Bartering with neighbors and a few area merchants for items you could not produce on your own was a common practice. Trading a hog, eggs, or apples for coffee, lead shot, and gunpowder; or giving a share of your corn crop to the grist mill operator in exchange for ground corn meal was also a vital part of the lifestyle.<br /> <br /> The basic layout for a subsistence farmstead included the house, usually an original log cabin modified over the years with attached additions and a painted clap-board exterior, numerous outbuildings, barns, sheds, springhouse, and outhouse. Surrounding the farm, the forest was cleared and planted with corn fields, garden plots, and often apple orchards.<br /> <br /> Barns and other outbuildings provided shelter to the many domestic animals vital to the subsistence lifestyle. A horse or mule was needed to pull the plow and wagons, cows and chickens supplied milk, butter, cheese, and eggs, and beehives provided honey. Hogs, which were allowed to roam semi-wild through the forests, provided a basic source for meat, and the wool from sheep was sheared, spun, and woven for clothing.<br /> The Richmond-Hamilton house and farmstead you see today is one of several examples in the park of the final evolution and remains of the old subsistence lifestyle. The original Revolutionary War veteran land grant in this area of the New River was granted in 1796, to William Richmond, on a tract of land near the present-day Sandstone Falls (originally called Richmond’s falls).<br /> <br /> Through generations the original lands were broken up and divided amongst married children and their descendants. The last residents of this site were a railroad worker and his family who operated the farm part time to provide a secondary income.<br /> <br /> The River Road section of the park still consists of many privately owned properties which have evolved from the subsistence farmlands of the original European and African settlers from the early 1800’s. The Richmond Hamilton historic site is located two miles down the ten-mile long River Road, accessible off of Route 20 at Hinton, that dead ends at the Sandstone Falls boardwalk and day use area.<br /> <br /> River Road and Sandstone Falls covers the upper ten miles of New River Gorge National Park and Preserve and is the longest scenic riverside drive in the park. There are several public picnic, fishing, and river access areas along the way, including the Brooks Falls day use area and Big Branch trailhead. Sandstone Falls marks the dramatic transition for the New Rivers final fifty-mile rush through the New River Gorge to its confluence with the Gauley to form the Kanawha River.</p> <h3><strong> Visiting Richmond Hamilton Farm</strong></h3> <p>To get to Richmond Hamilton Farm, exit I-64 at exit 139. Take Route 20 south towards Hinton. Follow Route 20 for 10 miles south to Hinton. After reaching a traffic light, turn right on Route 20 and cross the New River. At the other side of the river turn right onto River Road. Richmond Hamilton Farm is located about two miles down River Road on your left. Watch for a break in a stone wall. There is a parking lot and vault toilet at the entrance. You can walk from there to visit two barns, an outbuilding, and the farmhouse.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>New River Gorge Waterfall Tour Stop 8:</strong><br /> <br /> The most iconic waterfall in the park is Sandstone Falls. Spanning 1,500 feet across, it is the largest waterfall on the New River. Several small islands divide the falls into different parts that drop 10 to 25 feet. <strong>Although the falls require some walking to view it, the boardwalk is short and accessible.</strong><br /> <br /> Sandstone Falls marks the transition zone of the New River from a broad river of large bottomlands, to a narrow mountain river roaring through a deep boulder strewn V- shaped gorge. The falls form the dramatic starting line for the New Rivers final rush through the New River Gorge to its confluence with the Gauley river to form the Kanawha River.<br /> <br /> Your journey to view the Sandstone Falls Boardwalk will require some driving time, but it will take you along two of the park's most scenic roads, Route 20 from I-64 at the community of Sandstone, ten miles upstream to the town of Hinton, then downstream eight miles along River Road, the park's only scenic riverside drive. Both these routes offer several overlooks, historic sites, natural areas, trails, and river access points. <br /> <br /> As you drive south, high above the river on Route 20 to Hinton you will pass two park vistas. The Sandstone Falls Overlook provides an aerial view of the falls from 600 feet above the river. Brooks Overlook looks down on the mile-long Brooks Island, a perennial bald eagle nesting site.<br /> <br /> Hinton is the southern gateway to New River Gorge National Park and Preserve. A once booming railroad center, the town has a large historic district, railroad museum, antique shops, and restaurants.<br /> <br /> After crossing the bridge at Hinton you will begin driving alongside the New River down River Road. There are great riverside vistas, several river access points, a trail, picnic area and small boardwalk view at Brooks Falls, a powerful Class III rapid. The journey ends at the Sandstone Falls day use area, where you begin your walk along the boardwalk and bridges that span the two islands below the falls.<br /> <br /> The walk begins by crossing a short bridge that spans a manmade channel that once diverted water for a water powered gristmill used for grinding the local farmers corn and wheat. The first island offers a view of the lower falls, the one half mile Island Loop Trail, and one of the most unique botanical ecosystems in West Virginia, the Appalachian riverside flat rock plant community. This community is found in only five areas in the state and consists of several southern plant species that have migrated along the north flowing New River and have adapted to the thin rock strewn soil and occasional scouring floods on this elevated island below the falls.<br /> <br /> The second bridge, a mini arch cor-ten steel structure, crosses a wide, naturally formed channel bringing you onto a low-lying island covered with a floodplain forest community and views of the impressive main falls.<br /> <br /> Sandstone Falls was created by the powerful flow of the New river eroding the soft conglomerate rock layer that lies below the hard sandstone layer from which the falls gets its name. Through eons of time as the river washed away the conglomerate beneath the harder sandstone, the precipice of the falls and the great boulders below were created. The falls are still a dynamic geological environment as slowly but surely the falls, through time are advancing upstream.<br /> <br /> A journey to Sandstone Falls provides a rare riverside scenic drive, the beautiful falls, and the dramatic interface of the New River's transformation from a broad mountain stream into a raging whitewater gorge in its final descent through the Appalachian Mountains.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Safety Advisory</strong></span>: The waters around Sandstone Falls are very swift and dangerous. Remain on the boardwalk or trails when visiting the falls. Anyone near or on the water should <strong>always</strong> wear a life jacket.</p> <h4>Directions</h4> <p>Sandstone Falls is not located at the Sandstone Visitor Center. It is an approximately 45 minute drive from the visitor center to the falls.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Travel Advisory</strong></span>: The final portion of New River Road to Sandstone Falls is narrow with no yellow line and limited passing space. Large vehicles over 25 feet in length such as RVs are not recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>If Following Waterfall Tour from Big Branch Falls</strong>: Take a left onto New River Road and continue north. The parking lot will be on the right in 4.2 miles.<br /> <br /> <strong>From Sandstone Visitor Center</strong>: Take a left out of the visitor center parking lot. Follow WV-20 S for 10.3 miles to the town of Hinton. Continue through the town of Hinton. At the traffic signal in town, turn right onto WV-20 S / Temple Street. Cross the bridge and take a right onto WV-26 / New River Road. The parking lot will be on the right in 8.3 miles.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "From a paved parking lot in the forest a wooden boardwalk extends over a rushing river 1,500 feet wide. The other shore of the river is obscured by trees on forested islands between where the river falls over brown sandstone rocks. Tree covered slopes of a deep gorge are on both shores of the river. From the parking lot, a small wide portion of the falls plunges 10 feet in shallow horseshoe shape and flows under a bridge at the start of the boardwalk. Tree branches and other vegetation litter are stuck in the rocks of falls as water flows over it. Along the quarter mile long boardwalk through trees and other vegetation, a rusty colored metal arch bridge crosses a narrow channel of water rushing away from the falls. At the end of the boardwalk, the river plunges over rocks down 25 feet into a deep pool of water.",

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 16: Segregation of African Americans</h3> <p>Thousands of African Americans migrated to West Virginia in search of jobs.  Upon their arrival, they were met with segregation and discrimination, but also with economic, political, and educational opportunities that had been denied to them in other southern states. Many towns had a “white” section and a “black” section that separated where they lived.  <br /> <br /> African Americans were also subjected to segregation at the movie theater, eating at a restaurant, attending school, and staying at a hotel. There were hotels for whites and hotels for blacks. At the movie theater, blacks had to sit in the balcony or away from the whites.  The Ritz Theatre was a place in Hinton that was segregated until the late 1950s.</p> <p><strong>Second Baptist Church:</strong></p> <p>Second Baptist Church was organized in 1878 in the home of Mrs. Henrietta Hostler of Hinton, WV. The Rev. C. H. Payne was its first pastor. The congregation met in member’s homes for several years until they could purchase for thirty-five dollars the property where the church now stands. In 1881, a wood framed building was constructed on the property and the congregation grew rapidly under the leadership of Pastor R. J. Perkins.<br /> <br /> Eventually, the original wooden structure was torn down and a larger church erected in its place. By 1925, the Church’s membership had grown so much that a larger church building was needed. In September of 1925, the corner stone was laid for the construction of a new brick sanctuary and education facility. During this time, the congregation held worship in the Odd Fellows Lodge with Rev. J. D. Woodfolk as pastor. At a cost of $45,000.00 the new facility was opened and dedicated for worship on February 13, 1927. This is the church building you see today at 212 James Street in Hinton.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/segregation-hinton-wv.htm\">Segregaton: Hinton, WV</a> </p> <h4>Other nearby places of interest:</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lincoln-school-hinton-wv.htm\">Lincoln School</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hinton-wv.htm\">Hinton, WV</a></p> <h4>Driving Directions</h4> <p>Physical Address: 210 James Street, Hinton, WV 25951<br /> GPS Coordinates: N37.672028 -W80.889716<br /> <br /> <b>From Beckley, WV: </b>Take I-64 East to Exit 139 (Hinton/Sandstone, WV).

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving Tour Stop 12: African American Music in West Virginia</h3> <p>Slab Fork, like many company owned coal camps in southern West Virginia, was home to many cultures and ethnicities. The reach of the company town extended beyond employment and a place to live. It was also the organizer of social life in the town. As migrants arrived in the coal company town looking for work, they found a common language in music. From the south, African Americans brought banjos, group harmonies, and spirituals, eastern Europeans brought brass bands and folk tunes, and Scotch-Irish immigrants brought fiddles and ballads. As the sounds mixed in the hills of the West Virginia coal camps Appalachian music was born.<br /> <br /> Often considered an Appalachian icon is the singing, dancing, and music surrounding the banjo. African American music was transformed when, in the early 1900s, guitars became readily available and affordable through mail-order catalogs. Music genres such as string band music, bluegrass, and rock ‘n’ roll are the result of the influence of black music in Appalachia.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slab Fork:</strong><br /> Slab Fork was established as a mining town in the early 1900s by the Slab Fork Coal Company. Taking is name from the Slab Fork, a tributary of the Guyandotte River, it was the first coal mine in the Winding Gulf Coal Field. The mine at Slab Fork opened in 1907 and operated until 1983. The Slab Fork mine was the first mine to ship coal out of the Winding Gulf Coal Field.<br /> <br /> Coal at Slab Fork was mined from the Beckley seam, and later from the Pocahontas No. 3 & 4 coal seams. The mine was served by the Virginian Railway which later became a part of the Norfolk & Western Railroad.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/african-american-music-in-west-virginia-slab-fork-wv.htm\">African American Music in West Virginia: Slab Fork</a></p> <h4>Driving Directions:</h4> <p>Physical Address: 374 Slab Fork Road, Slab Fork, WV 25920<br /> GPS Coordinates: N37.686920 -W81.330368<br /> <br /> <b>From Beckley, WV: </b>Travel on I-77 north or south to  Exit 42.

The school had already grown to 37 students and 10 faculty by 1933. In 1939, Stratton High School moved to a new facility on South Fayette Street which presently houses Stratton Elementary. By 1967, Stratton High School’s final year, the graduating class had grown to 109 students and consisted of 32 staff members, 10 of which were original graduates.During the 48 years that Stratton served the community as an all-black high school, it graduated 2,786 students, some of which became doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, nurses, and ministers.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/early-african-american-education-stratton-high-school-beckley-wv.htm\">Early African American Education: Stratton High School; Beckley, WV </a></p> <h4>Driving Directions:</h4> <p>Physical Address: 1129 S.

    "bodyText": "<p>During the first two decades of the 1900s, Thurmond was a classic boomtown. With the huge amounts of coal brought in from area mines, it had the largest revenue on the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway. Having many coal barons among its patrons, Thurmond's banks were the richest in the state. Fifteen passenger trains a day came through town-its depot serving as many as 95,000 passengers a year. The town's stores and saloons did a remarkable business, and its hotels and boarding houses were constantly overflowing. With the advent of diesel locomotives, and less coal coming in from local mines, the town began a steady decline. The many businesses closed down, and most residents moved on.</p> <p>Today, the town of Thurmond remains surprisingly untouched by modern development. It is a link to our past, and a town with many stories to tell. New River Gorge National River invites visitors to experience the impact of the industrial revolution, and the mission of the National Park Service to preserve our nation's heritage.</p> <p>To reach Thurmond, take U.S. Route 19 to the Glen Jean exit, north of Beckley. Follow the signs to Thurmond, seven miles down WV Route 25 (Route 25 is a narrow, winding road and is not recommended for RVs and trailers).<br /> <br /> <strong>Thurmond in Prosperous Times</strong><br /> <br /> The year 1873 marked the completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway mainline. It was also the year that Captain W. D. Thurmond acquired 73 acres along the railroad, a strategic position for developing a town.<br /> <br /> Thurmond was the heart of the New River Gorge, carrying shipments of coal from the surrounding coal fields. The town of Thurmond grew as the coal and timber industries expanded in the gorge. The rail yard was expanded to meet the railroad’s needs. By 1910, Thurmond was the chief railroad center on the C&O Railway mainline.<br /> <br /> In 1910, the C & O operation at Thurmond was first in revenue receipts, producing more freight tonnage than Cincinnati, Ohio, and Richmond, Virginia, combined. Freight was not the only key to this town’s success. Seventy-five thousand passengers passed through Thurmond in 1910, delighting in all it had to offer.<br /> <br /> At its peak, Thurmond had two hotels, two banks, restaurants, clothing stores, a jewelry store, movie theater, several dry-good stores, and many business offices. The town continued to thrive through the early decades of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> <strong>Thurmond in Decline</strong><br /> With the onset of the Great Depression, several businesses closed, including the National Bank of Thurmond. The town’s economic vitality waned after two large fires wiped out several major businesses.<br /> <br /> By the mid 1930s there were other indications that Thurmond’s heyday was ending. The American public had begun its love affair with the automobile, and good roads made travel by car easy. C & O Railway changed from steam to diesel locomotives in the 1940s. Thurmond had been a steam town, its rail yard and crews geared toward the short service intervals of steam locomotives. The switch to diesels left many of the rail yard structures and jobs obsolete.<br /> <br /> Once the heart of the New River Gorge, Thurmond remains its soul. Memories continue to be made here in the 21st century. The town is still incorporated and hosts an annual reunion for former residents.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stabilizing Thurmond’s Past for the Future</strong><br /> The Thurmond Depot was restored as a visitor center by the National Park Service in 1995. There are over twenty other park-owned structures in Thurmond. The National Park Service began a stabilization program in 2003, including repairs to preserve buildings until the time that they can be rehabilitated or restored. Work includes removal of overgrown vegetation, improvement of drainage around the buildings, installation of more permanent metal panel roofs and gutters, removal of hazardous porches and additions, the installation of window louvers to provide adequate interior ventilation and some exterior restoration work.</p>",

The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway announced the new depot would be one of the largest on the line. The new two-story Thurmond Depot opened in 1904. The first floor served travelers coming and going from Thurmond. The ticket agent’s office, baggage room, waiting rooms, and restrooms were at track level. Other services for passengers on the first floor included a snack and news room.</p> <p>The second floor housed the signal tower and telegraph office. It also had offices for the dispatcher, train master, and conductor. The decline in passenger trains in the 1960s caused the depot to undergo changes. The entire first floor joined the second floor as offices for the railroad. These offices operated until the mid-1980s when they finally closed.</p> <p>A few years later, the National Park Service acquired the depot. The park service restored the building to its classic early 1900s look. In 1995, the building opened for use as a visitor center. Today, this place gives us a glimpse of Thurmond’s lively days. Active preservation work continues to maintain its historical appearance. Thurmond remains a flag stop for Amtrak passenger trains. Amtrak added an accessibility platform in 2023.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A long yellow two-story wooden building has a sign on the side that says Thurmond. On the west side of the building is a small paved parking lot with about ten parking spaces. The narrow, unmarked road continues north of the building across the railroad tracks. Two railroad tracks sit on the east side of the building separated from a walking area by a black met-al fence. To the south of the building is a large accessibilities platform for Amtrak passengers. The outside of the building on the west side has two large covered wood-en staircases on either end. The staircase and upper porch’s trim is bright red-orange with a white railing. Doors and windows that line the upper and lower floors are trimmed with white painted wood. There are over ten different doors that give entrance to the depot. The doors on the up-per floor are labeled with office names like Conductor. The east side has no access to the upper level, but instead has its lower level covered by a small roof. Over a door in the center of the building on the west lower level is a sign that says “visitor center” hanging from the upper porch.",

    "bodyText": "<h4>Thurmond Walking Tour Stop 10</h4> <p>The town of Thurmond thrived through the early decades of the 20th century. But the Great Depression and changes to transportation began Thurmond's decline. The 1930s marked the growth of America's love for the automobile. Across the country, new roads were built and old ones were improved. Fewer people travelled by train instead choosing the more convenient automobile. Within the next few decades, Thurmond faced even more challenges. The coal mines in New River Gorge began to dry up. Mines closed, people moved out, and Thurmond was no longer needed as a major coal shipping town.</p> <p>In the 1940s, railroad companies began the switch from steam to diesel locomotives. Although some companies like the C &O Railway tried to keep steam, eventually they had to make the switch. By the 1960s, the C&O had completely switched to diesel electric locomotives. Thurmond was a steam town. It's railyards, infrastructure, and crew specialized in servicing steam locomotives. With this change, Thurmond's structures and workers became obsolete.</p> <p>Over the years, Thurmond's businesses left and its residents moved away. In the 1990s, New River Gorge National River received buildings and land at Thurmond. The National Park Service restored the Thurmond Depot as a visitor center in 1995.</p> <p>Today, the National Park Service maintains over 20 historic structures in Thurmond. The Thurmond Depot is open as a seasonal visitor center in the summer and fall. In 2003, the National Park Service began a stabilization program which continues today. This includes repairs, removal of vegetation, drainage improvement, and exterior restoration work. Historic upkeep continues at the depot to maintain its vintage 1900s appearance.</p> <p>Thurmond remains a place where people travel and make memories. Amtrak has a flag stop at Thurmond on their Cardinal route. The town is still incorporated. The mayor and city council still meet to pass ordinances and make decisions about the future of the town. Every year the town hosts a reunion for former residents. Together they recall the days of their youth in a town that was once the heart of New River Gorge.</p>",

Travel down the trail (west) to see the conveyor and tipple system used in this operation, designed by Henry Ford in the 1920s. A long battery of coke ovens lies beyond the conveyor, where coal was processed into coke for use as fuel in steel production. You can also walk back on the road from the parking area to see remains of the clubhouse and site of the post office. Cross Short Creek bridge to get a glimpse into the life of African Americans who lived in this segregated community. Note: Climbing, sitting, or walking on walls and other constructed features weakens them. Please leave historic structures and artifacts as you find them, where they help tell the story of the past.</p> <h4><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\">Note</span></h4> <p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\">Mountain bike riding is only permitted on the trail section that runs from the parking areas, crosses under the conveyor, and runs parallel with the top of the coke oven battery (see map). All visitors who want to see the front of the coke ovens or under the tipple structure must walk to these areas.<br /> <br /> Lansing-Edmond Road and Keeneys Creek Road are both very small, curvy roads, including some single lane sections. Use caution while driving and be prepared to cooperate with other drivers; this may include backing up!</span></p> <h4>To reach the trailhead</h4> <p>Turn onto Lansing-Edmond Road (CO 5/82) off US 19 in Lansing, just north of Canyon Rim Visitor Center.

    "bodyText": "<p><em>Since the previous evening the temperature has dropped. You can feel in it your bones, not to mention the goose pimples scattered throughout your arms and legs. As you heave yourself out of bed your feet hit the cold wooden floor, adding insult to your injury. Your breath creates a frozen vapor as you walk over to the furnace. You realize that you didn't put enough wood in the stove, as you open the furnace and only see the dying red embers. Slowly you put on your boots, jacket, mittens, and walk out into the eerily white darkness of a February West Virginia morning. It's been a long winter. The fruits and vegetables your family canned during autumn have sustained everyone to this point, but how much longer can they last? Deer meat was frequent in November and December, but it's been too cold lately to see any deer. Too much snow; the deer aren't able to forage like they usually do. The firewood pile keeps getting smaller too. At the beginning of the month, you'd figured you had enough to last at least until March. But alas, February is cruel, and a family has to stay warm. You'll fell a couple of locust trees today, and spend the day chopping wood. That is of course after you feed the animals and inspect for any signs of game.</em><br /> <br /> Many visitors coming to New River Gorge National Park and Preserve have never experienced the harsh realities of subsidence farming. As the colonization of the United States lead to Western Expansion, most immigrants passed right by West Virginia. It's not a slight against the area, but simply a reality that a flat crop field in a place like Iowa or Ohio is more suitable for living than a harsh mountainous area such as the Appalachians. The people who stayed became mountaineers: tough durable people who lived off the land. They didn't thrive, and quite frankly some died. But their legacy is living through droughts, harsh winters, and practical starvations, to create farms, then towns, and eventually the State of West Virginia. Here at New River Gorge National Park and Preserve you have a chance to visit one of these special homesteads. The Trump-Lilly Farm is primarily preserved, and if you're ready, it's ready to take you back to the days of subsistence farming.</p> <p>The property title of this building can be traced back to the early 18th century. The earliest land owners of this tract of property were probably Samuel L. Hopkins and Alexander Stuart Both of these men were recipients of huge land grants given out during the infancy of the United States. The roots of settlement of the Trump-Lilly farm can be tied directly to Peter Davis. Davis bought the parcels of land from Alexander Stuart and settled down on the New River between 1810 and 1815. In 1850, Davis sold 150 acres to man named William Richmond. William Richmond was the patriarch of the Richmond family. It was under his stewardship that the Richmond family built a grist mill and established a post office and general store around the area of Richmond Falls. (Sandstone Falls today). In 1888, Richmond gave the tract of land which is officially Trump-Lilly Farm to his daughter Mary E. (Richmond) Trump. The 1880 census reports that Mary Richmond (Trump) was a 28 year old unmarried female. It is believed the first homestead on Trump-Lilly farm was built at this time. From 1905 to 1912, the farm land was sold various times, until finally Aden J. Lilly purchased the property from the New River Land Company. The subsistence farming practices of the Lilly family are what are preserved today by the National Park Service.</p> <p>Just a county over in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, there were scores of large farms at the time. They provided their owners with subsistence and a crash crop. Aden Lilly did not have the luxury of creating a cash crop. Everything grown was for subsistence, either for consumption or for trade. The family harvested timber to meet their building and heating needs, and to also create new crop fields. They planted apple orchards and had rows of vegetables. They raised sheep. The lambs that they would sell in the fall provided income to pay the farm's taxes and to buy school books for the children. Wool from the rest of the sheep provided clothes and additional money to buy supplies for the winter. They were not isolated. Theirs was one of many farms around the area. Farmers helped each other with their harvests. They shared cane mills to make molasses, and if they needed something they couldn't make themselves, they would make the trek to Hinton on horseback to trade their harvest items for sugar, salt, and farm equipment. Livestock were fed each morning before breakfast. Aden Lilly raised Poland China hogs, chickens, and three to four milk cows. The pork meat was always salted so it would be preserved.</p> <p>Growing up on the farm would be a vastly different experience than growing in today's technologically advanced society. Instead of electric heat, the house was heated by wood stove. There was not refrigerator or electricity until the 1940's, and the family would store their food in root cellars. The Lilly children entertained themselves with spelling and arithmetic drills. There was a Croby battery radio and an organ case piano on the property. The Lilly's attended regular church devotions.</p> <p>Today the Trump-Lilly farm is not entirely what it once was. Some of the fields have been taken back by nature. When Aden Lilly sold the farm to his son Oba in 1963, Oba did not live at the farm. He planted crops, but visited the farm irregularly. Oba sold the farm to David Rosenberger who used the property as a vacation rental. Rosenberger sold it to the National Park Service in 1989. The house and other structures have weathered over time, and the wide open fields of crops no longer remain. Today only a glimpse exists of what the Trump-Lilly was, but that glimpse is an eye opening experience into the strife and struggle of the Lilly's and other early Appalachian subsistence farmers; a collage of vegetables, fruits, and livestock flourishing in early 20th century Sewell Mountain.</p> <p><strong>To visit Trump-Lilly Farm:</strong></p> <p>To reach Trump Lilly farm use WV county road 26 (River Road just outside Hinton) north approximately fifty yards from its intersection with State Route 20, then follow a gravel road (the first left after crossing Madam's Creek Bridge - marked Freezeland Mountain) along its winding ascent through second growth forest to the site. The rugged unpaved road is characterized by a number of sharp turns, steep grades and panoramic views of Hinton and the New River below. There is a small parking lot at the farm. It can be a bit tricky to find both the gravel road and the farm (at this time there are no signs at the farm). It is recommended that visitors stop by the Sandstone Visitor Center to talk to a ranger and get directions and up to date road conditions.</p> <p><br />  </p> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<h4>Thurmond Walking Tour Stop 3</h4> <p>Thurmond was more than a railroad town, it was a steam town. The steam locomotives of Thurmond constantly needed water. In 1914, the C&O Railway built an elevated steel tower water tank with a 100,000 gallon capacity. In 1927, they added a steel standpipe water tank that held 210,000 gallons of water. Both tanks served five water columns, pipes used to fill steam locomotives with water. The tanks also provided water to the engine house and the fire hose house.</p> <p>In the 1950s, many railways began switching from steam locomotives to diesel locomotives. Diesel locomotives do not have the water requirements of their steam counterparts. Water columns were no longer needed. CSX Transportation, modern-day C&O Railway, removed the tanks in 1998. All that remains of the water tanks are the cement foundations.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>African American Heritage Driving tour Stop 3: Carter G. Woodson</h3> <p>Located on Keeneys Creek in the highlands north of the lower New River Gorge, Winona is inhabited, though little is left of the community. The entire site of present-day Winona was owned by Robert M. Holliday, Sr., farmer and pioneer settler who came to the area prior to the Civil War. The mineral rights to Holliday's land were purchased by John Nuttall in December of 1870. The Winona post office was named for Winona Gwinn, oldest daughter of William Gwinn, who operated a hotel in the town.<br /> <br /> The development of the coal lands surrounding Winona occurred due to the efforts of John Nuttall, who had by the 1880s acquired a tract of 30,000 acres of coal lands along Keeneys Creek in the highlands above his coal operations in the New River Gorge at Nuttallburg, which he had opened in 1873. <br /> <br /> Carter G. Woodson spent his formative years in West Virginia as a coal miner in Nuttallburg and a teacher in Winona. He went on to start Negro History Week, which eventually became Black History Month.<br /> <br /> The tour stop is at the Keeney's Creek Baptist Church.<br /> <br /> For the full story go to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/carter-g-woodson-winona-wv.htm\">Carter G. Woodson: Winona, WV</a><br /> <br /> Before Dr. Carter G. Woodson, there was very little accurate written history about the lives and experiences of Americans of African descent. Today a National Historic Site, Dr. Woodson’s home served as the headquarters for the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. To learn more about Carter G. Woodson, visit <a href=\"www.nps.gov/cawo/index.htm\">Carter G.

    "audioDescription": "A rocky dirt trail ascends up on the side of a gorge through trees and vegetation. On the side of the trail, water cascades down the side of the gorge over moss and vegetation covered rocks. The water flows into a manmade cement structure that pools the water in a small channel that directs the water to flow underneath the trail. Green algae, moss, and other aquatic vegetation grows in the water. Some water splashes out of the channel onto the trail forming small puddles. Across the trail, the gorge slopes steeply down towards a 30-foot-wide creek flowing near the road towards the New River. The water from the falls flows out of a large black plastic pipe and splashes its way down to join the creek.",

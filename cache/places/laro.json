It was designed by architect Marcel Breuer to resemble a generator rotor. An evening <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/pn/grandcoulee/visit/laser.html\">laser light show</a> was added in 1989. The center was retrofitted in 2004 for seismic, life-safety, and accessibility standards. The original laser equipment was replaced in 2013, and a new laser light show, “One River, Many Voices,” premiered in 2014.</p> <p>In 2006, new exhibits and displays were installed. The exhibits highlight Grand Coulee’s role as one of the main irrigation, flood control, and hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. They also describe the effects the dam has had on various groups of people, including Native Americans and early settlers. The new exhibits were designed, manufactured, and installed by Formations, Inc., of Portland, Oregon. </p> <p>This visitor center is fully accessible and features hands-on exhibits and an auditorium. Service animals are allowed inside the visitor center.</p>",

Beyond the pit toilet are pine trees and cliffs of dark rock several hundred feet high. 150 feet to your right is the boat ramp and beach. The boat ramp is concrete, 20-feet-wide, and extends to the water line. The beach is sandy and stretches as far as you can see, and the water level varies by season. The lake is approximately a mile wide and the opposite shore contains bare, gently sloping hills with occasional steep cliffs of grey rock. Behind you, the parking lot extends for another 300 feet, before becoming grass with scattered pine trees. Left from the information kiosk is the entrance into the paved parking lot, beyond which is the paved entrance road, a neighborhood, and more tall, dark cliffs withs scattered trees.",

Behind the road is a low gravel hill with low bushes. Rising above this hill are cliffs of dark rock several hundred feet high with thick clumps of pine trees on the lower slopes. Behind you, the paved parking area continues for 300 feet. The edge of the parking area and the shoreline of the lake stretches all along your right-hand side, approximately 150 feet away. Halfway across the lakeside edge of the parking area are two low signs with information on the history and geology of the area. The terrain on the opposite side of the lake varies. Almost directly behind you and stretching to your direct right, the opposite shore of lake to the northeast is several miles away and contains mountainous terrain with scattered forest. From your direct right to your slight right, the opposite shore to the north is .75 miles away and bare, with low sandy hills. The boat launch is 80 feet to your right. The ramp is 60 feet wide, concrete and extends to the waterline. In the middle of the ramp is a 100-foot-long floating metal dock. 30 feet to your right is a sign with three upright panels on boating safety.",

Throughout the region, the fur traders promoted their coming to the Native Americans. Representatives from five tribes came. For three days, the priests along with translators conducted religious services, including daily mass and 19 baptisms. Their activities marked the first Catholic presence in the region between the Cascade and Rocky Mountains. As they left the trading post, the priests promised the fur traders and natives that someone would return to establish a mission for the Upper Columbia River.</p>   <p>In 1847, Father Peter de Vos began his year-long residency at St. Paul’s. With assistance from fur traders at Fort Colvile, he began construction of a larger, substantial chapel to function both as a residence and a mission. Several cedar logs were chiseled and handhewn into beams for the frame. Instead of nails, pegs were used to keep the beams in place. White mud was chinked into the walls to prevent drafts. The building also featured glass windows. Two wood-burning stoves were installed to provide heat during the cold winter. By the end of the year, building of the mission was complete.<br /> <br /> Learn more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/laro/learn/historyculture/stpauls-mission.htm\">history of St. Paul’s Mission</a>.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "St. Paul's Mission is located at the end of a dirt road that served as the portage road to transport boats around the Kettle Falls. The building sits on a bluff surrounded by pine trees and is a rough hewn log building with no furniture inside. Outside, to the left facing the building, is the beginning of the Mission Point interpretive trail. Follow the trail to learn about Kettle Falls, the Hudson Bay Company, Fort Colvile, and the MacDonald family that operated the trading post there.",

Waddy shared with Alice an interest in colonial history and the Colonial Revival, so it is no surprise she chose him to design her little garden sanctuary on the east wall of the former billiards room (now the site's visitor center).</p> <p>The defining feature of this small garden is a wide bench sheltered by a thirty-foot-wide tri-part arched trellis structure. The design of this structure is both distinctively Colonial Revival and Classical Revival in character; it modestly evokes triumphal arches and Romanesque church architecture. A terracotta and metal-reinforced concrete bas-relief sculpture of the Madonna and child once adorned the apse above the central bench.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Alice’s Garden occupies the space between the white lattice fence of the Formal Garden and the steps to the veranda, abutting the visitor’s center. The yellow clapboard wall of the one-story visitor center spans the width of the west side of the garden. This garden is most notable for its white trellis made of three arched faces of latticework with space for a white wooden bench in the center arch. The lattice normally supports clematis vines during the growing season. The flower beds beneath the lattice include hostas, ferns, and other plants and are bordered by a low-clipped hedge of Japanese barberry. A second row of barberry running parallel to the planting bed marks the eastern edge of a turf path and defines the outer edge of Alice’s Garden. A black metal pipe arbor stands on the northern end of the garden and is used to support more clematis vines. The walkways of this garden are grass.",

A popular legend claims that George Washington took command of the army under the “Washington Elm” but there is no historical evidence to support this claim. The tree fell due to disease in the 1920s. Throughout the Boston Campaign, the Cambridge Common was used by the Continental Army as a place for drill and encampment. Today Cambridge Common has several monuments, including a plaque representing where the Washington Elm once stood, as well as a nearby trio of cannons dedicated to Revolutionary War figures. The cannons are dedicated to Brigadier General Tadeusz Kościuszko, Major General and Boston native Henry Knox, as well as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">George Washington</a>. In other spots in the common, there is a Civil War monument and another dedicated to victims of the Irish Famine.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Cambridge Common is an 8.5 acre public park bordered by Massachusetts Avenue, Waterhouse Street, and Garden Street. Roughly triangular in shape, the park has a large playground for children surrounded by trees as well as a grassy field for playing soccer or other sports. There are many paved walking paths crossing the common. Most of these paths intersect in the large brick-paved circle that surrounds a Civil War monument. The Civil War monument is a tall white stone structure topped with a stone statue of a Civil War soldier leaning on his rifle. The middle section of the monument has four arches cut out of it, through which you can see a metal sculpture of Abraham Lincoln. Each of the four sides of the base of the monument has three metal plaques that tell the names of Massachusetts soldiers who died in the Civil War. The monument is surrounded by stone benches. Nearby is the memorial to the victims of the Irish Famine. This monument consists of a stone block topped with a green metal sculpture of a seated woman reaching a hand out to a standing man. He reaches back to her with one hand, while his other arm holds a child. One side of the stone block is carved with “An Gorta Mór--The Great Hunger/ Ireland 1845-1850/Dedicated by the President of Ireland Mary Robinson July 22, 1997”; the other side is carved with “Never again should a people starve in a world of plenty.” Near the Irish Famine memorial is the Prince Hall monument, which is dedicated to the first Black Grand Master of the Freemasons. The monument consists of five tall slabs of black stone, which are engraved with excerpts of Prince Hall’s speeches and writings.",

Most of the founding members of the congregation were from the wealthy families that lived along Brattle Street, many of whom later became loyalists during the conflict. By 1774, with the church building you see today still incomplete, many of these loyalist congregants fled Cambridge for the safety of Boston and England. Due to the church's reputation as a loyalist organization, the Continental Army took control of the building and housed soldiers there during the Siege of Boston. Martha and George Washington forestalled the church's destruction when they requested to hold service there in December of 1775, but this spark of interest was not enough to save the church immediately. The building remained closed and in disrepair for nearly 15 years. By the end of the 1700s, however, a new Episcopal congregation reopened the church. That new congregation is still active there today.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Christ Church building is made of wood and placed on a granite foundation. Looking at the building from the street, there is a tall central tower with a shorter section on each side. Each of these shorter sections has a large window composed of many small panes of glass.

Small earthwork fortifications, such as the one at the heart of Fort Washington Park, “were built to prevent the movement of British troops up the Charles River.”</p> <p>Since historical preservation was not a priority for the fledgling United States government following the Revolution, all but one of the fortifications the army had built were either plowed over by farmers or built over by developers. The three-gun battery that is the centerpiece of Fort Washington Park survived thanks to a local family’s efforts to carefully preserve it. In 1858, the location was restored by the collaborative efforts of the City of Cambridge and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The chief monument of the Charles River Basin and the structure which does more than any other to formalize the planning of the river is the Longfellow Bridge, designed, the bridge commissioners wrote in 1900, \"to furnish the eastern boundary of a great park system along 18 miles of river...destined to be the most beautiful park in the country. It is the present purpose, to make the new Cambridge Bridge one of the finest and most beautiful structures in the world.\" The Longfellow Bridge was authorized by the same 1894 legislation which authorized the Boston Transit Commission, the Tremont Subway, and the Charlestown Bridge. Like the Tremont Street Subway, the Longfellow Bridge was in large part a result of heavy streetcar congestion brought about by the increased traffic of the new electric cars. The old West Boston Bridge, constructed in 1793 and rebuilt in 1854, had been on the very first route to carry horsecar traffic, in 1856. Originally known as the Cambridge Bridge, the present structure was begun in July 1900 and completed in 1907, named for Cambridge poet <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-wadsworth-longfellow.htm\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> in the centennial year of his birth.</p> <p>Though not the original structure, in 1855 the bridge into Cambridge played a role in the fugitive slave case of John Jackson. Escaping enslavement in Virginia, Jackson settled in Boston and found work on a coasting vessel. However, after being in Boston for a couple of weeks, Jackson’s former enslaver learned of his whereabouts and sent slave catchers to apprehend him. According to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-liberator.htm\">The Liberator</a>, while walking home from work in January of 1855 Jackson, “was accosted by a white man who, from the description given, answers very well for a noted slave-catcher of this city, and asked if his name was not Jackson.”<sup>1</sup> Jackson refused to give his name and, when pressed about his home address, Jackson lied, telling the slave catcher he lived in Cambridge.</p> <p>Believing this lie, Marshall Asa Butman hoped to catch Jackson on his way to work. The next day, as reported by <em>The Massachusetts Spy</em>, “Notorious Asa O. Butman was seen to take a position upon the bridge early on Wednesday morning where he remained for about three hours.”<sup>2</sup> Butman, the slave catcher that arrested <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>, did not get a chance to apprehend John Jackson. Jackson, with the aid of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">Boston Vigilance Committee</a>, left Boston and relocated to Worchester, remaining free for the rest of his life.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/486365b2-0027-4247-a314-ffc92add7123\"><img alt=\"Handwritten record listing R.F.

    "bodyText": "<p>In 1847, the Longfellows hired English landscaper Richard Dolben to design a formal garden behind their Cambridge mansion. The result was an Italian Renaissance garden with a Gothic “rose window” in the center and an overall Persian carpet pattern; remnants of this design can still be seen today.</p> <p>Following Henry Longfellow’s death in 1882, the garden fell into disrepair. The poet’s daughter, Alice Longfellow, took an interest in the garden, hiring one of America’s first female landscape architects, Martha Brookes Hutcheson, to restore it in 1904. Hutcheson reestablished the original boxwood parterres, then enclosed the garden with fences, gates, and a pergola to make an “outdoor room,” typical of the Colonial Revival style.</p> <p>At the center of the garden, Alice Longfellow placed a sundial inscribed “Pensa che questa di mai non raggiorna” or “Think that this day will never dawn again.” It was a favorite line of her father’s from Dante’s <em>Purgatorio</em>.</p> <p>In 1924, Longfellow hired Ellen Biddle Shipman to rejuvenate the space. She was known for her painterly design, enclosed spaces, and for emphasizing the relationship between garden and house. Shipman planted the rectangular borders with heirloom roses and added evergreens and ornamental fruit trees to give the garden height. Just as importantly, Shipman made detailed planting diagrams and cultivar lists for future maintenance.</p> <p>In the late 20th century the garden again fell into disrepair, and only the smaller center portion of the garden was maintained by the Cambridge Plant and Garden Club. In 2003, the Friends of Longfellow House-Washington’s Headquarters funded the restoration of the garden. Using Shipman’s extensive documentation and heirloom varieties of plants, Alice Longfellow’s Colonial Revival garden has been recreated for visitors to enjoy today. The pergola and fences are reproductions of the 1904 originals, the flowers are varieties and colors enjoyed by Alice Longfellow, and the central rose window feature honors the Victorian design.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Formal Garden is located adjacent to the northern border of the property, to the east of the Carriage House and north of the East Lawn. Visitors may enter the garden from three entrances. These entrances are the pedimented archway next to the carriage house, a gate on the southwestern border by Alice’s Garden, and another gate on the southeastern border adjacent to the eastern property boundary. The Colonial Revival-style garden design is intended to resemble a Persian carpet, having a circular teardrop pattern at the center with geometric beds on the eastern and western sides. Linear flower beds line each border except for the eastern border, which is occupied by a large pergola that has a few vines growing on it and normally has benches underneath it to provide a shady place for guests to sit and enjoy the garden. Short boxwoods border each flower bed to reinforce the geometric garden layout and the flower beds are planted with a variety of flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The western flower beds are dedicated to a variety of roses. Small ornamental trees are planted within the teardrop beds and flanking the pergola. The center of the Formal Garden is marked by a four-foot-tall column supporting a metal armillary sundial with the words “Pensa che questo di mai non raggiorna” (“Think that this day will never dawn again”) inscribed on the sundial’s base. The southern and western borders for the garden are marked by low three-foot-tall white lattice fencing. The northern border of the Formal Garden features a wide border of evergreen vegetation, creating a dense screen that entirely blocks the view of adjacent properties. Here, as elsewhere, the pathways are made of stone dust.",

    "audioDescription": "Longfellow House-Washington’s Headquarters National Historic Site is set a few hundred feet off of Brattle Street. There is a straight paved path that cuts in between green manicured lawn up to three-part brick stairs that go to the front door. The stairs are flanked by two white fences that extend into the lawn. The House is a classic example of Georgian style symmetrical architecture. The light yellow house has three stories, with white trim. The first story has a white front door at the center with two windows on each side, totaling four. All the windows have dark shutters, including the second floor. The second floor has a total of five windows with the four parallel to the first floor and an additional window in the center where the door would be on the first floor. The third floor has two dormer style windows that protrude from the grayish-black tiled roof also highlighted with white and have no shutters. On the roof, two yellow chimneys extend from the left and right sides, with a small railing fence in between them. The left side of the house has a gravel driveway that goes behind the house to an existing yellow carriage house in the same style and color as the house.",

In 1759, John Vassall, Esquire used his family’s wealth – which derived from Jamaican sugar plantations – to purchase large plots of land in Cambridge and build the mansion you see today. Vassall built this house in a traditional Georgian style, having a rectangular shape and symmetrical design typical of that era. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b01f525c-fcd9-4b55-a42c-5244fee202ca}{224}\" paraid=\"1931254607\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{b01f525c-fcd9-4b55-a42c-5244fee202ca}{228}\" paraid=\"1566385727\">When the Craigies bought this property in 1792, they focused on embellishing the landscape to show off their wealth. Here at the front of the property, the Craigies removed part of the brick wall replaced it with the wooden fencing you see today (a popular trend of the era). It is also likely that prior to the Craigies, a circular driveway was in front of the house, which the Craigies then moved to the western side (where you see the carriage loop today). </p> <p paraeid=\"{80ecc1a4-42d0-4682-99ba-0c87168c18f6}{3}\" paraid=\"771452523\">Later on, the Longfellows added to the Forecourt in a way that embellished and attempted to preserve the house’s charm. The lilac beds you see today were first planted by the Longfellows to shield the Forecourt and home from the bustling noise on Brattle Street. Furthermore, Henry Longfellow preserved the elm trees in the Forecourt the best he could. He believed the elms dated to Washington’s era, writing that “the magnificent elms… signalized the place and under whose shadow Washington had walked.” In 1872, Henry also added the balustrade (fence-like structure) you see running along the path leading to the sides of the house. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Forecourt is the front yard of the house that abuts Brattle Street. The border facing Brattle Street is lined with taupe-colored, Chippendale-patterned woodwork fencing and brick walls. An entrance for pedestrians is at the midpoint of the fence line. Walking through the visitor entrance, guests pass between dense masses of lilac shrubs and tall elm trees, following a path that leads directly to the front door of the house. The yellow house is built in a Georgian design, having symmetrical features like the windows and black shutters as well as four white pilasters that decorate the front of the house. The landscape is designed to give a sense of grandeur and the topography of the forecourt is organized into three levels of elevation that grow higher leading to the house. Three short flights of sandstone steps lead to the house, raising each terrace about two feet from the prior. A white wooden balustrade with woodbine growing underneath accentuates the edge of the first terrace and behind it is a stone dust pathway that runs east/west and curves around the sides of the house to provide easy direction.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Mount Auburn Cemetery is the first landscaped rural or “garden” cemetery in the United States. Established in 1831 in Watertown and Cambridge, Massachusetts, the cemetery was not only designed as a resting place for the deceased, but also as an attraction and pleasure ground, with picturesque landscapes, winding paths, a variety of horticulture, and sculptural art. Its success inspired other cemeteries’ designs and in turn articulated the need for public parks and gardens launching the American parks movement.<br /> <br /> In the early 19th century, Dr. Jacob Bigelow’s concern that crowded cemeteries in congested urban areas might promote the spread of contagious diseases spawned his idea for Mount Auburn Cemetery. In 1825, Bigelow, a Boston physician and Harvard professor, invited a group of civic leaders to his house and proposed that they establish a new kind of cemetery. Located on the outskirts of the city, the new cemetery would place family burial lots in a landscaped setting filled with trees, shrubs, and flowers. In 1831, Bigelow’s idea became a reality when the newly formed Massachusetts Horticultural Society agreed to take a lead role in developing a rural cemetery. They located a 72-acre farm in Watertown and Cambridge that was an ideal location for the cemetery and for an associated experimental horticultural garden. The key feature was a 125-foot central hill that provided spectacular views of Boston and Cambridge.<br /> <br /> Henry A.S. Dearborn, President of the Massachusetts Horticultural Association, was largely responsible for the cemetery’s design. Influenced by European naturalistic landscape design ideas, Dearborn incorporated ideas from English landscaped parks and the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris into his design for Mount Auburn Cemetery. Working with civil engineer Alexander Wardworth, Dearborn laid out the cemetery with winding roads that followed the natural contours of the land, naturalistic landscaping elements including wooded areas and reflective ponds, and panoramic views from the central hill’s summit.<br /> <br /> Dearborn also established a separate experimental garden at Mount Auburn, planted with many domestic and exotic varieties of fruits, flowers, and vegetables. As news of the garden cemetery spread, horticulturalists from around the world sent gifts of seeds, including magnolia trees from Ohio and vegetable seeds from the London Horticultural Society. These gift plantings became part of both the horticultural garden and cemetery. By the end of the 1830s, Mount Auburn had several hundred trees planted.<br /> <br /> The popularity of the new cemetery grew, and new cemetery lots sold quickly. In 1835, the cemetery became a private nonprofit corporation severing its relationship with Dearborn, and the experiential garden ended. The cemetery has continued to embrace horticultural experimentation and high standards of horticultural maintenance and practices as part of its mission.<br /> <br /> Mount Auburn Cemetery has played an important role in conservation thinking by creating a designed landscape open to the public. The popularity of the design led to political support for local and regional parks and park systems. Mount Auburn has continued to incorporate conservation ideas over time. By 1870, with the growing interest in Mount Auburn as a destination for birdwatching, the Mount Auburn Trustees established a Committee on Birds that recommended plantings of trees and fruit-bearing shrubs that would attract birds. In the 20th century, Mount Auburn President Oakes Ingalls Ames further developed the cemetery’s landscape as an arboretum and a bird sanctuary with his “hands-on” approach to managing the cemetery.<br /> <br /> Mount Auburn Cemetery currently has a collection of over 5,500 trees, shrubs and other plants from around the world that cover the 175-acre cemetery. More than half of the trees on the grounds display labels, which give the botanic and common names, the date planted, and the native range of the species. Mount Auburn is also designated as a Massachusetts Important Bird Area. Some current conservation initiatives include planting native New England plants in the Consecration Dell area, managing the four ponds to provide good habitat for wildlife, and practicing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for control of insects.<br /> <br /> Many famous Bostonians lie buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. Some have important conservation connections, including Jacob Bigelow (founder of Mount Auburn Cemetery), landscape architect Charles Eliot, activist Harriet Lawrence Hemenway (founder of Massachusetts Audubon Society), Horace Gray (who established a horticultural garden in the Boston Public Garden in 1838), Asa Gray (American botanist), and ornithologists William Brewster and Ludlow Griscom. Other distinguished people include Henry Cabot Lodge and Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. (U.S. senators), Dorothea Dix (activist), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/henry-wadsworth-longfellow.htm\">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> (educator and poet), Oliver Wendell Holmes (author and poet), Julia Ward Howe (author and reformer), and Charles Sumner (abolitionist and U.S. senator). The Secretary of the Interior designated the cemetery a National Historic Landmark in 2003.<br /> <br /> Mount Auburn Cemetery is located at 580 Mount Auburn St. in Watertown and Cambridge, MA. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

It is a symmetrical, two story home, with grey clapboards, large dentil molding, a cupola and three brick chimneys on the roof. The entrance to the home is on the western façade and consists of a red door, white trim, rectangular pediment that extends a few feet off the façade, and is completed by two white columns. This side of the house has eight symmetrical windows with black shutters on each, four on each floor. The grey roof features four dormer windows with white trim. The front path is flanked by large green hedges. A smaller, modern two-story addition extends off the right wall on this façade. The north façade sits on Brattle Street and is separated by a stone fence over five feet tall from the red brick sidewalk. There are ten symmetrical windows with white trim and black shutters on this side, five on each floor. On this side of the house, a large tree shades the sidewalk, a good place to view it from. Often, an early form of the American flag with elements of the Union Jack is flown from this façade.",

    "audioDescription": "This yellow two-story colonial house is nestled behind Harvard’s modern Monroe C. Gutman library. The façade of the house is symmetrical, with four windows on either side. A large black windowless door sits in the center with a triangular pediment above it. Also above the door sits a 9th rectangular window. The doors and all the windows have white trim. On the roof, there are two symmetrical chimneys and two dormer windows. There is a crescent walkway in front of the houses' entrance, made of segments of brick and granite. Where the crescent walkway meets the path from the library, it forms a circle garden bed with green ground cover and a single tree. At the bed’s southern edge, there is a shaded wooden bench to sit on.",

When <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">General George Washington</a> first arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts on July 2, 1775 to take command of the Continental Army, it was here that he first set up his headquarters. George Washington spent about two weeks here before moving into the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/longfellow-house-washingtons-headquarters.htm\">Vassall estate</a> several blocks away, on July 15, 1775.</p> <p>Although Washington’s time at Wadsworth House was short, he certainly kept busy during his stay. The day after arriving in Cambridge, Washington rode from here to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cambridge-common.htm\">Cambridge Common</a> to officially take command of the troops. At the end of his first week in Cambridge, on July 9, 1775, Washington convened the first Council of War, and they are believed to have held their meeting in Wadsworth House. Washington also entertained a number of notable people here, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abigail-adams.htm\">Abigail Adams</a>. In fact, their interaction here at Wadsworth House is believed to be the only time they met throughout the entire Siege of Boston, which lasted for nearly a year.</p>",

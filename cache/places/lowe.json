In 1956 he represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, a major international art exhibition. His sculptures are presently on view in museums and public spaces all over the world. Although the artist considered himself a \"traditional sculptor,\" most of his work is abstract in style. He reduces ideas and complex visual information into simpler forms. His shapes are often based on natural forms and have an organic energy.<br /> <br /> Site: Lower Locks, at the junction of the Pawtucket and Eastern Canals<br /> Artist: Dimitri Hadzi<br /> Materials: Bronze and granite",

Five of his novels are set in Lowell and his writings are part of the city's cultural heritage.<br /> <br /> Excepts from 10 of Kerouac's 20 books appear on eight triangular, polished, reddish-brown granite columns, creating a literary giant's memorial in language. The granite was quarried in South Dakota, and cut in Minnesota. West Virginia graphic designers worked on the text. The paved path, shaped as a cross and series of circles, refers to Kerouac's Roman Catholic and Buddhist beliefs, and evokes his lifelong spiritual quest. The design is reminiscent of a mandala, a pattern symbolizing the universe.<br /> <br /> The artist, Ben Woitena, of Houston, Texas, knows Kerouac's work well. His design was selected in a national competition. Woitena was a faculty member at Glassel School for 27 years. His preferred medium is welded and painted steel, and his sculptures are found at public sites all over Texas, including the Houston and San Antonio Museums of Fine Art, and the State Capital Building.<br /> <br /> Site: Eastern Canal Park, Bridge and French Street<br /> Artist: Ben Woitena<br /> Materials: Granite and Stainless Steel",

    "bodyText": "<br /> This twenty-foot-high kinetic sculpture captures the essence of flowing water with sunlight and sound. This piece, which illustrates the theme of \"the power of water,\" won a nationwide design competition. Ihara designed his piece so that originally the fountain's flow would move the 40 copper-colored steel cubes, which are arranged in a pyramid pattern. Today wind spins the cubes and simulates the sparkling quality of water as it is moved by wind and light plays upon it. Pawtucket is a Native American word for \"falling water.\"<br /> <br /> A graduate of Tokyo University, Micho Ihara is a former fellow of the Center for Advanced Visual Studies of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has recieved awards from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the Graham Foundation. Since 1956 Ihara has produced more than 50 commissioned works in this country, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore. His art is on view at the International Building of Rockefeller Center in New York City and Neiman-Marcus in Beverly Hills. A number of his works are kinetically engineered to move in the wind. \"Composing music must be very close to the process of orchestrating the structure of my sculpture,\" the artist says. Although he works with metal, usually stainless steel, his sculptures are much more about air and light.<br /> <br /> Site: Overlooking the confluence of the Pawtucket Canal and Concord River<br /> Artist: Michio Ihara<br /> Materials: Stainless and gold-plated steel",

    "bodyText": "These three pieces are derived from Lowell's industrial symbols. They are intended to be objects for seating and climbing, functioning as a kind of furniture as well as visual art.<br /> <br /> Sculpture One is a six-ton silhouette of Francis Cabot Lowell (1774-1817), the early textile manufacturer for whom the city is named. Sculpture Two is a tipped, mammoth, granite thread spool mounted on a granite base, which can also be seen as a spindle or beehive, symbolizing hard work and industry. Sculpture Three is a saw-toothed horizontal piece that might be the roofline of a boardinghouse or factory, or, perhaps, gears belonging to textile machinery. The ten-foot high spindle or smokestack is located near the entrance to the Boott Cotton Mills and emulates its red-brick chimney. The Lowell Sculptures was the winner of a nationwide design competition.<br /> <br /> Connecticut artist Robert Cumming is a painter, photographer, and printmaker, as well as a sculptor. His works rank among the collections of major American art museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. In 1984 he was one of ten artists invited to document the Olympic Games in Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> Site: Boarding House Park, corner of French and John Streets<br /> Artists: Robert Cumming<br /> Materials: Granite, Brick, and Steel",

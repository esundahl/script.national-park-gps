    "bodyText": "Having targeted the Muleshoe Salient on May 10 with 5,000 soldiers and some success Ulysses S. Grant and George G. Meade decided to attack it again on May 12 with almost 20,000 troops. Those Federal soldiers spent May 11 marching into position. A steady rain fell, blanketing the area in a heavy fog. Around 4:30 am on May 12, the 20,000 U.S. soldiers moved forward. They quickly captured the Confederate pickets and continued their attack into the main Confederate line, screaming and hollering.<br /> <br /> The initial Confederate defenses shattered almost immediately, and the Federals captured thousands of prisoners. Realizing that with the Mule Shoe taken, his lines were dangerously split, Robert E. Lee ordered counterattacks to stabilize the position. Thus began nearly 24-hours of constant combat, some of the most infamous fighting of the entire war that left both armies stunned. Sometimes separated by just a few feet of dirt, the two sides battled through the day and into the night around a bend in the works that became known as the Bloody Angle. One Union soldier said the Mule Shoe was “a seething, bubbling, roaring hell of hate and murder.” Another soldier wrote, “I never expect to be fully believed when I tell what I saw of the horrors of Spotsylvania, because I should be loath to believe it myself, were the case reversed.”<br /> <br /> After nearly a complete day of fighting, the Confederates pulled back. The counterattacks bought the time needed to dig new trenches and allowed Lee to restore his line. The cost came to nearly 17,000 casualties on both sides around the Mule Shoe.<br />   <h2>While you're here...</h2> <h4>Walk the Bloody Angle Trail</h4> <em>1.1 mi (1.8 km)</em><br /> Walk a route around the Bloody Angle as a 1.1 mile loop, or as a part of the larger Spotsylvania History Trail.

Thousands of soldiers, horses, cannons, and wagons needed established roads for mobility, and there were limited options in this region. The Brock Road provided access south for US forces to gain the inside track to Richmond. Lee could block the US forces if the Confederates controlled the Brock Road. Thus, the adversaries contended for it throughout the battle.<br /> <br /> Initially, a nominal Federal presence held the intersection on the afternoon of May 5<sup>th</sup>. Additional US troops were directed to the vicinity and after heavy fighting the US troops maintained control. On the morning of May 6<sup>th</sup>, a large US attack was staged from this area but later driven back to entrenchments along the Brock Road. Confederate assaults were repulsed at the earthworks as the woods ignited in flames.<br /> <br /> The Battle of the Wilderness became notorious for the horrific fires that consumed some of the wounded who were unable to escape. After two days of fighting, the US Army maintained its hold of the intersection and used the Brock Road to move southward. In a notable moment of the war, US soldiers cheered for General Grant as he ordered them onward to continue the campaign of attrition. <p> </p> <h2>While you're here..</h2> <h4>Walk the Vermont Monumnet Trail</h4> <em>0.4 mi (.7 km) loop<br /> Start: Brock Road-Plank Road Intersection, Tour Stop 8.</em><br /> Walk the same ground as the renowned Vermont Brigade and see the memorial to this unit which bore the brunt of the fighting in this area.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The space outlined on the ground here was once the site of a large, brick house on the Fairfield Plantation. Prior to the creation of Fairfield Plantation, this land was part of the Ormesby Plantation, which dated to the early 1700s. In 1806, members of the Thornton family divided the Ormesby Plantation three ways. John Thornton received 465 acres of Ormesby, which included this land that is today the Stonewall Jackson Death Site.<br /> <br /> During the 1820s, John Thornton funded the construction of a house here, which became known as Fairfield Plantation. Then in 1828, John Thornton ordered the construction of a plantation office building, the only original building that still stands today. It is likely that he utilized enslaved labor to construct the main house and outbuildings. During John Thornton’s ownership of Fairfield, he increased the size of the plantation to 753 acres. After John and his wife, Mildred, died in 1844 and 1845, Thomas Coleman Chandler purchased the property at auction.<br /> <br /> In the lead-up to the Civil War, Thomas Chandler lived at Fairfield with his wife, Mary, and their ten children. The Chandlers enslaved 66 people, who they forced to labor in the surrounding fields and in the main house. Thomas Chandler also employed an overseer, Pearson Payne, to manage the plantation. In 1854, Thomas Chandler funded the construction of a new, two-story, brick house in place of the original house. The Chandlers temporarily moved into the office building during its construction. Chandler likely utilized enslaved labor for the construction of his new house, outlined on the ground at this site.<br /> <br /> Thomas Chandler’s plantation records reveal that his family enjoyed many luxuries at Fairfield, such as molasses, sugar, and coffee, while the enslaved people had a limited diet and lived in poorly constructed quarters. <br /> <br /> In 1860, the buildings present at Fairfield included the main house, smokehouse, office, barn, stables, outhouse, and quarters for enslaved workers. The Chandlers also had a three-terraced garden in front of their house as well as large quantities of horses, cows, sheep, and hogs. Thomas Chandler benefitted greatly from his home’s proximity to Guinea Station. Yet, Fairfield’s location beside the RF&P had a second consequence that was realized when civil war broke out in 1861. The Chandlers’ plantation was directly in the path of traveling armies. As war spread through Virginia, the lives of the Chandlers, as well as the lives of the people they enslaved, were forever changed.</p> <h4>Fairfield After the War</h4> <p>During the postwar era, Fairfield Plantation lost its prominence and entered into a period of decline. Without enslaved people to work the land, white landowners in the South struggled to maintain large plantations such as Fairfield. Following the Chandler family’s move in 1865, Edgar McKenney resided at Fairfield. In 1873, McKenney was forced to put Fairfield up for auction due to financial issues.<br /> <br /> Between 1873 and 1909, the property was sold at least two additional times and the surrounding farmland was sold off. By 1909, the house tract totaled only five acres. The main house was in a ruinous state. As interest in the memory of \"Stonewall\" Jackson and his death grew, efforts went underway to preserve the structure in which he died, the office next to the main house. <br /> <br /> Consequently, the main house and all other structures left from Fairfield were demolished at some time between 1909 and 1913. </p>",

    "bodyText": "Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb was a prominent lawyer in Georgia before the war, most well-known for writing <i>An Inquiry Into the Law of Negro Slavery in the United States of America</i>. Cobb’s legal defense of slavery was the most significant proslavery argument of its day, and made Cobb a leading figure in the secession movement in his native state of Georgia.<br /> <br /> Rather than pursue a political career in the Confederacy, in 1862 Cobb organized a military unit known as Cobb’s Legion. On November 1, 1862, after performing well in the campaigns of that year, the 39-year-old Cobb was promoted to brigadier general, taking command of the brigade formerly led by his brother, Howell.<br /> <br /> Just a few months shy of his 40th birthday, Fredericksburg would be Cobb’s first battle as a general, and defending the Sunken Road his first test. He embraced the challenge, and had written to his wife late in November, “We hear their drums and bands plainly and my blood boils whenever I hear them.”<br /> <br /> Cobb and his troops, who occupied the position on the Sunken Road, received the brunt of the Federal assaults. However, Cobb would not witness most of these attacks. At midday, about twelve or fifteen minutes after the repulse of the first Federal assault, the general was struck in the thigh by an artillery shell fragment. A staff officer placed the wounded general on a stretcher and carried him to a field hospital at the Wiet house, located approximately three miles back along the Telegraph Road. There surgeons sought to stanch the crimson flow coming from the wound, but their efforts were in vain. Tom Cobb was dead. <h4>The History of the Monument</h4> The Cobb Memorial is among the oldest monuments in the park. Several years after the war, Editor Rufus B. Merchant of the Fredericksburg Daily Star conceived the idea of erecting a memorial to General Cobb at the site where he received his mortal wound. Merchant, a former member of Cobb’s Legion, wrote a letter to the Augusta, Georgia, Chronicle, suggesting that the State of Georgia purchase Martha Stephens’s house on the Sunken Road and create a small park there in memory in memory of Cobb’s Georgia Brigade, the centerpiece of which would be a monument to the fallen general. Although several Georgia newspapers endorsed Merchant’s proposal, Cobb’s family disapproved, fearing that a public fundraising effort might “have the semblance of ostentation, and perhaps excite jealousies....” Instead, the family erected a small monument of its own in 1888.<br /> <br /> The exact date of the monument is unknown. An article in the March 21, 1888, Fredericksburg Star announced the Cobb family’s intention of raising a granite shaft “just opposite Mrs. Martha Steven’s gate and in Col. Richardson’s lot, to mark the spot where the General received his mortal wound.”  <h4>Description</h4> The Cobb Memorial consists of a single granite block, rectangular in shape, with its top surface slanted slightly toward the front. Made entirely polished stone, the marker is 2’0” wide, 1’0” deep, and stands 3’0” tall in back and 2’9” tall in front. It is inscribed: <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /> <strong>[Top]</strong><br /> ON THIS SPOT<br /> GEN. THOMAS R.R. COBB<br /> OF GEORGIA<br /> FELL IN BATTLE<br /> DEC. 13, 1862.<br /> <br /> <strong>[East Face]</strong></div> <div style=\"text-align: center;\">COBB</div>",

    "bodyText": "<p><em>*Public restrooms are located at the brooder barn.*</em><br /> <br /> The Ellwood brooder barn was built around 1950 and used for raising poultry. It is one of many buildings added by the property’s last private owners. Today, the barn holds equipment that the park uses to maintain the Ellwood grounds. Volunteers play a critical role in keeping up the Ellwood grounds. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frsp/getinvolved/volunteer.htm\">Learn more about volunteering at the park.</a> </p> <h4>Plantation, Farm, Park</h4> <p><br /> Over the course of the 1900s, Ellwood transformed from a plantation into a modern farm, then into a protected historical site. The catalyst for these changes was the end of the Lacy ownership. As the Lacy children reached adulthood during the late 1800s, they moved away from Ellwood. In 1896, Horace and Betty Lacy moved to a house in Fredericksburg and left Ellwood under the management of another tenant farmer, Robert Duvall, who lived and worked at Ellwood until 1899. After the deaths of Horace and Betty Lacy in 1906 and 1907, their children sold Ellwood to Hugh Evander Willis of Vermont.<br /> <br /> Willis’ goal was to transform Ellwood into a modern farm. In 1909, he invited his parents to take over the farm. In preparation for their arrival, Hugh renovated the house and removed the old outbuildings in the main service yard, including the former quarters for enslaved people. The Willis family raised many types of animals at Ellwood, including cattle, sheep, chickens, turkeys, and hogs.<br /> <br /> During the 1920s, the Wilderness region experienced a period of rapid growth and development. The United States Marine Corps held a large demonstration on the Wilderness Battlefield in 1921. President Warren Harding traveled from Washington to observe the exercises. During the three-day event, soldiers made their way to Ellwood and stopped by the family cemetery. At the time there, there was growing interest in preserving Civil War battlefields. Local veterans began the process of preserving land during the 1890s, but their goal to transfer land to the federal government had not been realized. Finally in 1927, Congress established the Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania National Military Park under the War Department. The War Department transferred the park to the National Park Service in 1933.<br /> <br /> During the development of the military park, the federal government took 96 acres of land from Hugh Willis under eminent domain. Willis tried to sue for his land but lost.<br /> <br /> No longer wanting to spend his retirement at Ellwood, Willis gave the property to his sister, Blanche Jones. Blanche moved into Ellwood with her husband, Leo, and son, Gordon. The Jones family (of no relation to the first owners of Ellwood) transformed Ellwood into a livestock farm, known as Ellwood Manor Farm.<br /> <br /> Through the 1950s, Leo Jones added numerous agricultural buildings to the farm, including this brooder barn, which he used to raise chickens. Also present nearby were two large laying houses, where chicken eggs were collected for sale. Around the same time that farming operations at Ellwood ended, the state highway department made major changes to Routes 3 and 20, which encouraged additional development in the area. Developers built two large subdivisions nearby, impacting the rural landscape of the Wilderness Battlefield. Taking into consideration this development and his parents’ advanced age, Gordon Jones approached the National Park Service to plan for Ellwood’s future. In 1970, Gordon Jones sold Ellwood to the National Park Service, under the agreement that his parents would live out their lives here. When Leo Jones died in 1977, the National Park Service received full ownership rights to Ellwood.</p> <a> </a>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Established in 1807, the Ellwood cemetery contains the remains of fifteen members of the Jones family, including William Jones and Hannah Coalter. The cemetery is enclosed by a split rail fence. Depressions are visible on the ground, although only one marker is present. The marker indicates the location of Confederate General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson’s arm, buried here in 1863 during the Battle of Chancellorsville. The Ellwood family cemetery has long existed as a tourist stop for those curious about the war and about “Stonewall” Jackson. How did this small family cemetery become so connected with the legay of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause?<br />  </p> <h4>From Family Cemetery to Symbol of the Lost Cause</h4> <p>At the war’s end the Lacys began renting Ellwood out to a tenant farmer, Benjamin Hites, who moved into the house with his wife and nine children. In 1866, Horace Lacy inventoried the remains of the Confederate soldiers buried on the grounds and organized their removal to Confederate cemeteries. Unable to maintain numerous plantations, the Lacys sold Chatham in 1872 and moved to Ellwood. <br /> <br /> In the aftermath of the war, former Confederates such as the Lacy's sought to redefine the Confederacy’s reason for fighting and memorialize places associated with Confederate leaders like “Stonewall” Jackson. This type of work resulted in the creation of the Lost Cause narrative, a false version of the Civil War that denies slavery as the cause of the conflict. In this postwar period, Betty joined the Fredericksburg chapter of the Ladies’ Memorial Association and helped create two Confederate cemeteries in the area. The organization celebrated the ideals of the Confederacy and provided places for former Confederates to gather and hold events in addition to funding Confederate cemeteries. Meanwhile, Horace served a term in the Virginia House of Delegates. According to a local newspaper, he ran as the candidate for the “White Man’s party.” During his short political career, Lacy supported white supremacy and opposed equal rights for Black Americans. Though the Lacys lost some of their wealth at the war’s end, they still retained their power and influence.<br /> <br /> During the early 1900s, James Power Smith, a former aide to \"Stonewall\" Jackson and Horace Lacy’s son-in-law, traveled through the region and organized the creation of stone markers in places associated with the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. In 1903, Smith placed this granite marker in the Ellwood family cemetery, marking the general location of Jackson’s arm. The marker reads, “Arm of Stonewall Jackson, May 3, 1863.” Many former Confederates ignored the many reasons for the Confederacy’s defeat and claimed that the Confederacy would have won the war if Jackson had lived. This marker is one of many created to memorialize the final moments of Jackson and build support for a false explanation of the war’s events. It stands as evidence of the Lost Cause narrative in guiding the memory of the Civil War over time. <br /> <br /> Many stories and rumors have surrounded Jackson’s arm since its burial in 1863. One story posits that U.S. soldiers dug up and reburied the arm during the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864. Another suggests that U.S. Marines visiting the area in 1921 also dug up and reburied the arm. While these stories are difficult to substantiate, they confirm that Jackson’s arm has become a point of curiosity over time. In 1998, archaeologists working for the National Park Service investigated the area but did not find a specific burial site. What can be determined from the arm’s burial site today is that former Confederates found it worthy of remembering in 1903.<br /> <br /> While former Confederates directed their attention to people like “Stonewall” Jackson, U.S. veterans remembered people like Colonel Joseph Moesch. Colonel Joseph Moesch led the 83rd New York and was killed while leading his soldiers into battle in the Wilderness in 1864. Moesch’s soldiers buried his remains in the Ellwood family cemetery before their departure. The men who first buried Moesch here in 1864 came back for his remains in 1887. They reburied Moesch in the Fredericksburg National Cemetery and dedicated a large monument in his honor. <br /> <br /> Today, the National Park Service aims to present sites such as the Ellwood cemetery within their full context, including discussions of the Lost Cause and Confederate memorialization. Since the creation of a marker to Jackson’s arm in 1903, we continue to wrestle with the memory of the Civil War. The way that we choose to remember our past sets the course for future generations. What lessons can we learn from Ellwood’s story today?</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Today, Ellwood is most well-known because of the American Civil War. During the Battle of Chancellorsville, Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson’s arm was buried in the family cemetery. One year later, the house served as U.S. General Gouverneur Warren’s headquarters during the Battle of the Wilderness. However, the story of Ellwood stretches beyond these events. Before the Civil War Ellwood was a slave plantation where the forced labor of many enriched the lives of its owners. After the war, Ellwood was again transformed into a modern farm. Today, Ellwood is preserved and managed by the National Park Service and its story is shared with all who visit. But where does this story begin?<br />  </p> <h4>Ellwood's Origins</h4> <p>Ellwood is located roughly 20 miles west of a geographic boundary in Virginia known as the Fall Line. At the Fall Line, rivers cross over hard bedrock onto softer sediment. To the west of the Fall Line, rivers are rockier and shallower. To the east of the Fall Line, rivers become wider and faster. The Fall Line defined settlement patterns in Virginia for thousands of years, first by Indigenous tribes and then by European colonists.<br /> <br /> By 1600, the Fall Line marked the boundary between two Indigenous language groups. Algonquian-speaking tribes lived to the east of the Fall Line, while Siouan-speaking tribes lived to the west. The Manahoac, a Siouan-speaking tribe, lived in the vicinity of present-day Ellwood. The Manahoac cultivated corn, beans, and squash and built massive burial mounds. They utilized rivers and waterways for fishing and transportation. All through the region, the Manahoac used axes and fires to clear fields within a mature forest. Even though European colonists settled at Jamestown in 1607, few moved west of the Fall Line until 1690. By then, the Manahoac had largely disappeared, either due to disease spread by the Europeans or by their adoption into the Monacan tribe further west.<br /> <br /> When European explorers arrived in the region, they noted the presence of large clearings in the forest, evidence of the civilization that once thrived there. In 1710, Queen Anne appointed Alexander Spotswood lieutenant governor of the Virginia colony. During his governorship, Spotswood took a particular interest in the region west of the Fall Line, including where Ellwood stands today<span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.25px;\"><b>.</b></span> He funded the creation of Fort Germanna, five miles northwest of Ellwood, and encouraged German settlers to live in the fort while he continued to expand his landholdings in the region. Colonists like Spotswood often thought of the area as a “frontier,” overlooking the many Indigenous communities that still inhabited the Americas and viewing the land as something to be taken and sold. Spotwood also saw natural resources as an opportunity for wealth. He opened iron mines and funded the construction of a large plantation, Salubria, for himself. Take a moment to reflect: how did Spotswood’s vision for this land differ from that of the Indigenous people who first lived here?<br /> <br /> As development in the region continued, the colonial government established Spotsylvania County, named after Spotswood, in 1720. At the end of his governorship in 1722, Spotswood owned 85,000 acres of land in and around Spotsylvania County. He made contracts with colonists, allowing them to live on parcels of his land in exchange for annual tobacco payments. Iron mining and tobacco cultivation proved to be lucrative businesses in the region. Yet, iron mining and tobacco cultivation also depleted the soil and cost much of the region’s old-growth timber. A dense, second-growth forest took the place of a healthy, ancient forest. Colonists referred to the region as the Wilderness in response to the region’s changed landscape.<br /> <br /> Growth in the Wilderness region remained slow due to the large amounts of land held by Spotswood and his heirs. By 1740, Governor Spotswood’s grandson, also named Alexander, created a clearing at Wilderness Bridge over a creek known as Wilderness Run. He funded the construction of a group of buildings just east of the bridge. Around 1771, brothers William and Churchill Jones traveled into the Wilderness. The younger Spotswood invited them to live on his land beside Wilderness Bridge. The Jones brothers accepted Spotswood’s offer. They were among the hundreds of colonists who poured westward in the 1700s at the expense of the Indigenous people that once inhabited the land. Governor Spotswood’s success in transforming a once-inhabited forest into a lucrative settlement encouraged others, like the Jones brothers, to stake their claim in the Wilderness. The area’s dense woods served as a physical reminder of colonial expansion in Virginia. </p>",

The Ellwood grounds are open sunrise to sunset. To visig when the house is closed, park outside the gate (but not blocking the gate) to walk 0.4 miles to the grounds.</em><br /> <br /> Today, the main house at Ellwood is the only structure from the 1700s that still stands. Perched on a knoll overlooking Wilderness Run, Ellwood stood at the center of an extensive 5,000-acre tract of land that encompassed much of what in 1864 would become the Wilderness Battlefield. Ellwood was home to the plantation's owners as well as the people they enslaved. Many important events took place here during the Civil War, forever changing the lives of the people who called Ellwood home.<br />  </p> <h4>Ellwood in the Civil War</h4> <p>When the Civil War erupted in 1861, James Horace Lacy, a vocal supporter of secession and slavery, enlisted in the Confederate Army. While the Lacys likely viewed the war as a threat to their their wealth and status, enslaved people here and across the country understood that the instability of war could lead to freedom.<br /> <br /> Shortly after Horace's departure, Betty and her children moved into the town of Fredericksburg, then to a farm in southern Virginia. They brought a portion of the enslaved population with them to southern Virginia, and left a smaller number of enslaved people behind, trusting that they would remain, as Betty Lacy said, “faithful.” <br /> <br /> The actions of enslaved people here proved otherwise. Charles Sprout, an enslaved man born at Ellwood, fled to U.S. lines early in the war and joined the U.S. Army. On January 1, 1863, the remaining enslaved people at Ellwood were freed through the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation. Coupled with the arrival of the U.S. Army in the Wilderness three months later, enslaved people here had a chance to leave Ellwood forever. <br /> <br /> In early May 1863, the warring armies clashed at Chancellorsville, five miles east of Ellwood. On the evening of May 2, after a successful flank attack against the Union Army, Confederate troops mistakenly shot General “Stonewall” Jackson and his staff. The surviving members of the party carried Jackson to a field hospital near Wilderness Tavern, where doctors amputated his left arm. As General Jackson recovered, his chaplain, Beverly Tucker Lacy, took the amputated arm to Ellwood, his brother’s plantation, and buried it in the family cemetery. Meanwhile a team of Confederate surgeons used Ellwood as a hospital in the battle’s aftermath. Hospital staff buried an additional twenty-four Confederate soldiers on the plantation grounds. The hospital at Ellwood remained in operation through the fall.<br /> <br /> The armies returned to the Wilderness a year later. The upcoming presidential election and the introduction of the 13th Amendment in Congress added a sense of urgency to the war effort on both sides. Understanding the uncertainty of his reelection, President Abraham Lincoln looked for an opportunity to push the United States towards victory. In March, Lincoln promoted Grant to general-in-chief of all U.S. forces. Grant took up his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac in Virginia. On May 4th, 1864, the Army of the Potomac crossed the Rapidan River and moved into the Wilderness. Their movement marked the beginning of  the Overland Campaign. As the U.S. Army moved down the Orange Turnpike on May 5th, they clashed with Lee’s army at Saunders Field, one mile west of Ellwood. The head of the U.S. Fifth Corps, General Gouverneur Warren, set up his headquarters at Ellwood. Around 1:00 p.m., Warren’s soldiers advanced through Saunders Field.<br /> <br /> After a day of brutal, inconclusive fighting, General Warren returned to his headquarters at Ellwood. His men recovered on the plantation grounds. Warren went into the main house and retired in the room to left of the front door. There, he reviewed casualty counts with his surgeon, John Milhau, and adjutant general, Frederick Locke. An onlooker, Lieutenant Morris Schaff, described the scene: “Just as I passed them, I heard Milhau give a figure, his aggregate from data which he had gathered at the hospitals.” Schaff then remembered Warren stating, “It will never do to, Locke, to make a showing of such heavy losses. Warren, an experienced soldier, reacted to the costliness of the new campaign, and likely predicted the impact that a high casualty count would have on morale.<br /> <br /> Unbeknownst to Warren at the time, the Wilderness was only the first in a long series of battles that lasted through the summer. This second day of fighting did not bring victory to the U.S. Army. Refusing to accept the battle’s outcome as a failure, Grant led his army southeast for Spotsylvania Court House, where the fighting resumed on May 8th. The Battle of the Wilderness altered the landscape around Ellwood. Patches of scorched ground, felled trees, graves, and entrenchments stood as evidence of a brutal struggle. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Confederate General Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson died on May 10, 1863 in this small office building. This office served Thomas Chandler's 740-acre Fairfield plantation in the years leading up to the Civil War. The building is a one-and-a-half-story, square, frame structure clad in white weatherboard siding and with little ornamentation overall. During the early 1900s, the Richmond, Fredericksburg, & Potomac Railroad Company, led by a Confederate veteran, preserved the office building because of its association with Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson.<br /> <br /> Though most famous because of its assiciation with Thomas Jackson, many other events took around this location during the Civil War. While Thomas Chandler's three oldest sons joined the Confederate Army and Chandler himself provided supplies to the Confederate army on a number of occasions, the people the Chandler's enslaved claimed freedom for themselves when the United States soldiers were nearby. During the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Guinea Station became the northernmost supply depot for the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Over the winter after the Battle of Fredericksburg, a portion of Lee's army, under General Jackson's commmand, camped nearby.<br /> <br /> After a long winter, in the spring of 1863, the US Army of the Potomac and Confederate Army of Northern Virginia fought once again, this time at Chancellorsville, roughly 30 miles northwest of here. During the second day of the battle on May 2, Jackson’s corps carried out an extensive flank attack, catching the US Army of the Potomac off guard. However, Jackson's attack failed to fully overrun the center of the Federal line and reconnect with the remainder of the Confederate army. When nightfall brought the Confederate attack to an end, Jackson conducted a reconnaissance of the Federal position to determine whether he should renew the attack. As Jackson and his staff rode out on horseback in front of the Confederate line in darkness, soldiers in the 18th North Carolina Regiment confused Jackson’s party for US cavalry and fired on them. General Jackson was wounded in the left arm and in the right hand. One of Jackson’s aide’s, Keith Boswell, was killed by the same volley, and others were wounded or captured.<br /> <br /> The surviving members of Jackson’s staff evacuated him to a field hospital near Wilderness Tavern. There, they met with Jackson’s doctor, Hunter McGuire, who examined Jackson’s wounds and determined that his left arm needed to be amputated. McGuire put Jackson under anesthesia and removed his left arm in the early morning hours of May 3, 1863. The following day on May 4, Jackson traveled by wagon twenty-four miles to Guinea Station. Confederate surgeons hoped to transport Jackson by train to a more permanent hospital in Richmond. Earlier that day, however, the U.S. cavalry severed the RF&P. As a result, Jackson could not be moved until Confederates could repair the railroad. Under General Lee’s instructions, Jackson’s staff brought him to Fairfield and put him up in this office building. Members of the Chandler family as well as Jim Lewis, a man Jackson enslaved, prepared the building for his stay and helped make him comfortable.<br /> <br /> On May 5-6, Jackson continued to rest at Fairfield and seemed to be doing well. However, his condition worsened on May 7. By then, the railroad was back in operation, but Jackson was too ill to move. Doctor McGuire diagnosed him with pneumonia. Desperate to find a solution, McGuire called in a pneumonia specialist, Doctor David Tucker, from Richmond. Mary Anna, Jackson’s wife, also traveled to Fairfield from Richmond to be with her husband. Mary Anna brought Julia, the Jacksons’ newborn baby, and Hetty, a woman the Jackson family enslaved, with her from Richmond.<br /> <br /> At about 3:15 pm on May 10, 1863, Jackson died in the office building. News of his death quickly spread throughout the country. Mary Anna chose to have Jackson’s body buried in Lexington, Virginia. While Robert E. Lee’s army achieved victory at Chancellorsville, the battle came at an immense cost. Lee’s army suffered over 13,000 casualties, including General Jackson.<br /> <br /> While Jackson was the most well-known Confederate soldier to come to Fairfield after the Battle of Chancellorsville, he was not the only one. In the aftermath of the battle, thousands of wounded soldiers crowded around the station waiting for transportation to hospitals in Richmond. Roughly six thousand U.S. soldiers captured at Chancellorsville also camped at the station until the Confederate Army could move them to prisons in Richmond. More chaos followed in May of 1864, when a cavalry skirmish took place at Guinea Station after the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. The Civil War, which the Chandlers had wholeheartedly supported, drastically altered their lives. In December of 1863, the Chandlers sold Fairfield Plantation, but continued to live there until March of 1865.</p> <h4>The Fairfield Office Becomes the Jackson Shrine</h4> <p>In the decades after the Civil War, former Confederates elevated Jackson's status to mythic proportions within the idealogy of the Lost Cause. Meanwhile, Fairfield Plantation fell into disrepair. The property traded hands multiple times and owners sold off land bit by bit.<br /> <br /> In 1900, the Virginia General Assembly chartered the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Association. A group of former Confederates created the organization with the sole purpose of purchasing the building where Jackson died. At the time, the property was owned by another Confederate veteran, George Robert Collins, who rented out the property to a Black family. The family lived in this office building, while the main house was used as a storehouse. The <i>Evening Star,</i> a newspaper in Winchester, Virginia, applauded the group’s effort to save the site from what the writer deemed “ruin’s ravages,” an unfair judgement made against the property’s Black tenants. In the late 1800s, White preservationists frequently took issue with the presence of Black people at sites associated with White historical figures. The Stonewall Jackson Memorial Association never realized their dream to purchase the building.<br /> <br /> Soon, the president of the RF&P, William White, became interested in the site of Jackson’s death. White had served in the Confederate army during the war. In 1909, White purchased the 5-acre tract of land on which the office building sat. Around that time, White oversaw the demolition of the other buildings onsite. Two years later, White sold the property to the railroad. <br /> <br /> In 1926, the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad, with the help of a local ladies’ memorial organization, rehabilitated the Fairfield office building and furnished it with items related to Jackson’s career. A few notable changes were made to the building between 1927 and 1928. After two years of work, the RF&P opened the building to the public in 1928 as a “shrine” to Jackson. In commemoration of its opening, the <i>Charlotte Chronicle</i> in North Carolina reported that the site would become “the Mecca of Southern pilgrimage.”<br /> <br /> In 1933, the Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania County Battlefields Memorial National Military Park (FRSP) was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service. The Lost Cause narrative guided the park’s interpretive aims from the very start. Stories surrounding Confederate Generals Lee and Jackson became focal points in both early preservation efforts and public programs. In 1937, the property on which the Fairfield office building stands today was donated to the park. The park named the site the Jackson Shrine.<br />  </p> <h4>The Fairfield Office Today</h4> <p>When this building opened to the public, the acting U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Charles West, gave a speech in which he promised the federal government’s “sacred trust” in promoting Jackson’s “valor and character.” The Jackson Shrine came into the National Park Service during a time when the federal government prioritized reconciliationist memories of the Civil War that focused on the shared valor of soldiers on both sides rather than the actual causes of the war. For decades, park rangers working at the Jackson Shrine focused solely on Jackson’s death, overlooking the broader story of this place.<br /> <br /> Former NPS historian, Ralph Happel, wrote that in the Fairfield office, which he referred to as “that old house,” both the Confederacy and “a way of life” died with Jackson. By calling the office a house, Happel removed the building from its original setting. His usage of the phrase “way of life” sought to romanticize life on a plantation and ignore the horrors of slavery. With ideas like these placed at the forefront of the park’s interpretive goals, visitors to the Jackson Shrine encountered a one-sided version of the past.<br /> <br /> Today, the National Park Service aims to represent this site in a more holistic way. In 2019, in the wake of public critique of its administration of the site, the National Park Service renamed the site the “Jackson Death Site.” In making this change, the Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania National Military Park embraced a new goal: to discuss all of the important events that took place here over time and recognize its role in perpetuating Lost Cause mythologies in the past. While the physical remnants of the many people who came through this place are gone, their stories remain.<br />  </p>",

In July 1865, three months after the restoration of peace between the states, Congress authorized the establishment of a National Cemetery in Fredericksburg to honor the United States soldiers who died on the battlefields or from disease in camp. The site chosen was Marye's Heights, the formidable Confederate position which had proven so impregnable to repeated Federal attacks on December 13, 1862.<br /> <br /> A soldier who fought with the 14th Indiana in the recent war returned to Fredericksburg as a member of a veteran corps assigned the task of locating and identifying the dead. He made these observations in a letter: \"Your correspondent roamed all over the battle field of December 13, 1862. No headboards or monuments mark the spot where the gallant defenders of the old flag fell on that ever-memorable day. The great 'slaughter pen' of General Ambrose E. Burnside is most all under cultivation, enriched with the blood of as brave men as ever answered their country's call.\"<br /> <br /> The Fredericksburg National Cemetery is the final resting place for over 15,000 United States soldiers. Most of the soldiers buried here died during the Civil War, but there are about 100 soldiers from the 1900s and a couple of spouses. The cemetery was officially closed to further burials in the 1940s. The U.S. Civil War soldiers buried here include those who died of illness in the camps around Fredericksburg, in the four major battles around Fredericksburg (Fredericksburg in December 1862, Chancellorsville in May 1863, Wilderness in May 1864, and Spotsylvania Court House in May 1864) as well the Mine Run and North Anna campaigns.<br /> <br /> Burial plots are consecutively numbered; thus, the cemetery is not organized by state, unit or campaign. Soldiers are mostly privates because higher-ranking officers were often transported home by family members.<br /> <br /> Only about 20% of the soldiers are identified. Confederates who died in the Fredericksburg area were interred in Confederate cemeteries in Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Fredericksburg National Cemetery covers 12 acres and sits on the corner of Marye's Heights, with tiered terraces along the boundary of the cemetery. The cemetery is surrounded by a brick gate. An entrance walkway can be accessed to the west of the visitor center, up a pathway. The entrance is on a hill with uneven walkways and is steep. Once up the hill, the main cemetery consists of rows and columns of grave stones across gently sloping hills.",

Lee recognized that importance, and decided to strike against it. Some of the battle’s last fighting occurred along the Fredericksburg Road on May 19, as Confederates attacked Federal lines. One soldier wrote, “After a few minutes they got a little mixed, and didn’t fight very tactically, but they fought confounded plucky.” Another added, “The men stood and fought just as you see them in pictures.”<br /> <br /> The Federal line held, and the Fredericksburg Road remained open. Deciding he had done all he could do at Spotsylvania, Grant made plans to move his army further to the south. The armies soon left, marching and countermarching their way closer and closer to the Confederate capital at Richmond. Both armies had suffered close to a combined loss of 30,000 soldiers killed, wounded, and missing.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Guinea Station was a small community in Caroline County thrust into the spotlight because of its role as a Confederate supply depot during the Civil War and, subsequently, the location of Confederate General Jackson's death within the community in 1863.</p> <h4>Origins of Guinea Station</h4> <p>The surrounding area was first home to Indigenous people who lived here for thousands of years prior to the arrival of English colonists during the 1600s. When English settlers established the Jamestown colony in 1607, there were seven Indigenous tribes living in what is today Caroline County. In the 1620s, English colonists began pushing westward from Jamestown into present-day Caroline County. As more and more colonists pushed into Indigenous-controlled lands during the mid-1600s, violence broke out between the two groups. In 1677, the Treaty of Middle Plantation weakened the power of Indigenous tribes in eastern Virginia and allowed more settlers to move west<br /> <br /> One such settler, Michael Guinney, purchased a tract of land in this area in 1704. Shortly after his arrival, he funded the construction of a bridge near the confluence of the Po and Ni Rivers. A small village, named Guinea, grew around the bridge.<br /> <br /> In 1732, a major road, built for the purpose of transporting tobacco, crossed Guinea and brought more travel through the area. Michael Guinney opened a tavern alongside the road in 1735. The tavern served as a place for travelers to stop and socialize. It also served as an early center for the trade of enslaved people in Caroline County. Slave plantations were a critical component of the economy of the area and brought wealth to elite, white colonial landowners who dominated political, economic, and social life in Virginia.<br /> <br /> The arrival of the railroad brought more change to Guinea. In 1836, the Richmond, Fredericksburg, & Potomac Railroad (commonly referred to as the RF&P) was completed through Caroline County, connecting the state capitol of Richmond to Aquia Landing on the Potomac River. As a result, the town became known as Guinea Station. The railroad opened up markets and created economic opportunities for plantation owners. In the 1840s, a prominent family, the Chandlers, moved to Guinea Station to take advantage of these opportunities. Unbeknownst to the Chandlers at the time, their new home would become tied up in a bloody civil war that would bring many well-known figures to their doorstep and free the nearly 70 people they enslaved.  </p> <h4>Guinea Station After the War</h4> <p>After the Civil War, the community of Guinea experienced much of the changes that the remainder of the South experienced. Land prices plummeted, Confederate money lost its value, and white landowners had to navigate without enslaved labor for the first time. In Guinea, the physical landscape itself had been altered by years of fighting. Bodies of soldiers who had been buried there during the war were reburied in local cemeteries. Guinea Station was also rebuilt. Formerly enslaved people who remained living in the South turned to the federal government for resources and protection, though sometimes ended up in labor contracts, tied to the same people who had enslaved them before the war.<br /> <br /> During the late nineteenth century, Guinea persisted as a small community along the railroad. Located in Guinea at that time were a number of grist mills, dwellings, churches, blacksmith shops, boarding houses, stores, and sawmills, along with the railroad depot and post office. A new passenger station was constructed in 1886. The community experienced industrial growth through the 1920s. However, despite the optimism felt by residents of Guinea at the turn of the century, it never grew into a bustling town due to changes in transportation networks. Once the railroad was replaced by state highways, economic growth in Guinea waned. While Guinea's economy slowed, efforts to memorialize Jackson's death grew. </p>",

    "bodyText": "Hamilton's Crossing was a railroad stop on the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad. This location constituted the right anchor of General \"Stonewall\" Jackson's Confederate line in the Battle of Fredericksburg, December 13, 1862. It was also the supply base for the Confederate Army during the Fredericksburg Campaign after the depot in Fredericksburg came within range of US artillery in late November 1862, and trains could not go further north.<br /> <br /> The railroad traversed the Rappahannock River valley and connected Fredericksburg, about five miles north of Hamliton's Crossing, with Richmond, about forty-five miles to the south. The railroad was a vital link between the Confederate Army and their supplies. Facilities here consisted of a small station building where the Mine Road intersects the railroad. a telegraph shanty, and likely a quartermaster tents and several sidings.<br /> <br /> The crossing was named for Captain George Hamilton whose home, \"Forest Hill,\" stood on a knoll just southwest of the intersection. Though the home is gone now, the Hamilton cemetery still exists. Mine Run dates to colonial times when it meandered through Spotsylvania County from the iron mines in the northwestern section of the county to the Rappahannock River below Fredericksburg.<br />   <h2>During the Battle of Fredericksburg</h2> On the foggy morning of December 13, Jackson's right flank terminated at the crossing and the nearby woods teamed with Confederate soldiers. At about 10am, the fog lifted, revealing the 55,000 soldiers of General William Franklin's wing of the US Army of the Potomac on the fields in front of Jackson's Confederates. As the battle commenced, federal cannon roared from the plains and showered the forest with lead.<br /> <br /> Confederate reserves in Jackson's second line moved up along Mine Road through Hamilton's Crossing to aid in the struggle. Henry Handerson of the 9th Louisiana wrote, \"we were ordered forward at the 'double quick,' and...plunged into the woods in our front, where the shells were bursting with rapidity and considerable accuracy...\" The railroad embankment soon became a combat zone of fierce fighting. At the battle's end the Confederates retained control of their line.<br /> <br /> Today the surroundings give little hint of the thundering cannon and fierce combat that swept through the area more than a century ago, though the silence is still broken by the trains which still pass through Hamilton's Crossing. <h4>Walk to Hamilton's Crossing from Prospect Hill</h4> <em>0.64 mi (1 km) round trip</em><br /> From the parking area at Prospect Hill, take this short trail that leads to the site of Hamilton's Crossing.",

Lee and Richard Ewell used the Harrison House and grounds as their headquarters. Trenches still run through the woods near the Harrison House, built by the Confederate army in the latter stages of the fighting on May 12, 1864. On the ground here, Lee himself tried to lead an attack on May 12, before he was ushered to the rear. About a week later, Federal attacks near the Harrison House were repulsed by heavy concentrations of Confederate artillery on May 18.",

    "bodyText": "The charge of Andrew Atkinson Humphreys’ division (3rd Division, Fifth Corps, US Army of the Potomac, made up entirely of Pennsylvanians) was the last major assault made against the Sunken Road on December 13, 1862. Throughout the early afternoon, General Edwin Sumner had thrown the divisions of French, Hancock, Howard, Griffin, and Whipple against the Confederate line without success. Around mid-afternoon, Burnside ordered the heights to be attacked yet again, this time by the men of General Joseph Hooker’s Center Grand Division.<br /> <br /> In preparation for this assault, Humphreys’s division crossed the river and deployed into a line of battle on the western side of the millrace, astride Hanover Street, shortly after 2:30pm. Opposed to renewing the assault against what he considered an impregnable position, Hooker rode back across the river to confer with the commanding general. In his absence, word reached General Darius Couch that Confederate guns had been seen leaving the heights. Misinterpreting the movement as a Confederate retreat, Couch ordered Humphreys to attack at once.<br /> <br /> Humphreys ordered his men forward at sunset. As the division crossed the plain, Confederate infantry and artillery fire blasted its ranks, belying reports of a rebel withdrawal. Nevertheless, Humphreys’ men pressed forward, approaching to within 100 yards of the stone wall that ran along the base of the ridge. The division paid dearly for its courage. In little more than an hour’s time, it lost 1,019 men, 25 percent of the 4,000 men that it took into action. <h4><br /> The Monument's History</h4> Fredericksburg Battlefield Memorial Commission of Pennsylvania erected the Humphreys Monument was with assistance from the State of Pennsylvania. President D. Watson Rowe, Secretary/Treasurer James M. Clark, and other members of the Commission came to Fredericksburg in May 1906 to search for a place to put the monument. When they could not find a suitable site at a reasonable price, they determined to erect the memorial in Fredericksburg National Cemetery. Civil Engineer P. H. Henderson staked out the location for the monument on August 31, 1908. By the second week of October the monument was in place.<br /> <br /> Two trains carrying veterans of the division, their families, friends, and dignitaries arrived in Fredericksburg at on November 11, 1908. Although a rainstorm temporarily interrupted their reunion, the skies cleared off in time for the monument dedication.<br /> <br /> Tansil’s 16-piece band of Washington, D.C., opened the day’s activities with a concert at the courthouse. One hour later, 1,500 people marched to the cemetery. The veterans of Humphreys’ division, marching in regimental formation, brought up the rear. Thousands of local citizens crowded the streets to watch the mile-long procession as it made its way through the city. Once the procession arrived at the cemetery, dignitaries and honored guests took their seats on temporary stand, as 3,000 spectators crowded into position below.<br /> <br /> Over the course of the ceremony, the Memorial Commission transferred ownership of the monument to the State of Pennsylvania. The State of Pennsylvania, in turn, transferred ownership to Assistant Secretary of War Robert Shaw Oliver, representing the United States Government. <h4><br /> Description</h4> The monument is made of smooth pink Stony Creek, Connecticut, granite. A pedestal stands atop a stepped octagonal base that measures 14 feet square at its widest point. A bronze statue of General Humphreys crafted by Herbert Adams crowns the whole. Humphreys, holding his hat with one hand and clutching the hilt of his sword with the other, faces eastward his gaze focused on the northern horizon. The pedestal and base together stand 11 feet high, while the figure of Humphreys increases the height by another nine feet for a total height of 20 feet. Ornate bronze letters adorn the base and pedestal and form the following inscriptions:<br />   <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>[East Face]</strong><br /> ERECTED<br /> BY<br /> PENNSYLVANIA</div> <div style=\"text-align: center;\">TO<br /> CONMEMORATE<br /> THE CHARGE OF<br /> GENERALHVMPHREYS’DIVISION<br /> FIFTH CORPS-ON<br /> MARYE’S HEIGHTS<br /> FREDERICKSBURG<br /> VIRGINIA<br /> DEC—13—1862<br /> <br /> 134TH 129TH 126TH 91ST<br /> 131ST 133RD 123RD 155TH<br /> PENNA-VOL-INFY<br /> <br /> BRIGADIER-GENERAL</div> <div style=\"text-align: center;\">ANDREW ATKINSON HVMPHREYS<br /> THIRD DIVISION-FIFTH ARMY CORPS</div> <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /> <strong>[North Face]</strong></div> <div style=\"text-align: center;\">FIRST BRIGADE<br /> BRIG-GEN-E-B-TYLER</div> <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /> 134TH REGIMENT<br /> COL-EDWARD O’BRIEN<br /> <br /> 129TH REGIMENT<br /> COL-JACOB G-FRICK<br /> <br /> 126TH REGIMENT<br /> COL-JAMES G-ELDER<br /> LT-COL-D-WATSONROWE<br /> <br /> 91ST REGIMENT<br /> COL-E-M-GREGORY<br /> <br /> PENNSYLVANIA<br /> VOLUNTEER<br /> INFANTRY<br /> <br /> <strong>[South Face]</strong><br /> SECOND BRIGADE<br /> COL-P-H-ALLEBACH<br /> 131ST REGIMENT<br /> COMMANDING<br /> <br /> 131ST REGIMENT<br /> LT-COL-WM-B-SHAVT<br /> <br /> 133RD REGIMENT<br /> COL-F-B-SPEAKMAN<br /> <br /> 123RD REGIMENT<br /> COL-JOHN B-CLARK<br /> 155TH REGIMENT<br /> COL-EDWARD J-ALLAN<br /> <br /> PENNSYLVANIA<br /> VOLUNTEER<br /> INFANTRY <hr /> <div style=\"text-align: left;\">For more information see, Donald C.

Today, the Innis House is the only one of these structures left.<br /> <br /> The Innis House was built between 1856 and 1861. In 1861, the property belonged to Martha Stephens, who resided in another structure 150 feet to the south, but John Innis, Martha’s son, and his wife, Ellen Innis, resided here. The first floor of the house has a small entrance room, a larger living room with a fireplace, and a small side room. The upstairs has two rooms, one with access to the chimney and a small fireplace.<br /> <br /> During the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Innis House was directly in the crossfires of the two armies. By the end of the battle the house was greatly damaged, yet the structure was intact and the residents moved back in after the war. The Innis house remained private home for the next 100 years.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service acquired the Innis House in 1969. Restoration of the house was completed in 1987. The house was restored to its 1862 appearance. During the restoration many bullet holes, shell holes, and bullets were found within and on the outside of the structure. Some of the bullet holes were revealed when the restoration team removed layers of old wallpaper. One count of the bullet holes comes to 52; they are on the inside and outside of the home.",

An single story addition with a slanted roof extends from the south end of the house. Four windows along the east and west, the 30ft side, of the house peer into an unfurnished main room, with scattered bullet holes still visible in the walls. A walkway follows the western side of the house parallel to the Sunken Road.",

    "bodyText": "<p>On the evening on December 13, 1862, as hundreds of US soldiers lay wounded on the fields in front of the Sunken Road, a young Confederate sergeant crossed over the stone wall, and, under cover of darkness distributed water to the wounded enemy soldiers.<br /> <br /> The soldier who committed this brave act was reported later by Confederate General Joseph Kershaw to be Richard Kirkland, of the 2nd South Carolina. Kirkland became known as the \"Angel of Marye’s Heights\" and his story is an oft-repeated one, highlighting the bravery of soldiers, the horrors of war, and the hope that the connections between us are more powerful than things that divide us.<br /> <br /> Kirkland did not survive the war; he died at the Battle of Chickamauga on September 20, 1863.<br />  </p> <h4>Memory, Myth, and Truth in the Story of Richard Kirkland</h4> <p>Whether the Kirkland story is based in fact or if it exists only in legend has been a question surrounding the story for a long time. What does the evidence tell us?<br /> <br /> People did tell stories after the battle of good deeds, like the ones attributed to Kirkland. A few weeks after the battle, Walt Whitman, volunteering in a Union hospital, recorded a wounded US soldier recounting several Confederate good Samaritans who crossed the battle lines to provide aid for the wounded. In 1870, a James Hagood wrote of a soldier in Kershaw’s brigade who went over the wall to assist the Union wounded.<br /> <br /> In 1880, newspaper editor Carlyle McKinley prompted Kershaw to identify the good Samaritan in his brigade. Kershaw quickly identified Richard Kirkland and wrote the account of Kirkland’s deeds that became the version of the story most often retold today. After 1880, at least 5 other members of the 2nd South Carolina also named Kirkland as the hero.<br /> <br /> There is little reason to doubt Kershaw’s naming of Kirkland, the two were not connected or related in any way. At the same time, Kershaw’s story is filled with dialogue and detail that seem improbable to have been remembered with such exactness over 20 years after the event.<br />  </p> <h4>A History of the Memorial</h4> <p>At the time of the Civil War, the parcel of land where the Kirkland Monument now stands was the location of the Ebert House. The Ebert family purchased the land in 1858 and ran a small family store from their home which stood in the shadows of Brompton, perched atop Marye's Heights. By the 1950s the Ebert House had deteriorated and was ultimately demolished in 1957. In the 1960s the land was saved from development by the University of Mary Washington. The University of Mary Washington also owns and maintains the large manor, Brompton, across the Sunken Road as housing for the university president.<br /> <br /> The legendary story of Richard Kirkland proved particularly inspiring to Dr. Richard Lanier, a South Carolinian who had a dental practice in Fredericksburg. Dr. Lanier led fundraising efforts, ultimately resulting in significant contributions from the states of Virginia and South Carolina and the creation of the Kirkland Memorial Committee.<br /> <br /> With funds in place, the Committee commissioned sculptor Felix de Weldon (who had completed the famous Iwo Jima Memorial) to design and fabricate the new memorial. The finished statue depicts Kirkland bending over a fallen US soldier, offering the wounded man a canteen in one hand, and holding his hand in the other.<br /> <br /> In 1965 the Kirkland Monument was dedicated at its current location. In 1987, the University of Mary Washington transferred the land, and Kirkland Memorial, to the National Park Service.<br />  </p> <h4>Description</h4> <p>This life-size bronze statue measuring 5’6” x 8’4” x 4’9” depicts Kirkland bending over the figure of a wounded Union soldier. He supports the head of his recumbent foe on his right knee while giving him water from a canteen. The Confederate symbolically grasps the left hand of the Union soldier as if in brotherhood. The sculpture is situated atop a rectangular base of black marble measuring 3’2” x 9’0” x 5’6” that is engraved with the words: </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>[South Face]</strong><br /> IN MEMORIAMRICHARD ROWLAND KIRKLAND<br /> CO.

Lee made his headquarters in anticipation of the battle of Fredericksburg. Initially, Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia were situated further south. As reports came in that the United States Army was amassing at Fredericksburg, and just waiting there, Lee moved his army into position outside of Fredericksburg.<br /> <br /> When Burnside and the Army of the Potomac arrived at Chatham, Lee was unsure of the Federals' plan. Where would Burnside cross the Rappahannock: right there at town, further upstream, further downstream? Lee was not prepared to face the larger US Army of 120,000 men because he had divided his forces, sending Stonewall Jackson to the Shenandoah Valley and James Longstreet to Culpeper.<br /> <br /> From this hill, Lee was able to see both ends of his line: the north end above the stone wall and the south end on Prospect Hill. His vantage point gave him the opportunity to know how the battle was going and adapt if necessary.<br />  </p> <h2>While you're here...</h2> <h4>Hike up to Lee's Hill</h4> <p>From the parking lot, take the half a mile round trip trail to the top of Lee's Hill.

In the 1820s, when John Marye moved into his new home called Brompton, the stately mansion directly north of here, the entire ridge line came to be known as Marye’s Heights.<br /> <br /> When the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia arrived here in late November of 1862, they found a nearly perfect position from which to set up a defensive line around the city. From here, they could look east and see the whole town of Fredericksburg, its streets and buildings clustered between these heights and the Rappahanock River. <br /> <br /> In 1862 this hill looked out to the city's fairgrounds and the view was much more expansive than it is now. Currently, on a clear day, you can still see many landmarks in town and as far out as Stafford Heights on the opposite side of the Rappahanock River.",

Besides their names, Betty and Moses, little is known about these individuals or what happened to them after they reached Federal forces. <br /> <br /> Two years later, this home stood in the middle of what became some of the most intense fighting of the entire battle of Spotsylvania Court House. Members of the McCoull family hid in the basement while a Confederate general, Edward Johnson, used the house as his headquarters until he was captured on May 12, 1864.<br /> <br /> The landscape here bore the scars of the battle for years after the armies left. One traveler, coming to the McCoull house in the late 1860s, wrote “Of the woods, thinned and despoiled by the storm of iron and lead, only a ghostly grove of dead trunks and dreary limbs remained.” Almost 20 years after the battle, the house was not much improved, with another traveler noting that the house “is a weather-beaten, rickety structure that clearly has been through the mills.”<br /> <br /> The home burned down in 1920.

Confederate 2nd Corps General \"Stonewall\" Jackson's troops waited quietly in the tree line at Prospect Hill, the south end of a defensive line that spaned 8 miles around Fredericksburg. When Union General Meade's troops started toward Prospect Hill, Confederate cannons remained silent. Jackson did not want to give away his position, even in the face of artillery fire.<br /> <br /> At about 800 yards from the Confederate line, Meade’s troops were met with a storm of artillery shells as Jackson finally opened fire. The United State artillery units responded in kind. Soon this place would be filled with the intense noise, smoke, and power from cannons on both sides. Meade’s soldiers were driven back by the Confederate artillery. Reforming, Meade’s Pennsylvanians advanced again, this time cutting through Jackson's line briefly, but Jackson’s fire, manpower, and counterattack drove Meade to retreat.<br /> <br /> Jackson was unaware of the communication blunders that left Meade unsupported. In the end, fighting at Prospect Hill ended in stalemate, with both sides losing thousands of men. There were about 4,000 Confederate casualties and about 5,000 United States casualties (killed, wounded, and missing) on this side of the battlefield.<br />  </p> <h2>While you're here...</h2> <h4>Take in the View</h4> <p>Prospect Hill is one of the few spots in the park with a sweeping view. Challenge your imagination and picture what this place looked like in 1862. Imagine the noise of the 14 cannons that were here.

Access the trail from the woods behind the parking lot opposite the open field. NOTE: This trail is one-way and leads to the intersection of Lee Drive and Landsdowne Road.

The National Park Service manages and protects the church, the 15th New Jersey Monument, the 23rd New Jersey Monument, and one acre of ground.<br />  </p> <h4>The Battle of Salem Church</h4> <p><br /> In April of 1863, Union General Joseph Hooker planned to cross the Rappahannock upriver from Fredericksburg and get behind Lee, while another Union force under General John Sedgwick remained in front of the town. Lee would either be crushed between the two forces, Hooker hoped, or he would be forced to retreat southward. On May 3rd, while a big battle was raging around the Chancellorsville Inn ten miles west of town, Sedgwick drove across the Rappahannock, captured the Sunken Road and Marye's Heights, and advanced westward to join Hooker, moving on what is now Route 3. On a low ridge line running at right angles to the road, crowned by Salem Church, a small force of Confederates determined to make a stand. It was an excellent position that commanded the approaches from the east; directly in front of them was a tangle of bushes and undergrowth.<br /> <br /> Sharpshooters were posted in the upper gallery of the church on the north side. When the Federals began their assaults, they were met by volleys of fire. The underbrush made the going difficult, but suddenly the Federals were on the crest of the ridge, only a few yards from the church, and advancing determinedly. At this moment Confederates posted in the road cut just behind sprang up and counterattacked fiercely, driving the enemy back down the slope and onto the plain below. One Federal soldier remembered the opening of the battle this way:<br /> <br /> \"A tremendous roar of musketry met us from the unseen enemy, one hundred feet away, posted behind a fence and a ditch. Men tumbled from our ranks dead, and others fell helpless with wounds.\"<br /> <br /> Federal soldiers aimed at the upper windows where the sharpshooters were; the pockmarks from their bullets are still visible. Other bullets ripped through the galleries. Inside, Confederate soldiers climbed over the tumble of furniture, which by this time must have been no better than fancy kindling. The next day Sedgwick retreated across the river and the campaign was over.</p>",

In 1864, the field was nearly twice the size of what you see today, stretching across both sides of the road. On the morning of May 5, 1864, troops from the US Army’s Fifth Corps reached the eastern edge of the field. Confederates commanded by General Ewell simultaneously fortified the wooded western fringe. Remnants of these earthworks are still visible.<br /> <br /> General-in-chief of US forces, Ulysses S. Grant, directed his subordinate, commander of the US Army of the Potomac, General George Meade, “If any opportunity presents itself for pitching into a part of Lee’s army, do so without giving time for disposition.” Accordingly, US troops were ordered to attack across this field at about 1:00pm. Many Federals were shot down as they advanced under heavy rifle fire, however some reached the Confederate earthworks where hand-to-hand combat occurred. Two cannons were brought forward to support the US attack and deployed in the vicinity of the modern exhibit shelter.<i> </i>The artillery was unable to make an impact and the cannons were captured by the Confederates. Ultimately, the entire endeavor failed, and US soldiers were forced to either surrender or retreat back to the eastern edge of the field. Some Federal officers who carried out the attack were frustrated by the hastiness and lack of preparation. General Grant was disappointed by the setback, but it did not deter him from pursuing his goal: the destruction of Lee’s army.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Confederate General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson died on May 10, 1863 in the Fairfield Plantation farm office, today the only building left standing amongst what was once a much more developed landscape.<br /> <br /> Eight days earlier, at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Jackson led a flank attack that successfully routed the Army of the Potomac's 11th Corps. Looking to capitalize on that momentum, Jackson conducted a night reconnaissance in front of his line with a small group of staff officers. In the darkness, Confederate troops from the 18th North Carolina mistook this group of Confederates for Federal cavalry and opened fire. The Carolinians hit Jackson three times.<br /> <br /> The survivors worked quickly to carry Jackson into friendly territory, eventually reaching the field hospital near Wilderness Tavern. Two days later an ambulance carried Jackson a distance of 27 miles, from the field hospital to Guinea Station. Doctors hoped that Jackson would gain strength at Guinea and then proceed to Richmond by rail. However, Jackson developed symptoms of pneumonia and ultimately died on May 10, 1863.</p> <h4><br /> The Marker</h4> <p>This marker is one of 10 similar small rectangular stone monuments commonly referred to as the Smith Markers, because of the role that one of Jackson's former staff officers, James Power Smith, played in their placement. The markers identify important sites related to Robert E. Lee, his generals, and their actions from 1862-1864.<br /> <br /> The effort to place these stones began in 1902 when Samuel B. Woods, of Charlottesville, Virginia, suggested the formation of a committee to mark important places on the battlefield. James Power Smith later described the effort, saying, \"The purpose was not to mark battlefields, or lines of battle, but certain points or localities that would be of lasting historic interest.\"<sup>1 </sup>The placement of the markers came at a high point in efforts to memorialize the Confederacy before veterans of the war died off. The sites that the committee selected all mark events and stories that, by 1902, had become important parts of the Lost Cause interpretation of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> Smith directed the placement of the markers, including this one next to the farm office where Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson died. Placement was completed in 1903. Originally this marker was west of the house, near the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac rail line. Smith placed it there so that it could be readily seen by train passengers. The National Park Service moved it to its current location in the 1960s.</p> <h4><br /> Description</h4> <p>The stone marker is are one and one half feet square and has a rough point at the top. The blocks reputedly weigh one ton a piece and are chiseled from clear blue Fredericksburg granite taken from the Fall Hill or Taylor quarries. The stone reads:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /> STONEWALL JACKSON<br /> DIED<br /> MAY 10, 1863<br /> BURIED<br /> LEXINGTON, VA.</p> <p><br /> The National Park Service added the last two lines of the inscription to prevent the misconception that the monument marked Jackson’s grave. Unlike other Smith Markers, the first line of the monument has a crescent shape. There is a large crack in the stone that has required occasional repair.</p> <hr /> <ol> <li> <p>Smith, James P. “Spotsylvania Battle Field Markers,” Southern Historical Society Papers, 41:145-46.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For more information see, Donald C.

The interpretive panels here provide an overview of the battle and the consequences of this long engagement. Bathrooms and a water fountain are also here.<br /> <br /> The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House began here on May 8, 1864. Marching down the Brock Road from the north, Federal forces ran into Confederate opposition across the road from here, at a site called Laurel Hill. A section of the Spotsylvania History Trail covers the fighting at Laurel Hill, before returning here. Repeated Federal attacks against Laurel Hill failed to dislodge the Confederate defenses, and both sides settled into building trenches and other fortifications.<br /> <br /> Fighting continued here on May 9, and in the morning a Confederate sharpshooter killed Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick, the highest-ranking Union officer to die in the Civil War. Union veterans dedicated a monument to Sedgwick in 1887, which can be seen at the entrance to the park.<br /> <br /> Realizing they could not break through at Laurel Hill, the commanders of the Union forces, Ulysses S. Grant and George G. Meade, began to look for other ways to get around the Confederates led by Robert E. Lee. Thus started a nearly two-week long battle that led one Union soldier to write “Gettysburg is a skirmish compared to this fight.” <h2>While you're here...</h2> <h4>Drive the Battlefield</h4> The Spotsylvania Battlefield Driving Tour consists of 8 tour stops through the battlefield and begins here. Follow the brown tour signs through the battlefield. Tour stops are indicated on the park map and with the round signs onsite.  <h4><br /> Hike the Spotsylvania History Trail</h4> <em>5.7 mi (9.2 km) loop</em><br /> This trail weaves throughout most of the Spotsylvania Battlefield, passing much of the 14 miles of earthworks on the battlefield and covering the majority of tour stops.

A large US attack from the east pushed Confederate forces back to this vicinity, where only a line of cannons remained to save Lee’s army. All eyes were on the Orange Plank Road, as Confederate reinforcements from General James Longstreet’s Corps were expected to arrive any moment. General Lee was visibly distraught as potential disaster loomed. Then a column of troops approached, led by the renowned Texas brigade.<br /> <br /> Lee accompanied the Confederate infantry as it deployed to halt the Federal advance. The troops realized their leader was in harm’s way, and raised chants of “Lee to the rear!” as a Texan grabbed the reins of Lee’s horse and led him away from danger. The brigade pitched into the US formations and, along with the rest of Longstreet’s force, held the Federals at bay, but lost 500 of their 800 men in the charge.<br /> <br /> Another remarkable incident occurred when the Tapp family attempted to escape the battle by running out of their nearby house. Young Phenie Tapp, only four years old, recalled how “the bullets struck the dirt around them, kicking up dust like the first drops of a coming storm.” Miraculously, the Tapps survived the ordeal, just one of numerous local families impacted by the war.<br />   <h2>While you're here...</h2> <h4>Hike the Widow Tapp Farm Trail</h4> <em>1 mi (1.6 km) round trip.<br /> Start: Tapp Field, Tour Stop 6.</em> As the battle hung in the balance on the edge of this field, Confederate reinforcements arrived here just in time to save the Army of Northern Virginia.A one mile trail includes interpretive signs, cannons, original earthworks, and a monument to the Texas brigade.",

Meade aimed for a swampy tract of woods that Confederate General A.P. Hill left undefended, thinking it was impassible. When Meade's troops broke through the Confederate line they surprised unprepared South Carolinians. Soon the Confederates rallied, and without reinforcements nearby, Meade's men could not hold their position against Confederate General \"Stonewall\" Jackson's 38,000-man corps.<br /> <br /> This incident was just one of a series of tangled communications that left both flanks of the Army of the Potomac disadvantaged.<br /> <br /> On this side of the battlefield, US General William B. Franklin was in command of roughly 60,000 soldiers. His target was the high ground around Prospect Hill held by \"Stonewall\" Jackson's Confederate corps. On the morning of December 13, Franklin received orders to \"send out at once a division at least to pass below Smithfield, to seize, if possible, the height near Captain Hamilton’s, on this side of the Massaponax, taking care to keep it well supported and its line of retreat open.\" Franklin sent out one division and kept his line of retreat supported; by his thinking he followed his orders exactly as Burnside gave them.<br /> <br /> Did \"a division at least\" imply that Franklin should have been more prepared to send in additional troops? Was \"if possible\" the right way to describe taking the critical high ground? After the battle, Burnside's orders to Franklin, and Franklin's interpretation of Burnside's orders, became the subject of unceasing debate by Congressional committee and the American public, and has remained a subject of interest for generations of historians and Civil War enthusiasts.</p>",

Meanwhile, Confederate soldiers had dug miles worth of trenches, including a position known as the Muleshoe Salient (a salient is a piece of fortification that juts out from the main line). The Muleshoe, nearly a mile long and a mile wide, posed a threat to its own Confederate defenders because it opened them to attack from multiple directions at the same time. Federal officers planned to attack the Muleshoe in an attempt to cut the Confederate army in two.<br /> <br /> A young officer named Emory Upton was tasked with attacking a piece of the Muleshoe not far from here. Given 12 regiments, totaling almost 5,000 men, Upton moved into position. Rather than standard line of battle, Upton’s force formed into a column that went forward like a large fist around 6 pm on May 10, 1864. Over the next hour and a half, both sides engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat that saw Upton’s men punch through the Confederate defenses but then were in turn forced back by Confederate counterattacks. One Confederate wrote about the fighting that the soldiers “had to think like lightning to decide whether we would stay in the ditch and be bayoneted or made prisoners or run to the rear and probably be shot in the back.” Though Upton’s attack failed on May 10, it gave the Federal high command the idea to try a similar approach two days later with a much larger force.<br />  </p> <h2>While you're here...</h2> <h4>Walk Upton's Road</h4> <p><em>0.5 mi (0.8 km) round trip</em><br /> A half-mile trail that starts here follows near the path Upton’s troops marched to reach the Confederate positions.

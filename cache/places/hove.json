Some are open rock, others have remains of stonework nearby - rooms where people stored crops such as corn, beans, and squash. A surplus harvest was essential to the ancestral Puebloans because they had to get through the inevitable bad years when crops failed. We believe they kept at least 1 yearsâ€™ surplus crops for every person in the community.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Floyd Collins Homestead provides a valuable link with the early 20th century tourism of Mammoth Cave and has played an important role in early exploration of the expansive cave system. <br /> <br /> After Floyd Collins discovered the entrance to Great Crystal Cave in 1917, he and his family started a show cave business and began living at the Floyd Collins Homestead. The business ran for eight years until the death of Floyd Collins in 1925 in nearby Sand Cave. This tragedy brought a lot of attention to the Mammoth Cave area, including interest in the Great Crystal Cave, which the Collins family still owned.  <br /> <br /> In 1927, Dr. H. B. Thomas purchased the Collins Homestead and Crystal Cave, renamed the cave to “Floyd Collins Crystal Cave,” and continued the tourism business. Dr. Thomas and his descendants operated the Floyd Collins Crystal Cave as a private show cave from 1927 until 1960 when it was purchased by the National Park Service to be included within Mammoth Cave National Park.  <br /> <br /> The Floyd Collins Homestead also plays a significant role in cave exploration and cave science. The homestead was the first headquarters of the Cave Research Foundation, a group dedicated to the further exploration and understanding of caves and cave science. The Cave Research Foundation used the Floyd Collins Homestead as a base of operations for many of their expeditions to explore the Flint Ridge Cave System. In 1972, a famous expedition occurred that connected the Flint Ridge Cave System with the Mammoth Cave System and proved that Mammoth Cave was the longest known cave with a length of 144.4 miles (232.4 km) at the time of the discovery Since that time further exploration by the Cave Research Foundation and other organizations has extended the known length of Mammoth Cave to over 400 miles (643 km). </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Floyd Collins Homestead is reached by walking on a gravel roadbed, roughly one and a half miles long, through a heavily wooded area. The wooded area opens up at the end of the gravel road to a loop, where there are two light green buildings situated roughly 50 feet beyond the gravel road, and are roughly 75 feet from each other, with the building on the left being a one-story house and the building in the right being a single story structure. The building on the left has two deciduous trees in front of the house. The one-story house has a gray corrugated metal roof, slanting forwards and backwards over the house. The house is constructed with slat boards, all painted light green, and has a window and a door, complete with a screen on the left side, with the window trim and doorframe painted white. Mirroring the left-hand side of the house, there is an identical door and window. In between the two doors, roughly 6 feet high, there is a white painted board nailed to the slat boards, with black block lettering which reads, “Floyd Collins Home.” The second building is larger than the house, with a wraparound covered patio, with wooden floors and wooden support beams roughly every ten feet. This building is also constructed with slat boards painted light green, and there is a corridor diving the building in two. The left portion of the building is just the light green painted slat board, but on the right-side portion of the building there is a ten-foot-long rectangular window, exposing the inside of the building. Behind both of the buildings, there is a wooded area, with a small pathway making its way down a hill.",

The Rotunda boasts ¼ acre room. Early visitors did not get the opportunity to experience rooms this large. When they would write about their experiences they would often refer to the cave system as mammoth. After a while, that became the name everyone recognized, The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{166}\" paraid=\"727826648\">Why are there no cave formations?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{178}\" paraid=\"818144110\">Mammoth Cave is considered a dry cave. Above all the layers of limestone rock there are two more layers of sedimentary rock, sandstone and shale. These <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/rocks-of-mammoth-cave.htm\">layers of rock</a> were created long after the development of the limestone. A river flowed over this area leaving behind sand, silt and mud. These deposits solidified to form the sandstone caprock of Mammoth Cave. Unlike the soluble limestone, water can not penetrate through this type of rock. The insoluble rock layers keep Mammoth Cave dry. It is this feature that allows Mammoth Cave to be world’s longest cave system and allows all the artifacts in the cave to be preserved. </p> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{212}\" paraid=\"1372615239\">There are a few places where that caprock is weakened or absent and water can slowly make its way through the layers. In this locations we do find the classic <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/stalactites-stalagmites-and-cave-formations.htm\">cave formations</a> such as; stalactites, stalagmites, draperies, soda straws, cave bacon, cave grapes, cave popcorn and rim stone dams to name a few. All of these formations are typical of a wet cave.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{252}\" paraid=\"1694744471\">Tours to see wet formations: Frozen Niagara, Domes and Dripstones, Gothic Avenue, Violet City [lantern tour], Grand Avenue, Great Onyx [lantern tour], Introduction to Caving [crawling tour], Wild Cave [crawling tour].<br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{25}\" paraid=\"806533793\">How often do rocks fall?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{33}\" paraid=\"161328481\"><em>Only Once, lol. Typical cave humor. It’s the lowest form of humor there is, lol... </em></p> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{47}\" paraid=\"1946172559\">Enough with the horrible puns. This is a legit question that comes up quite often. The truth of the matter is that it does occur occasionally. These stone passages stabilized themselves long ago and there aren’t many outside forces acting on them. Sometimes there are changes in the environment that affect the rock layers. Areas next to entrances or ventilation shafts experience sufficient temperature change to create ice wedging between the layers. In areas where water is still flowing freely the cave experiences changes as rocks are dislodged by the water. </p> <p paraeid=\"{665ec8dc-10ce-4e8e-bc0c-9560d87c4cdb}{252}\" paraid=\"1694744471\"> </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{89}\" paraid=\"1215130733\">Are people still exploring the cave?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{95}\" paraid=\"394914924\">Cave exploration is still active and headed up by the Cave Research Foundation. The group is comprised of scientists, cave enthusiasts and members of the <a href=\"https://caves.org/\">National Speleological Society</a>.  The <a href=\"https://www.cave-research.org/\">Cave Research Foundation</a> (CRF) expedition leaders schedule excursions into the cave on holiday weekends when the members are off from their everyday jobs. Pushing their limits down in these depths trying to find those unexplored passages to add to length of this system. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{155}\" paraid=\"275997700\">How much of the cave was enlarged by people? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{165}\" paraid=\"830585508\">Mammoth Cave is what is considered a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/how-mammoth-cave-formed.htm\">solution cave</a>. Which means it was formed in soluble rock through a chemical reaction that caused the rock to dissolve thus creating passages. The cave is naturally formed by the underground rivers flowing against the limestone walls. The cave walls and ceiling have not been altered by man. The rivers that flowed through left behind large amounts of sediment and displaced rocks.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{187}\" paraid=\"229064473\">Throughout the use of the cave the floor has been altered. That is to say, loose rocks have been moved around and dirt has been removed in some areas to allow for more clearance between the floor and ceiling. In the Rotunda, the floor has been built up by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/saltpetre-mining.htm\">saltpetre</a> processing. After the nitrates were removed from the sediment, mine workers would shovel the wet mud from the leeching vats. The spent dirt was piled up along the sides of the chamber. This caused the floor of the room to rise almost eight feet in some places.<br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{231}\" paraid=\"597022712\">How many entrances are there?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{243}\" paraid=\"1429546519\">So far, we know of 27 entrances. The Historic Entrance is the largest natural entrance. A total of six entrances are used by visitors to access different guided tour experiences. The Great Onyx entrance is not counted among those because the connection of these two cave systems has not been found yet.  <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{6}\" paraid=\"2085965807\">Is there gold or gems in the cave?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{18}\" paraid=\"1412894393\">No. The limestone rock is not ideal for discovering gold or other gems. However, aside from calcite formations, the cave does have a variety of minerals that can be found on its walls. Salts such as gypsum, epsomite, and mirabilite can be found within the cave. Some of these were harvested by prehistoric <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/historyculture/native-americans.htm\">Native Americans</a>.<br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{51}\" paraid=\"506643395\">What is the black stuff on the walls? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{57}\" paraid=\"64555320\">As the limestone is drying out pushing moisture from its pores, it is picking up other minerals along the way. Here, when the moisture evaporates from the surface of the rock it leaves behind gypsum. The build up can take on various forms depending on the shape of the pore it traveled through. Through small pores a sugary crust will develop along the surface. It sparkles like fresh fallen snow. Naturally it is white in color but also appears light brown due to interactions with impurities found here. If the gypsum is forced from a larger pore, sugary lilies and clusters of delicate flowers will bloom on the walls and ceilings. These fragile formations are rated a two on the Mohs hardiness scale (Diamond being a 10 and talc being a one). They are about the same sturdiness of dried up cake icing. In early tourism visitors were allowed to pluck these beauties from the walls to take as souvenirs. With the creation of this national park, beautiful places like this are now protected for future generations. </p> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{89}\" paraid=\"1605357060\">In this section of the cave, the thin crust has been blackened by the smoke of bonfires and from lanterns. Native Americans harvested gypsum in the main cave. </p> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{103}\" paraid=\"1147832460\">Tours to see dry formations: Great Onyx [lantern tour], Cleveland Avenue, Accessible, Grand Avenue, Violet City [lantern tour], Wild Cave [crawling tour], Introduction to Caving [crawling tour].<br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{115}\" paraid=\"1756035765\">Why is the ceiling flat? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{121}\" paraid=\"1599476800\">Limestone is naturally formed in layers, like the layers of a cake. The limestone in the Mammoth Cave area was created when there was a salty sea covering this area of Kentucky. In this sea was a vast ecosystem of aquatic life. Many of these creatures had hard parts, such as shells. When one of these organisms died, the hard parts accumulated as sediment on the sea floor. This sediment continued to build over time and eventually solidify creating <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/nature/fossils.htm\">fossil</a> rich limestone rocks. When you gaze at the expanse of a flat ceiling in the cave, you are essentially looking at the bottom surface of an exposed layer of limestone. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{192}\" paraid=\"1209508542\">Where is the water that formed the cave now? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{198}\" paraid=\"208636599\">Over thousands of years the Green River has been cutting deeper into the valley. At the same time water in the cave is striving to be at the same level as the river on the outside. As time passes water is finding cracks in the limestone and seeping deeper creating layers of twisting passages. <br /> <br /> Once you leave the cave, you can hike the River Styx Spring trail 0.4 miles from the Historic Entrance to the Green River. This is one of many locations where the water is leaving the cave system and joining with the Green River. That will be deepest point of the subterranean labyrinth. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{12e0d934-fdcb-438b-9eee-77608b099248}{254}\" paraid=\"800426675\">Do earthquakes effect the cave? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{5}\" paraid=\"1006150961\">The closest major fault is the New Madrid, located almost 200 miles away. Seismic activity in South Central Kentucky does not occur often, but on the occasion shock waves may reach this area. The areas most impacted by the tremors will be on the surface. To understand this, imagine a rock being thrown into a pond. A duck swimming on top would feel the ripple and waves on the surface of the pond, but a fish swimming at some depth beneath would not be as aware. So while earthquakes can and have caused some impact in the cave, it is relatively a safer environment when compared to the tremendous impacts earthquakes can have on the surface. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{53}\" paraid=\"1264985633\">Where are the bats?  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{61}\" paraid=\"981413756\">The bat population has taken a very hard hit with the introduction of White Nose Syndrome and urban development. Bats have been losing much of their natural habitats. This causes them to be found in places they shouldn’t be, such as attic spaces. Food sources are also diminishing due to the increased use of pesticides. Many bat species are now considered endangered or threatened. </p> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{71}\" paraid=\"628125661\">Throughout the year the are about 13 different species of bats that will take up residence in this area of Kentucky. Not all of the bats will come into the cave. During the warmer season many bats opt to sleep in the hollow of trees or the thick canopy. When dusk falls and the insects begin to swarm, the bats are much closer to their food source. These nocturnal creatures like to consume what we call “M&Ms” but that isn’t the good kind we like to eat. Their M&Ms are moths and mosquitos. So think about that the next time you see them flying around at night. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{85}\" paraid=\"490132172\">What is White-nose Syndrome? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{91}\" paraid=\"2138848472\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/bats/white-nose-syndrome.htm\">White-nose Syndrome</a> is disease created by a fungus. It effects the bats echolocation when it grows on their faces. This can cause the bat to starve or fly into obstacles. When the fugus develops on the wings it can create holes that make it impossible for the bat to fly. During hibernation the bats normally slow their body systems to allow them to burn through fat reserves slowly. The growth of the fungus on their body causes an irritation that prevents them to go into hibernation for the full season. Infected bats will sometimes wake before the spring season. This can lead to many issues such as freezing to death or starvation. <br /> <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{111}\" paraid=\"1436025296\">Why do we walk on the mats after the cave and not before we go into the cave? </h2> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{117}\" paraid=\"398467897\">We clean our shoes after going into the cave to stop us from spreading the White-nose fungal spore from Mammoth Cave. Since the fungus is already here we can not stop visitors from reintroducing it. White-nose can live in the cave for many years without being reintroduced.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{23f84393-7255-420d-b2bc-88acfd330513}{139}\" paraid=\"564822387\">Before the fungus made it here we did ask visitors to go through a decontamination process before entering into the cave. Then as infected bats were migrating the fungal spore was introduced to the cave environment. Many of the bats here became infected and the fungus spread. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6ac78a70-7d8f-4a86-992f-f03818ca0232}{187}\" paraid=\"229064473\"><br />  </p>",

The church is composed of one building and an accompanying cemetery. It was founded the third Saturday in February, 1842, by church elders Jesse Moon, R.T. Gardner and William Skaggs. The conditions of the church can be seen in a letter written in 1931 by Aunt Susie Blair to Charlie Whittle: “On Sunday we went to church where Good Spring Church now stands. The old house was built of logs and heated with a fireplace.” Her letter also mentions that, when the number of service attendees was larger than the church could hold, they had service outside amongst the trees. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f0fa6d01-d5a2-4c5f-bb19-768a07b96a34}{220}\" paraid=\"4\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f0fa6d01-d5a2-4c5f-bb19-768a07b96a34}{222}\" paraid=\"5\">Before this church was formed, its members had to travel to Nolin Baptist Church or to a church in Beaver Dam. With Nolin Baptist church being about 10 miles away, and with the town of Beaver Dam being about 65 miles away, the construction of the Good Spring Baptist Church saved residents considerable travel time. The church charter members included Brown Blair, Mary Blair, Isaac Blair, Lucy Blair, David Blair, Betsy Blair, J.L. Smith, Sarah Smith, Rachel Pace, William Skaggs, J.D. Sanders, Sally Sanders, Thomas Meredith, Esaline Smith and Pega Davis. Many of these charter members were descendants of the pioneer Baptists that settled in Green County near the Brush Creek Church, located in Tennessee. </p> <p paraeid=\"{02835b6c-8d80-458c-9b0e-bfde06bd7c26}{29}\" paraid=\"6\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{02835b6c-8d80-458c-9b0e-bfde06bd7c26}{31}\" paraid=\"7\">Good Spring Baptist Church had the largest membership of any church in the Green River Association from 1896 to 1900. When the National Park Service acquired the church property, the church dissolved. The church building itself is still standing today. It currently holds reunion services for descendants of the pioneers during a yearly homecoming and dinner on the grounds. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1991.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "In a clearing among the trees there lies a small church off to one side. To the other side of the clearing there are picnic benches and a cemetery. Simplistic in its build it was once built of logs and heated with a fireplace. Good Spring Baptist Church was built by its parishioners. Painted white with two doors for entering and/or exiting the church, one of which has a ramp leading up to it. Inside it's still set up as if church services had occurred yesterday.",

Maybe that was what occurred almost 5,000 years ago with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/historyculture/native-americans.htm\">Prehistoric Native Americans</a>. They may have been out gathering supplies or hunting when they came across this amazing portal. Intrigued, they set off to explore. We find evidence they traveled over 19 miles with river cane torches to light their way. They journeyed into the cave for about 3,000 years before the exploration stopped... Why do you think they stopped coming into the cave?<br /> <br /> It wasn’t until the late 1700s, that a local legend says a young boy, named John Houchin, rediscovered the cave. According to the legend, this young boy was hunting along the ridge line with his father’s Kentucky long rifle. He spotted a large black bear, a mammal we no longer find in the park. Raising the rifle to his shoulder he took aim and fired. BOOM!... When the smoke cleared, he realized he had only wounded the bear. The injured bear took off down the hillside and deep into the cave. Not wanting to come back empty handed, the boy took off after the bear. Do you think he ever found that bear? What we do know is that this story spread and cave travel began once more.<br /> <br /> As you walk down the steps into the entrance, notice the water cascading from the limestone layers of the entrance. This feature will play an important role in one of our future stops.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Houchin Ferry was once the site of a vehicle ferry that shuttled residents back and forth on their commutes across the Green River.<br /> <br /> Houchin Ferry/Ollie Road had long been the most direct route linking the town of Brownsville to areas on the Northeastern side of Edmonson County. Some residents had long commuted from the rural northeastern part of the county to Brownsville by way of Houchin Ferry. Over the years, the ferry was closed now and then for various reasons which caused a hardship for the local commuters.  <br /> <br /> In 2013 the Houchin Ferry was put out of service and dry-docked. There was an uncontrolled breach in the Green River Lock and Dam #6 in November 2016  and subsequent removal which caused the river levels to drop 8-10 feet. The lower river levels make Houchin Ferry unreliable to use as a vehicle ferry crossing so residents are no longer able to commute to or from Brownsville using this route across the river. <br /> <br /> Today, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/planyourvisit/houchinferrycg.htm\">Houchin Ferry Campground</a> is a popular area among local and out of town visitors for camping and river access. There are twelve campsites with a view of the Green River that offer picnic tables, fire rings and vault toilets. It is surrounded by dense woods on two sides of the campground with the third side sitting directly adjacent to the riverbank.  This area is a nice spot for the active fisherman and camper seeking a quiet primitive experience.  There are no designated hiking trails at this area.   </p>",

Locals attended weekly church services, weddings, baptisms, homecomings, revivals, funerals and grave decoration days.social interactions with family and neighbors from the area. These churches were also places of social interactions with family and neighbors as they were sometimes used as meeting houses and schools for the communities they served. <br /> <br /> Before Mammoth Cave National Park was formed there were several churches that served the communities in the immediate area of the cave. Joppa Church is one of three remaining structures that was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The church was established in 1862. The Joppa Church served the community of Elko and the residents of the Joppa Ridge area. Elko or Joppa community lay between Woolsey Valley and the Green River and between Turnhole Bend and Deer Park Hollow. The very earliest settlers to this area in the early 1800’s were the families of Davis’, Jones’, Houchins’, Blairs’ along with others. These families were followed by others that were important in the early history of the area they are the families of Ages’, Denhams’, Gentrys’, Merediths’, Woods’, Minyards’ McCombs’, Rutherfords’ Simmons’, Smiths’, Sanders’, Parkers’ to name a few.  <br /> <br /> In 1880 there was five to six square mile area, with families that had no church to serve them. The first building at Joppa was a log schoolhouse that stood on the grounds where the current church stands today.  <br /> <br /> The church was first known as Pleasant Union and was constituted in the log schoolhouse. Wm. Travis Blair wrote of this event and said, “A Baptist minister living in the community held a series of meetings at the home of John Bailey Blair which resulted in the church being formed.” In the early 1900 the old log church was torn down to make way for the wood frame building that is still standing today.  Today the church grounds and cemetery are open to visitors as a day use area. Joppa Church holds a Homecoming every year on the second Sunday of September. </p>",

    "audioDescription": "The Mammoth Cave Baptist Church is a one-story frame building approximately 42 feet long by 26 feet wide, with white weatherboard siding and a tin gable front roof. The Church sits on a foundation of sandstone blocks. The front of the church has two entrances with three cement steps at each. There is a wooden sign between each door noting, “Mammoth Cave Baptist Church, Established 1827, Meeting Saturday and Sunday”. There is a third door on the side of the building. This entrance has three cement steps to enter. Each sidewall has four two-over-two double-hung sash windows. The church’s interior is unadorned with wood tongue-and groove planked walls and ceiling, and a wood plank floor covered with linoleum in some spots. There are a number of movable hand made pews in the church which are set in rows facing the podium. The Church building is deteriorating slightly from lack of regular use. It is original in design, workmanship and in most materials. The chimney on the west side of the building was removed in the 1970’s when the original metal roof was replaced. The church is wired for electricity. The Mammoth Cave Church property is in good condition with dense woods behind and to the east side of the church. It is a short walk to the west side of the church to the Mammoth Cave Baptist Cemetery.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Located ¼ mile down the hill from the park visitor center, the Historic Entrance is the largest natural opening into the Mammoth Cave system. For thousands of years this site has served as a gateway to the underground world beneath the park. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/maca/learn/historyculture/native-americans.htm\">Prehistoric people</a> first entered the cave through this entrance between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago seeking the resources of minerals the cave holds. Later <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/saltpetre-mining.htm\">saltpetre mining</a> operations dominated the landscape near the entrance, eventually leading way to tourism in 1816. Since then, over two hundred years of guided cave tours have taken place at Mammoth Cave.  </p> <h2>John Houchins and the Bear </h2> <p>Although the credit of the cave’s discovery belongs to the prehistoric Native Americans, the question remains as to how the cave came to the attention of European settlers in the area. According to legend, in the late 1790s a young boy named John Houchins, was out hunting for game for his family. He spotted a black bear roaming through the forest near the entrance of the cave, he took aim and fired. His shot failed to be fatal for the bear, only wounding the animal. The injured bear ran down the hill and took shelter in the cave, leading Houchins into the cave. The legend tapers off at this point, leaving unanswered the question of whether Houchins ever got his bear, but whether or not, Houchins gained the credit of the modern discovery of the great cave. </p> <h2>Visiting the Historic Entrance </h2> <p>The Historic Entrance of Mammoth Cave is viewable all hours, free of charge. To access this area, follow the paved trail down the hill behind the visitor center. The walk along this path travels 0.25 miles and takes about 5-10 minutes. Along the way there are wayside signs that describe the areas geology, and several benches are available. Please note that this trail has a steep incline and is not rated as wheelchair accessible. <br /> <br /> During the busy spring and summer season, the Historic Entrance can be a congested area. Large tour groups pass through this area about every 15 minutes at peak visitation. If there is not a tour entering the cave, you can travel down the 65 stairsteps and travel about 300 feet into the cave opening before reaching the gate.  </p>",

In 1874 Colonel Larkin J. Procter, who was the owner of the stagecoach line, chartered the Mammoth Cave Railroad with his brother George and other investors and leased the railroad rights to Mammoth Cave from the L&N Railroad. <br /> <br /> The new railroad acquired four used steam engine locomotives. They were Baldwin “dummy” steam engines formally used on the street railways in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee. The reason the small steam Baldwin locomotive was called “dummy” was because it was boxed up to look like a passenger streetcar. They also acquired two wooden passenger coaches and two wooden combination coaches and baggage cars.   <br /> <br /> The actual work on the railroad did not begin until 1880, and was officially opened for business on November 8th of 1886. The first passenger, W.F. Richardson, paid $3.00 for ticket #1350 as was recorded in the Mammoth Cave Hotel Register on November 8, 1886. The Mammoth Cave Railroad would make several stops at places such as Diamond Caverns, Chaumont Post Office, Proctor’s Hotel and Sloan’s Crossing during its short 8.7-mile trip from Glasgow Junction (Park City) to the Mammoth Cave. <br /> <br /> The Mammoth Cave Railroad was a short rail line with a small train. This “dummy” type locomotive and its accompanying combine coach were among the last of their kind used in the United States. The final run of the Mammoth Cave Railroad occurred in 1931. The original Locomotive “Hercules” #3 was unable to make the last run, so Locomotive #4 was renamed “Hercules” to keep with tradition.  <br /> <br /> Today, visitors can still travel by foot or bicycle on the rail path as the abandoned line was converted to the Mammoth Cave Bike and Hike Trail in 2004.   </p>",

The exterior of “Hercules” is nine feet wide and twenty-three feet long and stands eleven feet high. There is an entrance at each end with five windows along each wall. The exterior is painted black with white lettering above the windows “Mammoth Cave R.R. Co.” and a large number 4 below the window in the center of the car.

    "bodyText": "<p>Mammoth Cave has represented the challenge of the unknown for millennia, from the time the first American Indian explorers ventured inside some 5,000 years ago, to the cave’s rediscovery by European settlers at the turn of the 19th century, and still today as explorers, scientists, and visitors from the United States and around the world brave its shadowed chambers in search of wonder and new knowledge. Named for the enormity of its “mammoth” subterranean vaults and the unparalleled extent of its passages, Mammoth Cave is the longest known cave system in the world with 412 miles surveyed to date.<br /> <br /> In 1941, Mammoth Cave’s superlative qualities led the Southern Appalachian National Park Commission to recommend that the cave be made into a national park along with other national treasures such as Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah. The Mammoth Cave National Park Association and the Kentucky National Park Commission began the necessary, and unprecedented, 15-year process to convert settled areas into parklands, and once congressional requirements were met, Mammoth Cave National Park entered the national park system.<br /> <br /> Today, Mammoth Cave National Park (the park) comprises approximately 52,830 acres in Edmonson, Hart, and Barren counties in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Visitors are drawn to the park by its caves, scenic river valleys, bluffs, forests, and abundant wildlife. The park offers ranger-led cave tours and surface walks, camping, hiking, horseback riding, bicycling, scenic drives, canoeing and kayaking, fishing, accessible trails, and picnicking. This breadth of activities is available because Mammoth Cave National Park is a park on two levels—reclaimed hardwood forest and winding riverways above, and complex cave systems below.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>African American History at Mammoth Cave</strong><br /> The history of enslavement and manumission at Mammoth Cave began in the earliest days of the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> century, when teams of enslaved Africans and African Americans labored extracting minerals from cave soil for the commercial production of gunpowder before and during the War of 1812. Commercial tours began almost immediately after and continued through the Civil </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">War, when several skirmishes and battles, including the battle of Munfordville in September of 1862, occurred less than 20 miles from the cave entrance.</span></p> <p>Serving as guides and explorers at Mammoth Cave partially rescued at least four men from the obscurity of enslavement. Stephen Bishop, Materson Bransford, Nicholas Bransford, and Alfred Croghan, all had their existence documented in the written journals and diaries of various 19<sup>th</sup> century Mammoth Cave visitors. They were physically described, their personalities contemplated, their intelligence gauged, and their dialects imitated. At least one abolitionist characterized Stephen Bishop, who found many miles of new cave passages, as a charismatic natural leader who could govern the citizenry of freedmen in Liberia, should he choose to relocate there.</p> <p>Modern cavers and researchers have monitored the cave explorations of these men for years. Their dated signatures are found in various places around the cave, often documenting discovery dates of passageways and exploration parties involved. With the exception of Mat Bransford, the personal and professional lives of enslaved Mammoth Cave Guides are shrouded in mystery and continue to be researched. The park’s cultural and geographic landscape, including segregated cemeteries, lends some understanding of these early guides, their families, and their enslavement.</p> <p><strong>Content used with permission from Eastern National’s <a href=\"http://generalstore.eparks.com/store/product/92424/Guidebook-to-African-American-History-in-the-National-Parks/\">Guidebook to African American History in National Parks.</a></strong></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Old Guide’s Cemetery is the burial place of one of Mammoth Cave’s earliest cave guides, Stephen Bishop. Bishop was an African-American man who spent almost 20 years guiding cave tours of Mammoth Cave, first as an enslaved guide and then as a free man. He is considered by many to be the most famous cave guide and explorer in Mammoth Cave’s history. The stories of his discoveries inside the cave are shared with hundreds of park visitors annually.  <br /> <br /> The cemetery is the resting place of several members of the surrounding communities, dating from the early 1840’s to the late 1850’s. Also buried here are three patients who died during the experimental Tuberculosis cure treatment held within Mammoth Cave during the winter of 1842. Several of the stone huts where the patients lived can still be found within the cave and are viewable on several tours offered to the public.  <br /> <br /> The Old Guide’s Cemetery is one of approximately 80 cemeteries located within Mammoth Cave National Park and is included in the National Register of Historic Places. It is located near the visitor center, off of the half-mile long Heritage Trail that connects to several other trails in the park. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Old Guide’s Cemetery is located within a wooded area, with fallen leaves strewn over the grass. There is a concrete pathway that leads to a black painted metal fence, roughly four feet tall, surrounding the cemetery. In front of the black painted metal fence there are two wayside exhibits, approximately 15 feet apart, containing information about the cemetery and the people buried within. The wayside exhibits are located on a broad semicircular cement section. The wayside exhibit on the left-hand side of the concrete platform addresses the strong African-American heritage associated with Mammoth Cave. The wayside exhibit on the right-hand side discusses Stephen Bishop and his impact on Mammoth Cave and his gravestone. The black painted metal fence is roughly 60 by 100 feet, and protects the cemetery. There are two deciduous trees within the Old Guide’s Cemetery, roughly in the center, one larger and one smaller. There are many stone headstones of varying sizes scattered throughout the cemetery. Two box tombs, made of stacked stone, are located within, one towards the front left of the cemetery and the other in the back-right corner, as well as a stone sarcophagus, located in the left portion of the cemetery.",

Pipes carried water from the waterfall at the entrance of the cave to these leeching vats. The water slowly seeped through the layers of dirt, pulling with it the nitrates from the soil. The muddy solution would travel through the filter made by the interlocking logs at the bottom, separating debris from the nitrate rich water. The mixture was piped to the surface and placed in large cauldrons where workers would add some ingredients and then boil it down until all that was left was a crystal known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/saltpetre-mining.htm\">saltpetre</a>. This crystal is the number one ingredient of black gun powder. America was still young at the time of this operation and the saltpetre created here became very important during the War of 1812. By the end of the war in 1815, America had maintained its freedom. Unfortunately, the majority of the workers in the saltpetre production were enslaved men who would not reap the benefit of freedom for themselves. <br /> <br /> With the end of saltpetre production a new means of industry would develop here at Mammoth Cave. A steel door was installed in the Houchin’s Narrows barring entry. Curious bystanders would now need to purchase a ticket to gain entry into the darkness. Parties were led by local guides that had knowledge of the cave. By 1816, tourism would become the new business model for Mammoth Cave. What do you think it was like for those early visitors?</p>",

Long exposure to cooking and heating fires in the cold clammy cave wrecked havoc on their weakened conditions. The cure for consumption would not be found in the depths of Mammoth Cave. <br /> <br /> The eight wooden huts are no longer standing due to development of tourist trails and people venturing too close to the historic buildings. The second stone building in the distance had to be stabilized. The reconstruction of the shelter left some of the walls incomplete.</p>",

The agent, the doctor surmised must be the cave air.  In 1839 Dr. Croghan purchased the cave from Franklin Gorin for $10,000.00, slaves and all. <br /> <br /> Dr. Croghan sent his slaves into the cave to construct a series of buildings, two of stone, eight of wood, to function as a sanitorium where his patients could “take the airs.”  Dr. Croghan led his patients into the cave to their new residence, where they remained for weeks. <br /> <br /> At first the patients claimed to be improving, Dr. Croghan, anticipating success began to draw up plans for a hotel to be built inside the cave.  But as time passed it became obvious that the patients’ claims only came from improved moral.  The smoke from the cooking and heating fires, the cold clammy cave air began to ravage lungs already weakened by disease. <br /> <br /> In all, five patients perished underground, admitting at last that his experiment had failed Dr. Croghan brought the surviving patients back to the surface.  Dr. Croghan himself would struggle with tuberculosis until it claimed his life in 1849.  His will would grant ownership of the cave to his heirs, nine nieces and nephews and would remain in that family until the 1920’s. <br /> <br /> NPS Mobile App Users: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=4DBF1A00-A323-41B1-A30B-55C453656000\">Click here to watch a video of a ranger at the TB Huts.</a></p>",

The site also has restrooms, picnic tables, and a playground. </p> <h2>Nolin: The Story Behind the Name</h2> <p>The Nolin River is named for the early American explorer and Kentucky militia member, Benjamin Lynn. Serving under George Rogers Clark during the Revolutionary War, Lynn traveled to Illinois to spy on the British and Indian forces, and also played a pivotal role in the Northwest Campaign on 1778-79. Following his return to Kentucky, Lynn and several friends were camped in the Green River Area. Lynn became separated from his friends and could not be found for several days. Each night, they returned from the search reporting “No Lynn.” The river at which they camped became known as the Nolin.</p> <p>Many of the early settlers in the area around the Nolin River came from Nordic regions which is reflected in community names such as Stockholm and Sweeden. Others came from France, showing influence through community names like Moutardier and Chalybeate. Rich in culture, the local area mirrors history and tradition in small businesses around the lake.</p> <h2>Contact Nolin River Lake USACE</h2> <p>For more information about the Tailwater Recreation area, please contact Nolin River Lake USACE.</p> <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:500px;\"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>Phone:</p> </td> <td> <p>(270) 286-4511 </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Mailing Address:</p> </td> <td> <p>P.O.

On the surface you can see many historic signatures, as well as some not so historic signatures. Names like J.N. McDowell M.D., 1839 is considered historic. The signature was scribed before the cave became a national park in 1941. After the establishment of the national park, marking on the cave walls became a federal offense. The earliest name for this particular landmark was “Steamboat”, by the 1840’s visitors decided it looked more like a giant’s coffin.<br /> <br /> Guides began to weave tales about a race of giants that once roamed this land. The smallest among them began to venture daily into these depths. Inside the cave he found a world untouched by the light and filled with strange creatures living in the darkness. The young giant named Cozad befriended the creatures, promising to protect them and their home. Local tribes would bring offerings to the cave entrance daily for the kind giant. As time passed, days became years and years became centuries but each night the offerings would be gone. A peaceful relationship developed between the tribes and Cozad. Entry to this underworld would remain open as long as no harm came to the cave or to those that dwelled there.<br /> <br /> One night, a tribal warrior was on patrol around the entrance and noticed the offerings had not been accepted. Tribal leaders were worried they had offended the giant. So they sent their finest warriors and scholars on a pilgrimage to find the gentle giant and to assure the treaty was still in place. With their torches held high, the group journeyed into the depths. Shadows danced in the flickering amber light that stretched up against the ashen stone walls. Pushing deeper into the quiet void, they found the aged gentle giant sleeping on the stone floor. They tried many things to rouse him but he would not stir. <br /> <br /> The tribe built the stone coffin that protects him today. For it is told that one day when his cave friends need him, the giant shall rise from his slumber and walk these passages once more. Till that day, people like you and I can help protect this subterranean world for future generations.</p>",

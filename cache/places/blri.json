Notable mountains include Peach Bottom Mountain, Mount Rogers, Doughton Mountain, Bald Knob, and Round Top. <br /> <br /> In the farmland below Christmas trees are grown. North Carolina is ranked 2nd in the nation for Christmas tree production. An informational wayside on site explains, \"For thousands of years Native Americans cultivated the fertile valleys of the Blue Ridge region including North Carolina. Employing techniques such as “slash and burn” to clear small areas of forested land and fertilize the soil, the Cherokee raised crops that included the “three sisters” – corn, beans, and squash.<br /> <br /> Upon settling the region, European immigrants quickly adopted many Cherokee crops and techniques alongside the agricultural practices they brought with them. This blending of farming traditions resulted in a distinctive regional agricultural heritage. <br /> <br /> From this overlook, visitors are offered a long-range view of an area of mixed agriculture in the region. Like their ancestors before them, the people of this region continue to cultivate traditional fruits and vegetables, but they have also introduced new crops such as Christmas trees, ornamentals, mushrooms, herbs, and wine grapes.”</p>",

The Predators- Until recently predatory birds and mammals, those which preyed on other animals or were in conflict with humans were termed “varmints” and killed on sight. Fortunately, modern ecology proves the vital interdependency of all wild plants and animals. Today hawks and owls, black bears, bobcats, foxes and snakes continue to roam parklands like this and help preserve the delicate balance of nature.",

At 1.3 miles long, it is the perfect length for a family hike or a leg stretcher after a long drive<br /> <br /> Get everyone out of the car and onto the trail at the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center. It's a nice 1.3-mile ramble through a mixed forest with some unique features along the way. The Visitor Center Loop Trail begins in the back corner of the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center’s parking lot, next to a small stone replica of one of the Parkway’s tunnels. It is a designated <a href=\"https://www.kidsinparks.com/\">Kids in Parks TRACK Trail</a>. Access the trail using the steps and then follow the trail to the left. Orange dots or blazes on the trees mark the trail. Follow the orange blazes and they will return you to the starting point.<br /> <br /> It’s hard not to notice the large oak trees at the start of the trail. This may mean that there was a once a home site here. These trees may have surrounded a house or lined a driveway. During the hike, the trail will lead you through a tunnel. You’ll be crossing underneath the Blue Ridge Parkway! Down the trail, the Mountains-to-Sea Trail will split off towards the Folk Art Center (it is a one way 2.5-mile hike to the Folk Art Center). Further on you’ll walk along a long ridge and then cross the Parkway to return back to the parking area. Use extreme caution as you cross the Parkway road surface. Cars sometimes travel faster than they should and there is an on-ramp intersection near the trail crossing that can cause congestion. Once across the Parkway, there’s a little moist ravine reminiscent of a tiny fern gully. Climb up and you are almost done. All in all, this is a family-friendly nature trail. <p>The Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center Loop Trail is a fairly short, easy walk that is great for people of almost any hiking skills, including families with small children. It has very little change in elevation and is mostly level throughout. It is a good hike after traveling all day.</p>",

The City of Asheville has some of the nation’s most pristine drinking water and it’s all thanks to the protection of the surrounding forests and the responsible actions of visitors like you. Parking only in established paved lots is one way to prevent erosion and keep greasy runoff from entering Asheville’s primary water supply.<br /> <br /> The North Fork Reservoir (historically the Burnett Reservoir), that crystal-blue body of water that can be spotted along the Parkway between Mount Mitchell and Craggy Gardens, is one of two artificial lakes that feed the city’s water system. This 5.8 billion-gallon lake serves as the primary drinking water source for nearly 125,000 customers both inside and outside of the city limits — including Asheville’s beloved food and beverage industries.<br /> <br /> According to the Conservation Trust for North Carolina, who the city designated to hold a conservation easement on the land, “the Asheville watershed hosts eleven plant species and nine animal species considered endangered, threatened, or significantly rare.” This easement not only protects the water quality and forest health of the surrounding area, it also protects the scenic vistas that make the Parkway famous!</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This overlook features a lush, mid-elevation forest and trail access with a view of mountain ridges across the Parkway.<br /> <br /> The long Mountains-to-Sea Trail has entrance points at this overlook and the trail is also part of the Shut-In Trail. This section of the trail is challenging. Along the hike there are some nice examples of original stonework from when George Vanderbilt constructed the trail in the 1890's to connect the Biltmore Estate to his hunting lodge at Buck Spring.<br /> <br /> This lesser visited parking area is mainly used as a rest stop, trail access, and lunch spot. The grassy area between the parking lot and the Parkway is a nice place to spread a picnic blanket and relax a while.<br /> <br /> Nearby Beaver Dam Creek flows north from the gap to the French Broad River. In early history before settlement, beavers were abundant in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Early explorers noted that beavers and their dams were prevalent. Beavers alter the landscape freely to meet their habitat needs, creating ponds and wetlands that also met the needs of other wildlife.<br /> <br /> Settlers and fur trappers came after the explorers and removed millions of beavers for their luxurious fur. The important wetlands and ponds beavers had created disappeared, as well as the wildlife that used them. Unregulated trapping caused their complete disappearance in the late 1890’s. From the 1930’s to the 1950’s beavers were reintroduced into many areas in North Carolina. In the late 1980’s they began to re-colonize rivers and streams along the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br /> <br /> Managing a major scenic motor road for practically year-round use takes unique management skills. Sharing the roadsides, creeks, culverts, and drains with beavers can be an effort. Their innate behavior is to clog culverts, block spillways, dam streams, and divert water which can cause hazards for drivers. However, they also create essential habitat for a variety of wildlife along the Parkway and beyond, which increases biological diversity. The Parkway welcomes the beaver and recognizes the balancing act required to manage this important species.<br /> <br /> Visit Beaver Dam Gap Overlook, reflect on the Blue Ridge Parkway’s ecological significance, sample the Mountains-to-Sea Trail with a quick hike, have a picnic, and enjoy a relaxing moment on the Blue Ridge Parkway.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The buildings may be gone now, but in 1896 this was the site of the newly constructed Buck Spring Lodge. Boasting views of Mount Pisgah and the surrounding valleys, this was the ideal location for George Vanderbilt to build his summer hunting lodge.<br /> <br /> The term “hunting lodge” conjures up images of rough-and-rustic living. Buck Spring Lodge was anything but. Designed by the same company that had just completed the Biltmore Estate, Vanderbilt’s summer getaway was a grand affair. Made of rot-resistant American chestnut, it was inspired by the Adirondack camps of the day. Not only was the Main Lodge two levels with several rooms, it had a covered walkway to the adjacent Midway Cottage and the separate Dining-Kitchen building. Staff had their own quarters near the entrance. There was an orchard, beehives, livestock, a garden, and the grounds were kept trim by an entire team. An entire team of sheep, that is!<br /> <br /> Of course, if you’re going to be entertaining guests such as the Secretary of War, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of the Interior like Vanderbilt did, then your lodge has to be comfortable as well as manicured. By 1912, comfort had come in the forms of electricity, indoor plumbing and hot water, telephone service, tennis and croquet courts, and even an ice house.<br /> <br /> Vanderbilt stocked the forests surrounding Buck Spring with deer, bear, and turkey. The streams were stocked with fish. Some of their descendants are still roaming around today! After a day’s hunting, hiking, or playing on the tennis court, guests would return to freshen up and don formal attire for dinner.<br /> <br /> There were several ways to get to the lodge, including riding horseback from the Biltmore Estate in Asheville on the Shut-In Trail. Named “Shut-In” for the enclosed feeling of the surrounding rhododendrons, it traveled roughly 16 miles from the French Broad River along the ridge line to the lodge. Today, it has been incorporated into the Mountains-to-Sea Trail. But riding horseback isn’t always the most comfortable way to travel. Starting in 1910, guests with automobiles could drive up in style, using a single lane road that later became NC 151.<br /> <br /> After George Vanderbilt’s death in 1914, his wife Edith would continue to use Buck Spring Lodge as a gathering place for family until her own passing in 1958. Soon after, the lodge was sold to the State of North Carolina. The State then transferred the land to the U.S. Department of Interior so that construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway could continue through the area.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the buildings of Buck Spring Lodge were removed or knocked down. While the National Park Service might have preferred to keep the lodge intact, there were several reasons why this was impossible, ranging from the cost of upkeep and renovations to the inability to staff the lodge. The remaining buildings were demolished in 1961.<br /> <br /> Today you can walk the grounds of the old lodge site and imagine what it would have been like to live like the Vanderbilts did. More than a hundred years later, you can still experience the fantastic views, cool summer breezes, and stunning fall colors. An information sign highlights the area's history and gives a site map. Access to the lodge is a short walk from the Buck Spring Gap Overlook or a 1.1 mile hike from the Pisgah Inn.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A relatively flat, grassy area crossed on one side by a hiking trail. A gravel semi-circle on one end has three wooden benches, and it opens up along the edge to the valley below. Facing the grassy area is an informational sign with some history of the Buck Spring Lodge. Following the hiking trail to the left of the sign, there is a post with the number “23” carved into it. To the left of the trail is a short set of steps leading steeply down into an open, rectangular hole. The hole is lined with old stone walls. Going back to the sign, facing across the grassy clearing, there is a gap in the trees. Crossing the grass to the gap, a short walk downhill emerges into a second open area. This courtyard-like space has a single wooden bench, and extends back to the Buck Spring Gap Overlook parking area. The uphill side of the courtyard is lined with old stone walls, and has two, uneven sets of stairs. They lead upwards, into only the woods.",

    "bodyText": "You woke up from a restful night at the Pisgah Inn and you want a nice hike before it gets too hot. Or you’re tired of fighting with your tent at the Mount Pisgah Campground and you need to just walk it off. Maybe something 2.2 miles out-and-back, somewhat rocky is fine, but not overly steep, with a sweet view and some history behind it. Oh yeah, some food would be nice too.<br /> <br /> A hike like this is too good to be true, right? Wrong! The Buck Spring Trail is exactly what you want. You can access the trail from two different places, the Buck Spring Gap Overlook and the Pisgah Inn. When starting at the inn, you’ll hike a little over a mile to get to the old site of Buck Spring Lodge. It was built in 1896 as a mountain retreat for George Vanderbilt, the owner of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville. His hunting lodge at Buck Spring is no longer standing, but you can still see old stonework and stairs from that era of elegance. Enjoy a view of Mount Pisgah and the valley below, then head back the way you came.<br /> <br /> And that food we mentioned? You can buy snacks at the camp store or pick up something more substantial at the restaurant and café at the Pisgah Inn.<br /> <br /> The Buck Spring Trailhead is located at the far north (left) corner of the Pisgah Inn parking lot. It has a large map board indicating where the trail starts. The Buck Spring Trail is part of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail. Depending on weather and road conditions, the average driving time to the trailhead is approximately 45 minutes south from Asheville or 2 hours 15 minutes north from the end of the Parkway near Cherokee.",
    "audioDescription": "Standing with your back to the trailhead, the rooms of the Pisgah Inn extend from behind you and to the left. The building continues away from your left, ending in a second building which contain offices. Beyond the offices, surrounded by shrubs and trees, is a third building for the restaurant. A small, one-way traffic circle is in front of the offices and restaurant. Still standing with your back to the trailhead, a large, oval parking lot extends in front of you and to the left, with the long sides following parallel to the inn. There is a grassy median with several trees and street lights. The vehicle spaces surround the edges of both the lot and the median, providing staff, guests, and visitors with four rows to park. Ahead of you and slightly to your right, at the far edge of the lot, directional arrows point the flow of traffic to the Camp Store. A few wooden picnic tables sit in the grass next to the restrooms, which are accessed outside of the one room building. Turning 180°, the trailhead begins as a set of steps. At knee height to your left is a wooden post. It has a carved “MST” above a circle, and a carved silhouette of a person walking with a hiking staff. On your right is a broad, upright, wooden framed map board, with a protective covering. Across the top it reads “Mount Pisgah Trail System”. Below the lettering is a basic, line map of the trails in the area. Near the center-right, about a foot under the word “Trail”, there is a curved arrow with the phrase “You Are Here”.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Camp Creek Overlook is located around a mile north of the Linville Falls Recreation Area. It derives its name from the Camp brothers, who logged parts of this area in the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> The small paved overlook does not seem particularly remarkable at first. It is surrounded by a thick forest consisting of a variety of large trees and shrubs. Galax lines much of the slope next to the curb. This vegetation is broken up only by a narrow dirt trail that lies to the right of the overlook sign. This trail descends steeply into the forest for just under 400 feet through rhododendron thickets and ultimately ends at Camp Creek. A couple of openings in the thickets provide clear access to the creek. The creek originates near Camp Creek Mountain a short distance northeast of the overlook. Below the overlook, it runs steadily from east to west flowing into the Linville River. Sections of the creek are broken up by large rocks with water rushing and churning around them. This makes for a beautiful sight as the creek flows under the shading branches that hang out over the banks. <br /> <br /> Shortly beyond the creek, the dense woods become part of the Pisgah National Forest that surrounds much of the parkway in this area. Fishing is allowed in these waters. Please consult https://www.nps.gov/blri/planyourvisit/fishing.htm to learn more about the fishing regulations on the parkway.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Canal Trail is an easy 0.4 mile loop trail that explores the remnants of the old James River and Kanawha Canal first proposed by George Washington back in the 1780s. Washington’s vision was to connect the Atlantic Ocean with the Ohio River Valley via the James and Kanawha (New) Rivers. This canal system connected the interior of Virginia with international shipping.</p> <p>The trail begins at the James River Visitor Center and gently slopes down to the foot bridge crossing the river before descending the 39 stairs to the south river bank. From there, the trail follows the bridge to the tow path/prism then downstream to Lock #7 with its corresponding waste weir and slackwater connection to the river.<br /> <br /> Four exhibits here relate the history of the lock and how it works. The trail then follows the river back to the stairwell for your return to the visitor center. Be sure to peer upstream to view the James River Water Gap which is one of the few places that rivers are able to flow through the mountains, which is exactly what Washington saw for his proposed canal route.<br /> <br /> The James River and Kanwaha Canal was a major transportation route serving to connect the Atlantic Ocean with the interior of Virginia during the 1800s. The canal operated from 1821 to 1877 ferrying finished goods to the interior inhabitants of Virginia and carrying raw materials downstream to be sold at markets.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The canal trail makes a small loop through an infrequently mowed meadow on the tall river banks of the James River just downstream from the highway overpass bridge that towers above the area. The foot path hangs directly underneath the motor road and is 28 feet above the normal water level. The loop trail is tear drop shaped as it comes off the stairwell, heads away from the river, downstream to the lock, and along the riverbank heading upstream back to the bridge. Tall sycamore and maple trees line the wide river banks. Lock 7 is about 100 feet long by 15 feet wide and about 21 feet deep providing 13 feet of lift built of polished rectangular stones some 4 feet long and 2 feet tall. Nearby Battery Creek has been rerouted to flow through the lock and into the James River.",

A variety of tall shrubs, vines, and small trees are growing down the hillside, including mountain laurel, blueberry, blackberry, sassafras, sumac, wildflowers, and hardwood sprouts (including American chestnut).<br /> <br /> This rich mix of vegetative cover makes it great wildlife habitat, especially for birds. Look and listen for eastern towhee, black-throated green warblers, indigo buntings, tufted titmouse, red-eyed vireo, and Carolina chickadee. A large variety of birds can be evident at this overlook (especially in summer) due to the mature trees, the mixed shrub layer, and the edge where the two habitats come together. Berries, nuts, and fruits from these plants are also valuable to small and large mammals.<br /> <br /> The view is east across the French Broad River Valley. Ball Mountain can be seen in the foreground with Little Pisgah, Bearwallow, Bank, High Top, and Couch Mountains visible in the distance on a clear day.<br /> <br /> Access to the Mountains-to-Sea Trail is across the Parkway from the overlook.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Chestoa View is an overlook located about 4 miles south of Linville Falls along the Blue Ridge Parkway. After turning off the parkway, a small paved parking lot is visible. It is nestled within a thick forest, obscuring the more distant views but providing an excellent example of the diverse plant life that exists in this region. Large oaks and thickets of mountain laurel help to provide shade over the parking area. It also contains a small collection of picnic tables and trash cans for visitors to use. A paved path leads down to a fork; to the left, the path turns into a set of stone steps that proceed further down 32 steps to a stone balcony situated on the eastern side of Humpback Mountain. The view looks out over North Cove, thickly covered in a variety of trees with Highway 221 barely visible as it makes its way through the bottom. Accessible from this highway, the privately-owned Linville Caverns reach deep into the western side of the cove. Looking across the other side of the cove, the western side of the Linville Gorge rises level with your eyeline. Beyond that and rising even more prominently from the eastern side of the gorge is Table Rock. Its distinct sharp cliff faces jut suddenly out of and above the otherwise gently sloping ridge. These lands are contained within the Pisgah National Forest and have trails of their own that are accessible off the Parkway. Further to the left and off into the distance, the face of Grandfather Mountain peaks out, revealing the characteristic features from which its name is derived. This provides a glimpse into Grandfather Mountain’s geologic window. Here, the ancient layer of stone that rose up over the younger rock has eroded away enough to reveal the incredible geological history of this area. This can be further explored at Grandfather Mountain or the Museum of North Carolina Minerals. From the right fork, the paved path gives way to a dirt trail called Chestoa View Trail. This narrow loop is 0.6 miles long and brings the visitor further into the depths of the forest. Following along the slope of Humpback Mountain, the trail provides a clearer view of Table Rock than is available at the balcony. Wooden fences line some sections of the trail where it meanders alongside a steep drop, offering dramatic, but safe, views of the wooded areas below. A bench stands roughly halfway through the loop; take in a view of Table Rock while you rest. Due to the short distance and mild inclines, this trail is one of the easier trails to walk in the area, providing some beautiful scenery for relatively little effort.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Crabtree Falls Recreation Area is a 253-acre site located on the Blue Ridge Parkway about 15 miles north of Mount Mitchell State Park. Crabtree Falls Recreation Area was previously named Crabtree Meadows because of the crabapple trees and the open areas that were evident on the site. Few of the crabapple trees remain, and in 2010 the recreation area was renamed Crabtree Falls to emphasize the spectacular waterfall. Crabtree Falls is the tallest single waterfall along the Blue Ridge Parkway and is a scenic feature that interests hikers during every season.</p> <p>In 1863, small-scale logging began in the North Carolina mountains, followed by larger logging operations and the construction of a logging railroad. Some of the loggers brought their families and built cabins in the vicinity, and a small community coalesced around the area near Crabtree Falls. Soon a grist mill, woodworking shop, blacksmith shop, store, Baptist church/schoolhouse, and commissary were built. Logging continued at Crabtree Falls until the 1930s, when much of the land was acquired by the U.S. Forest Service.</p> <p>Crabtree Falls was one of the areas identified early on as a desirable place for a recreation area by Stanley Abbott, landscape architect of the Blue Ridge Parkway. In 1936, Abbott noted that Crabtree Falls was “an oasis of restful quiet and charm in the midst of some of the most dramatic scenery in North Carolina.” In 1941, the U.S. Forest Service agreed to transfer 160 acres to the National Park Service, with more land acquired later. When the first picnic area and trail system were completed, the Parkway opened the area for public use in 1948. The campground opened in 1954 and proved so popular that a two-week limit on camping had to be imposed. A new 82-site picnic area on the east side of the parkway opened in 1960.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Crabtree Falls Recreation Area is a series of open meadows, in contrast to the rugged terrain and forests all around. A thick hedge of rhododendrons is along the side of the entry road and main parking lot. A dense, wooded landscape surrounds the open meadows, with common trees including oaks, maples, hemlock, birch, fir, spruce, hickory, dogwood and pine. Forest wildflowers, like jack-in-the-pulpit, purple trillium and corn lily along the trails and in the wooded areas, bloom early in the summer. During July and August, the area is lined by beds of joe-pye weed and white snakeroot. A gas station, coffee shop and amphitheater are unopen and unoccupied, but are signs of previous development in the area.",

The name “Looking Glass” comes from its mirror-like appearance when water freezes on its surface and glistens in the sunlight.<br /> <br /> In 1888, George and Edith Vanderbilt of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville purchased the land you see here. During this time, the southern Appalachian Mountains were in the midst of a major logging boom.<br /> <br /> At the time there were no land management or reforestation efforts in place and degradation of the land was starting to become apparent. The Vanderbilt’s saw a need to take action and asked Dr. Carl A. Schenck, a forestry educator from Germany, to help. Schenck founded America's first forestry school, The Biltmore Forest School, now the home of the Forest Service's Cradle of Forestry historical site. Schenck taught a scientific, hands-on approach to forest management that would keep logging profitable while also being sustainable.<br /> <br /> When George Vanderbilt died in 1914, Edith sold 87,000 acres of the land to the U.S. Forest Service, fulfilling her husband's wishes to help create the Pisgah National Forest.<br /> <br /> You can visit the <a href=\"https://cradleofforestry.com/\">Cradle of Forestry</a> to learn more about the Vanderbilt's legacy.

The name Craggy comes from jagged rock outcroppings or “crags” found here and the shrubs and grasses of the summit balds give the area a “garden” feel. And while colorful wildflowers can be seen from April through October, the highlight comes in June when the spectacular purple and pink blooms of the Catawba rhododendron are at their peak.<br /> <br /> A visitor center, picnic area, and hiking trails provide plenty to do for a short stop or an all day visit.

At 5,500 feet in elevation, there are long range, expansive views of the surrounding valleys and distant mountain ranges in all directions from various vantage points.

    "bodyText": "<p>Nestled among the tall rhododendron bushes at the top of the Craggy Gardens Trail is a piece of history. A rustic, wooden shelter greets visitors as they complete their climb. It provides a shady spot to rest or cover from a passing rainstorm. The trail shelter serves as the gateway to Craggy Bald, a beautiful open meadow with expansive views, colorful blooming flowers, and delicious blueberries in late summer. But the trail shelter is also a connector to our past—a relic that pre-dates the Parkway and harkens back to a difficult time in our history.<br /> <br /> The Great Depression was one of the worst economic periods in world history. President Franklin D. Roosevelt created a variety of public work relief programs to provide jobs during this terrible economic time. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was one of the most popular of these “New Deal” programs and focused on conservation projects on public lands. All told, 3 million young men participated in the CCC across the United States and they planted 3 billion trees, constructed trails, campgrounds, picnic areas, and developed landscape projects.<br /> <br /> Below Craggy Gardens to the west there was a CCC camp in Dillingham. In 1935 they built a road and trail through national forest land to access Craggy Gardens. Two years later, they added a picnic area and two shelters. The area became so popular that it hosted a Rhododendron Festival—before the Parkway even existed! When the Craggy Gardens section of the Parkway opened in 1950, the property transferred from the U.S. Forest Service to the National Park Service and most of the vehicle traffic shifted to the Parkway from Asheville. <br /> <br /> But the legacy of the CCC remains at Craggy Gardens. The Stoney Fork Forest Service Road, the picnic area, the trail to the bald, and the trail shelter are all still there. A visitor to the trail shelter today can marvel at the craftsmanship and longevity of this 80+ year old structure. It resembles a large barn with chestnut and oak posts supporting rafters, beams, and purlins carrying a shake roof. It is a testament to the work of an innovative program and it reflects the resiliency of the people and the times.<br /> <br /> The trail shelter is accessed by the Craggy Gardens Trail. From the Craggy Gardens Visitor Center the shelter is a 0.3-mile moderate hike. From the Craggy Gardens Picnic Area, it is a 0.5-mile moderate hike.</p>",

During rhododendron, azalea, and mountain laurel bloom season, the road is a showcase of splendor. Summer wildflower season brings a wave of spectacular color which includes a showstopping display of flowers right up into the picnic area and parking lot. The picnic area is ringed by mature hardwood trees including buckeyes, birch, and mountain ash. Rhododendrons dot the hillside. The woods edge features an abundance of wildflowers in summer.<br /> <br /> This picnic area is open daily until sunset, mid-spring through fall. A variety of picnic sites in full shade, partial shade, or in a grassy open area allows for the selection of a perfect lunch location. Some of the tables have benches only on one side because of the steep hillsides. Over the years, visitors have learned to bring their own camp chairs when they need to accommodate a larger group. Grills are located throughout the picnic area to be shared by all.<br /> <br /> Ample parking is available in the level, asphalt parking lot. Access to the Craggy Gardens Trail is in the far corner of the parking lot up the steps. At .2 miles you will encounter a side trail on the left to a pretty little gazebo. A trail shelter built by the CCC and views from a meadow bald are found at .5 miles. At the end of the trail you will see the Craggy Gardens Visitor Center. Because you will be walking through fragile habitats with some rare plants, please stay on the marked trails.<br />  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Craven Gap is a mountain pass between Peach Knob and Rice Knob, part of the Elk Mountains and the Great Craggy Mountains. Town Mountain Road (NC 694) connects downtown Asheville with the Blue Ridge Parkway at the gap. The gap offers trail access for hikers and is used as a rest spot by bicyclists.<br /> <br /> A small gravel parking area and roadside parking are available for hikers just off the Blue Ridge Parkway on the side road perpendicular to the Parkway. A set of wooden steps provide access to the Mountains-to Sea Trail heading north. The trail heading south can be found by walking toward the large white and orange gates at the road entrance and crossing the Parkway. The southern trailhead is a small path to the left of the guardrail. It heads down the hill. White circular dots (blazes) mark the trail at intervals along the way.<br /> <br /> The Mountains-to-Sea Trail is a 1,200-mile trail that spans the State of North Carolina from the Great Smoky Mountains to the Atlantic coast. It runs parallel to the Blue Ridge Parkway for many miles. Due to its proximity to Asheville, the Craven Gap section is well-used. You will encounter other hikers and sometimes their dogs on this section of trail. As a reminder, the trail is located in a unit of the National Park Service and dogs are required to be on a leash.<br /> <br /> Many trail users run or walk these sections (north or south) for the mileage or exercise. They gain some elevation, so are somewhat challenging, and are “out and back” in nature. There are rocks and roots in the trail, so hiking poles may be helpful. Mountain views are only available during the winter. Vehicle noise can be heard from the Parkway below. Spring and summer wildflowers along this trail are stunning and plentiful when they are in bloom. Fall color in this forest is beautiful due to the variety of deciduous trees.<br /> <br /> Bears are frequently seen in vicinity of Craven Gap. Sing, talk, or make noise as you hike so they know that you are there. If you see a bear, clap your hands and try to look big. Do not run away. Back away slowly.  <br /> <br /> Popular hike destinations from Craven Gap:</p> <ul> <li>North – Craven Gap to Ox Creek Road (1.8 mile, one way)</li> <li>South – Craven Gap to Haw Creek Valley Overlook (2.9 miles, one way)</li> </ul>",
    "audioDescription": "Gravel parking area with wood and gravel steps leading to the trail north. A secondary road is adjacent to the gravel parking spaces. The Parkway is perpendicular to the secondary road and must be crossed to access the trail south. The trail is narrow and rocky. It undulates through a mid-elevation mixed forest. There are some small creek crossings as well as wooden and rock steps. Trail sides are steep drop offs or sheer rock walls at times. The forest canopy provides shade, except in winter",

    "bodyText": "<p>There’s no missing Devils Courthouse.<br /> <br /> Rising above the surrounding spruce forest at an imposing 5,720 feet, this dark mass of exposed rock seems to almost hang over its surroundings. According to Cherokee legend, a powerful mountain giant named Judaculla danced and held court in an underground chamber beneath the rock. A strenuous half-mile trail leads visitors to the very top of this fabled dance hall, where, on a clear day, sweeping views stretch into North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee.<br /> <br /> But it’s not just a pretty view. Devils Courthouse also provides habitat for a variety of rare, high-altitude species that migrated here during the last Ice Age. With ample heat rising from the valley, it’s also the perfect territory for birds of prey, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/watch-peregrine-falcons-at-devils-courthouse.htm\">peregrine falcons</a> who nest on the side of the rock’s face—but they’ll only return if their home is left undisturbed. Due to this area’s unique ecology, it is critical that casual visitors and serious hikers alike follow all posted signs and trail regulations, like no climbing on the rock outcroppings and remaining behind the established wall at the trail’s end. By staying on the trail, we can ensure that these natural wonders remain protected for years to come.</p>",

Others offer that the terrain here is so rough that only the devil could traverse it. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the overlook’s naming, it offers visitors views of Sugarloaf Mountain, Chestnut Mountain, Rich Mountain and more. The topography of this overlook creates a “V”, providing a window for the mountains in the distance to be seen. <br /> <br /> The overlook is an access point for the Mountains-to-Sea trail. This 1,175-mile-long, North Carolina hiking trail stretches from the Great Smoky Mountains on the western edge of the state, to the Outer Banks at the eastern edge.

Between the trees, the forested ridges of several mountains are prominent. Below these peaks lie valleys and lowlands. On the opposite side of the Parkway, a narrow dirt trail leading into the forest provides access to North Carolinas Mountains-to-Sea trail.",

Unfortunately, that’s not the case. While much of the southern end of the Parkway is adjacent to Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests, the National Park Service also relies on a patchwork of partnerships, private citizens, and nonprofit groups to make the views possible.<br /> <br /> With its long-range views towards the distant mountain ranges and valley below, Fork Ridge Overlook is a great example of what we can achieve when we work together. This area is close to a housing subdivision and was at risk of development. Thankfully, the Conservation Trust for North Carolina, with the help of private landowners and philanthropists, was able to purchase and protect 81 acres adjacent to the Parkway that can be seen from this overlook. <br /> <br /> Without the purchase, “the land might have become a blight of development amid the forested views from the Parkway,” according to Executive Director Reid Wilson. Now it is part of a growing stretch of protected land that extends across the Plott Balsam Range toward Waterrock Knob.<br /> <br /> So, the next time you’re traveling along the Parkway, take a moment to appreciate the views and the people who help protect them.<br /> <br /> The Mountains-to-Sea Trail can be accessed across the Parkway from this overlook.</p>",

Sitting at 2,805 feet, this overlook offers views of<em> (from left to the right) </em>Fisher Peak, Slate Mountain, Round Peak, Sauratown Mountains (Hanging Rock & Pilot Mountain), Skull Camp Mountain, and Raccoon Mountain. During late spring the mountain tops come alive in a sea of green, and in fall burst with bright yellows and reds. On foggy days During late spring the mountain tops come alive in a sea of green, and in fall burst with bright yellows and reds. On foggy days, the mountain peaks rise like islands in a sea of clouds. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a wonderful place to view a sunrise, or just to stop and rest, Fox Hunter’s Paradise will not disappoint!<br /> <br /> <em>Note:</em> This overlook has two different parking areas. If you pull into the overlook going south on the parkway. A road to the right (inside the overlook) will take you to more parking as well as to a short walkway leading to an observation deck. The walkway to the stone overlook is 0.2 miles long and is wheelchair accessible.",
    "audioDescription": "A grassy median separates the overlook from the parkway road. The terrain slopes down from a low, wooden guardrail at the edge of the pavement. Low vegetation covers the slope in the center of the overlook, while trees stand at the edges on either side. In the valley below, there's a patchwork of fields and woods, while in the distance, mountains rise. To the right in the overlook, another road leads to the top of a hill, where there is more paved parking, as well as spaces for RVs. A small path leads to another slightly hidden overlook. This stone viewing point offers some of the same views as the lower overlook. The small 0.2-mile path is wheelchair accessible.",

It is one of the few rivers that flows north. The Cherokee called it Agiqua or \"Long Man”, an apt name as the entire watershed contains over 4,000 miles of rivers and streams. Its modern name came from early European settlers. Of the two broad (wide) rivers in this area, this one flowed into French territory in Tennessee. Hence the French Broad River was named!<br /> <br /> This overlook is on the south side of Asheville, close to the North Carolina Arboretum and NC 191. It is located on the east side of the Blue Ridge Parkway (Milepost 393.8) and provides views of the French Broad River. An interpretive sign provides an overview of area’s history in the 1800’s. This large parking area is perfect if you are thinking about hiking the section of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail called the Shut-In Trail. You can pick up the trail on the nearby Parkway on-ramp. The French Broad Overlook is also a great spot for bicyclists heading south towards Mount Pisgah to start their ride.<br /> <br /> Whether you spend a few minutes or a few hours, the French Broad Overlook provides an interesting glimpse into the rich history of this area.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This historic, 70-foot fire tower is among the tallest of its kind in Western North Carolina. Constructed in the 1940s as a lookout for land management agencies like the U.S. Forest Service, this tower was a home-away-from-home for fire watchers for nearly a half-century.<br /> <br /> Due to the rugged and rural terrain, lookouts would often spend days at a time in the tower’s cabin, subsisting on basic supplies and scanning the sky for wisps of smoke. But time—and technology—marches on. Airplanes, sophisticated cameras, infrared images, and even drones have rendered most hired lookouts, and the towers they inhabit, obsolete. Frying Pan Fire Tower was decommissioned in the 1990s, though a recent restoration means that visitors can still safely visit this historic structure today.<br /> <br /> This popular 1.5-mile hike begins at the dirt pull-off located on Forest Service Road 450. Please do not block the gate. Rumored to have been named by mountain herders for a communal frying pan that hung in a nearby tree, Frying Pan Mountain rises 5,340 above sea level. The historic steel fire tower adds another 70 feet to the total. Although the path climbs steadily for nearly a mile, the wide gravel roadbed and abundant wildflowers make for pleasant hike to the top at any time of year. From the summit, visitors can take in sweeping views of the surrounding mountains and valleys below.<br /> <br /> For a longer hike, begin at Mount Pisgah Campground, which adds another two miles to the total.</p>",

Seeing the waterfall requires a bit of luck, however, as this ephemeral falls only flows after periods of rain. During drier weather it will slow to a trickle or even dry up completely. So plan your visit after a rainy day, if you have that option!<br /> <br /> At the base of the waterfall is an old mica mine. Miners called the flaky, shiny mineral they mined “glass,” hence the name Glassmine Falls. There were many “glass mines” that operated in western North Carolina in the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> Today the waterfall and surrounding land is privately owned as part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/asheville-watershed.htm#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Conservation%20Trust,the%20water%20quality%20and%20forest\">Asheville watershed</a>. There is no public access to the waterfall. But the view from the overlook after a good rain is impressive—even better if you bring a pair of binoculars. And listen closely, you may even hear the distant sounds of this roaring cascade as it plummets over the steep cliff. The sign at the overlook says the falls is over 800 feet high. That seems to be extremely generous—most would estimate around 200 feet—but Glassmine Falls is a magnificent sight, nonetheless. A short path from the overlook leads to another viewing area.

A paved path at the north end of the overlook leads to a slightly higher viewing area. There are trailheads for the Mountains-to-Sea Trail at both ends of the overlook.

Formed about 300 million years ago, the mountain soars to an elevation of 5,939. The original Cherokee name for the mountain was “Tanawha,” meaning a fabulous eagle. It was later named “Grandfather” by early European settlers who saw the face of an old man on one of the west facing cliffs.<br /> <br /> If you are traveling from the south, this will be your introduction to this mountain, as you will follow it for the next 7 miles. If arriving from the north, you will already be acquainted with the beauty of Grandfather Mountain.<br /> <br /> Visitors to Grandfather Mountain are easily confused by the division of the mountain between three different entities. The Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation cares for about 1/3 of the mountain. They operate a nature museum and the Mile High Swinging Bridge which spans 80 foot chasm at one mile in elevation. The entrance to their enterprise is on Hwy 221S, 1.5 miles north of this overlook and does have an entrance fee. <br /> <br /> The wild, undeveloped portions of the mountain are owned by the State of North Carolina and operate as Grandfather Mountain State Park. The park offers spectacular hiking and backpacking, but is known for its severe weather and challenging terrain--with 12 miles of trails that scramble along cliffs and up ladders. There is no charge to access the trails within the state park from Highway 105 and or from the parkway, at Boone Fork Parking Area at Milepost 299.9, 7 miles north of here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Blue Ridge Parkway traverses Grandfather Mountain at a lower elevation. This section of the parkway includes the Linn Cove Viaduct and the 13.5 mile Tanawha Trail.",

The overlook gets its name from the Mount Airy Granite Quarry, which you can glimpse in the distance. This quarry is the largest open face granite quarry in the world. Local lore says that on a clear day, the quarry can be seen from space! This black and white speckled rock put Mount Airy on the map long before Andy Griffith Show and Mayberry. This granite is widely used in construction of mausoleums, statues, buildings, and bridges. The operators of the quarry boast that they could mine the rock for another 500 years and still not reach the bottom. <br /> <br /> You will also notice the knob shaped mountain in the distance, this is Pilot Mountain. Known to Native Americans as Jomeokee Mountain, the mountain is located on the western end of the Sauratown Mountain range. This mountain range received its name from the “Sauras,” a Native America group that lived in the area pre-European contact.</p>",

The name comes from an old mica mine that was located below the overlook. It operated from the mid-1800’s until the 1920’s.<br /> <br /> Two different hiking options await you. Walk up behind the picnic table and the trail forks to the left. It traverses north 1.7-miles to Licklog Ridge Overlook. This leisurely walk takes you from the Grassy Ridge Mine Overlook parking area to the Licklog Ridge Overlook and returns for a total of 3.4 miles. A second option is to go straight at the trailhead fork where the trail bends to the right to follow the Mountains-to-Sea Trail south. On this path you can walk as far as you like and return the same way.<br /> <br /> This part of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail does not stray far from the Parkway but still gives the illusion of being on an “off the grid” walk. The terrain is up and down, but not really steep for long periods. Parts of the trail are rocky, so sturdy footwear is necessary.<br /> <br /> The trail provides a pleasant hike into the remnants of a high elevation oak forest that are found in spots along the parkway. Awaiting you is an overstory of oak and birch that was logged several years ago, but still has some older trees remaining. This walk is flush with spring and summer wildflowers and has fall color well into October. High elevation birds you may spot in summer include: veery, rose-breasted grosbeak, blue-headed vireo, dark-eyed junco, winter wren, scarlet tanager, black-and-white warbler, least flycatcher and golden-crowned kinglet.<br /> <br /> This section of the Mountains-to Sea Trail is a pleasant foray into the high elevation forests not far from the Parkway itself that still puts you in a relatively secluded, easy to moderate hiking situation.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Hike into a mile-high valley featuring spectacular waterfalls surrounded by rolling ridges. This is a very popular area, so be prepared to share the trail with others.<br /> <br /> Graveyard Fields is an extremely popular hiking area. Easy trail access is from the Graveyard Fields Overlook at Milepost 418.8 of the Blue Ridge Parkway, but the property is managed by Pisgah National Forest. Finding a parking spot on a weekend or during a busy time of year requires an early start to the day, a great deal of patience, or the willingness to park a significant distance away and walk on the road to the overlook. Signs on the roadsides clearly mark where motorists can and cannot park. Cars attempting to park in restricted areas have rolled over the edge down a steep embankment! Please do not put yourself or your family in danger. If the parking lot is full, visit one of the other hiking areas available along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Be sure to investigate your options before you embark on your journey.<br /> <br /> A sign at Graveyard Fields explains one theory behind its strange name. Many years ago, a windstorm uprooted the forest, leaving behind stumps that gave the area the appearance of a graveyard. Other theories include that logging in the early 20th century, prior to the area being under management of the US Forest Service, left tree stumps covered in moss resembling gravestones. Later, the Graveyard Fields area burned, destroying the stumps.<br /> <br /> The headwaters of the Yellowstone Prong, a tributary of the Pigeon River, originate in the mile-high valley. The two waterfalls in the Graveyard Fields area are accessible from the trailhead near the vault toilets in the overlook on the Parkway. The trail descends steps that give way to an asphalt path, necessary due to the amount of use the area receives. Many parts of the trail beyond the asphalt portion have been worn into deep ruts which are often muddy due to the frequency of precipitation. A trail map is available in the overlook parking lot. Familiarize yourself with the general loop trail prior to hiking. “Social trails” (or illegal trails) have been created over the years, which can make navigating confusing. Please do not compound this problem by going off the established trails. The 1.2-mile loop trail is rated as easy overall, however the “spur” trails to the waterfalls are steep and add additional mileage to the hike. Climbing on and near waterfalls is dangerous. Rocks near waterfalls are notoriously slippery.<br /> <br /> If you don't mind crowds, Graveyard Fields is an appealing hiking area for a variety of reasons. The Graveyard Fields Loop Trail is a reasonable hiking distance for families, including children, and includes waterfalls. It offers a variety of different plants, shrubs, and trees, as well as bird and wildlife diversity for natural history buffs. The trail connects to other trails in the valley and beyond, allowing further exploration for those who want a longer hike.<br /> <br /> Camping is not allowed in the Graveyard Fields area. During the season, the nearest National Park Service campground is located at Mount Pisgah. Dispersed camping is allowed nearby at Black Balsam and in the Shining Rock Wilderness. Contact <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=48260&actid=34\">Pisgah National Forest</a> for camping information and regulations. During the winter season, the Blue Ridge Parkway may be closed in this area due to ice and snow.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Graveyard Fields is a picturesque high elevation valley with two scenic waterfalls. A parking overlook provides access to a loop trail. The paved parking lot curves off of the main road. On the right of the parking lot, a small stone building has vault toilets, which are open spring through fall. The parking area has a paved, level sidewalk on the side of the lot that is farthest from the roadway. The trailhead for the loop trail can be accessed from the parking area. The trail is steep and has numerous steps. The natural surface is uneven and is muddy for a large portion of the year. The trail winds through rhododendrons, mature trees, grassy areas, and stream corridors. The valley is surrounded by rolling mountains.",

    "bodyText": "If you liked the movie <em>Last of the Mohicans</em>, you’ll want to visit Green Knob Overlook. The views from the overlook were used by Hollywood for the opening shot in the film. <br /> <br /> Located at approximately milepost 350.3 on the Blue Ridge Parkway, the overlook takes its name from the mountain whose rocky face is located across the parkway. Enjoy spectacular views into the valleys created by the headwaters of the Catawba River. Views to the southwest offer waves of ridges and valleys that continue into the distance. To the southeast, Lake James looks like small puddles nestled among surrounding distant ridges, and the southern end of Linville Gorge offers its last rocky exposure before disappearing into Lake James and the Catawba River Valley. <br /> <br /> The overlook also serves as a trailhead for two United States Forest Service Trails: Green Knob Trail and Snook’s Nose. The Green Knob Trail (FS182) will take you to the fire tower and then connects to the Lost Cove Trail (FS182) which descends to the Black Mountain Campground located on the South Toe River. Snook’s Nose (FS211) descends into the Curtis Creek valley. ",
    "audioDescription": "This is a half-circle overlook with the center island of grass containing a white oak tree located on the southern corner. Waves of mountain ridges and valleys stretch to the east southeast and south southwest. Lake James and the southern end of the Linville Gorge are in the distance to the southeast. Snook’s Nose Trail (FS211) indicated by a yellow diamond blaze begins on the downhill side in center of the exterior natural area to the south of the overlook. Directly across the parkway the rocky face of the knob for which this overlook gets its name rises upward. The Green Knob Trail (FS182) has access 0.1 mile north from the northern overlook entrance. It is marked with a white diamond and carsonite sign designating the trail. The forested area is mixed hardwood with occasional pockets of rhododendrons and firs.",

    "bodyText": "A picnic at Groundhog Mountain comes with a side dish of great views—if you're willing to climb the old, wooden tower. With 28 picnic sites, there's room to spread out at Groundhog Mountain. But the site's main claim to fame is a large, log observation tower. Originally erected by the Virginia State Forest Service in 1942, it was used to view mountain ranges and look for hazards or fires. If you walk up the single flight of stairs to the top of the tower you will be rewarded with views of Buffalo Mountain, Rich Hill, and others. <br /> <br /> Buffalo Mountain is a prominent peak in the distance. Mothers in the area use to tell their children that they could roam as they wished throughout the woods and hills of this area—as long as they could still spot the Buffalo. <br /> <br /> In the field surrounding the tower, there are several styles of historic log fences. An informational wayside explains the different styles of fencing on the parkway and the benefits of each one. These fence displays were first constructed in 1939, by the Civilian Public Service Enrollees and have been maintained ever since.<br /> <br /> All picnic sites at Groundhog Mountain have grills and there are restroom facilities.",
    "audioDescription": "The entrance to Groundhog Mountain is located on the left side of the road at MP 188.8 when heading South on the Parkway. The entrance curves to the contour of the mountain as you pull around the picnic area and into a loop style parking lot. Just past the picnic areas sits a small building housing the restroom facilities and a water fountain sits out front of this building. Parking is available on either side of the circle drive. Within the middle of this loop sits the historic Bowman-L cemetery maintained by the family. The historic observation tower sits at the top of the hill along with the displays on fencing styles in the Blue Ridge. A small walkway leads the way to the observation tower that stands 20 feet high. There are 17 steps to reach the top of the tower where you get a 360-degree view of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The hill is surrounded by different styles of fencing picket or paling rail, snake rail, buck rail, and post and rail fencing. A wayside exhibit onsite explains the differences.",

During the summer months, the vista is composed of rich green, forest-covered mountains and farm fields and forests in the valley far below, which contrast with a deep blue sky on clear days. In autumn, the forests become a varied palette of red and yellows dotted with deep green pine trees, and the valley becomes more golden. In late fall and into winter, the thinning foliage reveals lichen-covered granite boulders under the canopy.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Looking for the road less traveled? Try the Heintooga Spur Road, also known as Balsam Mountain Road. This 9-mile paved spur road just 11 miles from the south end of the Blue Ridge Parkway has overlooks with gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains and valleys below, hiking trails, picnic grounds, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/watch-elk-heintooga-spur.htm\">opportunities to see elk</a>.<br /> <br /> For the first four miles you are within the Blue Ridge Parkway boundary. The road leads drivers along the mountain's crest with scenic overlooks on both sides of the road. To the left are the Smokies and peaks like Clingmans Dome and Mount Le Conte. To the right, the Plott Balsam Range and the Parkway's route is your view.<br /> <br /> As you reach Black Camp Gap you will leave the Parkway and enter the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A large wooden sign will welcome you and there is an adjacent parking area. A short walk from the parking area leads to a Masonic stone monument completed in 1938. It was built when the park was created and contains rocks from most states and different places around the world. There are both stone steps and an accessible paved ramp that take you to the monument. The stone structure is protected under a wooden pavilion and surrounded by a fence. You can still get close enough to see and read the stones.<br /> <br /> Next along the road is a small parking area on your left for Flat Creek Trail. This is a 5.2-mile round trip, out and back hike that is rated moderate. This trail brings you to the end of Heintooga Spur Road where the picnic area and bathrooms are.<br /> <br /> Carry on a few more miles and you come to Poll’s Gap. Here there is access to three remote hiking trails into the Smoky Mountains. These are Hemphill Bald Trail, Rough Fork Trail and Poll's Gap Trail. A few more miles of driving will bring you to Balsam Mountain Campground, the highest campground in the Smokies. Balsam has 46 campsites, fire pit grills, cold running water, bathrooms, and is a great spot for tents. For more information about hiking and camping in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, visit www.nps.gov/grsm.<br /> <br /> Soon you will reach the end of Heintooga Spur Road at 9 miles in. There is a lovely, shaded picnic area with plenty of spaced out picnic tables. There are restrooms here as well. Near the picnic area you will see the end of the Flat Creek hiking trail mentioned earlier. If you walk down this trail just a short way you will come to the Heintooga Overlook with two benches to relax and enjoy the view of the Great Smoky Mountains.<br /> <br /> For a more adventurous drive, you can continue to Heintooga-Round Bottom Road, marked by a large brown sign where the pavement ends. This is a narrow, gravel, one-lane, mountain road and will bring you out near the Qualla Cherokee Indian Boundary. This route is not suitable for RV’s or trailers, is 14 miles and one way only.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Heintooga Spur Road is a paved, two lane road that is 9 miles long. The road winds up a mountain, gaining elevation as you go. About 5 feet on either side of the road are flat grassy areas that are regularly mowed. Adjacent to the grass begins thick Appalachian forests with tall trees and thick shrubbery. Along the way plenty of asphalt, pull-through overlooks open windows through the forest for a view. The overlooks have rock curbs that step up to level sidewalks allowing views of the valley and mountains in the distance.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Old farms, like this one, serve to bridge the gap between our lives today and the lives of subsistence mountain families long ago. This farm has been preserved as it may have looked during the 1890s. Farm highlights include a demonstration garden, log home, chicken house, root cellar, barn, hog pen, spring house, and rail fencing surrounded by forest. This farm existed to feed the family throughout the year and provide for all of their needs. Food was grown in the fields, stored in the outbuildings, prepared and eaten in the cabin. Surplus crops could be bartered, or sold, for cash money in order to obtain things that could not be grown or gathered around the farm. </p> <p>On farms like this one, you can visit the places where a generation learned some tough lessons in life: preservation, restraint, conservation, sustainability, the value of working smart, living with nature and many, many others. It may seem difficult to relate to a world that on the surface appears so vastly different than our own, considering the families lived without electricity, indoor plumbing, motorized vehicles, interstate highway systems, cell phones, or the internet. If you scratch the surface a bit however, you will find that we have many similarities with these families. They ate much of the same foods that we do today. They wanted similar things for their children: to grow up in a healthy, safe environment learning how to raise their own families in the world. They liked to shop for new innovations and things to improve their lives, while living frugally. In short, they too laughed, cried, celebrated, debated, and lived life to the fullest they could just like we do today.</p> <p>Seasonally, in the summer and fall, rangers and volunteers can be found at the farm site to answer questions and, ocassionally, demonstrating 19th century Appalachian life. </p> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The farm grounds are a mix of open forest and fields surrounded by thick forests just below the Parkway motor road. Humpback Rocks Mountain Farm is a collection of log buildings constructed during the late 1800s. The farm consists of a small demonstration garden which grows various field and kitchen crops in the summer including: corn, beans, squash, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, okra, carrots, hot peppers. Just opposite the garden is the orchard comprised of 8 apple trees of various ages and sizes aligned along the hillside. The young trees are protected from browsing deer by woven wire metal fencing. The cabin measures roughly 19 by 17 feet with a main floor and loft. A 7 foot wide covered porch supported by 4 posts runs the entire length of the front of the cabin covering the main entry door. A large stone fireplace with a hearth is on the right side of the cabin from the main entry. The cabin logs have gray/brown, weathered, square sides with white daubing in between. The roof is covered with hand split shakes each about 12 to 16 inches wide and 2 to 3 feet long put down in several overlapping layers. The floor of the cabin is elevated some 18 to 24 inches on stone piled piers and is comprised of sawn board planks. The interior of the cabin is modestly furnished including a full sized rope bed, infant cradle, chest, bureau, dining table with bench and ladder back chairs, a wooden shelf with a lower cabinet, iron skillets/ovens, and a wide range of farm tools for gardening and woodworking. Behind and to the right of the cabin is the chicken house, roughly 8 feet wide and 10 feet deep, made of up stacked round logs with two openings: a main door (2 feet wide x 3 feet tall) and small “window” including a wooden ramp for the chickens to get in/out of the structure. This building also has a shake roof. Inside there are nest boxes, a feed trough, water bucket, and brood perches Finally, the spring house measures 9 feet wide by 10 feet long, constructed of round logs stacked with a shake roof, it covering a stone lined floor and spring box with water flowing through up to 8 inches deep. A small door roughly 3 feet wide by 4 feet deep with a swinging entry door.",

This 0.5 mile out and back trail offers nice scenery and opportunities to investigate the remaining parts of the canal including a lift lock, waste weir, restored section of prism with a tow path, and a slackwater connection to the river. Learn how the canal helped make the river a major transportation corridor before the Civil War. The aquatic habitats of the James River provide excellent chances to observe bald eagles, herons, cormorants, river otters, musk rats, and wetland plants.</p> <p>The self-guided Trail of Trees is a 0.5 mile moderately strenuous loop along the rugged banks of the river connecting a selection of identified species of trees.

    "audioDescription": "The TRACK Trail kiosk sits along the paved descent to the James River Visitor Center entrance. It is on the left side of the path standing about 6 feet tall on two dark brown metal uprights with a vertical information panel about the TRACK Trail program along with 4 plastic brochure holders with flip top lids. The panel is dark blue with images of a dog & dragonfly on it along with some text and an inset trail map of the area. The kiosk is on the edge of a mowed trail shoulder at the beginning of a wooden railing topped by large walnut trees overlooking the small mowed picnic area with towering shade trees. The James River Visitor Center entry is opposite the kiosk. The panel reads: Welcome to the James River Visitor Center TRACK Trail The Kids in Parks TRACK Trails program provides a network of trails designed for kids and families. Each TRACK Trail has a series of self-guided adventures. A different story unfolds within the pages of each brochure. They’re fun, easy and free. Best of all, the fun doesn’t stop at the trail’s end because kids can earn Trail TRACKer Gear for each TRACK Trail adventure they register through the website KidsInParks.com Continue a lifetime of adventure on the Blue Ridge Parkway.\" Two animals are shown speaking on the left side of the panel. A tan & white dog says, “Hi I’m TRACK!” and the dragonfly says, “I’m KIP!”. We’ll be your guides for this adventurous trip. Grab a brochure. It’s time to play. Let’s see what we can find outside today! The James River Visitor Center TRACK Trails follow both the Canal Lock Trail and Trail of Trees, each 0.4 miles. You can also hike a portion of the Otter Creek Trail to the Otter Lake Loop Trail (3 miles from the Visitor Center). The Canal Lock Trail highlights a restored canal lock, typical of those constructed in the 1800s. This canal helped make the river a major transportation corridor before the Civil War. On the Trail of Trees, you have the opportunity to observe different species of trees found in low elevation habitats. Over twenty different species have been labeled along the trail. INSET MAP on the lower right of the panel showing the CSX Railroad paralleling Highway 501, the canal route, and James River (flowing from west to east) and the local trail system. The canal and railroad are on the southern/ lower edge of the map right to left, while the Blue Ridge Parkway runs perpendicular from north to south (top to bottom) including the James River Bridge. The Canal Trail is on the southern banks of the James River at the foot of the bridge. The Trail of Trees is a tear drop shaped loop on the northwestern end of the bridge. Otter Creek Trail follows Otter Creek from the Picnic area north to Otter Lake on this map.",

Price planned to build a hotel retreat to be used primarily by insurance agents during their vacation periods. He also had plans to dam a stream on the property to create a lake stocked with rainbow trout. The resort, Price felt, would give a vacation spot to the agents and still make it possible to keep contact with the home office. <br /> <br /> On October 25, 1946, at 78 years of age, Julian Price was killed in an automobile accident while traveling from Greensboro to Blowing Rock. Julian Price Memorial Park was donated to the National Park Service by the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company in 1949. </p> <p paraeid=\"{63be47ca-958b-4e18-8892-951d65b3468b}{3}\" paraid=\"742371624\">Almost the entirety of the construction and development of Julian Price Park, including the Blue Ridge Parkway and associated facilities within the park boundaries, took place between 1955-1964. By the end of 1964, all the campground loops, the amphitheater, the picnic area, and their associated amenities were finished and operating. The park development was closely associated with the Mission 66 program, a federally sponsored program intended to improve visitor services within the National Park system. </p>",

Visitors enjoy leisurely paddling a kayak or canoe on the lake or tossing a fishing line in from the shores.",

A picnic table makes for a pleasant lunch spot. The Mountains-to-Sea Trail can be accessed across the Parkway from the overlook.

Witnesses have claimed to see strange bright lights that appear as if from nowhere, and disappear without a trace, on and around Brown Mountain since at least 1910. Despite various studies showing that these reports are likely describing normal occurrences such as vehicle headlights, many people continue to be fascinated by the phenomenon today.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Matthews, with the help of neighbors, constructed a home near Galax, VA in 1869. The two-story oak home housed the couple as well as their eight children, six of whom lived to adulthood. Log cabins were a common site in the mountains during that time.<br /> <br /> The Matthews cabin provides visitors to Mabry Mill a chance to tour an historic home from the latter half of the 19th century. This cabin does contain a few nicer features, setting it apart from many other houses of the time: glass windows rather than shutters, a wood floor, an arched fireplace, and a complete second story upstairs. The cabin was donated by Mr. K.R. Matthews in 1956 and subsequently moved to its current site, which is the same general location where the home of Ed and Lizzie Mabry. That home was built out of chestnut and using the sawmill on site. It was dismantled soon after Mr. Mabry's passing in 1936. </p> <p>Inside, the cabin is staged with common household items of the time period and features an historic loom. The cabin is typically open to the public from late May through October, with rangers present.  On-site cultural demonstrations by rangers and volunteers include basketry, weaving, and spinning. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Looking at the cabin from the asphalt pathway between the house and the parkway there is a sign outside the house that reads the following: “Appalachian Houses. More than a century ago, log cabins were a common sight in Appalachia and in other rural areas of the Eastern United States. Samuel and Elizabeth Matthews built this cabin near Galax in 1869. Made largely of oak, it has one room on each of its two floors. Over time, the family installed a wood stove and added a bedroom, a metal roof, and weatherboarding. In 1956 Matthews Cabin was donated to the National Park Service. Workers carefully restored the structure to its earlier appearance and moved it to this site. Because they were so many sawmills, frame houses were also common in Appalachia. The Mabrys built their home on this site in about 1914. They used boards and chestnut paneling sawed at their mill and workshop.” The cabin itself is is nestled between two large evergreen trees- cedar and hemlock abound here. It features a cedar shake roof above rough hewn chestnut, flat and faded to a light gray. There is one small window of paned glass to the left of the doorway and the structure is 25 feet wide by 21 feet deep. Inside is a collection of household items such as a wooden backed chair, a simple wooden table and an historic loom. The door to the house is in the middle of the structure with a small series of 3 steps leading to the house. From the first doorway going left there is a great wheel in the corner, along the side wall there is a small window with a table in front. In the far-left corner, there is a staircase with a small storage area below. In the left center of the room there is a large loom. Directly across is a second doorway that visitors may enter from. Next to the other doorway is another small window, in the far-right corner there is a table against the other wall is the fireplace with a few cast iron pots around. In the corner closest to the first doorway is a large cabinet and against the wall to the right of the first doorway is an old sewing machine. There is a table with several chairs in the right center of the room. Along the rafters there are several baskets hanging up. A picture of Matthews Cabin before it had been restored in original location with the following caption. “Prior to its relocation in 1956, additions and alterations such as weatherboarding were removed from Matthews Cabin.” A picture of Ed and Lizzie in front of their frame house with the following caption. “Ed and Lizzie Mabry, the local sawmill owners, stand on the porch of their newly built frame house in 1914.” A picture of the cabin in the process of being rebuilt in its current location with the following caption. “Log by log, Parkway maintenance crews reconstructed Matthews Cabin on this site.”",

These long-distance travelers are often seen in September and October along the high elevation meadows of the Blue Ridge Parkway. <br /> <br /> The main text on the wayside exhibit at the overlook says:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Orange-brown, black-striped monarchs are the only butterflies that migrate. On their southward flight in September, large numbers cross the mountains at several points in this area. Tunnel Gap is a popular place for viewing this striking event.<br /> <br /> Many monarchs that pass here spend the winter on the Florida panhandle; some may journey as far a central Mexico. In spring they head north, breeding along the way and depositing their eggs on milkweed. During the slower spring migration, monarchs travel in smaller groups.<br /> <br /> No single monarch makes the entire round trip. Offspring that hatch along the northward route either remain where they are born or journey on to the northern starting point.<br /> <br /> Sudden storms and migrating hawks pose the greatest threats to migrating monarchs.</em></p> <div> </div> </blockquote>",
    "audioDescription": "The wayside is located in a paved pull-off on the south side of the roadway. A paved sidewalk runs along the edge of the pull-off. The wayside exhibit is located in a narrow grassy strip on the far side of the sidewalk near the eastern end of the pull-off. Low bushes line the edge of the overlook behind the wayside. The panel consists of a main text block, a simple map, and a photo of a monarch butterfly. The main text is positioned on the left side of the panel. To the right of the text is a map inset captioned \"Autumn migration routes taken by monarchs in the eastern United States.\" On the plain beige map red lines with arrows are drawn from Maine and coastal Canada down to Florida, at points all along the Gulf of Mexico and into Central Mexico. There is also a photograph of an open winged monarch butterfly resting on a flower, the orange wings outlined by thick black lines with smaller yellow dots inside the outlines. The caption for this photo is, \"Before migrating, monarchs fatten themselves with nectar. This gives them the energy to make their long trek.\"",

Grills are located throughout the picnic area to be shared by all.<br /> <br /> Ample parking is available in the level, asphalt parking lot. Be aware that access on the paved trail from the parking lot is steep at a grade of approximately 15%. The picnic area has a short loop trail associated with the initial paved trail, continuing on a dirt road past the restroom building, turning off the dirt road into a rhododendron tunnel, then returning to the parking area. A trail at the north end of the picnic area parking lot connects to the Mount Pisgah Trail. A trail at the south end connects to the Mount Pisgah Campground.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This hilltop picnic area has an open sunny field with tables spaced along the edges. The woods around the edge of the open field have mature trees with rhododendrons in the understory. Picnic tables are nestled beneath in little shrubby alcoves.

The latter half of the moderate to strenuous hike is steep and rocky. Plant life is diverse along the initial portion of the trail. Birdsong is rich and musical in spring and early summer. The trail passes through a northern red oak forest with a thick shrub understory and ends at a deciduous heath bald at the summit. It offers a spectacular view, including the French Broad River Valley and Shining Rock Wilderness. On a clear day you can see the City of Asheville.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Mount Pisgah Trailhead is located at the end of a level asphalt parking lot which is bounded on one side with a level asphalt sidewalk which requires one step up over a rock curb. There is a line of shrubbery running along the sidewalk and down a hillside toward to Parkway. Across the parking lot there is a small incline with trees and woods leading off onto a mountainside. A small gap is adjacent to the woods and allows for a beautiful view of a valley. Where the Mount Pisgah Trail heads into the forest, mature trees make a gap just wide enough for the trail to enter the woods. Beyond the tree line the trail disappears into shadow and foliage.",

It provides long range views to the south and southeast of North Cove, Peppers Creek Valley, Dobson Knob, and distant views of Wolf Pen, Hickory Nut Mountain, Sugarloaf, Piney Mountain, Graveyard Mountain and more. Close up views of the Historic Orchard at Altapass face west from the overlook.<br /> <br /> The overlook has two picnic tables and parking for 15 cars. A wayside exhibit tells the history of the original Crest of the Blue Ridge Highway. Joseph Hyde Pratt, a North Carolina State Geologist, first proposed the scenic highway in 1906. His proposal anticipated the growth of the automobile industry and the subsequent boom it would bring in tourists flocking to see the natural beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Eight miles of the scenic highway were built from this location running north towards Linville Falls, but the outbreak of World War I brought the construction to an end. The idea of a scenic highway would be revived more than a decade later in the 1930s—becoming today’s Blue Ridge Parkway. <br /> <br /> The wayside has a historic photograph of a group of workmen and two teams of mules grading the roadbed for the Crest of the Blue Ridge Highway in 1913. It also has a map of the proposed route of the road beginning in Marion, Virginia running through Western North Carolina and ending at Tullulah Falls, Georgia.<br /> <br /> Railroad enthusiasts prize the North Cove Overlook because it provides views of the trains ascending from the valley below, up the slopes of the Blue Ridge mountains on the railroad engineering marvel known as \"The Loops.\"  Constructing a railroad with a sufficiently low grade to cross the steep slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains was a daunting task. Construction began in 1905 and was completed in 1908. It is 13.5 miles long, contains 18 tunnels and many switchback curves that give “The Loops” its name. It required the labor of 4,000 workmen, most of whom were immigrants from Italy, Russia and Germany. Accidents and violence are believed to have cost more than 200 of these workers their lives.<br /> <br /> Once completed the railroad forever changed the lives of the mountain families as timber and mining companies offering steady wages flocked to the area. Trains pass just below the Orchard at Altapass and disappear into a tunnel below McKinney Gap to emerge on the other side of the Blue Ridge. The Loops are best viewed after the leaves fall from the trees. <br /> <br /> The overlook also provides views to the west of the Historic Orchard at Altapass. The Orchard was created in 1908 by the Clinchfield Railroad and has been in operation for well over a century. It was considered to be an ideal location for an orchard because it could take advantage of the largely frost-free thermal layer found on the slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  <br /> <br /> McKinney Gap is named for Charles McKinney (1780-1852) who lived here with his very large family in the 1800s.",
    "audioDescription": "The North Cove Overlook is located on Parkway at an elevation of 2815 ft. It is a large semicircular overlook with enough space to accommodate 15 cars. There are two picnic table in its grassy median that are shaded by a white pine and a mix of hardwoods. There is a trash can and a wayside exhibit about the “First Mountain Parkway.” Southeast lies the Peppers Creek Valley which connects to North Cove. To the south, forested mountain ridges dominate. To the West apple trees cover the hillside at the Historic Orchard at Altapass. Looping up the mountain slopes ringing the Peppers Creek Valley is the cut in the treeline marking the route of the railway.",

At the rock overhang, turn around and return to the picnic area. The entire Boone Fork Trail is a 5-mile loop and includes several strenuous sections that may not be suitable for young children.</p> <p>The hike begins in an open field area scattered with picnic tables, trees, and rhododendron. Behind a restroom building, a small wooden foot bridge crosses a gentle creek and a dirt path winds around through the open field and parallel with the creek. Vegetation continues to thicken and in many places the creek has eroded its sides very near the trail. At the conclusion of the Track Trail section, a huge boulder juts out providing a roof type structure over the trail.</p> <p>For additional information about the Kids In Parks TRACK Trail program and to download activity brochures for Price Park, visit <a href=\"https://www.kidsinparks.com/blue-ridge-parkway-julian-price-memorial-park-picnic-area\">kidsinparks.com</a>. Print the <em>TRACK Trail Adventure Scavenger Hunt</em> and <em>Birds of the Blue Ridge Mountains</em> activity brochures to use along the trail.</p>",

Beaver gnawed tree stumps are commonly spotted along the trail, along with wood ducks floating on the lake.<br /> <br /> By water, boaters can circle the 47-acre lake on gentle rocking waters sliding up into coves and exploring streams that feed the lake with cold water.

    "bodyText": "<p>Born around 1837, “Aunt Orlean” Puckett is a local legend. She lived here with her husband, John. Aunt Orlean was revered as a midwife who successfully delivered more than 1,000 babies. <br /> <br /> Orlean had 24 children of her own, but tragically, each one died in infancy. Many people speculate that this is why she worked so tirelessly to aid other mothers. “Aunt” Orlean Hawks Puckett died in 1939 at the age of 94 or 102, no one is quite sure which! (Not only is her age unknown, the spelling of her name varies based on the historical source.)<br /> <br /> An informational wayside on the site explains, \"Born in 1837, “Aunt” Orelena Hawks Puckett lived here during the latter of her 102 years. She was often heard to say, “The Forest was green when I was a-born and I’m green yet.” A bride at 16, Mrs. Puckett and her husband first farmed below nearby Groundhog Mountain.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Puckett was past age 50 when she began a long career of midwifery. She assisted at the births of more than 1,000 babies, delivering the last in 1939, the year she died. It has been said she never lost a child or mother through her own fault. Ironically, none of Mrs. Puckett’s own 24 children lived beyond infancy.<br /> <br /> Regardless of weather, “Aunt” Orelena went wherever and whenever called. Sometimes on horseback, often walking, the midwife brought assurance and kindness to all she visited. When she began her practice around 1890 her fee was one dollar, and “when time was good,” six dollars. Often receiving food or other goods in lieu of money, she generously shared all she had with neighbors or those in need. Today, Orelena Puckett is remembered in this area for her witty, cheerful personality, as well as for her unselfish and skillful practice as a midwife.”<br /> <br /> Orlean and John Puckett lived in a larger house that was located in what is now the garden plot on this site. The cabin here currently was moved to the property for one of John’s sisters to live in. It is preserved by the National Park Service to keep the memory of Orlean alive.</p>",

A paved walkway leads visitors from the parking area to these historic structures. The log home has a main floor and loft, and was constructed with different types of logs; chestnut, pine, poplar, and oak. The house has wood shake roof, chimney and several small windows. An interpretive wayside near the parking area tells the story of Aunt Orlean’s life.",

    "bodyText": "<p>A hike to Rattlesnake Lodge is a fascinating trip back in time. The pleasant wooded hike just north of Asheville brings you to the remains of the summer retreat of Dr. Chase Ambler. The Ambler family enjoyed the lodge and surrounding property in the early 1900’s and gave it a most unusual name.<br /> <br /> Rattlesnake Lodge was aptly named as 41 rattlesnakes were said to have been killed in the first three years the Amblers were there. The snake skins were hung on the living room ceiling. Certainly an interesting decorating choice! <em>(Please note that it is against federal law to disturb or kill snakes in the area now.)</em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hike-to-rattlesnake-lodge.htm\">Rattlesnake Lodge can be the perfect hike</a> when you're in the Asheville area. It’s great if you’re looking for a shorter hike or if your time is limited. It is also a less traveled trail than many others in the area, so give it a try if you crave a less crowded, quieter experience.<br /> <br /> The trailhead for the Rattlesnake Lodge Trail is located at Milepost 374.4 on the Blue Ridge Parkway. On the south end of the Tanbark Ridge Tunnel there are dirt pull-offs on both sides of the road that serve as parking for the trailhead. The trail begins on the west side of the road next to a small cascading creek. The trail quickly splits and both sides climb steadily for approximately 0.5 miles to the historic Rattlesnake Lodge site.<br /> <br /> Pets are allowed but must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet in length.</p>",

    "bodyText": "Roanoke Mountain day use area is slightly off the beaten path. Originally opened as a campground in 1966, it is located on the Mill Mountain Parkway, a 2.5-mile road connecting the Blue Ridge Parkway with Roanoke City’s Mill Mountain Park. The campground was repurposed and reopened as a day use area in 2014. <br /> <br /> One of the nicest things about this site is that most tables have their own parking space and are a short distance from the car. Tables that do not have individual parking have spaces nearby. Additionally, there are three handicap sites with a paved path leading up to the table. These are on the back half of the main picnic loop. <br /> <br /> Each site has a grilling surface in the fire ring. There are no designated group picnicking sites. Picnic sites are on a first come first serve basis. The area is typically open from late May to late October. Never leave food out in the open or unattended.<br /> <br /> One of the biggest draws to this site is the weekend concert series held in the summer and autumn. These free concerts feature old time string bands, ballad singers, and bluegrass musicians. Bring chairs or blankets, as well as snacks and non-alcololic beverages. As a National Park site, alcohol is prohibited. Concerts take place outside and may be canceled in the event of inclement weather. <br /> <br /> Chestnut Ridge Trail, a moderate 5-mile loop, goes around the picnic area. A parking area for the trail is located on the left about 700 feet before you turn into the picnic area. There are several smaller paths in the picnic area that also  connect to the trail.",
    "audioDescription": "The picnic area is located on Mill Mountain Spur approximately a mile from the parkway. This area is mostly wooded and hilly. Just after passing the entrance gate there is a dumpster. To right is an old ranger check-in station. The building is about 10 feet by 6 feet. Approximately150 feet past the entrance gates there is a side road to the left that turns into a one-way loop leading to picnic sites. This area is not as well maintained as the main loop. Two hundred feet after this turn, the road becomes the main loop. The main loop is about 0.5-mile-long and has parking spaces on both the left and right. Near the beginning of the main loop, there is a small stage about 50 feet from the road in a clearing. The stage is 3-sided and is about 15 feet across. Up a hill to the right of the stage is a comfort station. The loop road continues going slightly uphill, providing more picnic tables. Some are farther in the woods and many have stairs leading up and down to them. About halfway around the main loop there is an access point to the Chestnut Ridge Trail and another comfort station to the right. Coming back down around towards the front of the picnic area, there is an additional access point to the first comfort station. At the road fork, turning left will circle back through the main loop, while turning right will take you to the other loop and exit. This second loop goes uphill about 0.2 mile before reaching tables. Along this road the Chestnut Ridge Trail crosses the road. This section of the picnic area is slightly more overgrown and access to the tables here is limited.",

The river itself begins in Montgomery County, Virginia and passes through Roanoke on its way to empty into the Albemarle Sound in North Carolina.<br /> <br /> At only 985’ of elevation, this is one of the lowest overlooks along the parkway, but it still offers an expansive view of the river and the Niagara Dam, sitting a little over 100’ below. Constructed in 1906, it continues to supply power to the city of Roanoke. Behind the plant is a portion of the Norfolk Southern Railway.  <br /> <br /> This overlook is the starting point for the Roanoke River Trail, an easy 0.35 mile hike that goes down the cliff and gives other views of the river and plant. About halfway down, the trail splits into the Fisherman’s Trail, which goes to the river, or makes a loop, passing under the bridge to a smaller pedestrian overlook. Fishing is allowed with a valid license. Due to the strong current, swimming is not recommended at this site.</p> <p>There are approximately 35 painted parking spaces at this site and some benches lining the area.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This parking lot lies just to the south of the 1000' Roanoke River Bridge. The surrounding area on both sides is wooded. The vista at this overlook is approximately 140’ across. To the far left side there is a large tree circled by a wooden bench. In front of the parking lot there is a paved walkway. In the center of this, there is a gravel path leading to a sign that reads the following, “Roanoke River Overlook / Elev. 985.” To the right of the sign is a bench and behind the sign is a fence along the length of the overlook. The area is wooded, and the land drops off behind the fence. The dam is about one-quarter of a mile in the distance. It is 52’ tall and 452’ wide. The reservoir is to the left of the dam and is the farthest point of the water visible. The water flows over the dam, dropping a significant amount before flowing past the plant, a stone structure on the opposite side of the river, and then to the nearby bridge. The land around the water is mostly wooded and hilly. On the opposite side of the river, there is also a railroad that follows the curve of the water. To the left side of the overlook, about 12’ past the tree with the bench, the Roanoke River Trail begins. A sign at the start of the trail reads the following; “Roanoke River Trail/ 20 minute walk along rocky cliffs above river gorge. Please stay on established trail. It is dangerous to climb on rocks. / Pedestrian overlook 1000 ft.”",

These rocks are slippery from mist and algae. The top of any waterfall is dangerous—never play in the stream above a waterfall.</strong><br /> <br /> Hike into a mile-high valley featuring spectacular waterfalls surrounded by rolling ridges. The Graveyard Fields Loop Trail is a very popular and reasonable hiking distance for families, including children, and includes waterfalls. The 1.3-mile loop trail is rated as easy overall, however the spur trails to the waterfalls are moderately steep. Trail access is from the Graveyard Fields Overlook at Milepost 418.8 of the Blue Ridge Parkway, but the area is managed by Pisgah National Forest. Finding a parking spot might require the willingness to park a significant distance away and walk on the road to the overlook. Signs on the roadsides clearly mark where motorists can and cannot park. Cars attempting to park in restricted areas have rolled over the edge down a steep embankment! If the parking lot is full, visit one of the other hiking areas available along the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br /> <br /> The two waterfalls in the Graveyard Fields area are accessible from the trailhead near the vault toilets in the overlook. A trail map is available in the overlook parking lot. Familiarize yourself with the general loop trail prior to hiking. Taking a photo of the trail map is recommended. “Social trails” (or illegal trails) have been created over the years, which can make navigating confusing. Please do not compound this problem by going off the established trails. <br /> <br /> Second (or Lower) Falls is only 1/3 of a mile from the trailhead. Follow the trail down to the Yellowstone Prong, the stream that feed both waterfalls. After crossing the stream, take a right on the spur trail that follows the stream as it flows down to the waterfall. A series of stair steps will take you to the base of the waterfall for safe viewing, photography, and cooling off in the mist of the falls. Return to the loop trail the same way you came.<br /> <br /> To reach the Upper Falls, continue on the loop trail through the beautiful open meadow. Look for a spur trail to the right after about a half a mile of hiking. It is before you recross the Yellowstone Prong. This 0.8-mile spur trail to the Upper Falls crosses small creeks and is rocky towards the end. The Upper Falls is divided into two sections, each accessible by a short side trail. At the lower section, the river flows over an angled rock outcrop resembling a chute before pooling above several large boulders. The upper section is a classic tall waterfall where the water falls over a high cliff and flows over a rock face.<br /> <br /> To return to your car, follow the Upper Falls Spur Trail back to the Graveyard Fields Loop Trail. Turn right on the loop trail where it will cross the Yellowstone Prong and ascend through a rhododendron thicket back to the other end of the parking lot.<br /> <br /> Be aware that camping is not allowed in the Graveyard Fields area. During the season, the nearest National Park Service campground is located at Mount Pisgah. In the winter, the Blue Ridge Parkway may be closed in this area due to ice and snow.</p>",

Beyond the path the land is less maintained; it is fairly level for 600 feet and then sharply drops. One sees low growing vegetation like bushes for several hundred feet before meeting the tree line. The slope of the hills converges at a low point creating a narrow sightline of the mountains beyond in the Pigg River Valley. The trees around the overlook are a mixture of dogwood, locust, maple, oak, cedar and pine. Most of the trees are between 20 to 30 feet tall.

Like many sites in the early years of the parkway, Smart View once housed a gas station and sandwich shop. Over time as the surrounding towns began to offer these amenities, the gas station and shop were closed.<br /> <br /> The picnic site contains 72 individual sites with grills, including several accessible sites. There are 2 comfort stations and a pavilion. Picnic sites are on a first come first served basis. The area is typically open from late May to late October. This site offers access to the Smart View Trail—2.6 mile moderate trail which loops around the area. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The road to the picnic area is through the parking area for the Smart View Trail. Continue down the hill, past a pond on your left where the road turns and passes the Trails Cabin, a rough hewn log cabin with a cedar shake roof and stone chimney opening up to a view of the rolling mountains beyond. The picnic area itself is mostly wooded with concrete picnic tables and metal grills spaced throughout the loop. Some of the primary tree types include oak and hickory with a dogwood, azalea understory. The pavilion is approximately 42’ long and 24’ wide and is located along the first turn of the loop to the right. The first comfort station is across from this on the left side of the road and has a paved path leading to it. This area has a few paved paths leading to tables. As you exit the picnic loop a left left will cut back to the beginning of the loop, while a right will exit the loop and lead you out of the Smart View Picnic Area and back to the Parkway. To the right as you exit is a fenced field that sometimes contains cattle.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Located approximately fifteen miles north of Asheville, the Tanbark Ridge Tunnel allows visitors an opportunity to safely park their vehicle and view or photograph one of the Blue Ridge Parkway's iconic tunnels.<br /> <br /> Limited gravel roadside parking is available on the south side of the tunnel. There is a slight drop-off from the asphalt roadway to the gravel--pull off the road slowly. Trails lead up to the historic Rattlesnake Lodge site (the relics of a summer home of a local Asheville physician that dates to the early 1900’s) and ultimately to the Mountains-to-Sea Trail.<br /> <br /> The word \"tanbark” in the name of this tunnel refers to tannins, organic compounds in the bark of oaks and hemlocks. Traditionally, the bark of these common mountain trees was bruised and broken to extract the tannins, which was used to tan hides for leather-making. The forest in this area is still predominantly mature oak and hemlock.<br /> <br /> Although “social” trails appear to lead to the top of the tunnel, they are not Park Service authorized hiking trails and are steep, slippery, and dangerous. Traffic is busy on this section of the Parkway. Drivers from the south are approaching from a blind curve, drivers from the north are coming out of the tunnel. This makes anyone standing in the road very difficult to see. For your safety and the safety of others, please stay out of the road and do not walk inside the tunnel. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy the beauty and craftsmanship of the tunnel from the safety of the roadside.<br /> <br /> Tunnels along the Parkway were created to reduce the impacts open blasting would have had on the mountainsides. After initial construction of the Parkway in 1935, tunnel building took place in the late 1940’s – 1950’s. A concrete lining was added to the interiors to prevent problems with groundwater dripping, freezing, and roadways icing inside the tunnels. The semi-circular arches on the entrances of the tunnels were added by Spanish and Italian stonemasons in the 1950’s and 60’s. The stone is all local, from less than 50 miles away from each build location.<br /> <br /> There are 26 tunnels constructed along the entire 469 miles of the Blue Ridge Parkway. One is in the state of Virginia and 25 are in North Carolina. They range in length from 150 feet (Rough Ridge Tunnel) to 1,434 feet (Pine Mountain Tunnel).</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Large dirt and gravel pull offs are on both sides of the Blue Ridge Parkway just south of the Tanbark Ridge Tunnel. These serve as a parking area to view the Tanbark Ridge Tunnel and nearby trail. The tunnel is nestled into the mountain ridge with trees surrounding it. A large rock outcropping is adjacent on one side. The handcrafted stonework on the face of the tunnel is similar in rock type as the native stone evident on the mountainside. Mid-elevation deciduous forest surrounds the area. To the west, the slope rises steadily up towards the top of the ridge. To the east, the slope drops steadily into the valley below.",

The trains are best viewed after the leaves fall from the trees.<br /> <br /> The Overlook provides views to the north, northeast, east and southeast. To the north, lies McKinney Gap named for Charles McKinney (1780-1852) through which the North Toe River Valley can be viewed. To the east, lie Jackson Knob and the Peppers Creek Valley. To the southeast, lie the Linville Ridge, Dobson Knob and Bald Knob. <br /> <br /> Due to its eastward facing orientation, the Loops Overlook is an excellent place to watch the sunrise and is generally dark enough after nightfall to observe any astronomical phenomenon that occur in that portion of the sky.<br /> <br /> The Loops is also a prime location to witness the natural phenomenon known as a fogfall.  When atmospheric conditions are right, fog forms in the North Toe River Valley, travels through McKinney Gap and because the fog is heavier than the surrounding air cascades down the slopes into the valley below.  This river of fog plunging through the gap and down the steep mountainside can rival the views of the parkway's most beautiful waterfalls.  The fogfall phenomenon occurs most frequently in the mornings from Mid-August to Early October. <br /> <br /> The Loops Overlook provides views of the Historic Orchard at Altapass lying directly below the overlook.

    "bodyText": "<p>Pioneer families began to settle in present day Floyd County in the 1740s and in Franklin County around the time of the American Revolution. Many made their homes in the mountains along the present-day Blue Ridge Parkway, including the family of W.J. Trail whose cabin today looks out onto the rolling hills of the Piedmont.</p> <p>This one-room cabin style was common in the area. Oftentimes the initial home was a simple structure—people needed a decent shelter fast so that they could move on to other activities that sustained their livelihood. Over time, as families grew and became more established on the land, extensions would be added to the house or a new home might be constructed nearby. Once this cabin no longer served as a home, it was used as a barn.</p> <p>During the development of the parkway, the cabin, like many other structures found along the way, was left to gradually fade back into the landscape and by 1947, little remained of the original structure. </p> <p>Today, the cabin is closed to visitors, but it is possible to look between the logs and see what remains; pieces of a floor and the fireplace but not much else. The cabin today lacks chinking—a mixture of clay, sand, lime, silt, ash, and dirt, that would have been placed between the logs. This protective mixture would have sealed the structure, providing some temperature control and keeping water from pooling between the logs. In another effort to seal the cabin, windows were kept small; before glass, they would be covered with animal skin or greased paper.</p> <p>The 2.6-mile easy to moderate Smart View Loop Trail passes here. There is also a bench near the cabin making it an ideal place to stop and take in the view or visit the adjacent picnic area.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "From the parking area the land slopes downward, about 25’ out from the parking area there is a split rail fence that goes in front and down the left side of the land around the cabin. The cabin stands 50’ away from the front portion of the fence. By the parking area there is a wayside about the cabin that reads: “Trail Cabin. Once common among the Blue Ridge, there remains but a few of the rough log buildings such as this cabin. While built in the 1890s by the Trail family, it is typical of the first cabins built by pioneers throughout the forested sections of our country. United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service.” The cabin itself is about 15 by 15feet. It is built on a hill so one side is built up slightly more to make the home level. At its tallest point, the cabin is about 12’ high. There is a rock chimney on one side. Since there is a lack of chinking between the stacked logs there is 3” - 6” of space between rows of logs depending on size and one can see clear into the structure. The door is on the left side of the building but is closed. Inside there are serval large logs running lengthwise across the floor, but the remainder is dirt. The only other visible trace is the stone fireplace, situated perpendicular to the logs. Past the cabin, about 18’ ahead is a bench that looks out into the land below, short shrubs rolling down a steep slope with mountains rolling on into the distance. To the left and right of this clearing are woods.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Waterrock Knob is truly a hidden gem on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Located just 18 miles from the southern end of the Parkway and farther away from larger cities, it has a more remote and quiet feel to it. Perfect for escaping the crowds you sometimes find at other park locations!<br /> <br /> Waterrock Knob has the highest elevation on the Parkway. The visitor center is located at 5,820 feet and the summit itself is 6,273 feet. A large open parking area can provide fantastic long-distance views anytime, but can be particularly stunning for sunrise and sunset. Fog and clouds are common here and temperatures are much cooler than in the surrounding valleys. High elevation deciduous trees mix with the spruce/fir forest to create this mountain retreat. Night owls also enjoy Waterrock Knob’s dark skies for star gazing. A visitor center, picnic tables, seasonal restrooms and a hike to the summit make this a hard to beat destination!<br /> <br /> The trail to the summit and back is round trip a mile but the elevation gain is 460 feet so take your time and enjoy the walk. The first .2 miles are paved, leading to an uneven and, at times steep, dirt and rock path. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The large, paved parking lot at Waterrock Knob stands at 58 20 feet with the summit itself rising in front of you at 62 37 feet, covered in the evergreen of a spruce and fir forest. To the right is a wooden sign reading \"Waterrock Knob Trail Waterrock Knob point 5 miles Pedestrian Overlook point 2 miles.\" Beyond the sign the mountains fade off into the distance in waves and the road can be seen like a ribbon halfway up one of the mountains. The sign stands in grass and is just beyond a sidewalk. The paved sidewalk leads off to the left, starting its climb to the summit and stays paved until one reaches the overlook. There are stone steps with a wooden handrail along this trail. It is approximately 2 feet wide. In the spring flowers line some of the trail, along with leafless trees interspersed with tall evergreens. The views from the overlook are similar to those from the parking lot and often one sees a blanket of white fog with islands of rounded topped mountains popping up above the fog for tens of miles. Turning further to the right is the road leaving the lot and even further another stretch of tree covered mountains on the other side of the parking lot. There are two small concrete block restroom buildings on this end of the parking lot. Across the paved roadway of the parking lot stands a one story visitor center adjacent to the mountain. Fog and clouds are common here, making the air colder than that off the mountain. On a clear day the views seem never-ending with mountain ranges beyond mountain ranges, changing color with distance from the greens of summer or the red orange of fall to the blue of distance.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Yankee Horse Ridge Overlook is known for two popular attractions: Wigwam Falls and the Irish Creek Railroad. This overlook is a family favorite for easy leg stretcher trails, picnic meals, and the relaxing sounds of the small stream flowing through the site. It is also a great place to search for wildflowers and migrating birds each spring.</p> <p>Wigwam Falls is one of the easiest to access waterfalls between Waynesboro and Roanoke, VA. It is a 0.1 mile walk to its base along a gently flowing stream. This waterfall is greatly impacted by rainfall – becoming more active and impressive following a recent storm.</p> <p>The Irish Creek Railroad was a 42 inch narrow gauge railway used by the South River Lumber Company based in nearby Cornwall, VA. Operated from 1916 to 1939, Climax locomotives climbed the mountain slopes to access and remove timber. Temporary track lines were constructed off branching off of the main trunk to provide access for loggers into various hollows. The felled trees would be loaded onto log cars to be pulled back to the sawmill. A small section of track and an old trestle have been reconstructed near the overlook, and visitors are welcome to stroll south along the old line for about half a mile to explore the re-growing forest. This exhibit commemorates timber-mining operations of the 19th century including the valuable lessons society learned from its affects.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Yankee Horse Ridge Overlook has a flat parking area with room for about 8 vehicles. A stone staircase leads up to the middle of a restored section of track about stretching about 200 feet north and south. To the right of the steps, the tracks run across a restored wooden tresstle that spans a small, rocky creek. Wigwam Falls is upstream a few hundred feet above this trestle. On the northern end of the restored tracks, is another stone staircase that leads to a single stone picnic table surrounded by forest.",

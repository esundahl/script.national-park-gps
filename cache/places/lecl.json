It had been a stopping place for centuries.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d2f9aa6-e4c5-4391-9e9e-fe40b3458ea3}{183}\" paraid=\"550683154\">In 1797, Dr. Felix Brunot, a Frenchman who had come to the continent to serve with the French Army during the American Revolutionary War, arrived in Pittsburgh and started a medical practice. In 1800, he purchased the 129-acre island three miles downriver and started a farm.20 Blaise Cenas (related to Brunot by marriage) lived there, along with several other settler families. Meriwether Lewis knew Cenas and some of these other men through the Pittsburgh Freemasons. </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d2f9aa6-e4c5-4391-9e9e-fe40b3458ea3}{233}\" paraid=\"1129527759\">When Lewis and crew stopped at the island in 1803, they docked their keelboat and pirogue and came onshore—perhaps to say goodbye to their acquaintances, or maybe to pick up a few extra supplies. Whatever the reason, they stopped and chatted for a while.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d2f9aa6-e4c5-4391-9e9e-fe40b3458ea3}{247}\" paraid=\"1711458400\">One thing led to another, and they asked Lewis to show off his <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/lewis-s-air-gun.htm\">air gun</a>—maybe he couldn’t help but mention it so soon after purchasing it. Lewis had bought this specialty gun mostly to impress and intimidate Indigenous people along the way—a muscle-flexing icebreaker, rather than as a tool for hunting. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a859ad2c-edc9-4a7c-b60d-6039aaa2d59f}{50}\" paraid=\"106909523\">However it came up, Lewis brought out the air gun and showed it around. Lewis shot it several times himself (“with pretty good success,” he later bragged in his journal). He then passed it to Cenas, who did not have as much success. Cenas shot a woman who was watching (perhaps a relative of his) in the head. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a859ad2c-edc9-4a7c-b60d-6039aaa2d59f}{82}\" paraid=\"631316028\">She ended up being fine, but it was maybe a little too eventful for a friendly visit. Lewis and crew packed up and headed downstream.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

On July 7, 1806, they passed through the Alice Creek drainage. Lewis described “much appearance of beaver many dams” and noted that the “bottoms not wide and covered with low willow and grass.” They continued “up the same creek on the east side through a handsome narrow plain” and across “the dividing ridge be­twen the waters of the Columbia and Missouri rivers.” Looking east, Lewis recognized the familiar landmark of “Fort Mountain” (Square Butte), and estimated it to be “distant about 20 Miles.”</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Located within the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/helena/\">Helena National Forest</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">, the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gis/storymaps/mapjournal/v2/index.html?appid=5c65518366224abd8d8643380b64d498\">Alice Creek Historic District</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> still evokes the 1806 landscape experienced by Lewis despite minimal impacts from cattle grazing.

The town’s inhabitants left by 1450 A.D. for reasons unknown, although it was possibly due to nutrient-depleted soils or lack of wild game.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ad6fb0b0-799c-4e98-a194-2532d7458915}{175}\" paraid=\"317830522\">The Angel Mounds State Historic Site strives to tell the story of these native peoples. It was first established in 1938, when the Indiana Historical Society purchased the current 600 acres, prior to which it was a working farm. Between 1939 to 1964, a crew of excavators directed by noted Indiana archaeologist Glenn A. Black uncovered more than 2.5 million artifacts from the site. Angel Mounds was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5758cb86-c812-4a5f-ac0f-7a87682995a2}{220}\" paraid=\"314586140\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Twelve earthen mounds created for ceremonial purposes are scattered throughout the property and can be viewed from the walking trail. The interpretive center details the history and culture of the site’s historic inhabitants, known as the Mississippian Culture. There is also an interactive area where visitors can explore different aspects of Black’s research. Visitors can also walk the four-mile Angel Mounds Loop Trail. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ad6fb0b0-799c-4e98-a194-2532d7458915}{205}\" paraid=\"1074725215\">For those who want a deeper look into the history of the area, Angel Mounds hosts a regular lecture series on the history of Mississipian Culture’s way of life, economics, politics, and religion. Camps and other activities for children are available in the summer. Farm Fest is another popular two-day event celebrating Indiana’s history of farming.

They hunted and fished the lush land and bountiful waters. Over time, the area was home to encampments, burial mounds, and at least one village, the remnants of which can still be seen. Today, the site is part of the Annie & Abel Van Meter State Park.</p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{379e08c7-270b-4301-8b0d-e04867fa7a79}{218}\" paraid=\"1862192237\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">It was here in 1804 that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark greeted the natives and exchanged foodstuffs. Once the largest population of native peoples in the area, Clark noted in his journal that the majority of them had been wiped out by diseases like smallpox and cholera. At the time of Lewis and Clark’s visit, there were fewer than 400 members of the Missouri tribes left. No longer an independent nation and dealing with raids from the Sac and Fox tribe, the survivors eventually left the area to join with the Otoes, Little Osage, Kansa, and Ioway tribes.   </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{659851cf-adbf-4a6c-928d-455d880187c3}{253}\" paraid=\"1679316117\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The Annie & Abel Van Meter State Park park boasts over 1,000 acres of trails, freshwater marshes, lush forests, and camping. The Missouri's American Indian Cultural Center is also located within the park and features exhibits detailing the nine tribes that inhabited the region, namely the Otoe-Missouria, Osage, Delaware, Ioway, Ilini-Peoria, Kanza, Kickapoo, Sac and Fox, and Shawnee. Murals and artifacts show visitors what life was like in the 19th-century, as well as the impact and long-lasting effects that European exploration had on the tribes. A 10-minute video also gives an overview of the area’s geology and the settlement of the area by the Vanmeter family and development of the park. Trails wind through the Oumessourit Natural Area, leading visitors through freshwater marshes and bottomland and upland forests.</p> <p paraeid=\"{5994cc9a-e579-4ac1-a3d4-40b6fdecff40}{44}\" paraid=\"1122966558\">For more information, call (660) 886-7537 or visit <a href=\"https://mostateparks.com/park/annie-and-abel-van-meter-state-park\">https://mostateparks.com/park/annie-and-abel-van-meter-state-park</a>. </p>",

    "bodyText": "Located in Astoria, Oregon, the 125-foot-tall Astoria Column serves as a monument to the history Pacific Northwest. The idea for the column first came about in 1898 when the city thought to build an electrified tower that would rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. In 1914, the project began to take its first tentative steps toward becoming a reality when the City of Astoria bought 30 acres of land on Coxcomb Hill. By 1917, a flagpole was erected on the site, and Astor Park was officially created just in time for the town’s 4<sup>th</sup> of July celebration.<br /> <br /> From 1917 to 1925, little progress was made on the tower project. Then, in 1925, Ralph Budd, president of the Great Northern Railway, approached New York architect, Electus Litchfield, with the renewed interest. Together with artist Attilio Pusterla, they formulated a plan to erect a column decorated with a sgraffito-style painted histogram recounting the region’s history spanning from the discovery of the Columbia River to the arrival of the railroad. Construction began in March of 1926, and the Astoria Column was officially dedicated during a celebration attended by 8,000 people on July 22, 1926.<br /> <br /> Today, the Astoria Column attracts visitors from around the world. Pusterla’s sgraffito artwork, an ancient technique in which images are engraved into wet plaster and then colored powders are hand-blown into the outlines, is a source of wonder for many. The lower bands begin with Captain Gray’s arrival to the Columbia River in May 1792, and his first contact with the Chinook and Clatsop tribes. As it winds up to the top of the column, the histogram continues with the Lewis and Clark Expedition’s arrival in the area, the arrival of the first European settlers, and ends with the arrival of the railroad to Astoria in 1893.<br /> <br /> Admission to the park is free, but visitors are required to purchase a 1-year parking pass for $5 per vehicle. Visitors may climb the inside of the tower to the observation deck at the top, which provides a spectacular view of Astoria and the Columbia River. The gift shop’s hours of operation vary, and visitors are encouraged to call the monument at (503) 325-2963 for current hours. More information can also be found at the Astoria Column’s website at <a href=\"https://astoriacolumn.org/\">The Astoria Column</a>.",
    "audioDescription": "Situated on the top of Coxcomb Hill, the Astoria Column rises 125 feet above the ground. A door opens into the base of the tower, allowing visitors access to the sprial staircase that leads up to the observation deck at the top of the tower. Outside the tower, a histogram winds around the tower, providing a pictographic history of the area, starting with the discovery of the Columbia River in 1792 and ending with the arrival of the railroad to Astoria in 1893.",

The men camped here on March 23, 1806, after wintering at Fort Clatsop. An interpretive panel is installed on the Astoria Riverwalk that commemorates their stay. A bench commemorating Keith Hay, author of <i>The Lewis & Clark Columbia River Water Trail</i> guidebook, is situated next to the panel. Additional interpretive exhibits can be found along the trail, providing historical information.<br /> <br /> The trailhead can be accessed from Lagoon Road. The gravel parking lot is well-marked, and the trail itself is wheelchair accessible, being either paved with asphalt or comprised of a wooden boardwalk, depending on the section one happens to be on. Those who don’t want to make the return trip on foot can catch the Astoria Trolley at the East Mooring Basin back to the trailhead for a small $1 per person fare.<br /> <br /> For more information on the trail, visit TrailLink’s website at <a href=\"https://www.traillink.com/trail/astoria-riverwalk/\">Astoria Riverwalk</a>.

    "bodyText": "<p>Bad Humored Island was the backdrop of a meaningful exchange between Lewis & Clark and the native tribes that called the region home. As the journals discuss, Black Buffalo and the other chiefs were invited to tour the keelboat, where they were presented gifts. Captain Clark conducted them back to Lilly Park in the pirogue. He wrote, “As soon as I landed the pirogue, three of their young men seized the cable. Chief Black Buffalo then took hold of the rope and ordered the young warriors away.”</p> <p>Clark was not permitted to leave the shore; the pirogue soon returned with twelve armed men. The boat guns, and the soldiers’ muzzle-loading guns, were pointed directly at the Lakota, whose numbers had now grown to about 100. (The expedition numbered forty-four.) Both sides stood down. The captains went upstream on the west side of the river to camp for the night. Clark writes, “I called this island Bad Humored Island, as we were in a bad humor.” (Bad Humored Island was later named Marion’s Island).</p>",

Inside the boats, they saw a group of armed White men and what appeared to be trade goods. Lakota people were accustomed to seeing White men passing through to trade—many spoke French, others spoke Spanish or English. These visitors appeared to have more weapons than some of the other traders, though. The Lakota lookouts lit a fire to alert people in nearby villages of the foreign presence.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{7a06d805-186f-4939-b9ff-ffe00f17f2a4}{231}\" paraid=\"786615815\">The men in the boat asked to hold a council with Lakota leaders.

They arranged a council the following day with chiefs of the Lakota, who were camped about two miles up the Bad River. On the morning of September 25, they “raised a Flagg Staff and formed an orning & Shade on a Sand bar in the Mouth of Teton R to Council under”. Fifty to 60 members of the Lakota arrived, and the council commenced at noon. Lewis and Clark presented medals to the chiefs Black Buffalo, Partisan, and Buffalo Medicine. Fol­lowing a speech by Lewis and a military parade, the chiefs were invited onto the keelboat, where they were presented with additional gifts. However, events took a turn for the worse when Clark ferried the chiefs back to shore. Clark was prevented from returning to the keelboat, and an armed standoff between the ex­pedition and the tribe quickly escalated. Clark and the chiefs managed to defuse the situation and abstain from violence. The expedition was able to peacefully continue upriver, and agreed to transport two of the chiefs aboard the keelboat.<br /> <br /> The Bad River Encounter Site is located within <a href=\"https://www.fortpierre.com/attractions/fischers-lilly-park/\">Fischers Lilly Park</a>, in the city of Fort Pierre.

It was Broughton who gave Baker Bay its moniker, naming it after a British merchant, Captain James Baker, whose ship happened to be anchored just inside the Columbia’s mouth when Broughton passed through.<br /> <br /> Years later, on November 15, 1805, Baker Bay, a popular spot for ships to shelter, would receive a new name. Lewis and Clark had just rounded “Point Distress” and established Station Camp on the sandy shore of the bay. They chose to call it Haley’s Bay in honor of a European trader that the local natives said to be their favorite. Clark mentions this in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“This Bay we call Haleys bay from a favourate Trader with the Indians which they Say comes into this Bay and trades with them.”</p> </blockquote> Today, visitors can access or view Baker Bay from a variety of locations. The town of Ilwaco, Washington, for example, is located inside the bay, as are Chinook Point and Cape Disappointment State Park.   ",

Side about 800 feet high & 400 yds round…”  His estimates were exceptionally close. Today, the site is on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail’s list of High Potential Historic Sites. <br /> <br /> As the area was settled in the 19th century, the basalt feature was given a variety of names. By 1915, river developments threatened to destroy the rock. Henry J. Biddle, a prominent Washingtonian and descendant of Nicholas Biddle, the original editor of Lewis and Clark's journals, bought it and eventually gave it to the state for a park, restoring the original name assigned by Clark. <br /> <br /> To get to the top, hike the mile-long switchback trail.  Or for the more adventurous, you’ll enjoy rock climbing or hiking to waterfalls. Cyclists and horseback riders will find trails to outstanding vistas, and boaters will delight in the majesty of the area from the waters of the Columbia.  The park includes 9,500 feet of freshwater shoreline and more than 26 miles of roads and trails. Picnicking and camping are also found at the park. <br /> <br /> The park is open daily from 8 a.m. to dusk. A Washington State Park Discover Pass is required and may be purchased at an automated station.  The park is just two miles from Skamania on state highway 14.

Side about 800 feet high and 400 paces around, we call the Beaten rock.” Significantly, Clark also noted the first evidence of tidewater: “I could not See any rapids below in the extent of my view which was for a long distance down the river, which from the last rapids widened and had everry appearance of being effected by the tide.” The expedition revisited Beacon Rock returning upriver on April 6, 1806. Lewis wrote, “from the appearance of a rock […] I could judge bet­ter of the rise of the water than I could at any point below. I think the flood of this spring has been about 12 feet higher than it was [the previous fall]; the river is here about 1½ miles wide; it’s general width from the beacon rock which may be esteemed the head of tide water, to the marshey islands is from one to 2 miles tho’ in many places it is still wider. it is only in the fall of the year when the river is low that the tides are persceptable as high as the beacon rock. this remarkable rock which stands on the North shore of the river is unconnected with the hills and rises to the hight of seven hundred feet; […] it rises to a very sharp point and is visible for 20 miles below on the river.”</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/474/Beacon-Rock\">Beacon Rock</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> is an eroded basalt volcanic plug that stands at approximately 848 feet. In the 1800s, it became known as Castle Rock. Purchased by Henry Biddle (a descendant of Nicholas Biddle) in 1915, he restored the Beacon Rock name, constructed a trail to the top, and donated it to the state of Washington. The landmark was designated a state park in 1935.</span></span></span><br />  ",

The graves of William Clark, his wife Harriet, and several of their children were moved to the new cem­etery. The memorial was unveiled in 1904 during the centennial of the expedition with funds donated by Clark’s youngest son, Jefferson Clark. Despite a family endowment, by the late 20th century the grave site had fallen into disrepair. Clark’s descendants raised $100,000 to rehabilitate the obelisk and celebrated the rededication with a ceremony on May 21, 2004, the bicentennial of the start of the expedition.</span></span></span><br />  ",

On September 20, they began the estimated 30- mile trip around the bend. Clark wrote, “detached [Drouillard and Shields] to the 1st.

Later, Lewis and another man also disembarked the boat to hunt. While camping overnight on a sandbar, quick action was required when Clark “observed that the Sand was giving away both above & beloy and would Swallow our Perogues in a few minits, ordered all hands on board and pushed off we had not got to the opposit Shore before pt. of our Camp fel into the river.” Circumnavigation of the Big Bend was completed before breakfast on September 21. <br /> <br /> Today, the Big Bend of the Missouri is part of Lake Sharpe, which was created by the 1959-1966 construc-tion of the Big Bend Dam 15 miles downriver. The neck of the Big Bend is 1.6 miles wide and the circumfer-ence is 22 miles. The land within the bend is part of the Lower Brule Indian Reservation and used for agri-culture.

In just three weeks Clark and his team collected enough bones to ship three large boxes to the President. Subsequently, Jefferson dedicated a room in the White House to display of the Big Bone collection. The collection was divided and various sections of it went to the National Institute of France in Paris, to Philadelphia and to Jefferson's personal collection, which was unfortunately ground into fertilizer by a careless servant. Between 1756 and 1812, while excavations were continuing, the salt industry developed in the area. The salt works required 500 or 600 gallons of water to make a bushel of salt. Two furnaces were created to speed the process of evaporating the water from the salt, but the operation proved too expensive to be profitable, and the business was halted in 1812. From 1831 to 1848, various paleontologists and geologists visited Big Bone Lick, and the lick was included in indexes of all the principal geological, paleontological and scientific journals in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Besides salt, the springs were known for their medicinal qualities and by 1821 Big Bone Lick was one of the most celebrated resorts in that part of the Ohio Valley. A large hotel was erected and named Clay House, in honor of Henry Clay, the famous statesmen from Lexington, Kentucky.</span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> Today, visitors can view fossils of many prehistoric animals that lived in this area, displayed in the Visitor Center. Visitors can also gaze upon life size replicas of prehistoric animals at the outdoor diorama pit. Other displays at the Visitor Center provide entertaining and informative lessons in local geology and Native American history.<br /> <br /> Big Bone Lick State Historic Site, located not far from the Ohio River, offers visitors unique experiences within the rich landscape. Visit the salty natural springs from which the Site gets its name. Catch a glimpse of the Site’s bison herd roaming the grounds, visible nearly anytime of the year! Admission to the park and Visitor Center is free for everyone all year, and park grounds are open daily until dark, year around. Activities include camping, hiking, swimming, birding, orienteering, and picnicking. There is also an 18-hole miniature golf course and tennis courts available.<br /> <br /> With 4.5 miles of trails to hike, Big Bone Lick features five different trails, ranging from easy to moderate difficulty. The orienteering courses are set up for two different trails, one for beginners and one for intermediate experiences. The beginners trail is 2.7 km long and the intermediate trail covers 4.5 km. Both trails have 10 checkpoints along the way. Using a map and compass, hikers navigate the trails, learning skills while enjoying the setting.<br /> <br /> 62 campgrounds with a camp store, showers, grills, laundry and restrooms are available from mid March to mid November. The campground also includes a playground and swimming pool opened seasonally (available to campers only). Campers can locate and register for a campsite anytime online.<br /> <br /> Be sure to also visit the Big Bone Lick gift shop, located in the Visitor Center.",

    "bodyText": "What’s a lick, and what do big bones have to do with it? <br /> <br /> A “lick” is a term for a natural occurrence of salt. They usually appear around sulfur springs, which are places where water and minerals bubble out of the ground. It often smells like rotten eggs.  <br /> <br /> People call these places “licks” because animals like to lick the salty deposits.  <br /> <br /> The “big bone” part of its name came from huge bones in this bog. Indigenous oral tradition states that the bones were from the white buffalo, who died when they drank the salty water.<br /> <br /> Western scientists theorized that animals—including mammoths and mastodons—who came for a salty treat got trapped in the marshy areas around the springs. This site was influential in the American development of paleontology and theories of animal extinction <br /> <br /> Thomas Jefferson knew about this place and asked Meriwether Lewis to stop and collect some fossils and send them back. <br /> <br /> Someone was already running the place as a tourist destination, so, Lewis had no trouble finding it. “Mr. David Ross of Virginia” decided before Lewis arrived that he did not want anyone taking anything from the lick anymore, probably because people had quickly taken most of the biggest fossils. <br /> <br /> Lewis convinced a fellow collector, Dr. William Goforth of Cincinnati, to send specimens already excavated to Jefferson. William Clark returned to the site four years later to retrieve more fossils. <br /> <br /> These were animal bones, not human remains. Still, was it okay for Lewis and Clark to take these fossils? <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

Inside, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a>, just sixteen years old, was giving birth to her first child. The baby’s father, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, had lived in a Hidatsa town for years. Sacagawea was one of his two wives. She had lived in a Hidatsa community for several years, after being captured (or recaptured) from Shoshone people. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{106}\" paraid=\"648359806\">A few months earlier, in November 1804, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark had arrived at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/knife-river-villages.htm\">Knife River villages</a>, where they met Sacagawea and Charbonneau. Sacagawea was about six months pregnant when they arrived. The historical record provides few details about her pregnancy. Did she experience morning sickness? Did she crave certain foods? Did she wake up at night as the baby kicked inside her? It is impossible to know the answers to these questions. We do, however, know something about Sacagawea’s labor and the birth of her son. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{146}\" paraid=\"854862356\">On February 11, 1805, Meriwether Lewis wrote in his journal about Sacagawea’s labor. This was her first pregnancy and, as is often the case, “her labour was tedious and the pain violent.” Sacagawea’s attendants gave her “a small portion of the rattle of a rattle-snake” to speed the birth, and within ten minutes (at “about five oclock this evening”), the baby was born. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{186}\" paraid=\"706461428\">It is easy to imagine the relief and happiness Sacagawea may have felt that evening, holding her newborn son after a long and painful birth. They named the baby Jean Baptiste after his paternal grandfather. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{196}\" paraid=\"91843005\">At just two months old, Jean Baptiste accompanied his mother and father when they set out from Fort Mandan in April 1805 with Lewis, Clark, and crew. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{216}\" paraid=\"811243509\">Having a woman and an infant in the party signaled that its purpose was a peaceful one. Clark took a particular liking to Jean Baptiste and gave him the nickname Pomp. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6af9a75d-c87c-4925-b975-b02b52665765}{228}\" paraid=\"199993044\">Clark offered to provide Jean Baptiste with an education. Around 1812, he went to live with Clark in St. Louis. As an adult, Jean Baptiste traveled to Europe and guided several military expeditions in the western parts of North America. He died on May 16, 1866, at the age of sixty-one.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

On August 11, 1804, Lewis, Clark and ten other men climbed the hill to visit the grave of Omaha Chief Blackbird, whose ruthlessness had gained him notoriety among other tribes and traders from St. Louis. Clark wrote, “We landed at the foot of the hill on which Black Bird The late King of the mahar who Died 4 years ago & 400 of his nation with the Small pox was buried and went up and fixed a white flag bound with Blue white & read on the Grave which was about 12 foot Base & circueller, on the top of a Penical about 300 foot above the water of the river, from the top of this hill may be Seen the bends or meanderings of the river for 60 or 70 miles round.”<br /> <br /> Blackbird Hill remained a distinctive landmark for river travelers throughout the 19th century. It was paint­ed by George Catlin in 1832 and Karl Bodmer in 1833. According to traditional Omaha tribal accounts, Chief Big Elk was also buried at this site. In a downslope gorge, natural sandstone bedrock exposures display a collection of petroglyphs which depict human, animal, and supernatural figures. While tribal or chrono­logical affiliation of the petroglyphs is unknown, one resembling a human on horseback is likely post-1700 CE. Located within the Omaha Reservation, Blackbird Hill is privately owned but publicly viewable from adjacent roadways.",

Rising 300 feet above them, they saw a promontory known as Blackbird Hill. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark already knew about this landmark. At its top lay the grave of Wazhiⁿga’ sabe (Blackbird), a former Omaha leader. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ba9a8f66-9add-4f00-8af6-14458258d8b5}{171}\" paraid=\"930675824\">Under Wazhiⁿga’ sabe’s leadership in the late 1700s, Omaha people became a strong force on the Great Plains.

In 1794, Frenchman Zenon Trudeau wrote of the need to maintain friendly relations with Wazhiⁿga’ sabe. He controlled the trade routes, and “without his consent,” they could not access Omaha or other Indigenous communities of the Upper Missouri.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ba9a8f66-9add-4f00-8af6-14458258d8b5}{219}\" paraid=\"280425263\">The Spanish Governor of Louisiana gave Wazhiⁿga’ sabe a medal in 1796, to establish his vassalage—and trading obligations—with Spain, in the tradition that all European monarchs used these medals. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ba9a8f66-9add-4f00-8af6-14458258d8b5}{243}\" paraid=\"1460503001\">Wazhiⁿga’ sabe’s power and prestige could not save him from the ravages of disease, however. In 1800, a smallpox epidemic ravaged Omaha communities. It killed Wazhiⁿga’ sabe and nearly one-third of his community. His relatives buried Wazhiⁿga’ sabe on a hill overlooking the Missouri River, at a site where he could see for miles and watch for travelers on the river. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a018b2dd-f026-45a6-94cc-4ff37ef29a07}{36}\" paraid=\"1010516605\">Lewis and Clark were aware of this history when they set out. They brought a specially made flag to leave at Wazhiⁿga’ sabe’s grave. On that day in 1804, Clark climbed to the top of the hill and “fixed a white flag bound with Blue white & read [sic] on the Grave.” They hoped that paying their respects at the gravesite would serve as an important diplomatic gesture to Omaha people. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",
    "audioDescription": "From a gravel parking lot off of U.S. Highway 75, a path leads up the hill to a circular, open-air pavilion designed after the earthlodges used by Omaha people. Looking east from the pavilion, the Missouri River is visible about 300 feet below. The pavilion stands in the center of a mown grass meadow surrounded by trees in a semi-circle. The trees are open to the east to provide a view of the river.",

Here Patrick Gass was formally promoted to the rank of sergeant, filling the position formerly held by the late Sergeant Floyd. Clark identified Bow Creek as the general location of an abandoned Omaha village, writing, “above the mouth of this Creek a Chief of the Maha nataton displeased with the Conduct of Black bird the main Chief came to this place and built a Town which was called by his name Petite Arch (or Little Bow) this Town was at the foot of a Hill in a handsom Plain fronting the river and Contained about 100 huts & 200 men, the remains of this tribe Since the Death of Petite arch has joined the remaining part of the nation”. <br /> <br /> Circa 1720, the Omaha Tribe established a village near the mouth of Bow Creek known as “Bad Village”, apparently due to a schism that split the tribe. Bad Village was likely occupied until circa 1750, when the factions reunited at a village site near present-day Dakota City, Nebraska. Following the rise of Blackbird, Little Bow and his followers left the Omaha Big Village and resettled in the Bow Creek area circa 1780-1790. Accounts vary, but the Omaha factions reunited following the death of either Blackbird or Little Bow, some¬time prior to 1804. The exact location of the Little Bow Village is currently unknown, but there are numer¬ous archeological sites throughout the area, which is primarily used for agricultural cultivation.</p> <h4>Recreation </h4> <p>Bow Creek Recreation Area provides many opportunities for the public to experience a part of the Missouri National Recreational River. The 205-acre property includes a mix of wetlands, grasslands, riparian cottonwood forest, and mesic-bur oak forest. Rock and sediment exposures along the Missouri River reveal past geologic events. A mowed grass trail is planned for the property to loop through these environments. In the restored prairie, look for dragonflies and butterflies. In the cottonwood and oak forests, watch for wildlife sign including resident whitetail deer and turkey.</p> <h4>How To Get There</h4> <p>Bow Creek Recreation Area is located along Bow Creek and the Missouri River in Cedar County about 2 miles northeast of Wynot, Nebraska.

She led them between the Bridger and Gallatin mountain ranges through Bozeman Pass. When still encamped at the Three Forks of the Missouri on July 13, Clark had considered a route through a pass further to the north, but wrote, “The indian woman who has been of great Service to me as a pilot through this Country recommends a gap in the mountain more South which I shall cross.” The party ascended following a “well beaten buffalow road” to “the top of the dividing ridge between the waters of the Missouri from those of the river Rochehone [Yellowstone].”<br /> <br /> Although first documented by Clark and later named for John Bozeman, who in the early 1860s helped blaze the Bozeman Trail, the pass had been used as a corridor for thousands of years prior to the Corps of Discovery, particularly by tribes reliant upon following bison migrations. As modes of transportation advanced into the modern era, the Bozeman Pass remained the established thoroughfare into southwest­ern Montana. Substantial development began with the Northern Pacific Railway, completed in 1883. An automobile highway, the Yellowstone Trail, was first constructed across the pass in 1912. This was replaced in 1926 by US 10, and then in 1956 by Interstate 90. There is a historical marker documenting the expedi­tion’s passage.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "The Cahokia Courthouse State Historic Site is located in Cahokia, Illinois. First constructed in the 1740s as a dwelling when the territory was under French control, it was converted to a courthouse in 1793 and is the oldest courthouse in Illinois. The building is an example of the French Colonial vertical log poteaux-sur-solle (“post-on-sill”) construction technique where upright hewn logs are seated on a horizontal log sill. Spaces between logs are filled with stone and mortar chinking. <br /> <br /> In 1901 the courthouse was dismantled and re-erected in St. Louis for the 1904 World’s Fair. It was moved once again in 1906 to Chicago’s Jackson Park. In 1939 it was reconstructed on the original site in Cahokia where it currently sits on its original stone foundation. <br /> <br /> This site is historically significant for serving as the headquarters of Lewis and Clark from winter of 1803 to the spring of 1804. They used the courthouse to make arrangements for their long voyage which included: gathering supplies, meeting with territorial leaders, collecting general information, and corresponding with President Jefferson. <br /> <br /> The courthouse now serves as a museum and historic site. Three exhibit rooms depict cases the court handled around 1800 and the French-roots of the structure. A fourth room is refurbished to represent the courtroom of 1790. Two massive limestone fireplaces, shuttered casement windows, and French-style doors allow visitors to step back in time to Illinois’s territorial infancy. Courthouse staff and volunteers offer guided tours, or visitors may walk through at their leisure. <br /> <br /> Managed by the State of Illinois, several special events are held at the site each year. Visit their website at <a href=\"https://www2.illinois.gov/dnrhistoric/Experience/Sites/Southwest/Pages/Cahokia-Courthouse.aspx \">https://www2.illinois.gov/dnrhistoric/Experience/Sites/Southwest/Pages/Cahokia-Courthouse.aspx </a>for more information",
    "audioDescription": "The front of an old building constructed of vertical, weathered logs with rough stone filling in the gaps sits on a lawn overshadowed by a deciduous tree. A porch wraps around the structure, covered by a gray, shingled roof. Two windows with wooden shutters and two double glass-framed doors provide access to the front of the building. A wooden barrel sits on the corner of the porch, and a sidewalk leads to one of the doors on the left-hand side.",

Europeans published these maps using geographic knowledge that Indigenous people shared with them. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/maps-of-the-missouri-river.htm\">Mackay-Evans map</a>, for example, drew on information James Mackay and John Evans received from their Mandan and Hidatsa acquaintances. Throughout their journey, Indigenous hosts drew maps and described trails, routes, shortcuts, and portages to Lewis and Clark. Most of this was not “uncharted” territory—many people knew its terrain and paths intimately and had passed down that knowledge over many generations.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

It is jarring to imagine how people could co-exist in such large numbers during an era before modern medicine, advanced irrigation, and an overall staggering amount of danger that lurked everywhere back then. It is inspiring that people could put aside their differences and come together to build something greater than themselves when the contrary would have been much easier, safer, and simpler.<br /> <br /> The settlement of Cahokia, in Southern Illinois fits this mold. From prehistory to the 1600s, the Cahokians were the most sophisticated and advanced society north of Mexico. With cities bustling with merchants, artisans, artists, priests and more- Cahokia was the premiere Native-American civilization. With their advanced knowledge of agriculture, science, and coexistence, the Cahokians managed to cultivate a civilization larger than London’s in the year 1250, this despite enduring the brutal winters and scorching summers of the Mississippi Valley. </p> <p>Not much remains of this once magnificent Native American cultural and economic hub. However, the Cahokians did an excellent job of leaving behind enough to keep their significant legacy and history intact. Visitors can tour the numerous trails offered on site where people can get a sense of what it may have felt like to live in ancient Cahokia. Bring your gym-shoes because you can even climb the 100 foot tall mounds created by the Cahokians all those years ago! From the top of one historic metropolis, you can see a modern one in S.T Louis- reminding visitors that our cities today would not exist if ancient civilizations didn’t put in the leg work.</p> <p>In the interpretive center, visitors can learn from the myriad exhibits, videos, and knowledgeable volunteers. Visitors will learn everything from the day-to-day life of the Cahokians to what qualified the settlement as an urban-hub. With over 5.4 miles of trails, 100 foot tall mounds, and the engaging interpretive center-visitors will leave the mounds with a much greater understanding of the prehistoric city.</p> <p paraeid=\"{31d09435-0d17-4e84-b147-77b8fd983774}{93}\" paraid=\"104\">Admission to Cahokia Mounds is free to the general public, although donations of $7 per adult, $5 per senior, $2 per child, and $15 for families are suggested. Visits to the Interpretive Center are currently by appointment only. To schedule a tour or for current operating hours, call (618) 346-5160. </p>",

Lewis, Drouillard and the two Field broth­ers reached the expedition’s northernmost campsite on July 22, 1806, and spent three full days exploring the area. With observation efforts frustrated by continual bad weather and increasingly wary of encounter­ing hostile Blackfeet, they departed on the morning of July 26. After failing to establish a latitude with his instruments, coupled with an understanding that the Marias River did not reach as north as hoped, Lewis wrote, “we set out biding a lasting adieu to this place which I now call camp disappointment.”</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Camp Disappointment lies within an open landscape of meadows interspersed with cottonwood stands along Cut Bank Creek. To the immediate east of the campsite and abutting the creek is a distinctive 300- foot cliff that was traditionally used as a buffalo jump. Located on privately owned land within the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, permission is needed to access this site. In 1925, the Great Northern Railroad erected a monument to commemorate Camp Disappointment near milepost 233 on US Highway 2. It is about four miles south of the actual historic site.</span></span></span></p>",

Conditions of the Louisiana Purchase required Lewis and Clark to remain within American territory until the land officially transferred from France to the United States on March 10, 1804. The location was also convenient to St. Louis and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cahokia-courthouse-illinois.htm\">Cahokia Courthouse</a>. Today, the exact location of the camp is unknown due to shifts in the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9190fb7-a9ca-46a8-a18e-2a4989c5cc83}{208}\" paraid=\"1547947899\">Clark spent most of the winter at Camp Dubois supervising and training the recruits.

They sometimes brought meat or other provisions to trade. Often they stayed and exchanged stories about communities upriver.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9190fb7-a9ca-46a8-a18e-2a4989c5cc83}{242}\" paraid=\"677176191\">Lewis spent much of the winter in St. Louis, meeting with fur traders and others who had experience on the Upper Missouri.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{863f9b38-68e7-4833-beb0-84e877664963}{5}\" paraid=\"244331779\">In the late afternoon of May 14, 1804, Clark and forty-one men set out from Camp Dubois. Curious onlookers along the riverbank may have watched the keelboat and two pirogues (a type of canoe) depart. They would have been accustomed to seeing vessels traveling up and down the Missouri. Did they know the political significance of this diplomatic mission of colonization? Did they have any idea of what it would mean for the Indigenous people who lived along the Missouri and beyond? </p>",

It remained under military law until 1795 when the Treaty of Greeneville was signed, ending open hostilities between settlers and local native nations. As a result, Colonel Ebenezer Sproat became the town’s first sheriff. In 1800, the settlement was incorporated into the town of Marietta, a name chosen in honor of Queen Marie Antionette and France’s support of the American colonies during the Revolutionary War. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f4e3f44c-21ab-413c-a4a2-a1ee8b3f0d42}{155}\" paraid=\"1922392462\">On September 13, 1803, Lewis wrote of the town in his journal, stating:</p> <blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{f4e3f44c-21ab-413c-a4a2-a1ee8b3f0d42}{155}\" paraid=\"1922392462\"> “we arrived at Marietta, the mouth of the Muskingum river, at 7 OClock in the evening […] Marietta is one hundred miles from Wheeling; lay here all night wrote to the President of U.S. dismissed two of my hands, […] I engaged another at Marietta or the mouth of Muskingum— This evening was visited by Colo.

Focusing on the role that the establishment of Marietta and the Northwest Territory played in early American history, the museum offers a first-hand experience of frontier life. It also tells the story of Ohio’s first peoples, such as the Adena/Hopewell Cultures and other native tribes that inhabited the area, through a combination of static, interactive, and living history exhibits staffed by interpretive guides.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{b930000d-4609-4ca2-8e21-aab8701153c7}{4}\" paraid=\"361675028\">Admission to the museum is $10 per adult and $5 per child and veteran.

Coboway and other Clatsop people visited often to trade, smoke, and play games.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{23}\" paraid=\"1513737495\">But on this particular day in late December, Coboway shared some news: a “large Fish was drove by the Wind & waves on the shore.” Through the gestures Coboway made, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark realized it was a whale.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{67}\" paraid=\"426705541\">A week later, Coboway and his friends returned with whale blubber.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{81}\" paraid=\"919153190\">Lewis called the blubber “excellent food” and elaborated, “it was white & not unlike the fat of Poark, tho’ the texture was more spongey and somewhat coarser. I had a part of it cooked and found it very pallitable and tender, it resembled the beaver or the dog in flavour.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{119}\" paraid=\"912805097\">Clark decided that they should retrieve some blubber themselves. He hired a Clatsop man to guide him, twelve men, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a> (and presumably her baby) down the coast to the whale. They packed items that people in the nearby Nehalem village might want to trade for whale blubber, like fishhooks, files, and glass beads. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{185}\" paraid=\"953706985\">When they arrived at the beach, the 105-foot-long whale was “nothing more than the Sceleton.” Nehalem families were “busily engaged boiling the blubber, which they performed in a large Squar wooden trought by means of hot Stones; the oil when extracted was Secured in bladders and the Guts of the whale.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bf9eb6e7-41b0-45bd-b368-0c7f35147eb7}{227}\" paraid=\"2075660567\">Nehalem families offered to trade whale blubber and oil for elk meat, but Clark had not brought any with them. After more haggling, they decided that the glass beads would suffice. Clark, Charbonneau, Sacagawea, and the other men divided the heavy whale blubber and oil among their party and returned to Fort Clatsop.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ede000-4a11-4ad5-bec0-a94b06272a6b}{12}\" paraid=\"377814310\">On the way, they passed many Chinook and Clatsop people who were also carrying large amounts of whale blubber home. Maybe they felt similar to Clark’s party: energized by the festive environment around this giant spectacle on the beach and excited to bring their families a special treat.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "Adjacent to the Clearwater River, this is the site where in 1805 the Nez Perce helped Lewis and Clark build five canoes for their journey down the Columbia River watershed.<br /> <br /> Where the North Folk of the Clearwater River enters the main channel of the Clearwater, the Corps of Discovery were exhausted and famished.  It was the end of September 1805 and the difficult trek over the Continental Divide was finally behind them.  But on this point of land over an 11-day period, they worked incredibly hard.  This was Canoe Camp.<br /> <br /> The Corps arrived on September 26 and immediately searched for food.  Deer and other large prey was nowhere to be found, so a horse was eaten.  Then they tried fat dogs of the Indians. <br /> <br /> The crew was divided into five groups, and each with axes too small for the task, they began hacking away at five huge trees – probably red cedar or possibly ponderosa pine.  They saved labor by building fires along the tops of the logs, as taught them by the Nez Perce, then scraped out the ashes and charred wood.  <br /> <br /> They dried and repacked their possessions, branded and cut the forelocks off their 38 surviving horses so the animals were easily recognized when mixed with the Nez Perce herds. Finally, in the dark of night, they cached their saddles and some powder for the return trip over the divide. <br /> <br /> Four of the canoes are believed to have been large, although no journal keeper reported any dimensions.  The fifth canoe was smaller, designed to more easily scout ahead of the others and check on the conditions of the rivers.  <br /> <br /> On October 7, the men broke camp, loaded the canoes and shoved off around noon.  For the first time since the fall of 1803, when they left the Ohio River, Lewis and Clark were going with the flow of a river, instead of against it.  <br /> <br /> Today, Canoe Camp is a part of the 38-site Nez Perce National Historical Park.  There are six wayside exhibits at Canoe Camp spaced along a short interpretive trail. They tell the story of the original meeting between Lewis and Clark and the Nez Perce, the Nez Perce role in the building of the canoes, the mission of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and the Nez Perce historic use of the area. The site also includes a reproduction of one of Lewis and Clark's canoes. The camp site is within the unincorporated town of Ahsahka, Idaho, about 50 miles east of Lewiston.  <br />  ",

The canoe is about 20 feet long and 2 feet tall, and is made of a single tree trunk which has been slowly and methodically carved out using hot stones and metal tools.

    "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\">A notable landmark of the Pacific Northwest, Cape Disappointment was already named by the time Lewis and Clark reached the site in November 1805.  The first known documentation of the site was in 1775 by Spanish explorer Bruno Heceta, who named it “Bahia de La Asuncion,” or Bay of the Assumption.  Then in 1788, British trader John Meares named it “Cape Disappointment” when he mistakenly believed that the mouth of the Columbia River was only a bay. <br /> <br /> Meriwether Lewis laid eyes on the area in mid-November 1805 – he proceeded on by land while the rest of the Expedition sheltered at Dismal Nitch.  He returned to camp on November 17 and Patrick Gass wrote in his journal, “They had been round the bay, and seen where white people had been in the course of the summer; but they had all sailed away.”  For this reason, Cape Disappointment had a different, unhappy meaning to the men of the Corps. <br /> <br /> Today, the Cape is a Washington State Park which pays tribute to the many different uses of the area, from military outpost during the Civil War and World War II, to iconic lighthouses. Hike through old-growth forest or around freshwater lakes, saltwater marshes and ocean tidelands. Gape at the breathtaking views. Launch your boat from Baker Bay. Benson Beach is a popular clam-digging destination, and fishers love to set up on the North Jetty to catch salmon and crab. The beaches at Cape Disappointment also lure kite-fliers, sand-castle builders and those who love to walk and explore.  <br /> <br /> But be sure to visit the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center for numerous interactive displays. Standing high on the cliffs of the Cape, 200 feet above the pounding Pacific surf, the Center is filled with information, artwork, and film presentations about the Corps of Discovery.  From April 1 to October 31, it’sr open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.<br /> <br /> Summer hours for the park are from 6:30 a.m. to dusk. A Washington State Park Discovery Pass is required; an automated pay station is on site.  A separate fee is required for the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center.  For more information, go to: http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment\">Cape Disappointment</a> is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> On November 14, 1805, while the expedition sheltered at Dismal Nitch, Lewis “concluded to proceed on by land & find if possible the white people the Indians Say is below and examine if a Bay is Situated near the mouth of this river as laid down by Vancouver in which we expect, if there is white traders to find them.” On November 17, Lewis “returned haveing travesed Haleys Bay to Cape Disapointment and the Sea Coast to the North for Some distance.” Gass remarked, “They had been round the bay, and seen where white people had been in the course of the summer: but they had all sailed away.” The next day Clark and 11 others “who wished to See more of the main Ocian” made the trip to Cape Disappointment and the northern coastline, rejoining the main party at Station Camp on November 20.<br /> <br /> The cape was a notable maritime landmark of the Pacific Northwest, with the first known documentation in 1775 by Spanish explorer Bruno Heceta, who named it “Bahia de La Asuncion.” British trader John Meares named it “Cape Disappointment” in 1788, due to his mistaken belief that the mouth of the Columbia River was only a bay. The United States deemed Cape Disappointment strategically significant enough to base military fortifications there during the Civil War and World War II. Construction of a lighthouse was complet­ed in 1856. The decommissioned military fortification and lighthouse are now encompassed by the <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment\">Camp Disappointment State Park</a>, which includes a <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment\">Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center.</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "English fur trader John Meares was mistaken as he stood on the northern shore of the mouth of the Columbia River in July 1788.  He was in search of the great river, but what appeared before him seemed to be a large bay, so he named the high bluff above the Columbia’s mouth, “Cape Disappointment.” <br /> <br /> When you visit Cape Disappointment State Park today, you certainly won’t be disappointed in what you find.  It’s an amazing park that’s home to the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center. <br /> <br /> Perched on a cliff 200 feet above the pounding Pacific surf, the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center shares the story of the Corps of Discovery’s journey, focusing particularly on their Pacific Coast stay during the winter of 1805-1806.  A series of mural-size timeline panels guide visitors through the westward journey of the Expedition using sketches, paintings, photographs, and the words of the journal writers.  <br /> <br /> It’s a wonderful stop for families with numerous interactive exhibits. Children can try to pack a canoe without tipping it, follow a treasure hunt, and check out what the Corps ate on their journey.  The center features a short film presentation, a nicely outfitted gift shop, and a glassed-in observation deck with fabulous views of the river, headlands, and ocean.  Additional displays focus on local maritime and military history. <br /> <br /> During winter and spring, trained volunteers come to the center to help visitors spot migrating Gray Whales.  You can also learn about the nearby North Head and Cape Disappointment Lighthouses.  The lighthouses both function to protect mariners from the rough and ever-changing Columbia River Bar in the treacherous area known as the “Graveyard of the Pacific.”  The Cape Disappointment Lighthouse is the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast.<br /> <br /> Cape Disappointment was armed with smoothbore cannons to protect the mouth of the Columbia during the Civil War.  In 1875, the area was expanded to become Fort Canby which remained in use through the end of World War II.  Today, near the visitor center, you can explore the remains of the military bunkers and defense batteries.<br /> <br /> Be sure to set aside time to hike through old-growth forest or around fresh-water ponds, saltwater marshes, and ocean tidelands.  The beaches are perfect for kite-flying, sand-castle building, or simply walking and exploring.  Camping, picnicking, clamming, boating, fishing, crabbing, and bird watching are also fun activities within the park. <br /> <br /> Cape Disappointment State Park is open year-round for camping and day use, 8 a.m. to dusk.  A Washington State Park Discover Pass is required.  The hours of the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center vary by season.  Be sure to check their website for current rates, hours, and information:  <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment\">https://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment</a>.<br />  ",

Some Chinookan people said words in English that they had picked up from the traders. Lewis relayed what they told him,  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ca333994-8781-4f03-923d-7d3ed2db50cc}{88}\" paraid=\"997359151\">The traders usually arrive in this quarter . . . in the month of April, and remain untill October; when here they lay at anchor in a bay within <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?places=Cape%20Disappointment\">Cape Disappointment</a> on the N. side of the river; here they are visited by the natives in their canoes who run along side and barter their comodities with them, their being no houses or fortification on shore for that purpose. . . . </p> <p paraeid=\"{ca333994-8781-4f03-923d-7d3ed2db50cc}{121}\" paraid=\"382140912\">Based on this, Lewis and Clark decided to spend the winter nearby, in case any European ships arrived.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ca333994-8781-4f03-923d-7d3ed2db50cc}{145}\" paraid=\"1804564642\">But they never saw one.

    "bodyText": "Cathlapotle Plankhouse is located in the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge near Ridgefield, Washington. The building is based on more than a decade’s worth of archaeological research at the site, which began in the 1990s where a large village of the Cathlapotle Nation once stood. It took over 100 volunteers two years to complete it, and the official opening ceremony was conducted on March 29, 2005.<br /> <br /> Meriwether Lewis and William Clark mention the village in their journals, both when they passed the town on November 5, 1805, and on their return journey on March 29, 1806. According to the explorers’ entries, they traded deerskins with the Cathlapotle in exchange for dogs and other provisions during both encounters. Their visit spelled disaster for the local populations since, only 20 years later, European diseases like smallpox took a heavy toll on tribes of the area. By the late 1830s, those who survived abandoned the site. In 1840, the Carty family claimed the land and built a homestead. It became part of the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge in 1965.<br /> <br /> Today, the Cathlapotle Plankhouse plays an important role in the life and community of the tribes of the area. It also serves as an outdoor education center and is used by tribal members for special events throughout the year.<br /> <br /> The plankhouse is currently closed to the public.",
    "audioDescription": "The pankhouse measures 37 feet by 78 feet and is constructed mainly from cedar timber donated by local landowners and national forests. The two side walls of the building are low to the ground, standing at roughly shoulder-height. From there, the wooden roof rises to a peak that is approximately 20 feet above the ground and is held up by the front and rear walls of the structure. The peak is supported by a cedar log painted red. The front wall features a round entry hole, the top of which is about shoulder-height. A long painted geometric design in red, white, black, yellow, and gray stretches vertically from the ground around the entrance all the way to the peak. Horizontally, the design is just a few inches wider than the entry hole, outlining the entrance in red and white.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Cave Hill Cemetery is a 296-acre Victorian era National Cemetery and arboretum. It is the largest cemetery by area and number of burials in Louisville. Cave Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Cave Hill National Cemetery, containing military graves, is also on the National Register, added in 1998.</p> <p>Cave Hill was chartered in 1848 on what was William Johnston’s Cave Hill Farm, then a rural property some distance east of Louisville. Johnston, who died in 1798, had built the first brick house in Louisville on the grounds circa 1788. City officials had purchased part of the land in the 1830s in anticipation of building a railroad through it, and a workhouse was built there. The railroad was built elsewhere, and the land was leased to local farmers.</p> <p>In 1846, Mayor Frederick A. Kaye began investigating the possibility of developing a rural or garden-style cemetery on the grounds, a popular concept at the time. Hartford, Connecticut civil engineer Edmund Francis Lee was hired, who planned a cemetery with winding paths, graves across the tops of hills, and lakes and ponds in the valleys. The Cave Hill Cemetery Co. was chartered in February 1848, and the cemetery was dedicated on July 25, 1848. Reverend Doctor Edward Porter Humphrey delivered the dedicatory address and elaborated on the idea of the garden cemetery, noting, among other things, that “. . .Reason and taste suggest that [this cemetery] should be decorated appropriately by the beautiful productions of our great Creator. . .”</p> <p>Before the era of large municipal parks, it was common for cities to promote a garden cemetery as a green oasis and recreation destination, and Louisville was no exception. This largely ended with the opening of nearby Cherokee Park in 1892. After administrators sold several acres of land for the burial of Union soldiers during the Civil War, local Confederate supporters purchased nearby land as well. Several deceased patients from the Brown General Hospital and other nearby army medical facilities were interred in Cave Hill Cemetery.</p> <p>The grounds were expanded and remapped in 1888 to their modern size of nearly 300 acres (1.2 km<sup>2</sup>). In the 1980s, razor wire was added to the brick walls surrounding Cave Hill to keep out after-hours visitors.</p> <p>The first scenic overlook for the cemetery, Twin Lakes Scenic Overlook, opened on August 20, 2008.</p> <p>There were about 120,000 people interred by 2002, with space remaining for 22,000 more graves. Notable among those interred in the cemetery is:</p> <ul> <li>George Rogers-Clark – A soldier from Virginia and the highest ranking American military officer on the northwestern frontier during the American Revolutionary War. Brother to Captain William Clark of the Corps of Discovery.</li> <li>Patty & Milred Hill – The sisters who composed the Happy Birthday song.</li> <li>Colonel Harland Sanders – The founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken</li> <li>Muhammad Ali – American professional boxer, activist, philanthropist, and Louisville’s Native Son</li> <li>Enid Yandell – An American sculptor who studied with Auguste Rodinand and Frederick William MacMonnies. The sculpture collection at Speed Art Museum (Louisville, KY) includes a large number of her works in plaster.</li> <li>Jeptha Barnard Bright, Jr – Better known as Barney Bright, was a sculptor from Louisville, KY and is best known for his work on the Louisville Clock.</li> </ul>",

There were 17 lodges above the falls and five more below. Lewis and Clark determined a portage route “on the Stard. Side, and the distance 1200 yards one third of the way on a rock, about 200 yards over a loose Sand collected in a hollar blown by the winds from the bottoms below which was disagreeable to pass, as it was Steep and loose.” They received a great deal of assistance from the villagers, including the use of their horses. The Corps camped two nights on the north bank below the falls, “close under a high range of clifts of rocks, where the body of the River beat against it and formed a verry large eddy.” The return portage was made on April 21, 1806. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">Over the years, Celilo Falls has been impacted by infrastructure developments such as a canal, railroad bridge, transmission lines, and inundation from the Dalles Dam. Even so, the portage route on the Wash­ington side of the river remains intact and above water. On-site access is restricted, but nearby Celilo Park provides public viewing and interpretation of the area from the Oregon side of the river.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />  ",

This stretch of turbulent water and rocky banks has always been an important meeting place.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdfa7f07-23c9-4fec-b2a1-26f070fd4105}{49}\" paraid=\"796250749\">People spoke many languages here. Upstream, residents of the Columbia River Plateau spoke Sahaptian languages. Downstream, people spoke Chinookan languages.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdfa7f07-23c9-4fec-b2a1-26f070fd4105}{81}\" paraid=\"773370408\">People came to trade here. The spring and fall salmon runs were the most bustling times for the communities along the rapids. Wasco-Wishram (Chinookan-speaking) people who lived here caught salmon, dried it, and pounded it into cakes, which they then wrapped in dried grass and salmon skin. They called these powdered fish cakes “killuk.” It remained edible for months. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdfa7f07-23c9-4fec-b2a1-26f070fd4105}{165}\" paraid=\"1750103005\">Far-flung travelers—from Paiute people who lived in the deserts to British sailors who anchored their ships at the mouth of the Columbia—came to the falls to trade for this preserved fish. To buy the killuk, people traded what they had: horses, knives, axes, copper kettles, guns, beads, buffalo robes, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/dismal-nitch-washington.htm\">cedar clothing</a>, shells, blankets, cloth, and more—materials that had been made anywhere from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Basin to England to China. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark’s group bought hazelnuts, berries, grass mats, and lots of killuk. The dried fish cakes ended up being the only food they still had left later that year. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdfa7f07-23c9-4fec-b2a1-26f070fd4105}{235}\" paraid=\"2070553916\">People came for community here. They came to see long-lost friends and celebrate the abundance of the salmon runs.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bdfa7f07-23c9-4fec-b2a1-26f070fd4105}{249}\" paraid=\"994997300\">Walamottinin (Twisted Hair) and Tetoharsky led Lewis and Clark to the falls, which these Nez Perce men had probably visited many times before, and then the Nez Perce returned home. Still in need of locals to help them portage around these difficult falls, the expedition members traded goods with Wasco-Wishram people in exchange for their assistance. </p> <p paraeid=\"{52c2c775-118a-4517-8461-6829d2878b8c}{42}\" paraid=\"1790826919\">Clark called the area “the Great Mart of all this Country.” He even tried to set up his own market stand in one town—“I rose early and took a position near to the village and exposed the artiles I had for Sale”—but met little success.338  </p> <p paraeid=\"{52c2c775-118a-4517-8461-6829d2878b8c}{74}\" paraid=\"778833175\">Clark, Lewis, and the people with them were just another group passing through this busy marketplace.  </p>",

At dark, a large fire was made in the center, and the dance began.</p> <h3>Thursday, September 27, 1804</h3> <p>The men of the expedition were invited by Chief Black Buffalo back to the large council house for another dance, which lasted until about 1:00 p.m. Lewis and Clark and company returned to their keelboat, accompanied by two chiefs. As the pirogue approached the keelboat, the steersman misjudged, cutting the metal anchor cable.</p> <h3>Friday, September 28, 1804</h3> <p>After searching in vain for the lost anchor, the captains prepared to depart. Several of the Lakota warriors seized the rope holding the keelboat, and refused to leave.

Interpretive panels and works of art can be found at various points along the trail. The trail goes along the Port of Ilwaco, then up a steep hillside. The main trail leads straight to Cape Disappointment State Park, but side trails will take you to North Head Lighthouse and Beard's Hollow, through groves of ancient Sitka spruce, coastal forests, transitional wetlands, and windswept dunes. Gray whale carvings can be found near the Sid Snyder Beach Approach. The bronze replica of Clark's tree is found at the end of the trail.",

George Gibson had suffered a serious thigh injury after being thrown from his horse, making land travel for him all but impossible. Clark wrote that they “found some large timber near which the grass was tolerably good I En­camped under a thick grove of those trees which was not Sufficiently large for my purpose.” However, there were no better trees in the vicinity to be found. The next day Clark “deturmined to have two Canoes made out of the largest of those trees and lash them together which will Cause them to be Study and fully Suffi­cient to take my Small party & Self with what little baggage we have down this river.” The party remained at the camp until July 24 building the canoes, hunting, and stitching new clothing from deer and elk skins. One night half of their horses disappeared. While Clark suspected it to be the work of an element from the Crow Tribe, no Crows were ever encountered and the missing horses were never recovered.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Based on geographical analysis and an archeological study conducted between 2011 and 2014, Clark’s Canoe Camp site is likely located near present day Park City, Montana.

As they waited for the arrival of George Drouillard and John Shields, who were traveling separately on horseback, Lewis and Clark took measurements and recorded observations. Clark climbed the hill behind their camp on June 2, noting in his journals that he “assended the hill in the point 80 ps. from the pt. found it about 100 foot high, on the top is 2 graves, or mouns, a Delightfull prospect from this hill which Comds. both rivers.”<br /> <br /> Although the confluence of the two rivers was visible from Clark’s Hill in 1804, it subsequently shifted to a location approximately six miles further downstream. However, the woodland character of the river valley remains intact and visitors are afforded views that are relatively undisrupted by modern intrusions. The site is operated as a state park unit, and features a hiking trail that accesses a viewing platform over the rocky outcrop that Clark stood upon. The two burial mounds documented by Clark remain intact, and have been dated to the Late Woodland period (BCE 600-900). Three additional mounds and a village site have also been located in the area.",

The terrible weather had made it impossible to stay at their current camp and had left them all wet and miserable, to the point that even their clothing was beginning to rot away.<br /> <br /> When the weather worsened a few days later, the expedition was forced to relocate once more on November 12 in the hopes of finding a drier campsite. Clark describes the dire weather and the new camp in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“A Tremendious wind from the S. W. about 3 oClock this morning with Lightineng and hard claps of Thunder, and Hail which Continued untill 6 oClock a. m. when it became light for a Short time, then the heavens became Sudenly darkened by a black Cloud from the S. W. and rained with great violence untill 12 oClock, the waves tremendious brakeing with great fury against the rocks and trees on which we were encamped. our Situation is dangerous. we took the advantage of a low <em>tide</em> and moved our camp around a point to a Small wet bottom at the mouth of a Brook, which we had not observed when we Came to this cove; from it being verry thick and obscured by drift trees and thick bushes…” </p> </blockquote> The point of land that Clark describes is located at the upstream end of Hungry Harbor and is known as Cliff Point. Unfortunately, this meant that the crew was separated from their cargo by half a mile, as they were unable to carry it with them. The canoes were left to “the mercy of the waves,” having been secured to the best of their ability by using stones to sink them and keep them from being dashed to pieces against the rocks.  <br /> <br /> The weather finally let up on November 15, and the expedition hurriedly loaded their gear into the canoes. They made it around Point Distress (modern-day Point Ellice) where they established Station Camp, which would serve as their base of operations until November 24.<br /> <br /> Today, Cliff Point can be viewed from the Lewis and Clark Trail Highway (WA-401), approximately two miles southwest of Knappton, Washington. There is no marker at this location, but there is a pullout for vehicles on the harbor side of the road.",

Persevering through rain, hail, and snow, the fatigued expedition struggled over steep mountainsides made nearly impassable by a plethora of fallen tim­ber. They ended the day “Encamped opposit a Small Island at the mouth of a branch on the right side of the river which is at this place 80 yads wide, Swift and Stoney, here we wer compelled to kill a Colt for our men & Selves to eat for the want of meat & we named the South fork Colt killed Creek, and this river we Call Flathead River.” The horsemeat was a welcome addition to the paltry food rations. Gass wrote, “none of the hunters killed any thing except 2 or 3 pheasants; on which, without a miracle it was impossible to feed 30 hungry men and upwards, besides some Indians. So Capt. Lewis gave out some portable soup, which he had along, to be used in cases of necessity. Some of the men did not relish this soup, and agreed to kill a colt; which they immediately did, and set about roasting it; and which appeared to me to be good eating.” </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">The Colt Killed Creek Campsite is located on the grounds of the Powell Ranger Station, within </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/nezperceclearwater/\">Clearwater National Forest</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">.

The space between them is covered with a flat roof, forming a large lobby that runs the length of the building.<br /><br />To the right of the entrance walkway is a landscape border filled with native plants. Flat stones with raised lettering identify many of the plants here, including choke cherry, mock orange, arrow-leaf balsamroot gray rabbit brush, snowberry and ponderosa pine. A nearby wayside sign tells us about the historic Columbia River Highway, the first scenic highway in the United States. Bypassed by Interstate Highway 84, sections of the old road are now preserved and open to automobile, foot and/or bicycle traffic. Further to the right of the museum, a paved walk winds through the grounds past historic structures and a wagon.<br /><br />On the left side of the entrance walk is a stone wall. Triangular in cross section, it is about 5 feet tall near the parking area, reducing to half that as the walk slopes up to the front doors. The wall forms a fountain, water pouring out from a slot running the length of the wall at the top and cascading down the rough sides into a trough at the bottom.<br /><br />The entrance leads into the long, high lobby area extending the length of the building, with rough stone walls on either side topped by a row of clerestory windows under the roofline. Large support pillars made of natural wood run along each wall. The back wall is solid windows, filling the space with natural light. The floor is covered with smooth, dark-colored tiles.<br /><br />The information desk is to your left as you enter.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Columbia Hills State Park is a Washington State Park located 6 miles east of Dallesport on SR 14 in Klickitat County. The park occupies 3,338 acres on Horsethief Lake, an impoundment of the Columbia River, and was created in 2003 with the merger of Horsethief Lake State Park and Dalles Mountain Ranch. It also includes Horsethief Butte and Crawford Oaks, both popular hiking areas. Horsethief Lake section of the Columbia Hills Historical State Park is a National Historic Site.</p> <p>Located on the site of a former Native American village, Columbia Hills State Park is along the rolling hills of the Columbia River Gorge, with nearly two miles of freshwater shoreline on the Columbia River. This made it the perfect stopping point for the Lewis and Clark expedition on their way to the coast. A group of significant Native American pictographs and petroglyphs are located in this area of the park. The Temani Pesh-Wa exhibit is open daily for self-guided viewing. The world-famous Tsagaglalal, (She Who Watches) and other pictographs and petroglyphs can be viewed by making a reservation to participate in a regularly scheduled ranger-led tour (see Interpretive Opportunities on website for registration instructions).</p> <p>Across Highway 14 from the main part of Columbia Hills State Park, Horsethief Butte dominates the skyline, standing over Horsethief lake like an ancient castle. The lake itself is enormous, flooded into existence by the construction of The Dalles Dam. Lupine and balsamroot bloom in mid-April, making spectacular fields of purple and gold. Songbirds flit about, while larger birds of prey — like eagles and falcons — soar on air currents high above your head.</p> <p>The commission combined the park with Dalles Mountain Ranch and renamed the area Columbia Hills State Park in 2003. Now, in addition to the more than 12 miles of hiking trails in the area, visitors can enjoy swimming, freshwater fishing, bird watching and wildlife viewing, sailboarding, and playing horseshoes. Rock climbers also frequent this park. Dalles Mountain is known for the spectacular wildflower displays in the spring.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "There are many different sights in this state park sprawling over 3,338 acres. Set within rolling hills and plentiful green and tan bushy prairies, Columbia Hills has a rich history to discover. Mostly red pictographs and petroglyphs were drawn by native Americans who inhabited the area are scattered throughout the rocks and stones along the Columbia River. Across the way, Horsethief Butte, a tall, flat-topped, and steep hill, dominates the skyline being approximately 500 feet tall. The butte overlooks the enormous Horsethief Lake, encompassing over 90 acres.",

Stroll up a gently curving 150-foot ramp to the bird blind, constructed of sustainably harvested, durable black locust wood.</p> <p>From this quiet spot, you can view birds and wildlife that inhabit the area today as you learn about the flora and fauna–some of which are now extinct, endangered or threatened–that existed here 200 years ago. The artwork serves as a lasting reminder of the impact humans have had on the environment and a model for a new way to envision the connection between people and the natural world.</p> <p>The site was formally dedicated August 23, 2008, with more than 500 people attending.</p> <h4>The Bird Blind</h4> <p>A 1.2-mile trail, built primarily by volunteers, leads from the parking lot to Maya Lin’s elliptical bird blind. The wood used to build the bird blind comes from the black locust tree, a long-lasting, sustainable hardwood that is considered invasive in the Northwest. Using locally harvested black locust for this project supports efforts to eradicate the tree from native forests and reinforces the Confluence Project’s goal of promoting sustainability. The vertical wooden slats of the bird blind are inscribed with the name and current status of each of the 134 species Lewis and Clark noted on their westward journey.</p> <h4>Project Partners</h4> <p>The Sandy River Delta site was built by James E. John Construction, of Vancouver, and Krekow Jennings Inc., of Seattle. Other key partners include the Oregon Department of Transportation, which built a new, safer deceleration lane at Exit 18 on westbound Interstate 84; the U.S. Forest Service, who owns the land at the site; and the Oregon National Guard, who built a new parking lot at the site as part of a training mission.</p> <h4>Directions to Sandy River Delta</h4> <p>The Sandy River Delta is just north of I-84 off Exit 18. Driving east, exit the freeway and turn right at the T, go under the overpass and enter the park at the sign. If you’re driving west on I-84, take Exit 18 and take an immediate right. At the parking lot, look for the gravel path marked “Confluence.” Follow the path for 1.2 miles to reach the Bird Blind.</p> <h4>About Confluence</h4> <p>Confluence connects you to the history, living cultures, and ecology of the Columbia River system through Indigenous voices. We are a community-supported nonprofit that works through six art landscapes, educational programs, and public gatherings in collaboration with northwest tribes, communities, and the celebrated artist Maya Lin.

The information in the story circles comes from tribal stories, Lewis and Clark’s journals, Yakama elder and Sahaptin speaker Virginia Beavert, Ph.D., and the natural history of this site, which has been a gathering place for Native people for more than 10,000 years.</p> <h4>Timeline</h4> <p>The formal dedication of the site happened on Friday, August 27, 2010. The dedication was highlighted by tribal, local and civic speeches, music, and prose.

Their journey’s endpoint is where Confluence’s work began, with an installation that draws together the site’s bay side and ocean side, interweaving the stories of the Corps of Discovery expedition and the Chinook people in a single, steadily unfolding experience.</p> <p>Visit the site today to find a restored native landscape that integrates artist Maya Lin’s artwork with the site’s shifting cultural and ecological history. As you walk along oceanfront dunes, read excerpts from Lewis and Clark’s journals and see the Pacific Ocean as they saw it. Run your hands along the smooth surface of a fish-cleaning table formed from a single block of native basalt and inscribed with a Chinook creation story. Follow a path of crushed oyster shells inland from the coastal forest, and read the text of a Chinook song of praise along the way. Encounter a group of five cedar driftwood columns surrounding a cedar tree trunk that existed before Lewis and Clark arrived.</p> <p>Confluence’s Cape Disappointment site is complete and was dedicated on May 7, 2006. Two self-guided tours are available.</p> <h4>Waikiki Beach Self-Guided Tour:</h4> <p><strong>1. Cedar Circle </strong><br /> In a secluded grove, cedar driftwood columns surround a cedar tree trunk that predates Lewis and Clark’s arrival.</p> <p><strong>2. Amphitheater and Walkway</strong></p> <p>From the existing amphitheater, a path of crushed oyster shells leads you from the coastal forest environment through dune grasses to a secluded grove. As you walk, read the lyrics of a Chinook praise song that was recited at this site on November 18, 2005, the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark’s arrival.</p> <p><strong>3. Boardwalk</strong></p> <p>Along one of several trails at the site, learn about Lewis and Clark’s 4,133-mile journey from St. Louis to the Pacific in their own words. Read text from their journals inscribed in a boardwalk that leads from an existing amphitheater to Waikiki Beach.</p> <h4>Baker Bay Self-Guided Tour</h4> <p><strong>1. Fish Cleaning Table</strong></p> <p>Cut from a single polished block of native basalt, this artistic fish-cleaning table is inscribed with a Chinook origin legend that tells the story of the interdependence of the Chinook people and the Columbia River’s salmon.</p> <p><strong>2. Overlook</strong></p> <p>A simple, curved viewing platform offers an unobstructed view of Baker Bay and its surroundings. Text from the Lewis and Clark journals etched into the surface of the platform evokes the scene and moment they finally arrived at their destination.</p> <p>Confluence connects you to the history, living cultures, and ecology of the Columbia River system through Indigenous voices. We are a community-supported nonprofit that works through six art landscapes, educational programs, and public gatherings in collaboration with northwest tribes, communities, and the celebrated artist Maya Lin.

As Pat Courtney Gold (who is Wasco) said 200 years after Lewis and Clark came through, “There’s roughly 50-some independent sovereign nations and we were all connected by the Columbia River. We had one of the largest Native trade routes in the entire United States.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{b6b77320-5ba5-4930-a3a5-5e94f4a7ab23}{181}\" paraid=\"1601563774\">Lewis and Clark realized that they could benefit from this densely populated area.

They asked about the rivers—about their widths, their depths, their lengths and about the people who lived along and traveled on them. This was part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-and-clark-enter-into-louisiana-purchase.htm\">colonial goals of their journey</a>, since American leaders wanted to know who to trade with and where to establish settlements. </p> <p paraeid=\"{184e454e-ca6d-423e-b1cf-274d4ba84db7}{106}\" paraid=\"1744515370\">Their hosts knew these rivers well and shared their experiences with the visitors. A Yakama leader drew a map of the confluences of the Snake, Yakima, and Columbia Rivers for Clark. Clark then used this map to draw his own sketch of the rivers. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

They would travel to their family’s regular fishing spot when the salmon were running, or when the weather was too frigid in the high country. For Sahaptian-speaking residents of the Columbia River Plateau, including the Umatilla, Cayuse, Yakama, and Walla Walla people, fishing for salmon was and is a way of life and of obtaining sustenance. It was and continues to be spiritually and culturally important.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{76a12922-2f99-481d-b9ff-92c82cd3f84a}{35}\" paraid=\"559552909\">William Clark’s sketch of the confluence of the Walla Walla and Columbia Rivers noted so many times the “lodges of Indians fishing.” The expedition passed through at a time when the salmon were swimming upstream—everyone was down at their fishing spot. Bobbie Conner, director of the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, explained,  </p> <p paraeid=\"{76a12922-2f99-481d-b9ff-92c82cd3f84a}{83}\" paraid=\"1047980918\">Sahaptian-speaking people fishing here welcomed these distant visitors. Many probably knew the Nez Perce men, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/weippe-watkuweis.htm\">Walamottinin (Twisted Hair) and Tetoharsky</a>, who were traveling with them. They sold the visitors dogs—dozens of dogs that the expedition members then killed and ate. The locals wondered why these men would rather eat dogs than the delicious salmon that were spawning. </p> <p paraeid=\"{76a12922-2f99-481d-b9ff-92c82cd3f84a}{165}\" paraid=\"1682703636\">On the party’s journey upstream the following year, another man who lived in the region and knew the river well accompanied the travelers. In exchange for the ride, he helped the party decide which villages to visit. Communities on the river looked very different in April 1806 than they had in October 1805, but more salmon were about to arrive, and things would soon change yet again.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{76a12922-2f99-481d-b9ff-92c82cd3f84a}{209}\" paraid=\"599661234\">The travelers first met Yelépt, a Wallulapum leader in 1805. He hosted the party for several days at his village on the visitors’ journey downstream in the fall and then upstream in the spring. They socialized, sang, danced, and rested. They traded canoes and horses and Yelépt helped them prepare for the upstream journey.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{668f12b7-67b6-411a-87a2-80460054d273}{7}\" paraid=\"1910529062\">Fishing for salmon along the Columbia has long been a way of life for Indigenous people of the Columbia River Plateau. That continues to this day, despite <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/celilo-falls-oregon.htm\">the dams</a> that have made it harder for the salmon to make their way upstream.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Clark, who was traveling on foot, passed above the bluffs and did not view them.<br /> <br /> Located nearly a mile east of the city of Townsend, the distinctive bluffs are an exposure of Pre-Cambrian Greyson Shale. By the late-1990s the scenic quality of the natural features was increasingly threatened by encroaching real estate development. A preservation effort led by the <a href=\"http://www.crimsonbluffs.org/\">Crimson Bluffs Chapter of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation</a> culminated in the 2002 acquisition of a 50-acre parcel of land encom­passing the bluffs by the Bureau of Land Management. Crimson Bluffs is open to the public and may be accessed via foot traffic or viewed by boat from the river. There is a small parking area off River Road, with a footpath that is about one-third of a mile leading to an overlook of the bluffs.",

Prosperous in the mid 19th century, the town served as a key transportation destination along the Missouri River. In the mid 20th century, the area was identified as having high potential for the development of wildlife. The DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge was officially established on March 12, 1958. In the Lewis and Clark expedition, the DeSoto River Bend served as the location of the captains’ campgrounds during their first meeting with the Native Americans at Council Bluff.<br /> <br /> The Boyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge, named after the Boyer Chute that crosses through the middle of the Refuge, was created in 1992. The Boyer Chute had originally been blocked off in 1937 in an attempt to simplify the path for boat travel, to the detriment of the chute’s native species. The Refuge’s mission is to preserve the habitats of various wildlife and aquatic species that reside in the area.<br /> <br /> Today, The Boyer Chute and DeSoto National Wildlife Refuges are managed jointly. The refuges provide opportunities for fishing, hunting, wildlife viewing, photography, education, and self-guided tours. The DeSoto Visitor Center features the Bertrand Steamboat Museum, which displays the remaining cargo found from the sunken Bertrand Steamboat of the 1860s.",

The following day Lewis wrote, “This morning early we passed over and formed a camp on the point formed by the junc­tion of the two large rivers. here in the course of the day I continued my observations […]. An interesting question was now to be determined; which of these rivers was the Missouri”. Most of the party believed the north branch to be the Missouri, because its water was the same muddy consistency as the rest of the Missouri. By contrast, the waters of the south branch ran clear. Lewis and Clark suspected this branch was the Missouri, as the clear water indicated it sprang from the mountains. Choosing the wrong course would, at the least, cost valuable time and damage morale. At the worst, it could have derailed the entire expedi­tion. To gain greater certitude, Lewis and Clark spent the next five days exploring both rivers. By June 8, they correctly determined the south branch to be the Missouri River. The expedition spent the following few days refitting equipment and caching supplies to be retrieved during the return trip. On July 28, 1806, Lewis reunited with part of the Corps several miles upstream on the Missouri River, following a skirmish with the Blackfeet two days prior. They then retrieved a cache left at the mouth of the Marias River.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/montana-dakotas/upper-missouri-river-breaks\">Decision Point</a>, owned and managed by the BLM, is located near the town of Loma.

A few hundred miles later, one of those streams splits yet again. That third stream seems small, not the main stream of the river. But the other two are sizable—which is the way to go? </p> <p paraeid=\"{e8ec9ece-0e26-4f4d-a5f4-449c9003a73a}{198}\" paraid=\"1754784101\">This is what the Lewis and Clark Expedition faced when they reached the confluence of the Missouri and Marias Rivers—the place later called “Decision Point.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{e8ec9ece-0e26-4f4d-a5f4-449c9003a73a}{220}\" paraid=\"1736170308\">Meriwether Lewis and William Clark wanted to end up where Shoshone people lived. Lewis and Clark knew from their <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/knife-river-villages.htm\">Mandan and Hidatsa hosts</a> that Shoshone people knew an overland route across the Rocky Mountains. Lewis and Clark hoped that Shoshone people might be willing to sell them horses and guide them across the route.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{124b2c1e-52bb-425f-a3b6-2119757681b5}{37}\" paraid=\"1224844605\">Lewis had survey instruments and a British-made map, which the author had drawn from knowledge he learned from Blackfeet people. Several men in the Lewis and Clark Expedition had spent their lives on river boats and knew how water behaved. They could try to determine which stream was easier to boat on, or which stream went farther up the mountains. And Sacagawea had been here before and knew this river. </p> <p paraeid=\"{124b2c1e-52bb-425f-a3b6-2119757681b5}{105}\" paraid=\"134112449\">Lewis led a party up one stream, and Clark led a party up the other. Did the clear waters of the stream on the left indicate that it came from the mountains? Or did the muddy waters of the stream on the right that resembled those they had been traveling on mean that it was the way to go? </p> <p paraeid=\"{124b2c1e-52bb-425f-a3b6-2119757681b5}{127}\" paraid=\"1506238920\">Members of the expedition disagreed on which was the correct fork.

    "bodyText": "<h3>History</h3> Miserable and soaked to the skin, the Corps of Discovery had followed the shoreline of Grays Bay (Shallow Bay in the journals) for two days in an attempt to round modern day Point Ellice (Point Distress in the journals). At this point in their journey, they had run out of fresh food, and their clothes were quite literally rotting away. Getting around Point Ellice/Distress would have allowed them to meet up with one of the last trading ships of the season and refresh their supplies.<br /> <br /> What the Corps didn’t realize, however, was that it was about to run into some of the journey’s most treacherous moments. A fierce winter storm forced the Corps off the river on November 10, and pinned the group to a north shore cove consisting of little more than jagged rocks and steep hillside. Captain William Clark named the dreary spot “that dismal little nitch.” For six stormy days, the group was trapped by fierce wind and high waves at the rocky shoreline. For only the second time in the expedition, Clark said he was concerned for the safety of the Corps. <br /> <br /> It would be five days later, on November 15, that a break in the weather finally allowed the men to move forward. Once the wind and river calmed, Clark ordered the canoes loaded as quickly as possible and the Corps was able to make it around Point Ellice/Distress. They landed on a sandy beach where they established Station Camp. They missed the trading ship, but eventually achieved their exploration goals.<br /> <br /> In the following years this site became a fish receiving station to support a cannery operation, and later a ferry landing and train station. Eventually in 1968 and 1969 the Washington Department of Highways demolished the ferry landing and constructed the Megler Rest Area in its place. The Megler Rest Area was renamed the Dismal Nitch Rest Area in 2005. <h3>Today</h3> Located on SR 401, ten miles south of Naselle, Washington, visitors will find interpretive wayside exhibits about the expedition, as well as a short trail that leads to the approximate location of Lewis and Clark’s campsite. Great views of the Columbia River, birds, and the vibrant shipping lane are highlights of this site.<br /> <br /> Dismal Nitch<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> is a </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> on the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br />  ",

Their buffalo robes and buckskins began to rot, even while they wore them. Their tents, blankets, and bedding were soaked, and they had “nothing to eate but dried fish pounded which we brought from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/celilo-falls-oregon.htm\">the falls</a>.”</p> <p paraeid=\"{872be0e9-5ccf-4e95-b915-cf60f358aa6a}{176}\" paraid=\"1407841862\">Unable to navigate their canoes over the high swells of the river’s mouth, the Lewis and Clark Expedition got stuck here for five nights.

Even in this “dismal” spot, it was again the knowledge and infrastructure of Indigenous people that enabled Lewis and Clark to survive. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0e37462a-c1fc-4219-b0d5-c91ad1a47b31}{61}\" paraid=\"1195659043\">To this day, special river pilots navigate boats through this dangerous stretch of the Columbia River.

S. and the upper of the 6 Villages the Mandans occupied about 25 years ago this village was entirely cut off by the Sioux & one of the others nearly, the Small Pox distroyed great Numbers.” The abandoned site documented by Clark – now known as Double Ditch – was another ancient Mandan earthlodge village that had been occupied for nearly 300 years until the ravages of the 1781-1782 smallpox epidemic. Although called Double Ditch, the site actually features evidence of four concentric ditches. The ditches were part of defensive perimeters. The earliest settlement, established circa 1350 CE, is estimated to have contained about 160 lodges and 2,000 families. It occupied an approximately 22-acre area. As the population subsequently diminished, the village contracted and smaller defensive perimeters were built. The fourth and final settlement at Double Ditch – established sometime in the 1700s – was reduced to only about four acres in size. <br /> <br /> The <a href=\"http://www.history.nd.gov/historicsites/doubleditch/index.html\">Double Ditch Historic Site</a> is located along the east bank of the Missouri River about seven-and-a-half miles north of Bismarck. It is publicly accessible, featuring walkways and interpretive signage. The archeo-logical remains of earthlodges, refuse mounds, and fortification ditches are clearly discernable.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr8ZbAHuRpM&feature=youtu.be\">Double Ditch animation</a>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Double Ditch Indian Village is an archaeological site located seven and one-half miles north of Bismarck, ND. For nearly 300 years (from approximately AD 1490 – 1785), this site was the location of a large earthlodge village inhabited by the Mandan Indians. According to Mandan oral history, Double Ditch was one of seven to nine villages simultaneously occupied near the mouth of the Heart River. The Mandan population in this area probably totaled 10,000 or more during this time. The earthlodge villages were centers of trade between the Mandans, their nomadic neighbors, and later, Euroamerican traders. A massive smallpox epidemic swept the interior of North America about 1781-1782. This catastrophe was apparently responsible for the abandonment of Double Ditch and all the other Mandan villages near the Heart River. The Mandans had moved to new villages farther upriver. People of Mandan Indian ancestry live today throughout much of the Northern Great Plains. As one of the Three Affiliated Tribes, the Mandan tribal headquarters are at Fort Berthold Reservation, North Dakota.</p> <p>The Mandans built dome-shaped houses of logs and earth, known as earth-lodges. All that remains of the earthlodges on the surface are circular depressions. The men usually decided how large an earthlodge would be, and the women did most of the building. To build an earthlodge, a wooden framework was erected, then covered with layers of willow branches, grass, and finally, earth. It took about 150 trees to build one earthlodge. Earthlodges typically were 35 to 45 feet in diameter, although they varied from 20 to 65 feet, and housed a family of eight to twenty people.</p> <p>The Mandans are one of the best-known agricultural tribes of the Missouri Valley region. The Missouri River valley provided water, food, and shelter for the Mandans. Abundant timber and game could be found in the wooded bottomlands, and bison flourished on the surrounding prairie grasslands. The terrace-edge settings of the villages offered access to garden land and abundant timber as well as extensive views up and down the valley. The Mandans developed a rich and elaborate culture based on farming and bison hunting. Farming produced a large surplus of food which could be stored for use during leaner times and traded to nomadic, non-farming groups. Principal crops include corn, beans, and squash. Sunflowers and tobacco also were grown.</p> <p>In the archaeological record the dominant role of bison, hunted for their hides and meat, is evident. Other animals also were hunted and trapped, including pronghorns, deer, wolves, rabbits, beavers, muskrats, porcupines, foxes, mink, badgers, and bobcats. A diverse variety of birds (waterfowl, hawks and eagles, grouse, cranes, owls, woodpeckers, crows, ravens, and small songbirds) and fishes (sturgeons, gars, mooneyes, pikes, suckers, catfishes, and cods) are represented in the archaeological record. These animals all contributed to the subsistence of the villagers. Each supplied an important source of bone for tools and ornaments, as well as being tapped for their hides, furs, and plumage.</p> <p>Fortification systems consisted of a deep moat and a wall of wooden posts that formed a palisade. Natural features, such as steep terrain and riverbanks, also were used for added protection. Fortification systems attest to the fierce warfare between villagers and surrounding nomadic tribes that is reported in early historic records.</p> <p>The raised areas around the village are midden mounds or earthen mounds ranging from one to ten feet high. There are more than 30 mounds surrounding the village. The oldest mounds, dating to AD 1550-1650, occur directly atop Ditches 3 and 4. Excavations showed some mounds to be accumulations of household refuse – animal bones, broken pottery, and ash from hearths – carried and dumped in huge heaps. Other mounds were composed partially or entirely of fill excavated from elsewhere in the village, clearly indicating that those mounds were intentionally constructed. During one phase of occupation, the village defense involved a combination of Ditch 2, which lacked bastions, and several large mounds placed as strong points just inside the ditch.</p>",

Clark marveled at the “inoumerable rocks of emence Sise out at a great distance from the Shore and against which the Seas brak with great force [and] gives this Coast a most romantic appearance.” He also noted a “village of 5 Cab­ins on the Creek which I shall call E co-la or whale Creek.” Unfortunately, the whale was “pillaged of every valuable part” and “noting more than the Sceleton.” At the village, Clark “purchased some oile and about 120 w of Blubber after rendered, finding they would not trade I Deturmined to return home with what we have.” On the journey back to Fort Clatsop, an attempt to rob and kill Hugh McNeal was thwarted.

    "bodyText": "<h3>Overview</h3> <p>Located an hour west of Portland, Oregon between Seaside and Cannon Beach, Ecola State Park stretches along 9 miles of coastline and offers outstanding sightseeing and recreation opportunities, as well as a look into the history of the area. Breathtaking scenery and hiking may be the main allure, but Ecola also provides opportunities for picnicking, tidepooling, surfing and wildlife observation. </p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Captain William Clark and 12 members of the Corps of Discovery traveled through what is now the park in 1806 in search of a beached whale near present-day Cannon Beach.  Within the park you'll find a strand of shoreline now called Indian Beach, which was once home to several Tillamook villages. When passing through on January 8, 1806, William Clark’s guide pointed out these village to the explorer. In his journal, Clark describes them, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>“… from this point of View my guide pointed to a village at the mouth fo a Small river near which place he Said the whale was, he also pointed to 4 other places where the princpal Villages of the <em><a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tillamook%20Indians\">Kil la mox</a> </em>were Situated, I could plainly See the houses of 2 of those Villeges & the Smoke of a 3rd which was two far of for me to disern with my naked eye— <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-08#n27010809\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> after taking the Courses and computed the Distances in my own mind, I proceeded on down a Steep decent to a Single house the remains of an old <em><a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?lc_native_nation_ss=Tillamook%20Indians\">Kil a mox</a> </em>Town <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-08#n27010810\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> in a nitch imediately on the Sea Coast, at which place great no. of eregular rocks are out and the waves comes in with great force…\"</p> </blockquote> <p>After scaling the north slope of Tillamook Head and reaching one of its viewpoints, Clarke described the vista as “… the grandest and most pleasing prospects which my eyes ever surveyed…”</p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>The park’s network of trails include an 8 mile segment of the Oregon Coast Trail, and a 2 1/2 mile historical interpretive route called the Clatsop Loop Trail. Part of the Clatsop Loop Trail and the trail over Tillamook Head follow in the footsteps of the Corps of Discovery. <br /> <br /> Entrance into the park requires an entrance fee or park pass. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=136\">Ecola State Park - Oregon State Parks</a>.</p>",

Sergeants served as a link in the military expedition’s chain of command. Privates could not communicate directly with Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. They reported to their squad sergeant, who then conveyed the information to the captains. Each squad was also responsible setting up camp and cooking for its members. </p> <p paraeid=\"{516d6f4a-2779-4325-96df-532419b52288}{76}\" paraid=\"1132379308\">Two days after Floyd’s death, Clark ordered a vote to select a new sergeant for the second squad. Three men stood out for promotion: William Bratton, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-kaskaskia.htm\">Patrick Gass</a>, and George Gibson. The journals do not provide details about what was said during election proceedings, but Gass won by an overwhelming nineteen of twenty-seven <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-vote-at-station-camp.htm\">possible votes </a>(York, who was enslaved by Clark, was likely not allowed to vote).  </p> <p paraeid=\"{516d6f4a-2779-4325-96df-532419b52288}{116}\" paraid=\"1880676778\">Gass’s sense of humor and straight talk may have been an attraction for the men.

The river falls twenty-six feet in 2.5 miles, enough to make a canoe descent tumultuous at high water and impossible at low water.106 In 1805, Josiah Espy described the falls viewed from Clarksville as a “zigzag channel which is only navigable at high water.” <br /> <br /> People who regularly traveled the busy Ohio River—whether French, American, Shawnee, Haudenosaunee, or Delaware—knew how to get around these rapids. They knew when the water was high enough to take a boat or canoe over them and when they needed to carry their vessels around the waterfalls (known as a <a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/portage-route.htm\">portage</a>).  <br /> <br /> William Clark’s family had <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/falls-of-the-ohio-old-clarksville-site.htm\">settled near these falls</a>. Here he met up with Meriwether Lewis here to begin their transcontinental journey.<br /> <br /> The falls no longer look like they once did. Private interests constructed a canal and locks south of the falls starting in 1825, to improve navigation on the river. The federal government later enlarged the canal and added additional dams, so that by 1964, dams made the river no longer navigable at this point: all traffic had to go through the canal.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

The Society was founded on May 15, 1884, by ten men, mostly amateur historians based in Louisville, led by Reuben T. Durrett.

The mansion boasts its own historical significance and is a stunning showcase of Beaux-Arts architecture, a style characterized by order, symmetry, and extensive decorative detail. It later served as a funeral home and passed through two more owners before being purchased and renovated by the Filson Historical Society.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{be2c73cd-e4dd-4828-b8f2-bdd27afa8c8e}{169}\" paraid=\"259932834\">According to the Society, its mission is “to collect, preserve, and tell the significant stories of Kentucky and Ohio Valley history and culture.” Their many collections of photographs, manuscripts, books, and artifacts represent a period that spans more than 230 years. Included among them are six original letters written by William Clark and one original letter written by Meriwether Lewis, all transcribed during their 1803-1806 expedition. Several related documents include a diary by Clark’s brother, Jonathan Clark, and a prospectus by Lewis detailing the official expedition history. Artifacts and portraits of the explorers and their kin are also included in the collection.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{be2c73cd-e4dd-4828-b8f2-bdd27afa8c8e}{173}\" paraid=\"1341187474\">Several physical and virtual resources are available for research purposes and are regularly utilized by guests from all over the world. The staff is very knowledgeable and available for assistance and private tours. The Filson Society helps edit the peer-reviewed journal, Ohio Valley History, and also publishes a seasonal news magazine, The Filson, with articles written by staff and volunteers to aid in community outreach. Educational events and discussions are held regularly for the public, and rooms within the charming Ferguson Mansion are available to rent for special events and gatherings.

Such knowledge was necessary so that the American representatives could establish a precedent that all occupants of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-and-clark-enter-into-louisiana-purchase.htm\">Louisiana Territory</a> were under the rule of the United States. The captains gave medals with Jefferson’s likeness on them to Indigenous leaders they met, to establish that new colonial relationship.</p> <p paraeid=\"{699d0e65-0101-49ba-88ac-9fc392167d44}{136}\" paraid=\"1631195998\">While out hunting on July 28, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/profile-of-george-drouillard.htm\">George Drouillard</a> met a Missouria man named Op-Po-Hom-Mon-Ne (Buck Elk Walking). He told Drouillard of a nearby village but said the majority of its residents were out hunting bison, including its leaders, We ‘ar ruge nor (Little Thief) of the Otoe and Chon ga ton ga (Big Horse) of the Missouria.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{699d0e65-0101-49ba-88ac-9fc392167d44}{228}\" paraid=\"1967834762\">When Drouillard relayed this to Lewis and Clark, they sent La Liberté, a French engagé who spoke the Otoe language, with Buck Elk Walking to invite Missouria and Otoe leaders to a council. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a89454bb-7605-4a31-92e7-730758662897}{5}\" paraid=\"1353685219\">At sunset on August 2, a group of twelve Missouria and Otoe people arrived at the expedition’s camp. Among them was Big Horse, who had returned from the bison hunt. The formal council began on August 3. Lewis and Clark had ordered a makeshift pavilion set up on a tall bluff rising seventy feet above the Missouri River. From the top, they “observed the most butifull prospects imagionable.” They saw expanses of grassy prairie, groves of cottonwood in the bottomlands, and the river meandering through it all. From this vantage, the two delegations exchanged speeches. Lewis informed their guests of the transfer of land—their land?!—from France to the United States. He explained the “wishes of our government to Cultivate friendship & good understanding.” He gave the leaders of the delegation peace medals and invited them to send envoys to Washington, DC. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a89454bb-7605-4a31-92e7-730758662897}{65}\" paraid=\"481792242\">The historical record provides few clues to what Big Horse and the other Missouri and Otoe leaders may have thought about the meeting. They had held many diplomatic meetings with people of European descent before. Lewis and Clark’s grandiose language of U.S. sovereignty might have seemed like just a shift in trading partners, as had happened many times before among the White people. And so, Big Horse and the others “made Some verry Sensable Speeches,” were kind to their guests, and then moved on with their lives.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Convincing the wary Shoshone to return across the continental divide with him and then assist the expedi­tion in portaging over Lemhi Pass proved to be a tremendous test of Lewis’ skillful diplomacy. However, it was Sacagawea’s joyful reunion with her brother Cameahwait that cemented the trust and goodwill between the two groups. Subsequently, Lewis and Clark were able to barter for 29 or 30 horses to transport all of their supplies through the mountains. They also secured the services of a guide, whom they nick­named “Old Toby.” The Corps of Discovery departed Cameahwait’s Shoshone camp on August 30.<br /> <br /> The First Flag Unfurling Site is a five-acre National Register-listed property located on BLM land adjacent to the Salmon-Challis National Forest. A historical marker and interpretive wayside exhibit are located next to a pull-off on NF-185, also known as Warm Springs Road. Despite the name and designation, there is no sup­porting evidence that this was the actual site Lewis unfurled the flag. However, it provides a good overview of the terrain and general area occupied by the Shoshone and traversed by the expedition.<br />  ",

The village was a permanent settlement, and its residents relied upon fishing, hunting, and crops. After a smallpox epidemic in 1781 wiped out a large portion of the villagers, the site was abandoned. When Meriwether Lewis and William Clark came upon the ruins in 1804, they were already heavily deteriorated.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{6044c3d7-831f-48e4-9dc8-182e048f3815}{186}\" paraid=\"276269584\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In June 1872, the U.S. Military established an infantry post near the ruins called Fort McKeen, but it was renamed Fort Abraham Lincoln a few months later.

Tribal representatives finally arrived on the evening of August 2, and council was held throughout the following day. Recognizing the strategic value of the location, Clark wrote, “The Situation of this place which we Call Council Bluff which is handsom ellevated a Spot well Calculated for a Tradeing establishment, the Bank high & leavel on top well Calculated for a fort to Command the Countrey and river the low bottom above high water & well Situated under the Command of the Hill for Houses to trade with the Natives a butifull Plain both abov and below at no other bend on either Side does the High land touch the river for Some distance up, as I am told.” <br /> <br /> In 1819, <a href=\"http://outdoornebraska.gov/fortatkinson/\">Fort Atkinson</a> was established at the site of Council Bluff. As the first U.S. military post west of the Missouri River, it was a gateway to the fur trade in the Upper Missouri and Rocky Mountains. The fort’s strategic importance eventually dwindled and it was abandoned in 1827. By the 1850s, it had almost entirely deteriorated. In the 1950s, the <a href=\"https://history.nebraska.gov/\">Nebraska State Historical Society</a> completed archeological surveys to determine building sites. The <a href=\"http://outdoornebraska.gov/\">Nebraska Game and Parks Commission</a> acquired the property in 1971, and reconstructed the fort during the 1980s and 1990s. Currently, <a href=\"http://outdoornebraska.gov/fortatkinson/\">Fort Atkinson</a> is open to the public as a Nebraska state historical park.<br /> <br /> On July 30, 1804 the Corps set up camp at a site which later became known as Fort Atkinson. During their stay here hosted the first formal meeting between representatives of the U.S. government and western tribes. At sunset on August 2, a party of Otoe and a few Missouris arrived at the camp, and official meetings began after breakfast on August 3. The structure of the council would establish the routine for all subsequent councils on the expedition. Upon it’s conclusion, the explorers continued their journey up the river.<br /> <br /> Fort Atkinson was established officially established during the Yellowstone Expedition of 1819. Named after the Expedition’s commander, Col. Henry Atkinson, it was the U.S. military post west of the Missouri River. During it’s existence, between 1820 and 1827, it served as the first school and library in Nebraska. It was also a gateway to the fur regions of the Upper Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, and served as the starting point for several early expeditions to the Mexican settlements of Taos and Santa Fe. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"> </p>",

Situated just east of Fort Calhoun, NE, Fort Atkinson State Park educates visitors on the military and daily-life frontier experiences of the early 1800s.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{211bd93d-9e76-405f-949c-bc62e14ff99c}{150}\" paraid=\"4\">Established as a fort in 1820 at the recommendation of the Lewis & Clark expedition, Fort Atkinson remained a vital outpost for the United States military until 1827. Home to both “The Regulars” (the Sixth Infantry) and the elite Rifle Regiment (second regiment), visitors today can see actor demonstrations of military drills and the daily life of the early American soldier. In addition to reproduction uniforms, the actors utilize reproduction weapons of the Regulars and Rifle Regiment, offering visitors a near authentic experience.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{211bd93d-9e76-405f-949c-bc62e14ff99c}{160}\" paraid=\"6\">Among the fort’s reconstructed buildings are a school, a store, blacksmithing and tinsmith shops, and more! Visitors can watch modern day blacksmiths, coopers, carpenters, tinsmiths, spinners and weavers ply their trades before purchasing items they create at the Sutler (the fort store).  </p> <p paraeid=\"{211bd93d-9e76-405f-949c-bc62e14ff99c}{170}\" paraid=\"8\">For more information about times and dates when you can see reenactments and artisans at work, contact the park visitor center.

    "bodyText": "Fort Belle Fontaine is about 20 miles north of St. Louis, Missouri.  Built in 1805 under the direction of Lt. Col. Jacob Kingsbury, the fort was the first U.S. military installation west of the Mississippi River.  The trading fort was an important gathering place for officers and enlisted men; Native peoples; and French, Spanish and American settlers, trappers, and traders.  <br /> <br /> The original site of the Corps campsite and the first Fort Belle Fontaine have been destroyed by shifts in the Missouri River channel. The grounds below the bluff became a popular summer retreat during the late 1930s and in 1936 the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built a grand limestone staircase down from the bluff along with a number of other structures. Today, Fort Belle Fontaine Park is a 305-acre park of St. Louis County. <br /> <br /> Fort Belle Fontaine<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">is a </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> on the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">The expedition first camped on an island opposite Coldwater Creek on May 14, 1804.

The expedition visited the new fort on their return journey. On September 22, 1806, Ordway wrote that “towards evening we arived at Bell foun­tain a Fort or cantonement on South Side which was built since we ascended the Missouri & a handsome place. we moovd. a short distance below and Camped, the Company of Artillery who lay at this fort fired 17 Rounds with the field peaces the most of our party was Quartered in the Canonment.” The next day they returned to St. Louis. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">The original cantonment housed a government-operated trading post (or factory), until that function was transferred to Fort Osage and Fort Madison in 1808. By 1809, the post had deteriorated and relocation to a new site above a bluff began. The new Fort Belle Fontaine, completed in 1811, included 30 buildings, several blockhouses, a rectangular palisade, and an arsenal. In 1826, the second fort was abandoned and replaced by Jefferson Barracks, a new post located in St. Louis. The City of St. Louis acquired the Fort Belle Fontaine property in 1913 and built a detention home and training school for boys. In the 1930s the Work Progress Administration (WPA) built a “grand staircase” of stone steps from the riverbank to the top of the bluff, as well as trails and facilities.

    "bodyText": "<h3>History</h3> <p>Fort Clatsop was the winter encampment for the Corps of Discovery from December 1805 to March 1806. After finding a location that offered plenty of game and close proximity to the ocean, Clark sketched a preliminary site plan, and they began construction in early December. The fort was completed by January 1st and housed 32 men, one woman, a baby, and a dog. Joseph Whitehouse wrote that the officers named the fort \"after a nation of Indians who resided near us, called the Clatsop Nation.\" They spent the extremely rainy winter collecting supplies, making salt and leather, and preparing their maps and journals. <br /> <br /> After the expedition finally departed on March 23, 1806, Fort Clatsop gradually deteriorated. A reconstruction of the fort based on Clark's sketch was completed in 1955, but burned down in 2005.

They speak a Chinookan language and traded often with other people in villages up and down the river. Like other people living on the Lower Columbia River, they were expert <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/chinook-canoes.htm\">canoe-makers</a> and navigators.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e184b8cb-fa5a-4ab6-910c-f6720fa20407}{203}\" paraid=\"12631031\">Coboway was the leader of a Clatsop village located in what is now Fort Stevens State Park. In the winter of 1805, Coboway gave Meriwether Lewis and William Clark his blessing to build a house in the area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e184b8cb-fa5a-4ab6-910c-f6720fa20407}{241}\" paraid=\"1150225614\">Coboway and other Clatsop people visited and helped the expedition members many times during the winter of 1805–1806. They brought wapato, berries, fish, whale blubber, dogs, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/dismal-nitch-washington.htm\">otter skins</a>, cedar bark hats, and canoes to trade with the visitors in exchange for manufactured goods such as glass beads, files, razors, other tools, and thread. Sometimes Coboway stayed overnight, and Lewis showed off the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/lewis-s-air-gun.htm\">air gun</a> to him. Coboway and his friends also helped two of the expedition members, George Drouillard and Jean-Baptiste Lepage, carry the animals they hunted back to Fort Clatsop. </p> <p paraeid=\"{59296d9b-333c-45a8-8acd-4fa3a96fe73d}{114}\" paraid=\"1749108976\">Coboway was “the most friendly and decent” person in the area, wrote Lewis, after Coboway brought him a present of cured anchovies. </p> <p paraeid=\"{59296d9b-333c-45a8-8acd-4fa3a96fe73d}{144}\" paraid=\"2025549979\">Lewis knew they needed a new canoe for the journey home, and he had tried to buy one from Clatsop people. However, the items Lewis offered—including his fancy dress uniform—were not a sufficient trade for the valuable canoe.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{59296d9b-333c-45a8-8acd-4fa3a96fe73d}{168}\" paraid=\"1756275604\">Rather than offer more, Lewis directed his men to steal a canoe: “we yet want another canoe, and as the <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?lc_native_nation_ss=Clatsop%20Indians\">Clatsops</a> will not sell us one at a price which we can afford to give we will take one from them in lue of the six Elk which they stole from us in the winter.” But Coboway had already brought presents to make up for the stolen elk. </p> <p paraeid=\"{59296d9b-333c-45a8-8acd-4fa3a96fe73d}{205}\" paraid=\"1398587761\">And so, after all Coboway’s kindness and hospitality, Lewis and Clark broke the trust established through months of friendship and trade with Clatsop people and stole a canoe. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Chinook Point, the setting of this historic fort, is within the accustomed territory of the Chinook Indian Nation and is designated as a National Historic Landmark for its historical significance over three centuries. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark passed through this area as well on January 9<sup>th</sup>, 1806. <h3>Today</h3> <br /> Fort Columbia Historical State Park features a self-guided interpretive walk that details the area’s history, and visitors will find informational exhibits near the fort’s gun batteries. In addition to it's history, the area offers bird watching, miles of forested hiking trails, secluded beaches, wildlife viewing opportunities, and an interpretive center. Here, visitors will find exhibits focused on the history of Fort Columbia, including the area’s early exploration, fur trade, and western settlement. A pass is required to enter the park.<br /> <br /> For more information on the park or to download a park brochure, visit their website at <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/506/Fort-Columbia\">Fort Columbia Historical State Park</a>.",

    "audioDescription": "191 acres of rugged woodland situated at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers provides a contrast to the gently rolling surrounding farmlands. The park's trails, picnic areas and scenic overlooks provide visitors with ample opportunities to appreciate the local wildlife and lush vegetation, including hawthorn, plum, locust and many species of oak. In the spring, wildflowers like trillium, bloodroot, hepatica, and violets can be seen. There's also a small prairie with native grasses and flowers sitting atop a secluded knoll.",

    "bodyText": "In the fall of 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark traveled up the Mississippi River gathering information, supplies, and recruits. Lewis arrived at Fort Kaskaskia on November 29, where he sought recruits with a range of skills, from hunting to carpentry to blacksmithing. <br /> <br /> Indigenous communities that were part of the Illinois Confederation had hunted and farmed these lands for millennia. French settlers established a trading post at Kaskaskia in 1703, near an existing Illiniwek village, and then built an earthworks fort in 1759. The French officially ceded the land to the British in 1763, but French-speaking people remained. After the American Revolutionary War, the British transferred the Illinois Country, including Kaskaskia, to the United States. Indigenous people living here had not consented to these land transfers between colonial powers.  <br /> <br /> When Lewis arrived in 1803, the civilian population at Fort Kaskaskia was still largely French speaking, but the U.S. military controlled the fort. Many Shawnee, Delaware, and other Indigenous people lived nearby. <br /> <br /> Lewis recruited ten members of the Corps from Kaskaskia: John Boley, John Collins, John Dame, Patrick Gass, John Ordway, Ebenezer Tuttle, Peter Weiser, Isaac White, Alexander Hamilton Willard, and Richard Windsor. These men ranged in age from nineteen to thirty-two years old, and most were hired as laborers. Only two of the men were ranked higher than privates: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/patrick-gass-and-john-ordway.htm\">Ordway</a> was recruited as a sergeant. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/patrick-gass-and-john-ordway.htm\">Gass</a>, a carpenter, would be promoted from private to sergeant after the death of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sergeant-floyd-s-death.htm\">Charles Floyd</a>. <br /> <br /> Lewis also hired French and Métis engagés. (Métis is a term for Indigenous people who also have French or other European heritage, and engagés was a common name for river navigators in the North American fur trade, many of whom spoke French.) These engagés operated the boats that ferried new recruits up the Mississippi River to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/camp-dubois-illinois.htm\">Camp Dubois</a>. Some of these men stayed with the expedition to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-mandan.htm\">Fort Mandan</a>. Many of the men hired as engagés were of multicultural parentage, with French and Indigenous roots. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

Lewis wrote, “This place we have named Fort Mandan in honour of our Neighbours.” Clark “fixed on a place for to build a fort and Set to work.” As described by Gass, “the huts were in two rows, containing four rooms each, and joined at one end forming an angle. When rasied about 7 feet high a floor of puncheons or split plank were laid, and covered with grass and clay; which made a warm loft. The upper part projected a foot over and the roofs were made shed-fashion, rising from the inner side, and making the outer wall about 18 feet high. The part not inclosed by the huts we intended to picket. In the angle formed by the two rows of huts we built two rooms, for holding our provisions and stores.” The Corps stayed at this location until April 7, 1805. While there, they engaged in diplomacy with area tribes, made preparations for the next leg of the journey, and consolidated records and specimens that would go back downriver with the keelboat in the spring. Fort Mandan is also the site where Sacagawea and Charbonneau first joined the expedition.<br /> <br /> The historic site of Fort Mandan is located on privately-owned land along the northeast banks of the Mis­souri, about 12 miles west of the city of Washburn. The exact location is unknown and may be partially sub­merged by the river.

It is believed that Burr tried unsuccessfully to enlist Wilkinson's participation in a scheme to establish a nation west of the Alleghenies. In 1811, the New Madrid earthquake caused severe damage at the fort, but the damage was repaired and the fort became headquarters for the 24th Infantry. The fort was evacuated in 1814 and its garrison was moved to St. Louis.

With a rich history that stretches back well before the Revolutionary War, Fort Massac is the site where, in November 1803, the Corps of Discovery added George Drouillard to its expedition. The park is also the site where, in 1778, William Clark’s older brother, Colonel George Rogers Clark, led a Virginia militia regiment known as the “Long Knives” up through Massac Creek and into Illinois Territory, later taking the territory from the British. Today, an 8.8 mile trail named in honor of George Rogers Clark stretches from the nearby city of Metropolis, IL, through Fort Massac State Park, crossing over Massac Creek in the East of the park. <br /> <br /> While the original fort no longer stands, a replica was built in 2002, based on the 1802 fort constructed by Americans. Fort Massac became Illinois’ first state park on November 5, 1908, initially covering a mere 22 acres. Today, visitors can visit the park’s museum which boasts of myriad prehistoric objects on display. The park also offers various historic programs that cover the time period of the mid 18th century to the Civil War. Every October the park puts on the Fort Massac Encampment, a multi-day event in which visitors can see and interact with period performers. The family friendly event offers contemporary food, music, and educational reenactments to show visitors how early American pioneers, settlers, and the military conducted day to day life. Throughout the rest of the year, Fort Massac hosts “Living History” weekends for visitors (contact the park directly for further details). <br /> <br /> Campers can choose from tent camping, or vehicular camping sites. The 50 sites designated for vehicle camping include showers and electricity. In addition to the history and scenery, campers are also welcome to play 9 or 18 holes of disc golf on the park’s disc golf course.<br /> <br /> Hunters and anglers are welcome to the park. Check in with the park first for regulations. Hunting game includes squirrel, woodcock, deer, dove and rabbit. Fishing game includes bullhead, carp, catfish, crappie, drum and largemouth bass.<br /> <br /> When you visit the park, make sure to stop by the visitor center to see museum artifacts and collect information about the park and surrounding areas. Maps of trails and the park are available on the <a href=\"https://www2.illinois.gov/dnr/parks/pages/fortmassac.aspx\">park’s website</a>.<br />  ",

The building on the center-right has a lookout tower on the top and a small square window on the second floor. The building in the center has a chimney on the right side. The building at center-left sits at the corner of the fort’s wooden post fencing. It’s similar to the building at the center-right, minus the lookout tower and with two square windows cut into it. The fourth building on the left side appears similar to the building with the chimney, but with no chimney visible. The fort is surrounded by a brown, log fence and a second, larger fence stretches between the corner buildings of the fort. Two large wood poles stretch from the green grass at the bottom of the picture to the gray sky at the top.",

    "bodyText": "On the journey west to spend the winter at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/camp-dubois-illinois.htm\">Camp Dubois</a>, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark spent a few days at Fort Massac on the Ohio River. The French built the original fort in 1757, in an area where Chickasaw, Osage, and Shawnee people lived. In 1794, the U.S. military took it over and it became a stopping point for White American settlers moving west.  <br /> <br /> Here, Lewis and Clark sought men with a diversity of skills, including hunting and carpentry, to join their expedition. Language skills and cultural knowledge were especially important, since this was a diplomatic mission into Indigenous lands.  <br /> <br /> Two key members joined the party at Fort Massac: George Drouillard and Private Joseph Whitehouse. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/profile-of-george-drouillard.htm\">Drouillard</a>, whose father was French-Canadian and mother was Shawnee, was hired as an interpreter. He spoke Shawnee, French, English, and the sign language that was common among Indigenous communities and non-Native traders across North America.  <br /> <br /> Whitehouse, who was already enlisted in the U.S. Army, was stationed at Fort Massac. Like many people living in the area, his family moved west to Kentucky during the wave of White settlers displacing Indigenous people. Whitehouse learned valuable skills during his time in the Kentucky woods, including hunting, curing meat, and preparing hides. <br /> <br /> The expedition journals note many times when Whitehouse’s skills as a tailor and skin curer were useful to the crew. During the summer of 1805, Lewis tasked Whitehouse with preparing and sewing together elk skins for construction of his <a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/portage-route.htm\">iron-framed boat</a>.  <br /> <br /> Whitehouse was one of the only lower-ranking members of the expedition who was tasked with keeping a journal. In it, he often mentioned being asked to repair or make new clothing for the party. In Idaho, for example, he made caps from otter skins procured through trade.<br /> <br /> Both Drouillard and Whitehouse brought skills critical to the Lewis and Clark Expedition. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

The Corps of Discovery first passed through the area on June 23, 1804, although no mention regarding the site’s suitability for a fort was noted in the journals. At the time, Clark only documented an island that was then across the river from the later site of Fort Osage. However, when he returned in 1808 as a brigadier general in the Louisiana Territory militia and U.S. agent for Indian Affairs, Clark referenced his initial un­documented impression of the location, writing that he “examined the Situation and the points of a Small Island which is opposit, found the River could be completely defended and Situation elegant, this Situation I had examined in the year 1804 and was delighted with it and am equally so now, […] and fixed on the spot for the fort and other buildings.” In 1810, as Nicholas Biddle prepared the expedition journals for publica­tion, he interviewed and corresponded with Clark in order to elaborate on details within the text. Based on information provided by Clark at this time, the first edition of the journals, published in 1814, revised the original June 23, 1804 journal entry to insert the text: “Directly opposite on the south, is a high command­ing position, more than seventy feet above high-water mark, and overlooking the river, which is here but of little width; this spot has many advantages for a fort, and trading house with the Indians.” Following aban­donment in 1827, archeologists rediscovered the fort’s foundations in the 1940s. It was then reconstructed to portray the circa-1812 appearance.</p>",

Then, in 1908, an article published in the Kansas City Star prompted a decades-long effort to reclaim the fort, culminating in it being named a county park in 1941. Reconstruction of the fort was authorized in 1947, and the first Blockhouse was completed in 1948. Construction continued into the 1960s, with Fort Osage officially becoming a historical landmark in 1961. </p> <p paraeid=\"{aa907f5b-1bbc-4f58-900f-55522e24783d}{98}\" paraid=\"68\">Currently operated by Jackson County Parks & Recreation, Fort Osage provides an opportunity for visitors to tour the reconstructed site and experience living history. Each year, the Fort Osage Education Center provides educational programs to thousands of students. For more information, call 816-650-3278 or visit <a href=\"https://fortosagenhs.com/\">https://fortosagenhs.com/</a> </p>",

The expedition’s first introduction to the region was on the evening of Monday, September 24, 1804 when Lewis, Clark and their entourage of 43 men and three boats anchored at the mouth of what is now known as Bad River. This location today is Fischers Lilly Park in Fort Pierre. The consequent days which saw the expedition’s first interaction with the Lakota people, then known as the Teton Sioux, proved contentious. Challenges in communication and differing objectives led to what many believe was the closest the expedition came to ending. We know this today because much of the interaction was recorded in Captain Clark’s journal, including the following excerpt:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“and such curiosities as we thought might amuse them; in this we succeeded to well; for after giving them a quarter of a glass of whiskey, which they seemed to like very much, and sucked the bottle dry, it was with much difficulty that we could get rid of them. They at last accompanied Captain Clark on shore in a dugout canoe with five men; but it seems they had formed a design to stop us; for no sooner had the party landed that three of the Indians seized the cable of the dugout canoe, and one of the soldiers of the chief put his arms around the mast; the second chief, who was intoxicated, then said, that we should not go on, that they had not received presents enough from us…” </i></p> </blockquote> <p>Today, visitors can visit Fischers Lilly Park along with the thriving towns of Pierre and Fort Pierre, located on opposite sides of the Missouri River. The area is known for its political significance as capital of the state, high density of museums and historic sites, its plethora of outdoor recreation activities including fishing and water sports on the Missouri River, and hunting and bird watching in the Fort Pierre National Grassland and surroundings. </p>",

The original earthen fort was built to keep British and Confederate gunboats from entering the mouth of the Columbia River. <br /> <br /> After World War II, Fort Stevens was considered obsolete, and it was turned over to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for use as a headquarters in 1947. Then, in 1975, the site was officially designed a state park after being leased to Oregon State Parks.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Georgia, Times, \"Times New Roman\", serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Today</span><br /> Visitors can visit the historic Fort Stevens and Point Adams. The park’s visitor center and museum interpret the site’s long history. Tours through the old earthen fort and artillery gun batteries are also available. Those with a passion for the outdoors will enjoy the golf course, fishing, 15 miles of multi-use trails, and access to Coffenbury Lake for swimming and boating. Picnic tables are available on a first-come-first-served basis.<br /> <br /> There are several camping options available in one of the countries largest public campgrounds. All campsites are ADA accessible and come equipped with a picnic table and grill. Yurts and cabins are also available for rent. Restrooms, showers, a playground, and a dump station are on site.<br /> <br /> A day-use pass is required for entrance.

It was located just north of present Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and was not a military fort, but rather a stockade to control the trade with the Kansa and Osage Indians and perhaps to promote trade with the Spanish to the southwest.<br /> <br /> According to the Frontier Army Museum at Fort Leavenworth, the log structure was 80-feet square, with protective extensions at each corner. Inside the fort was the commandant’s house, the guard house, and a powder and traders’ house. It’s believed the post population totaled about 40 people, consisting of the commandant, about 10 French soldiers, and the traders and their families.<br /> <br /> Today, a plaque marks the likely area of the fort site, about three miles northwest of Fort Leavenworth.  It mentions Lewis and Clark visiting the abandoned fort, but nothing is written in the July 2, 1804 journal entries about the Captains crossing the river and actually visiting the remains.",

Visitors will quickly notice the quality and authenticity of all of the restorations, as the fort has been steadily improved upon with painstaking detail since the 1920s. One would hardly know that they weren’t in France!</p> <p>History lovers will be able to gather during the trade fair, where craftspeople sell reproductions of period crafts and people play historic games, as well as events like demonstrations of 18th century cannons and a popular New Year’s Eve celebration.

Today, it is the oldest active military installation west of the Mississippi River. The fort’s first artifact collection was started in 1938 after the closure of the its wagon shop. The “Old Rolling Wheels Museum” was established to house the wagons, which were then relocated to the museum. For the next two decades, the museum expanded its collection to include other forms of military paraphernalia, mainly focusing on items related to Fort Leavenworth and the Frontier Army that was once posted in American frontier settlements during the 19th century. It was officially declared an Army Museum in 1960.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{898f3916-fa23-4d9e-a8f0-c39bee405cd9}{92}\" paraid=\"7\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Today, the museum displays over seven thousand items, including vehicles, weapons, and various other pieces of equipment. Admission to the museum is free and in-person tours are available. Visitors looking to take home souvenirs will enjoy the Fort Leavenworth Historical Society’s gift shop inside the museum. The organization “Friends of the Frontier Army Museum” hosts events throughout the year to promote engagement with the museum and raise money for the museum’s development.<br /> <br /> For more information, call (913) 684-3186. For access on to the post, contact the Visitor Control Center (913) 684-3600.</p>",

On the Missouri River, not far from present day Helena, the hardy members of the Lewis and Clark expedition toiled to move upstream. Rock embankments made towing from shore impossible, and the deep channel forced the men to row rather than pole their boats forward.</p> <p>Suddenly, there loomed before them towering rock formations unlike any they had ever seen. From both sides of the river, limestone cliffs rose to a spectacular height of 1200 feet. “In many places,” wrote Meriwether Lewis, “the rocks seem ready to tumble on us.” At each bend in the waterway, great stone walls seemed to block passage, only to open like gentle giant gates as the expedition drew near. In his journal, Meriwether wrote: “I shall call this place: “GATES OF THE MOUNTAINS“.</p> <p>The name stuck, and for nearly two centuries travelers have ventured down this stretch of the Missouri to marvel at its natural wonders. Today, most visitors enjoy the beauty of the Gates of the Mountains from aboard a tour boat – the “Canyon Voyager” or the “Sacajawea” (named after the only women and indigenous person on the Expedition). Aboard a comfortable open-air boat (covered in case of rain), you’ll glide through magnificent country Meriwether Lewis would still recognize if he could return.</p> <p>Great towering walls of limestone still stand guard over the river. Bighorn sheep and Mountain Goats scamper in the rocks high above the water. Ospreys, eagles (bald and golden), vultures and falcons (peregrine and prairie) still soar on the updrafts. The canyon is also home to otters, deer, squirrels, ermine, beaver, mountain lions, black bears and other wild creatures. The life list for bird species is over 120 right now.</p> <p>From the vessel you can see Mann Gulch, the site of the raging forest fire that killed 13 smokejumpers, August 5, 1949. This tragedy was the main subject matter of Norman Maclean’s book “Young Men and Fire”. The story of Mann Gulch is one of the more interesting stories told by the guide and pilot.</p> <p>Near Mann Gulch the pilot will hug the shoreline to give you a look at Indian pictographs painted on the rock wall. Proof that indigenous people lived here long before Meriwether named it the Gates of the Mountains.</p> <p>The tour’s main attraction, though, is the inexhaustible scenery – wooded slopes, rugged rock formations, and the placid beauty of the timeless Missouri.</p>",

A planning effort is underway to determine the future of the site. For more information, call the Falls of the Ohio Visitor Center at (812) 280-9970. </strong><br /> <br /> The George Rogers Clark Home Site is a 7-acre tract of land that makes up part of the Falls of the Ohio State Park. George Rogers Clark, a revolutionary war general, the town’s founder, and William Clark’s older brother, built his home here in 1803 as a place to spend his retirement years. He stayed here until 1809, at which time he suffered a serious burn that resulted in the amputation of his leg. As a result of the injury, he was forced to move in with his sister at her farm outside of Louisville, Kentucky. </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{103}\" paraid=\"23007673\">Although his younger brother, William, would go down in history as part of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, George was a noted hero of the American Revolution in his own right. He was a skilled surveyor and used those skills to take the fort at Kaskaskia, Illinois, as well as Prairie du Roche and Cahokia. He also convinced several Indian tribes to stop allying with the British.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{119}\" paraid=\"793605974\">Clark’s home served as an important stopping point for those traveling along the Ohio River. On October 15, 1803, Meriwether Lewis stopped here to meet with William Clark. Together, the two recruited nine men, thus forming the Corps of Discovery that departed from this location on October 26, 1803. </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{141}\" paraid=\"252058547\">Today, a replica of George’s cabin sits on the site of the original, which was destroyed in 1854. Situated atop the lower end of a 24-foot limestone drop, the home commands beautiful scenic views of the river and the falls.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{171}\" paraid=\"197801599\">Directly behind it is a replica of the McGee Cabin. This structure isn’t in its original location, as the McGees lived in Guinea Bottoms, one of the first freed African-American communities in the Northwest Territory. It was erected here to tell the story of Venus and Ben McGee, who were George Clark’s indentured servants.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{af4a169e-1787-49ee-8a86-0469ef2a3608}{203}\" paraid=\"343181420\">Visitors can tour the home site daily from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. The cabin itself is open seasonally on weekends. For more information, call the Falls of the Ohio Visitor Center at (812) 280-9970 or visit the website at <a href=\"https://www.fallsoftheohio.org/portfolio/outdoor-activities/george-rogers-clark-home-site/\">https://www.fallsoftheohio.org/portfolio/outdoor-activities/george-rogers-clark-home-site/</a>. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Goat Island lays within the 59-Mile District of the Missouri National Recreational River in between the two cities of Yankton and Vermillion, South Dakota. Situated along the Missouri National Recreational River Water Trail, the island is between Nebraska and South Dakota.<br /> <br /> This prominent island, also affectionately known and referred to by locals as Jake’s Island, is a remnant of large emergent sandbars that later developed into successional forests and sand flats. While the overall landscape has changed with time and while the area is not specifically cited in the Lewis and Clark journals, geologic and riverine scientific study suggests a high probability the island existed during the passage of their expedition in 1804 and 1806. Today the 800-acre property supports a wide variety of wildlife on its sandbars and within its dense forested areas of cottonwood and Eastern red-cedar. Chutes paralleling the island, free-flowing water, vegetation, and sandbars not only provide important wildlife habitat, but add to the aesthetic qualities of the Park’s 59-Mile District.<br /> <br /> Goat Island provides unique and unparalleled recreational opportunities, as well as a place to simply pause and reflect. Situated along the Missouri National Recreational River Water Trail, the island is one of only a few places in both Nebraska and South Dakota where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mnrr/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm\">island camping</a>, hiking, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mnrr/planyourvisit/hunting.htm\">hunting</a>, and other pleasure activities are available on publicly owned land. As part of the National Park Service System, the island is ideally suited as a stopover point for boaters navigating the river. Similarly, Goat Island provides a natural setting to hike trails or set out on one’s own to explore and enjoy the riverine backdrop.<br /> <br /> <b>Primitive Camping </b><br /> Two designated tent camping only areas. The first (southern) campground area is in the process of being established. The second (northern) is targeted to be established in 2021. Primitive camping is allowed anywhere on the Island, with the exception of the established hunting season after Labor Day to January when camping is restricted to the two designated camping areas. Please email or call (605-665-0209) for a back country use permit issued by the Park's HQ Office.<b> </b><br /> <br /> The Goat Island Management Plan emphasizes the intent to retain the primitive character of the island in permanency. The overarching goal and management objectives outlined in the plan is to provide a quality recreational experience for visitors in the same spirit that historically contributed to the island’s popularity.<br /> Visit the <a href=\"https://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?parkID=151&projectID=71840&documentID=98316\">Goat Island Management Plan and Environmental Assessment FONSI</a> through the NPS Planning Environment and Public Comment (PEPC) website: <a href=\"https://parkplanning.nps.gov/projectHome.cfm?parkID=151&projectID=71840\">http://parkplanning.nps.gov/goatislandplan</a>.</p>",

On June 16, the expedition consolidated at a lower portage camp, about one mile below Belt Creek (named Portage Creek by Lewis and Clark). They encountered Sulphur Spring, located across the river from Belt Creek, and Lewis used its waters to aid the treatment of an extremely ill Sacagawea. While encamped they surveyed a suitable portage route, constructed wagons to haul canoes and supplies, and undertook the arduous task of moving their equipment 18 miles overland to the Upper Portage Camp. By June 28, the last load was transported away from the lower camp and remaining supplies cached in place. The white pirogue was left there and retrieved on the return trip in July 1806.<br /> <br /> The Great Falls Lower Portage is one of two discontiguous segments of the Great Falls Portage NHL, separated by the intrusion of Malmstrom Air Force Base. It includes the lower portage camp site, Sulphur Spring, and the northern portion of the portage route. The majority of the Great Falls Lower Portage is under private ownership. However, there are numerous state and federal public areas along the Missouri River frontage.<br /> <br /> Great Falls Upper Portage is a </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\"> on the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> <span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">Clark had surveyed and staked out an 18-mile portage route during June 17-20, 1805. On June 22, Lewis, Clark, and a contingent of the expedition began transporting the first load of equipment, to include the components of Lewis’ iron frame boat. The next day they arrived at the site selected for their upper por­tage camp, along a stretch of the Missouri River marked by three islands they named White Bear Islands. Lewis began the assemblage of his experimental boat, while Clark directed the portage endeavor. All sup­plies had been moved to the upper camp by July 2, but efforts to make the iron boat river-worthy contin­ued until July 9 when Lewis finally “relinquished all further hope of my favorite boat and ordered her to be sunk in the water, that the skins might become soft in order the better to take her in peices tomorrow and deposite the iron fraim at this place as it could probably be of no further service to us.” Putting the failed experiment behind them, Clark and ten men traveled 14 miles upstream and fashioned two cottonwood dugout canoes. By July 13, the entire expedition relocated to the “Canoe Camp,” and finally, on July 15, resumed their journey up the Missouri.<br /> <br /> The Great Falls Upper Portage is one of two discontiguous segments of the Great Falls Portage NHL, separated by the intrusion of Malmstrom Air Force Base. It includes the upper portage camp site and the southern portion of the portage route. Great Falls Upper Portage is under mixed private ownership, but there is a public parking area with interpretive wayside exhibits and expansive viewshed of the portage route landscape located off of 40th Avenue.<br /> <br /> On June 13, 1805, the Great Falls Portage presented Lewis and Clark with one of the most challenging ordeals of the Expedition. The Corps needed to find a way around the falls - a journey that would require all equipment and supplies be carried 18-miles overland. Progress was slow. The crudely-made wagons required almost constant repair. They trudged through intense heat, and prickly pear cacti tore through their moccasins. Lewis described his men's condition:</span></span></span></span></span></span></div> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">“. . .

Shore resembling a hat at a rapid at the lower point of an Island in the middle of the river on which there is 7 Lodges of nativs drying fish, and opposit the head of an Isld. near the Std. side on which is 5 Lodges of na­tivs drying fish.” During the 1805-1806 winter at Fort Clatsop, Clark prepared a list of “Estimated Distances in Miles” from Fort Mandan to the Pacific Coast, using “remarkable places” such as distinctive landmarks, confluences, and villages as reference points. Included in that list is “the hat rock.”<br /> <br /> Located about nine miles east of Umatilla off of Highway 730, Hat Rock is a formation of exposed basalt that rises approximately 70 feet to a plateau. It is located within the 719-acre <a href=\"https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=12\">Hat Rock State Park</a>, which was established during the construction of the McNary Dam circa 1951-1953. On-site wayside exhibits and signage interpret the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Day-use recreation opportunities include activities such as boating, swimming, fishing, picnicking, horseback riding, and hiking. The park also provides an access point for the Lewis and Clark Commemorative Trail- a footpath along the Columbia River that extends west to the <a href=\"http://www.nww.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/McNary-Dam-and-Lake-Wallula/McNary-Beach-Park/\">McNary Beach Recreation Area</a>.<br />  ",

The park has its own pond, which is popular for fishing as it is teeming with rainbow trout.

It stretches for miles along the Oregon coast. Among the many species that make their home here are the Tufted Puffins, Common Murres, Black Oystercatchers, sea lions, and seals.<br /> <br /> Within the refuge are 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands, all of which have been designated National Wilderness Areas. One of the most iconic and recognizable of these is Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach, Oregon. On January 8, 1806, William Clark and a few other men of the Lewis and Clark Expedition had arrived in the area searching for a blue whale that the local tribes had reported to them. They were hoping to harvest a bit of meat from the carcass to bolster their dwindling supplies, but it was not to be. When they found the animal, the 105-foot-long behemoth was indeed laying net to Haystack Rock, but it was little more than a skeleton. A few days later, when the men returned to Fort Clatsop, another expedition member who had remained behind with Meriwether Lewis and the rest of the party, Joseph Whitehouse, recorded their report in his journal on January 10, 1806, saying: <blockquote> <p>“…In the evening late <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?people=Clark%2C%20William\">Captain Clark</a> & some of the party returned to the Fort. they informed us that they had been about 25 Miles along the Sea Coast, nearly a South course to see the Whale, <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-10#n27011016\"><sup>[16]</sup></a> expecting to get some of the Meat of it, and that they had to pass over rough <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?places=Rocky%20Mountains\">rockey mountains</a>, <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1806-01-10#n27011017\"><sup>[17]</sup></a> to get to the place where the whale lay, & that the Indians had showed them, to where a whale lay; which had been a long time Dead, which was on a very large Rock.

The party got some of the Jaw bones &ca…”</p> </blockquote> Rising 235 feet above the shoreline, Haystack Rock is an irregular basalt formation that was first created some 17 million years ago as lava flowed through the old Columbia River drainage system and intruded into soft marine sediments. Erosion and geologic uplift eventually revealed it and the many other large stone formations along the coast.<br /> <br /> Today, Haystack Rock is protected as one of Oregon’s seven Marine Gardens. It’s a popular location for tidepooling and, at low tide, visitors can walk right up to the enormous rock. A wide variety of birds can also be seen year-round. Gray Whales, Humpback Whales, Orcas, and Sperm Whales are often spotted from December to March. Visitors are encouraged to bring binoculars, spotting scopes, and cameras if they want to spot some of the giant creatures out in the water.<br /> <br /> The Haystack Rock Awareness Program presents interpretive programs from February to late October. Program schedules are available from City Hall, local businesses, and the Chamber of Commerce Information Center. For more information on visiting, see the city’s website at <a href=\"https://www.cannonbeach.org/things-to-do/beaches-and-parks/haystack-rock/\">Oregon Coast Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach Oregon</a>.",

In the late summer and fall, people from far up- and downriver flocked to the area to trade. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark had heard of these prominent trading towns and hoped to spend the winter near them. </p> <p paraeid=\"{baf44ae0-62eb-4d02-a41a-ab403d7f0399}{59}\" paraid=\"1840044147\">In early November 1804, Lewis, Clark, and their crew arrived at the Mandan and Hidatsa villages. While the crew began to “Cut Down trees and raise our houses,” a French-Canadian trader came to introduce himself. His name was named Toussaint Charbonneau. He had lived in these villages for years, and he had two wives. One of these women was named <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a>.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{baf44ae0-62eb-4d02-a41a-ab403d7f0399}{119}\" paraid=\"533600784\">Charbonneau offered Lewis and Clark his own skills as an interpreter (he spoke French and some Hidatsa), as well as Sacagawea’s (she spoke Hidatsa and Shoshone). Lewis and Clark were aware of the importance of good interpreters. They also knew, from what Mandan people had told them, that would need to trade for horses with the Shoshone to cross the Rocky Mountains. They agreed to hire Charbonneau and Sacagawea for the duration of the journey. </p> <p paraeid=\"{baf44ae0-62eb-4d02-a41a-ab403d7f0399}{169}\" paraid=\"1087023120\">At age forty-six, Charbonneau became the oldest member of the permanent party, while Sacagawea, age sixteen, became the youngest.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{baf44ae0-62eb-4d02-a41a-ab403d7f0399}{205}\" paraid=\"1545934955\">As interpreters, Charbonneau and Sacagawea acted as critical links in a translation chain. Charbonneau did not speak English. But he could speak in French with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/profile-of-george-drouillard.htm\">George Drouillard</a>, as well as with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/st-charles-historic-district-missouri.htm\">French and Métis boatmen</a>. Sacagawea did not speak French or English, but she could speak Hidatsa with Charbonneau. A chain formed in which, during meetings with Shoshone people, Sacagawea would translate from Shoshone to Hidatsa. Charbonneau then translated from Hidatsa to French for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/profile-of-george-drouillard.htm\">Drouillard</a>. He would then translate to English, so Lewis and Clark could understand.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The name for Fort Steuben originates from Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, George Washington’s drillmaster during the revolutionary war. The fort offers a glimpse into what military life was like during the 18th century.<br />  <br /> Fort Steuben began its original construction in 1786, and completed construction in 1787. The First American Regiment built the fort with the purpose of protecting surveyors who were tasked with mapping the United States’ Northwestern territory to prepare it for settlement. Fort Steuben was abandoned in 1787 and later eradicated by a fire in 1790. The town of Steubenville was established after the abandonment of the fort. <br /> <br /> Lewis and Clark of the Corps of Discovery passed through the city of Steubenville as the expedition made their initial progress westward. On September 6th, 1803, as the group traveled down the Ohio River, Lewis wrote in his journal that they had reached the city of, as he spelled it, “Stewbenville.” He described it as a “small well built thriving place” despite the fact that the city had only been “five yers since it was wilderness.” No note was made of Fort Steuben because, by 1803, the fort had long since ceased to be.<br />  <br /> Today, Historic Fort Steuben features attractions such as an herb garden, an archaeology site, and the visitor’s center. The Exhibit Hall located inside the visitor’s center is home to a variety of exhibits that center around Ohio’s history. Fort Steuben provides the opportunity to explore the reconstructed Fort, and self-guided tours are available to visitors.<br /> <br /> For more information, call 740-283-1787 or email info@oldfortsteuben.com.

The highlight of the Historic Paducah Audio Tour is perhaps the riverfront, which acts as the focal point for past and present-day life in Paducah.</p> <p>Whether this is your first time in Paducah or your 50th, the Historic Paducah Audio Tour will offer a unique perspective of this charming city.

As a result of changes in the course of the river, Horse Island has been absorbed into the Missouri shoreline in the vicinity of this marker, and the Mississippi River has shifted its course eastward, carrying away the original village of Kaskaskia.</p> <p>When the party reached Horse Island, Capt. Meriwether Lewis left his co-commander, William Clark, in charge of the keelboat and pirogues, while he was put ashore to walk the six-mile distance to Fort Kaskaskia. The fort was now an American Army post situated on the high ground on the east side of the Kaskaskia River opposite the village of Kaskaskia.</p> <p>Clark and the rest of the men, meanwhile, pushed their boats into the Mississippi and begin to work their way around a long and difficult bend, known as Coco Bend. Clark had wanted to make calculations of latitude with his sextant but a thick morning mist obscured the sun. The west side of Coco Bend hugged the Missouri shore and Clark observed a range of highlands next to the river. At 1 p.m., the party passed Joseph Donahoe’s landing. Boats loaded salt from the salt works in Saline Creek at this place. Two hours later, Saline Creek itself was passed. In addition to the salt works on this creek, there was also a thriving settlement. The party rounded Coco Bend and pulled up to Kaskaskia Landing on the Illinois shore. On the opposite side of the river was the former west bank community of Old Ste. Genevieve, known locally as “misar” (phonetic for misère in French, or misery in English). This community was relocated after disastrous floods in the 1780s.</p> <p>There is a roadside historical marker for visitors to glen into the times and landscape of 1803 when they camped here.</p> <p>(description courtesy <a href=\"https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM3TFV_Kaskaskia_Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition_Across_Missouri_Perry_County_MO\">waymarking.com</a>)</p>",

They resided in semi-permanent villages, usually located along rivers. Winter months were spent in their villages, and they spent the summers hunting and gathering food. Large hunting parties would journey out over the grasslands in search of bison and other game. Women foraged for edible plants on the fertile plains. They cultivated corn, beans, squash, and watermelon in gardens along the river.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8457be30-8e20-4aad-82a7-1e957b3e545b}{205}\" paraid=\"572313948\">For generations, a large Kanza village existed near where Independence Creek meets the Missouri River. The village, with some 1,500 residents, consisted of nearly 150 lodges. It was large enough that Frenchman Étienne Veniard de Bourgmont documented it in on his map in 1724.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8457be30-8e20-4aad-82a7-1e957b3e545b}{237}\" paraid=\"363647661\">When Lewis and Clark arrived in July 1804, they found the village empty and mistakenly assumed that Kanza people had abandoned it. But Kanza families actually lived in communities along Independence Creek as late as 1811.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{d61801a6-c0ec-470f-b922-c61439af4f3e}{22}\" paraid=\"1605959548\">Where were they? </p> <p paraeid=\"{d61801a6-c0ec-470f-b922-c61439af4f3e}{28}\" paraid=\"1849857853\">Out on a summer bison hunt.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{d61801a6-c0ec-470f-b922-c61439af4f3e}{36}\" paraid=\"1978794578\">Lewis and Clark’s lack of understanding of Indigenous lifeways led them to incorrectly assume that Kanza people were a part of the past.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{d61801a6-c0ec-470f-b922-c61439af4f3e}{64}\" paraid=\"166455151\">That wasn’t true then, and it isn’t true today.

He wrote, “Those Bluffs appear to have been laterly on fire, and at this time is too hot for a man to bear his hand in the earth at any debth, gret appearance of Coal. An emence quantity of Cabalt or a Cristolised Substance which answers its discription is on the face of the Bluff.” Ordway further elaborated that the bluff “had a Sulpheras Smell”.<br /> <br /> Following Lewis and Clark, later fur traders and travelers frequently noticed dense smoke and fire in this region. In 1839, French explorer J. N. Nicollet attempted to prove that these phenomena were not of vol­canic origin. He theorized that the decomposition of beds of iron pyrites in contact with water resulted in a heat capable of igniting other combustible materials. Still, by the late 1800s the bluff was known as the Ionia Volcano. It was named after the nearby town of Ionia, established in 1856. In 1878, a flooded Missouri River undermined the bluffs and a large section of the “volcano” fell into the river. The same flood heavily damaged the town of Ionia, which was later completely abandoned. By 1900, there was scientific consensus that the eruptions were due to the heat caused by the oxidation of damp pyritiferous and carbonaceous shale exposed by erosion. The Ponca Tribe consider the bluff to be a sacred site. Located north of Newcas­tle, Nebraska, the Ionia Cemetery is across the road from a small overlook and the top of the Ionia Volcano remnants.<br /> <br /> Learn more at <a href=\"http://www.lewis-clark.org/article/3351 \">Discovering Lewis and Clark</a>",
    "audioDescription": "Geologic formation on a bluff that showcases exposed hillside. Having previous contact with the river, the site has erosion and the river has shifted nearly one mile away from the \"volcano\". The site does not have volcanic activity and the source of the heat resulted from a chemical reaction of the various minerals eroding the bluff. Overtime the Missouri River eroded and washed these minerals away and the base of the bluff is now gone, therefore there is no more seemingly volcanic activity.",

On the south side of the Capitol is a large statue of Thomas Jefferson, commemorating the namesake for the city.</p> <p>After touring the Capitol grounds, venture inside to see the Missouri State Museum, which encompasses both wings on the first floor, to learn about the history and resources of the state. The governor’s portraits in the first-floor, west wing have paintings of both Lewis and Clark honoring their respective terms as Missouri Territorial Governors. Throughout the Capitol are a variety of artworks related to the expedition. Proceed to the second floor hallway to view the lunette mural titled, “Lewis and Clark at the Mouth of the Osage River.” Then go up one floor to the third-floor Rotunda to view the Lewis and Clark statues and associated lunettes. From the windows of the Senate viewing gallery doors on the fourth-floor you can view the large mural titled, “Jefferson, Lewis and Clark.”</p> <p>After seeing the resources of the Capitol Complex, venture downtown for coffee, lunch, and shopping. Then go to the Jefferson City Greenway Skywalk Trail to walk over the Missouri River (adjacent to the highway bridge) and have a splendid view of downtown Jefferson City. At the Carl R. Noren Access, you can walk right up to the river’s bank. The Noren Access will also lead you to the KATY hiking/biking trail, which crosses virtually the entire state east-west.</p> <p>If you want a short-road trip, drive eight miles east to Clark’s Hill/Norton State Historic Site and enjoy the same view that William Clark did on June 2, 1804, when the expedition camped at the base of the hill, and Clark decided to climb to the top of the hill to enjoy its view.</p>",

The Knife River Indian Villages are spread out over 1,758 acres of land where the Knife River winds its way north before cutting back southwest. Here, at the confluence of the Missouri and Knife Rivers, was the home of the Corps of Discovery during the winter of 1805. It was at this location that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first met Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau, central figures to the expedition as it headed west in the spring of 1806. But while this area is significant to the history of the Corps of Discovery, the land has a long and rich history of its own.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ee77148d-e173-4f42-9b08-6d0f3e96a988}{176}\" paraid=\"1730831961\">With a Native American history dating back to at least 1300 CE, the land is home to the Mandan and Hidatsa people. Evidence of their long history is still visible in the site’s three villages. The southernmost of these villages, called the Awatixa Xi’e Village (also known as the Lower Hidatsa Site), is just a short distance (quarter mile) north from the Knife River Indian Village Visitor Center. Visitors can see the site of what once was home to 50 earth lodges, set out upon about 10 acres of land. Not too far north is the second village, called Awatixa Village, a stone’s throw from the Knife River itself. Of particular note to those interested in the history of the Corps of Discovery is that this village was the home of Sacagawea; in fact, it’s referred to as the Sacagawea Site. Originally, the site consisted of around 60 earth lodges, but today only 31 lodge sites are still visible. Awatixa Village is under threat from the river itself as nature gradually erodes the banks and edges closer to the lodge sites. But the erosion does allow for a unique experience along the walking trail: the chance to see artifacts from the village itself, buried between layers of earth that are gradually eroding, revealing the history below.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ee77148d-e173-4f42-9b08-6d0f3e96a988}{246}\" paraid=\"171397149\">The largest, and newest village (established around 1600 CE), is the Hidatsa Village (also known as the Big Hidatsa Village). This is the northernmost site of the Knife River villages and also sits near the Knife River. At one time, the 15.5 acres contained over 100 earth lodges and, at its designation in 1964 as a National Historic Landmark, its remaining constructions were considered among the best examples of Native American earth lodges.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{9}\" paraid=\"1571515515\">Before heading out on the trail to explore the Villages, be sure to stop by the Visitor Center and step inside a modern earth lodge construction, built in 1995 by the National Park Service. Here visitors can get an idea of the varied uses and complexity of these lodges. The earth lodge is available to visitors during regular park hours. In addition, the Knife River Indian Villages website offers more extensive history about the earth lodges and a helpful schematic of what the lodges looked like.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{19}\" paraid=\"48969615\">Admission to the site, its museum, and visitor center is free for all. The site is seasonal, so be sure to check with the visitor center to plan ahead. Keep in mind that the weather also varies in the extremes, from -35 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, to upwards of 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{41}\" paraid=\"1778755593\">While there is no camping on the Knife River Indian Villages NHS grounds, there are trails of different length throughout the site that link up and loop around all three villages. As you snap photos along your hike, be sure to share them on the iNaturalist app! This app helps the Knife River Indian Villages NHS research and study the plants and animals found throughout the park. Instructions on how to get and use the app are available through the Knife River Indian Villages NHS website.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{61}\" paraid=\"1513733091\">No food is sold at the visitor center, but hikers are permitted to bring their own food and picnic at designated picnic tables along the trails. In addition to the Indian Villages, there are ample natural sights and wildlife to see. If you are planning to visit the site over multiple days and would like to camp, the Stanton City Park (located at 501 Harmon Avenue, Stanton) is open to campers.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{80}\" paraid=\"1103688598\">Before your visit, check out the Knife River Indian Villages website where you can read up on the history of the area and download a checklist for wildlife viewing. Kids can join the Junior Park Ranger program on the site, as well. If visiting during the summer months, kids are welcome to join the kids camp (free to all) where they can learn about Native American history and partake in canoeing, fishing, crafts, Native American games, and hiking.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e7a16a3-f39a-4952-af81-09a745e3f4cc}{90}\" paraid=\"1923339244\">To get the latest on hours of operation, or to find out more, call the Knife River Indian Villages NHS at (701) 745-3300. </p>",

Along that river were two Hidatsa towns, which were also home to many Mandan. Awatixa was the town where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a> and her husband, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, lived. These were winter villages, which were smaller than and upriver from summer villages. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{179}\" paraid=\"914467629\">Mandan and Hidatsa people cultivated crops in the fertile riverine lands, and they were well-acquainted with the French, British, and Spanish traders who traveled the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers to trade with them. They even permitted some of these traders, like Charbonneau, to live with them, as was customary in many Indigenous villages across the continent. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{223}\" paraid=\"1030498113\">In the winter of 1804–1805, Mandan and Hidatsa people permitted members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition to build a dwelling for the winter seven miles downriver. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{251}\" paraid=\"810725828\">Meriwether Lewis and William Clark wanted to be at this site because of its proximity to the Mandan and Hidatsa villages on the Knife River. They wanted to have access to the expansive trading network that revolved around these towns, which spanned west to the Rocky Mountains, north into Canada, and south through the Great Plains. A wide array of goods was available at these marketplaces: Spanish horses, Cheyenne leather goods, English and French guns and ammunition, and food grown and preserved by Mandan and Hidatsa people.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ab000ee8-b82f-45c3-a12b-0e56a16726af}{44}\" paraid=\"339846512\">Lewis and Clark wintered here because they needed access to the goods and information that Mandan and Hidatsa people had thanks to generations of developing relationships and trade networks with people who lived up and down the Missouri River. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

(The Indians of the Missouris Still Keep up the Custom of Burying their dead on high ground.)”<br /> <br /> Clark imagined (correctly) that these mounds were constructed for human burial. The mounds are believed to have been constructed by the Oneota people. The site is significant because it shows the expansion of the Oneota during the late Prehistoric period.<br /> <br /> While at the Leary Site, Corps member Alexander Willard was charged with lying down and sleeping while on guard duty. He was sentenced to receive 100 lashes to be broken up and given at four different times. The Corps of Discovery left the site early on July 13 to continue their westward trek.<br /> <br /> Sources<br /> http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/15695<br /> <br /> Leary Site is a High Potential Historic Site on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> Clark visited this site on July 12, 1804, and observed raised mounds that were American Indian grave sites. He noted that “after going to Several Small Mounds in a leavel plain, I ascended a hill on the Lower Side, on this hill, Several Artificial Mounds were raised; from the top of the highest of those Mounds I had an extensive view of the serounding Plains, which afforded one of the most pleasing prospects I ever beheld, under me a Butifill River of Clear water of about 80 yards wide Meandering thro a level and extensive Meadow, as far as I could See, the [view of the] prospect Much enlivened by the fine Trees & Shrubs which [was] bordering the bank of the river, and the Creeks & runs falling into it, [...] I observed artificial mounds (or as I may more justly term Graves) which to me is a strong indications of this Country being once Thickly Settled.” A court martial was convened at the Corps’ nearby camp that same day. Alexander Willard was charged and punished for sleeping while on guard duty.<br /> <br /> Located along the Big Nemaha River south of present-day Rulo, Nebraska, the Leary Site National Historic Landmark is within the boundaries of the Iowa Reservation. The hill summited by Clark remains intact and is crested by three burial mounds. The mounds and surrounding area comprise the archeological site of an extensive village formerly inhabited by the Oneota Tribe.</p> <div> </div>",

Their objectives were to “find a portage if possible” and make contact with the Shoshone Tribe in order to acquire horses. A few days later, on August 12, Lewis crossed the continental divide through Lemhi Pass. This marked the point of departure from both United States-controlled territory and the Mis­souri River watershed. Lewis wrote, “two miles below McNeal had exultingly stood with a foot on each side of this little rivulet and thanked his god that he had lived to bestride the mighty & heretofore deemed endless Missouri. after refreshing ourselves we proceeded on to the top of the dividing ridge from which I discovered immence ranges of high mountains still to the West of us with their tops partially covered with snow. I now decended the mountain about ¾ of a mile which I found much steeper than on the opposite side, to a handsome bold running Creek of cold Clear water. here I first tasted the water of the great Co­lumbia river.” Following successful contact with the Shoshone and acquition of horses, the full expedition crossed the pass on August 26.<br /> <br /> The pass was named in 1855 by Mormon missionaries for King Limhi, a character from the Book of Mor­mon. Located in the Beaverhead Mountains of the Bitterroot Range, it spans about two miles across the boundary between Montana and Idaho. Lemhi Pass is encompassed by two national forests – <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/bdnf\">Beaverhead- Deerlodge National Forest</a> in Montana, and <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/scnf\">Salmon-Challis National Forest</a> in Idaho.</p>",

Upon finding the whale, little flesh was left on its skeleton, the usable parts already having been harvested by the local people. Disheartened, the men returned to a small Tillamook village of five houses that they had passed earlier that day, where the people were processing whale blubber.<br /> <br /> After purchasing some whale oil and fish from the villagers, Clark shot a raven and gull with a small rifle and, after a meal, the explorers crossed the creek and set up camp. Some of the Tillamook men came to smoke with the captain, but their visit was interrupted by a loud commotion from across the creek. Concerned, Clark, his men, and the Tillamook visitors discovered that Private Hugh McNeal was missing. Clark describes the event in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“…I Suspected perhaps Some of my party was over after the Squars, by exemening found that <em><a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?people=McNeal%2C%20Hugh\">McNeal</a> </em>was not in Camp, 〈I was〉 my guide who Staid with me told me Some body throat was Cut.

Here, visitors will find picnic areas, access to the seashore at Cannon Beach, salt marshes, and wetlands.

    "bodyText": "<p>To tell visitors the story of the Camp River Dubois and the newly formed Corps of Discovery, the 14,000-square-foot visitor’s center presents the often-untold story of the Illinois portion of the Expedition.  Construction of the center began in October 2000 in an area similar to that of the original Camp River Dubois on the south side of the Wood River, where the men of the Corps lived from December 1803 to May 1804.<br /> <br /> Six galleries discuss the preparation phase of the Corps, including the information and knowledge gathered about the land west of the Mississippi River, and the expectations and anticipations of the newly formed Corps.  Everyone enjoys seeing the 55-foot, full-scale cut-away keelboat which demonstrates how the men handled packing the hundreds of bundles, boxes, and barrels of goods and supplies.  Outside stands a small replica fort, similar in structure to the original, which gives visitors an idea of what life was like on the frontier for this small military unit. <br /> <br /> Lewis & Clark Historic Site is near today’s confluence of the Missouri River, which can be best seen from the top of the nearby 180-foot-tall Confluence Tower.  However, due to changes in the course of both the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers over the past 200 years, the actual location of Camp River Dubois cannot be accurately pinpointed.  It’s often believed that the original site is now either under the main channel of the Mississippi, or even on the western side of the river, in today’s Missouri. <br /> <br /> The Lewis & Clark Historic Site is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday. The address is One Lewis and Clark Trail, Hartford, Illinois.  For more information call 618-251-5811 or go to <a href=\"https://www.campdubois.com\">www.campdubois.com</a>.<br /> <span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span><span style=\"display: none;\"> </span> </p>",

Glenn Bishop initially spearheaded this immense project of constructing the boats. His vision continues to be realized today with re-enactments featuring the magnificently, hand-crafted, and highly unique fleet.  The Keelboat and two pirogues have been showcased in several films, documentaries and an upcoming televised miniseries.  When the boats are not appearing in events or re-enactments, they are on display at the Boat House. <br /> <br /> On the second floor is the Museum and Visitors’ Shop.  Formed in 1985, the educational Museum provides visitors the opportunity to explore the Lewis & Clark Expedition, Native American displays, various Missouri River habitats, and natural discoveries the Corps encountered during the journey. The museum’s artwork, \"Missouri River Walk,\" is the largest indoor mural in the state.<br /> <br /> Classes, private presentations, and tour-group talks are conducted in the classroom area and when not in use an award-winning film is shown throughout the day.  Adjacent to the Boat House is Bishop’s Landing with its huge sculpture of Lewis, Clark, and Seaman. <br /> <br /> Unique items for all ages are available in the Visitors’ Shop featuring a wide selection of books of all reading levels. Titles include those related to Lewis & Clark, Native Americans, general history, local interest, and nature.<br /> <br /> The first Missouri State Capitol State Historic Site and the historic town of St. Charles are both easily walkable from our site. <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.lewisandclarkboathouse.org.\">Learn more about the boathouse</a> </li> <li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/78ihrg99d-Q\">Watch a short video overview of the musem</a></li> </ul>",

Built to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the beginning of the Lewis & Clark Expedition, construction on the monument was completed on May 14, 2010.<br /> <br /> How does it relate to the Lewis & Clark expedition, you ask? Well, in many ways, it was the first step on what would become known as the Lewis & Clark Expedition. In December of 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark established camp at Wood River, otherwise known as Camp Dubois. Located along the Mississippi River between St. Louis and the modern-day Confluence Tower, the camp served as the winter quarters for the two men and those who joined them on their expedition. Here, they spent the winter gathering supplies and recruiting other intrepid explorers from St. Louis. Then, in May of 1804, the group embarked on their historic journey westward from the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.<br /> <br /> For those wishing to get a bird’s eye view of the area, the Confluence Tower has observations decks at the 50, 100, and 150-foot marks, and all three levels are accessible by either stairs or elevator. Exhibits focusing on Lewis and Clark and the importance of the Missouri-Mississippi Confluence can be found on every level. Guests can also request a short, guided tour that ends with a trip to the highest level of the structure. On particularly clear days, parts of St. Louis and the Gateway Arch can be seen from the upper decks.",

    "bodyText": "Around the time <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-s-departure-from-pittsburgh.htm\">he departed Pittsburgh</a> in late August 1803, Meriwether Lewis recruited crew members.  <br /> <br /> One of those new recruits may have been a dog. <br /> <br /> Lewis purchased a Newfoundland dog in September 1803 for $20 (roughly $500 in 2022 dollars). Why? <br /> <br /> Newfoundland dogs are known to be intelligent, hard-working, loyal, and well-tempered animals, as well as good hunters and swimmers. This meant Seaman could handle a mostly river-bound journey and help with hunting, all while being good-natured.<br /> <br /> Seaman especially loved to chase squirrels in the river. Maybe he loved it even more because of how much his human liked eating them. Day after day on the Ohio River, Lewis saw squirrels swimming across the river—almost always from the north to the south shore, he observed. Most days, Seaman would hop in the river and chase after a few.<br /> <br /> After he swam his heart out, Seaman would return to the boat, sopping wet. Maybe Lewis would have to help hoist him back onto the boat, or maybe he’d jump himself, heavy fur and all. He may have been proud to please his human with a squirrel offering, and perhaps excited to hop back again into the river and go chase some more.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

It only allowed Indigenous communities to retain a so-called “native title.” This meant they could occupy and use, but not own, their own homelands. It still required Europeans to negotiate treaties with Indigenous leaders to fully take over their land. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4f3bb0a7-5b26-4a51-8558-b1aa05f246a0}{88}\" paraid=\"1248712408\">The French first claimed the territory west of the Mississippi River in 1682 and called it La Louisiane after King Louis XIV. French settlers knew about Indigenous nations who had lived, farmed, and hunted near great cities like Cahokia for millennia, but according to the rules that the European leaders wrote, Indigenous claims were not as valid as those of these new arrivals.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4f3bb0a7-5b26-4a51-8558-b1aa05f246a0}{136}\" paraid=\"2038097171\">France, Britain, Spain, and eventually, the new United States of America, vied for and divided up this land that had been occupied by many people since time immemorial. This back and forth culminated in 1803, when the United States agreed to pay France $15 million for 818,000-square-miles of territory west of the Mississippi River that France claimed. With this purchase complete, the U.S. government could negotiate directly with Indigenous communities for their lands. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4f3bb0a7-5b26-4a51-8558-b1aa05f246a0}{200}\" paraid=\"1951756841\">One of President Thomas Jefferson’s main goals for the Lewis and Clark Expedition was to establish contact with as many Indigenous people as they could and understand “the extent & limits of their possessions.” Once armed with this information, the United States could take these lands, either through treaty or through force.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4f3bb0a7-5b26-4a51-8558-b1aa05f246a0}{246}\" paraid=\"373067890\">For Indigenous people west of the Mississippi River, the Louisiana Purchase was the beginning of a hundred years of land loss, forced relocation, and threats to traditional lifeways.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

There is a stone marker nearby for the bicentennial as well. The Iowa tribe was assigned this land as a reservation in 1836 after it had been ceded by the Kansa. This hollow became the favored hunting ground for its head chief, White Cloud II. After the Iowa ceded this location in 1854, the town was established in 1857 and named in honor of the Iowa chief White Cloud. The town was a bustling one, as the site of a steamboat landing, the oldest opera house west of the Missouri R., and it was where the inventor of the Gatling gun lived.<br /> <br /> The national Piggy Bank movement was started here, and it is considered the birthplace of the piggy bank. The movie “Paper Moon” was filmed in part here as well. The historic general store and other buildings are being renovated in this beautiful little town with its famous Four State Lookout. The famous White Cloud Flea Market is held on two weekends: Memorial Day and Labor Day.",

    "audioDescription": "A large vinyl banner secured between two steel posts. This banner is two-sided and has different information and images on each side. If you are standing in front of the banner facing north, the banner is divided into six sections, dissected by a large dark green x. At the center of the x is a dark green rectangle with rounded corners. Inside the rectangle, in teal letters, the banner reads, you are here. Inside the top section of the x, the background is a light-green map. The National Park Service arrowhead logo is in the center of the map background. Moving clockwise from the logo, the next section is an image of a river at sunset. There is a small rainstorm in the background and the riverbanks are forested with evergreen trees. Below that, the next section is an image of one person in a canoe. The person is wearing a hat and backpack and is sitting below a small waterfall. The next section is the bottom of the x. It has a light green map as a background. The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail logo is atop the background. It is a white, rounded triangle with two men at the center. One of the men is pointing. The outside of the triangle reads, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. The next image is of a National Park Service ranger showing an item to some children who are sitting in the grass. Behind her, a brown banner reads, National Park Week. The final image is of a person standing on a wooden pier overlooking a bright blue body of water. Behind the person a stand of trees and a rock face are visible. At the bottom of the banner is a dark green section with white words. The section reads, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Visitor Center and Headquarters. Nps.gov/LECL National Park Service Regional Office Department of the Interior Regions 3, 4, & 5. Nps.gov/MWRO. If you are standing in front of the banner, but facing south, the top of the banner is dark green and has teal words inside the dark green. The words read, “this trail is 4,900 miles long.” Under the dark green is a teal horizontal stripe and some lighter green beneath that. There are stylized mountains and a sun added to a picture of two people on bicycles. They are cycling on a dirt trail with prairie grass on either side. There are deciduous trees in the distance. Beneath the cyclists there are white words that read, “Omaha is a point along the 4,900 mile Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, a historic corridor that connects 16 states and over 65 tribes. Beneath the words are three horizontal blocks of color. The top is sage green, the next is teal, and the bottom is dark green. At the bottom of the sign are teal words that read, “Check out the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Visitor Center to learn more.” Just above the words are two red arrows pointing toward the National Park Service building. Next to the words and arrows is the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail logo. It is a white triangle with rounded sides with a smaller off-white triangle with rounded sides inside. Around the outside edge are words that read, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Inside the off-white triangle are brown silhouettes of two frontiersmen. One is pointing with an arm outstretched.",

    "audioDescription": "A small sign is placed near a Bur Oak. The sign describes the Bur Oak. There is a black bar across the top of the sign. It has white letters that read Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Beneath the black bar is a light blue rectangle that contains words and a drawing of a Bur Oak cluster. The words above the Bur Oak cluster are in two different fonts. The bold font reads Bur Oak, while italic font below the bold font reads Quercus macrocarpa. Beneath the italic words is an image of the Bur oak cluster. The cluster contains two small, brown acorns and two green oak leaves connected to a light brown twig. The leaves have pointed lobes and their surface appears shiny. There is one long vein running from the tip of the leaf to the stem. Veins also run from the center vein out to the tip of each lobe. The acorns are round and slightly elongated. Their outer shells are several different shades of light brown and light yellow. Each shell covers more than half of its acorn. The shells have a rough and hairy texture. The bottom of the acorn is visible below each shell. It is dark brown, and has a smooth texture. Below the Bur Oak cluster are italic words that read, … a small species of white oak which is loaded with acorns of an excellent flavor very little of the bitter roughness of the nuts of most species of oak… the cup which contains the acorn is fringed on it’s edges and imbraces the nut about one half. Beneath the italic words are words that are not italicized. They read -Meriwether Lewis, September 16, 1804. Beneath those words are more words, not italicized, that read, “Bur oak” refers to the coarse hairs that grown on the cupule or cup that holds the nut.",

    "audioDescription": "A wayside mounted on a frame built of black, square metal tubing. At the top, the wayside has a black bar with white words. On the left the words read, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. On the right the words read, National Park Service U.S. Department of Interior. Next to those words is a picture of the National Park Service logo. Beneath the bar, the background is light blue and fades into a map of the north-western United States. In the upper right corner Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron are visible. Overtop of the light blue background, words are written in black. Large, italicized words say, Capt. Lewis… will… give us account of new things only. Beneath that in small, non-italicized words is written, Thomas Jefferson, February 28, 1803. Beneath that are more non-italicized words that read, Between 1804 and 1806, the Corps of Discovery traveled from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific coast and back. President Jefferson instructed Meriwether Lewis to collect information on “the soil and face of the country, [its] growth and vegetable productions… the animals of the country generally, especially those not of the U.S.” In fulfilling these instructions, members of the Expedition were the first to describe for science 122 animals and 178 plants. The explorers’ written descriptions and the seeds and specimens they collected were Jefferson’s window into the new west. There is a large picture of a prairie dog. Its caption reads, Black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludvicianus). The route of the trail is outlined across the map of the United States. There are pictures of species the Corps encountered along the trail. Near St. Louis Missouri is a picture of an Osage orange. Its caption reads, Osage orange (Maclura pomifera) “[S]o much do… [the Osage Indians] esteem the wood of this tree for… making their bows, that they travel many hundreds of miles in quest of it… The Indians give an extravagant account of the exquisite odour of this fruit when it has obtained maturity…” Meriwether Lewis letter to Thomas Jefferson, March 26, 1804. Above the Osage orange is an image of a black-billed magpie sitting on a branch. Its caption reads, Black-billed magpie (pica pica). Near Omaha, Nebraska is an image of a badger. It has a caption that reads, Badger (Taxidea taxus neglecta) “it is very clumsy and runs very slow. I have in two instances out run this animal and caught it. In this respect they are not much more fleet than the porcupine.” Meriwether Lewis, February 26, 1806. Near Yankton, South Dakota is an image of a pronghorn antelope. Its caption reads, (Antilocapra americana) “a curious annamil resembling a Goat… the legs like a Deer. Feet like a Goat. Horns like a Goat only forked… Such an anamil was never yet known in the U.S. States.” John Ordway, September 14, 1804. In central North Dakota is an image of a Grizzly bear. Its caption reads, Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) “these bear being so hard to die rather intimidates us all…” Meriwether Lewis, May 11, 1805. Near Williston, North Dakota is an image of a Prickly Pear cactus. Its caption reads, Prickly pear cactus (Opuntia fragilis) “my feet is very much bruised and cut… and constantly Stuck full Prickley pear thorns, I pulled out 17 by the light of the fire…” William Clark July 19, 1805. In the south-central part of the Idaho panhandle is an image of a Western tanager. Its caption reads, Western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana) “we meet with a beautiful little bird… the plumage is remarkably delicate; that of the neck and head is of fine orange and red. Meriwether Lewis, June 6, 1806. Near Lewiston, Idaho is an image of a Camas. Its caption reads, Camas (Camassia quamash) “the quawmash is now in blume from the colour of its bloom at a short distance it resembles lacks of fine clear water…” Meriwether Lewis, June 12, 1806. Near Cathlamet, Washington is an image of a Harbor seal. Its caption reads reads, Harbor seal (Phoca vituline) “I have reason to believe… that there are several species of seal on this coast…when we first saw those animals… we conceived they were the Sea Otter. But the Indians here have undeceived us.” Meriwether Lewis, February 23, 1806. At the mouth of the Columbia River in Washington is an image of a Eulachon. Its caption reads Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) “he presented us with some Anchovies [eulachon] which had been well cured in their manner. We [found] them excellent.” Meriwether Lewis, March 6, 1806. At the bottom is an image of a Sharp-tailed grouse. Its caption reads, sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus). There is a caption at the bottom that reads, In 1805, the keelboat returned to Washington D.C. carrying 4 magpies, a prairie dog, and a sharp-tailed grouse. Only the prairie dog and one magpie survived the journey. Believing that “everything that comes from Louisiana must be interesting to the public,” Jefferson sent these two living pieces of the west to be displayed in Philadelphia.",

On one side, the words read, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. On the other side the words read, National Park Service U.S. Department of Interior. Next to those words is a picture of the National Park Service logo in black and white. The National Park Service logo is in the shape of an arrowhead. In the background is a lone peak, covered in snow. In the foreground are pine trees and the silhouette of a bison. Beneath the black bar is an illustration of an earth lodge village. There are six earth lodges which are dome shaped and grown over with grass. The doors are reinforced by several timbers and each has a smoke hole in the center of the roof. A pathway, dotted with grass, winds between the lodges. The sky above the lodges is blue and speckled with clouds. A brown and black bird flies overhead. Over top of the sky is text written in large, bold, italic font. It reads, endeavor to make yourself acquainted… with… the nations. Beneath that in small, non-italic text it reads, Thomas Jefferson’s instructions to Meriwether Lewis, June 20, 1803. Beneath that in larger, non-italic text it reads, In August 1804, members of the Expedition visited villages like this one, homes to the Otoe and Missouria who lived in what is today Omaha. Planning to invite these tribes to a council, or meeting, the explorers found the villages deserted. The tribes had left to hunt buffalo. Throughout their journey, the men of the Expedition held formal councils with tribes they met. Jefferson instructed the explorers to make themselves “acquainted … with… the nations,” to note the “articles of commerce [the Indians] may need or furnish.” And to prepare descriptions of “food, clothing, & domestic accommodations.” The explorers met with tribes for reason of trade, ethnography, and diplomacy. They also relied on American Indians for information, food, and clothing.",

    "audioDescription": "A large vinyl banner secured between two steel posts. This banner is two-sided and has different information and images on each side. If you are standing in front of the banner facing south, the banner is divided into six sections, dissected by a large dark green x. At the center of the x is a dark green rectangle with rounded corners. Inside the rectangle, in teal letters, the banner reads, you are here. Inside the top section of the x, the background is a light-green map. The National Park Service arrowhead logo is in the center of the map background. Moving clockwise from the logo, the next section is an image of a river at sunset. There is a small rainstorm in the background and the riverbanks are forested with evergreen trees. Below that, the next section is an image of one person in a canoe. The person is wearing a hat and backpack and is sitting below a small waterfall. The next section is the bottom of the x. It has a light green map as a background. The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail logo is atop the background. It is a white, rounded triangle with two men at the center. One of the men is pointing. The outside of the triangle reads, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. The next image is of a National Park Service ranger showing an item to some children who are sitting in the grass. Behind her, a brown banner reads, National Park Week. The final image is of a person standing on a wooden pier overlooking a bright blue body of water. Behind the person a stand of trees and a rock face are visible. At the bottom of the banner is a dark green section with white words. The section reads, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Visitor Center and Headquarters. Nps.gov/LECL National Park Service Regional Office Department of the Interior Regions 3, 4, & 5. Nps.gov/MWRO. If you are standing in front of the banner facing north, the background of the banner has a map of part of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the words River La Platte are visible on the map. The map fades into blue sky towards the top of the banner. In the foreground of the banner, there is a green sign post with four arrow signs attached. Each sign is two-tone sage green and has dark green words. The top sign points West and says Pacific Ocean 3,200 miles. The sign beneath that points East and says Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 1,700 miles. The sign beneath that points East and says St. Louis Missouri 530 miles. The sign beneath that points West and says Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Visitor Center. It also has the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail logo on it. The logo is a white triangle with rounded sides with a smaller off-white triangle with rounded sides inside. Around the outer edge are words that read, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Inside the off-white triangle are brown silhouettes of two frontiersmen. One is pointing with an arm outstretched. At the bottom of the sign post is a sage green and teal compass rose on a white and cream background. There is a black circle around the outside of the compass rose with green words on it. They read, connecting 16 states and over 65 tribes commemorate and protect 4,900 miles.",

Beneath the italic words is the image of the Missouri evening primrose cluster. Three bright yellow, four-petaled flowers rise up from a clump of narrow, pointed dark green leaves. At the center of each flower are many lighter yellow stamens. The stalks upon which the flowers sit are light brown and yellow. Each leaf has a center vein running tip-to-tip. There are non-italicized words beneath the picture of the Missouri evening primrose cluster. The words read, Also known as Ozark Sundrops, these flowers open at dusk and last only one evening. Though they do not need a pollinator to reproduce, the primrose is often visited by night-flying Sphinx Moths that are one of several nocturnal species drawn to the light-colored flowers reflected in the moonlight. Look for the 3-4 inch papery capsules that gave rise to the primrose’s species name, macrocarpa.",

Beneath the black bar is an illustration of prairie grassland under a partially cloudy sky. In the distance, the grassland is a homogenous golden color, but in the foreground a variety of grasses and flowers are visible. A small brown and yellow bird sits on a small, leafless twig. Beneath it, an orange and black butterfly sits on a cluster of red blooms. At the top of the illustration words are written. Large, italicized font at the top reads, Nature exerted herself to butify the Senery. Beneath that in smaller, non-italicized font is written, William Clark, July 4, 1804. Beneath that in two, non-italicized columns is written, The tallgrass prairies of Nebraska stook in stark contrast to the forested homelands of the explorers. Dense grasses, some taller than a man, covered the land. Lewis and Clark noted beauty in the vast reaches of waist-high grasses, a beauty beyond picturesque scenery. Lush grasses suggested fertile soils and the promise of bountiful farmlands for a growing country. Today, these promises fulfilled, less than one percent of the original tallgrass prairie remains to inspire us as it did Lewis and Clark.",

    "audioDescription": "A wayside mounted on a frame built of black, square metal tubing. At the top, the wayside has a black bar with white words. On one side, the words read, Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. On the other side the words read, National Park Service U.S. Department of Interior. Next to those words is a picture of the National Park Service logo in black and white. The National Park Service logo is in the shape of an arrowhead. In the background is a lone peak, covered in snow. In the foreground are pine trees and the silhouette of a bison. Beneath the black bar there is an image of a sepia-toned map. On top of the map is some text in two columns. Beneath that text are three photos, which are in a horizontal line across the map. Each photo has a caption. The title text at the top reads, People, Places, Stories in large, bold print. Beneath that in smaller print it reads, The joint efforts of many individuals and groups – among them the military men and scientists, a president and an enslaved man, French-speaking boatmen and American Indians, women and men – determined the fate of the Corps of Discovery. Today more than 100 groups work with the National Park Service to share the stories of the Expedition and to preserve the resources of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trial. Partners include a diverse group of federal agencies, tribal nations, state and local entities, and even private land owners. Many voices tell the stories of the Trail. To hear them all is to hear the true story. Beneath this text are the three images. The first is an image of a wooden fort, viewed through an open gate, with a rustic table and stool visible in the courtyard. The pickets of the fence are made from individual branches that have been sharpened to a point at the top. There are trees in the fore- and background. The caption for this photo reads, Fort Clatsop, Oregon. The next photo is of a seated National Park Service uniform ranger in uniform and standing child in indigenous regalia. They are in front of a white tepee, and a grassy area with trees can be seen in the background. In front of the ranger and child are a wide variety of tools an instruments laid out on top of an animal skin. The caption for this photo reads, Park ranger and American Indian dancer. The third photo is of a footpath through some low brush. There are several ranges of mountains in the background, stands of evergreen trees in the middle ground, and red and green brush in the foreground. The caption for this photo reads, Trail to Sherman Peak, Washington. Beneath these photos is a wide brown bar with an image of a leather-bound journal on the left and some text in three columns on the right. In larger, bold font the text says, The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Beneath that in smaller text is written, The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail stretches across 11 states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. The lands of more than 40 tribal nations – from the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska to the Clatsop/Nehalem Confederated Tribes in Oregon – are on or near today’s Trail. Seeing the vistas beheld by Lewis and hearing the same rushing rivers Clark heard connect us to our history. The National Park Service and its partners work to protect the remnants of what the Corps described.",

The words above the Prairie Blazing Star sprigs are in two different fonts. The bold font reads Prairie Blazing Star, while italic font below the bold font reads Liatris pycnostachya. Beneath the italic words is the image of the two Prairie Blazing Star sprigs. Two spikes of rosey-purple cylindrical, stalkless flower heads densely crowd up a very leafy stem. Stamens and styles protrude from the purple, tufted flower heads at the top of the flower head bunches, creating a fuzzy appearance. The stems are covered with small, green, grass-like leaves. There are non-italicized words beneath the picture of the Prairie Blazing Star sprigs. The words read, Omahas applied powered gayfeather root as a poultice for external inflammation. Tea made from the plant was also used to treat abdominal infirmaries. Translated, the Omaha and Ponca names mean “medicine.”",

Inside this building, more than 200 people – from architects to wildland fire managers – work to sustain the heritage of all Americans: our national park system. Beneath this text are the three images. The first is an image of a round granite building, whose roof is supported by large columns. Atop the column-supported roof is a saucer dome. There is a large, tree-lined pathway leading to the structure. The trees are covered in pink blooms. The caption for this photo reads, George Rogers Clark National Historic Park, Indiana. The next photo is of an expanse of prairie covered in yellow and purple wildflowers. There are low pushes dotted throughout the prairies and dense trees can be seen in the background. The caption for this photo reads, Homestead National Monument of America, Nebraska. The third photo is of a shoreline, whose dark brown surf-zone has been washed clean. Above the surf-zone low, tangles of plants can be seen. In the distance, light colored cliffs, topped with trees, meet the water. The water is rough with white-capping waves. The caption for this photo reads, Pictured Rocks National Lake Shore, Michigan. Beneath these photos is a wide brown bar with an image of a light tan ranger hat with a dark brown hat band on the left and some text in three columns on the right. In larger, bold font the text says, About the Midwest Region. Beneath that in smaller text is written, The Midwest Region of the National Park Service includes 13 states: North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. There are more than 50 National Park Service sites in the Midwest Region. These include parks, monuments, battlefields, historic sites, trails, lakeshores, and heritage areas. The third column of text begins with large bold font which reads, Mission of the National Park Service. Beneath that, in smaller italic font, reads, To conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such a manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. Beneath this text, in smaller, non-italic text it reads, From 1916 Organic Act establishing the National Park Service.",

In front and behind the rock slab are other, smaller slabs that stabilize the larger slab. The slabs are tan with lighter cream-colored and black variations running throughout. The slab and supports are surrounded by tall grasses. Words and images have been carved into the larger slab and are colored black. At the top left the largest font reads, River Critters. Next to that text is an image of a bird with wings upwardly outstretched. The bird has a ring around its neck, forked tail feathers, and a short, pointed beak. Beneath the large text and image of the bird is smaller text that reads, Environmental Play Area. Beneath that in still smaller text reads, funding for this play area was donated in appreciation of the civic contributions of George Krauss and his lifetime of service to the Omaha community. Beneath that text is a line with four egg-shapes in a cluster in the middle of the line. Beneath that line text reads, The America First Foundation John and Carmen Gottschalk Mike and Gail Yanney and friends at the Burlington Capital Group.",

The sturgeon is about five feet long and about two feet high at its dorsal fin, though it is laying slight curved at the middle. The sturgeon has a shovel-shaped head and long snout that comes to a rounded point at the end. The sturgeon’s pectoral fins curve toward its tail, as does its dorsal fin. It has a long, forked tail that is longer at the top than at the bottom. The sturgeon has black-colored rock inlaid for eyes. Directly behind the sturgeon, the words on the bench read, Sister river is the life blood of mother earth she holds the code of our ancestors and the prophesy of our future life. Love her. To the right of the center section, another section of the bench reads, Carolyn K. Fiscus Ho-chunk Nation of Nebraska. To the left of the center section is a button inset into the stone. It is surrounded by a 2 inch by 2 inch metal plate. Before the button is pushed it is illuminated red. Once pushed, the button turns to green. The word push is etched into the rock above the metal plate.",

Beneath that are larger, non-italicized words is written in two columns, Near Here the Corps of Discovery held its first council, making speeches and presenting gifts to the Otoe and Missouria. Communicating through an interpreter, members of the Expedition believed their message was clear. But were they? This meeting was the first of many formal and informal exchanges between members of the Expedition and tribes along the trail. The Expedition crossed the territories of more than 100 American Indian tribes. Oral tradition, passed from generation to generation within tribes, preserves the stories of the Expedition.",

The words above the Western serviceberry bunch are in two different fonts. The bold font reads Western Serviceberry, while italic font below the bold font reads Amelanchier alnifolia. Beneath the italic words is the image of the Western Serviceberry bunch. Seven oval-shaped and toothed leaves grow, each on their own stem. The leaves are shades of dark and light green and have one large center vein and smaller veins starting from the center and moving outward. There are eight serviceberries, each on their own stem, which are varying shades of dark red, light green and pink. Each berry has a star shape on the blossom end of the fruit. There are italicized words beneath the picture of the Western Serviceberry bunch. The words read, …the fruit is the same form but for the most part larger more luscious and of so deep a perple that on first sight you would think them black. Under the italicized words are non-italicized words that read, -Meriwether Lewis, July 17, 1805. Beneath those italicized words are more italicized words that read, Serviceberry was often used for pemmican: a mixture of animal fat, dried meat, and crushed berries. Serviceberries are also popular in the production of jams and jellies.",

In the foreground are pine trees and the silhouette of a bison. Beneath the black bar is an image of a river painting as a background for text. In the image, the river snakes through prairie grassland. The prairie is dotted with varying kinds of low bushes and grasses. There are some islands that emerge from the river water and have grass growing atop, as well. There is a downed tree rising from the water. In the distance are bluffs with vegetation growing atop them and trees in front. Above the bluffs is a pale blue sky with wispy clouds. Over the sky words are written in black. Large, italic words at the top read, Westwardly by the Waters. Beneath that in small, italic font is written, Albert Gallatin letter to Thomas Jefferson, April 13, 1803. Beneath that are two columns of small, non-italic words. They say, In 1803 the Missouri River carried the hopes of the youth United States in its dark and unpredictable waters. President Thomas Jefferson sought a “direct and practicable water communication across this continent, for the purpose of commerce.” The Missouri River would be a corridor to increased American trade and wealth. Traveling west against the current, the Expedition entered the lands of the recently acquired Louisiana Purchase. Along this watery path, the explorers would meet the people who had called this land home for many generations. With each mile of the Expedition traveled on the Missouri River, the United States pushed westward. In the lower right-hand corner of the image are italicized, white words that read, The Indians of this neighborhood inform us, that the Missouri is navigable nearly to its source, and … at a distance not exceeding half a [day’s] march, there is a large river… We believe this stream to be the…Columbia river…we shall probably find but little difficulty in passing to the Ocean. Beneath those words are smaller, non-italicized words also written in white. They say, Meriwether Lewis letter to his mother, March 31, 1805.",

    "bodyText": "In August 1804, the Corps of Discovery moved up the Missouri River along what is today western Iowa and eastern Nebraska.  The party camped on August 9 in a broad, wooded area where the river made a tight bend.  The Loess Hills could be spotted to the east whenever there were gaps in the trees. <br /> <br /> Between the 1830s and 1870s, the Missouri flooded many times and the main channel of the river migrated about two miles west, leaving behind a small oxbow lake.  Here is where local settlers of nearby Onawa, Iowa would create Blue Lake Park.  It became a part of the Iowa park system in 1924 when it was renamed Lewis and Clark State Park.<br /> <br /> Today, you’ll still find the semi-circular blue lake, surrounded by sand dunes and groves of huge cottonwood trees.  And you’ll enjoy an impressive visitor center built in 2013 that houses a display on the Expedition, along with full-size replicas of the keelboat, two pirogues, the iron boat, a dugout canoe, and a bull boat. From April 15 to October 1, another replica keelboat provides guests with short tours of the lake.  <br /> <br /> The 1930s-era Works Progress Administration (WPA) historic lodge still stands overlooking the water.  The park has more than 30 acres of picnic grounds with tables, fire grills, and drinking water.  And campers enjoy the large campground with electric and full hook-up sites, a modern restroom, and showers.  Those who seek water activities will enjoy a fine beach for sunbathing and swimming, and a boat ramp provides access to the lake.<br /> <br /> The park’s Lewis and Clark Festival is held in June each year, featuring movies, history enactors in frontier attire, bluegrass music and historic presentations.  <br /> <br /> The park is less than five miles from Onawa, Iowa on State Highway 175.  It is about 40 miles south of Sioux City.  To learn more, go to: <a href=\"https://www.iowadnr.gov/Places-to-Go/State-Parks/Iowa-State-Parks/parkdetails/parkid/610142\">https://www.iowadnr.gov/Places-to-Go/State-Parks/Iowa-State-Parks/parkdetails/parkid/610142</a><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

It was named after Baron Von Steuben, the Prussian military leader who helped American troops during the American Revolutionary War.31 Von Steuben wrote Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States, which was the U.S. military’s conduct manual at the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. </p> <p paraeid=\"{70f8b990-abea-452b-9b92-2dadbdf0b72e}{188}\" paraid=\"2120541905\">The fort burned down in 1790, and by 1797, settlers formed a small village near the site of the fort.

Black families, who were enslaved by the White families, were often forced to join them. Many Shawnee, Delaware, Haudenosaunee, and Cherokee people lived in the multicultural Ohio River Valley, as did folks of French, Spanish, and African descent. It was a place of commerce, a bustling highway full of traders and travelers. If a wilderness was a place with no humans, this was far from that.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{70f8b990-abea-452b-9b92-2dadbdf0b72e}{234}\" paraid=\"240008148\">For Lewis and others of his background in that era, “wilderness” meant any place without European-style settlements.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{70f8b990-abea-452b-9b92-2dadbdf0b72e}{240}\" paraid=\"358186229\">Steubenville was one link in the chain of America’s westward expansion.  </p>",

Delaware, Shawnee, Haudenosaunee, and many other people frequently took boats from here to the Mississippi River, or even all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0994e29f-2bbf-4e66-b546-66ad6fb03ac9}{36}\" paraid=\"1136177452\">By 1800, Pittsburgh was populated by European-American settlers and was known for its boat-building industry.</p> <p paraeid=\"{0994e29f-2bbf-4e66-b546-66ad6fb03ac9}{58}\" paraid=\"770267085\">Meriwether Lewis was familiar with this place: he had been stationed here two years earlier at Fort Fayette, an American fort that served as a supply depot for other forts on the Ohio.

Keelboats—in heavy use by the 1790s—could transport forty to fifty tons of material upriver quickly due to their long, narrow shape, heavy wooden keel, and pointed prow. Men used iron-tipped poles to push against the river bottom and cajole the boat upstream. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0994e29f-2bbf-4e66-b546-66ad6fb03ac9}{118}\" paraid=\"1821667116\">When Lewis arrived at Fort Fayette on the afternoon of July 15, 1803, he saw only the skeleton of the fifty-five-foot keelboat that was supposed to be ready for him.

The sculptures face inward, forming a small plaza with a river-like pathway with a bronze spiral inset in the center.</p> <p>Describing the artwork, Lillian Pitt states, “We wanted to do something that was in keeping with the diverse neighborhoods that were nearby, and we wanted to do something to honor the maple trees that used to grow on that spot. We ended up using legendary images from different tribal traditions to represent the diversity in Native American culture, and we placed these giant images on top of pillars in the shape of maple tree trunks.”</p> <p>The educational aspect of the Ainsworth project was enhanced by including a poetry project for students at the Ockley Green Middle School . Students learned to write poetry, and in keeping with the aims of the greenspace goals, were inspired to write about nature. The class was taught by collaborating artist and author, Gail Tremblay, who has worked frequently with Lillian over the years. Many of the resulting children’s poems are engraved onto the maple-tree columns that serve as the stands for the totems.</p> <p>Lillian Pitt is a Pacific Northwest Native American artist.

Fort Vancouver was built twenty years later.</p> <p>“The Land Bridge is a real link connecting back to the Klickitat Trail, Lewis and Clark, and the development of the Northwest. It completes a circle that’s been broken,” states Johnpaul Jones, acclaimed Native American architect and landscape architect who worked on the project along with designer Maya Lin.</p> <p>The Welcome Gate is the perfect creative entryway to the Land Bridge, which tells the story of river, land and people along the Columbia River. Artist Lillian Pitt states, “The site was built to honor the Chinookan people, who were awesome traders. They lived and traded from the mouth of the Columbia River in Astoria, all the way upriver to the area where my ancestors lived at Celilo. And this area they established within modern-day Vancouver was a major gathering place for them . . . and so it was here that they welcomed many people to trade.”</p> <p>About the author: Lillian Pitt is a Pacific Northwest Native American artist. She was born and raised on the Warm Springs reservation in Oregon and her ancestors lived in and near the Columbia River Gorge for over 10,000 years. The focus of her work is on creating contemporary fine art pieces that delight today’s art lovers, and at the same time, honor the history and legends of her people.</p> <p>For more information about Lillian Pitt’s work and a list of her other public art pieces to view in the area, please visit <a href=\"http://lillianpitt.com/\">http://lillianpitt.com</a>.</p>",

They named it Locust Grove, after the trees that grew nearby. The Clark-Croghans were wealthy and well-connected. Visitors to their house included James Monroe, Aaron Burr, and John J. Audubon. Many people lived at Locust Grove, as the Croghans enslaved about thirty-five individuals of African descent. These enslaved people built the estate’s houses and other buildings, did all the farming, and performed other labor as demanded by the Clark-Croghans. <br /> <br /> William Clark and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bios-of-the-ten-men-from-kentucky.htm\">York</a> grew up at nearby Mulberry Hill. This plantation was built and run by people enslaved by the Clarks—including York’s parents.<br /> <br /> Clark and Meriwether Lewis left the Louisville area in 1803. They were gone for three years. No one knew if they were still alive or how the journey had gone. <br /> <br /> When they finally arrived back in Louisville in 1806, Clark invited Lewis to stay with him at his sister’s home to rest and recuperate. They spent three weeks there. Settlers in Louisville had a party to welcome them back. York’s wife and family were surely happy to have him home, but their reunion was not recorded by local newspapers.  <br /> <br /> What had changed in Louisville while they were gone? <br /> <br /> More American settlers farmed on the lands around Louisville—lands that until recently, Indigenous families had called home. There were likely more Black people in the area, since White settlers who moved here (like the Clarks) brought with them the people they enslaved.  <br /> <br /> The hard work of these enslaved individuals meant that the ports of Louisville were probably bustling even more—more goods to trade up and down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, from Pittsburgh down to New Orleans.  <br /> <br /> Would it have felt differently to Lewis, Clark, and York? <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

It is located near the area where Meriwether Lewis and William Clark took eleven days in September of 1805 to traverse the grueling Lolo Pass through the Bitterroot Mountains. The dangerous terrain, harsh weather conditions, and near-starvation resulted in the most arduous portion of the entire expedition in which the men resorted to eating some of their own horses to survive. The visitor center is also located on the Nez Perce National Historic Trail, a path followed by a band of Nez Perce Indians while fleeing from the U.S. Calvary in 1877 to avoid being forced onto a reservation. <br /> <br /> At the visitor center, visitors will find information detailing Lewis and Clark's journey across the Bitterroot Mountains and the flight of the Nez Perce Indians, along with other historical, natural, and general information. As a major trailhead for cross-country skiing and snowmobiling, the center also has a warming hut for skiers and recreationists, a 24-hour restroom, a snowmobile parking log, and maps and information pertinent to winter visitors.<br /> <br /> For more information or current Lolo Pass conditions, visit <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nezperceclearwater/recarea/?recid=80112\">Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests - Lolo Pass Visitor Center (usda.gov)</a> or call (208) 942-3113. ",

Nez Perce people knew that September was too late in the season to attempt a journey over the high passes. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fb859070-754c-4026-b40d-c5aa0b7ae297}{149}\" paraid=\"618656357\">It was clear to the expedition members that this trail was well-traveled. Clark called parts of it “a good road” and mentioned several forks in the path that led to many places. The visitors passed areas they recognized as camping sites, seasonal housing, and fishing spots. They also passed streams for watering and hot springs for bathing. All of these places were well used by the many travelers who utilized this trail.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{fb859070-754c-4026-b40d-c5aa0b7ae297}{205}\" paraid=\"1046662107\">Think of a road trip you have been on. Do you stop for gas? For somewhere to stay the night? For a place to pick up some food? This trail had all of that.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{fb859070-754c-4026-b40d-c5aa0b7ae297}{211}\" paraid=\"1865641758\">But it was easiest to traverse in the summertime. Nez Perce people knew this trail was best traveled when the snow was melted and when the food—whether camas or animals—were again abundant.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{fb859070-754c-4026-b40d-c5aa0b7ae297}{239}\" paraid=\"591049877\">Once they crossed the trail, the travelers met Nez Perce people at Weippe Praire. On the return journey, after attempting to go too early in the spring—against the advice of Nez Perce people—Lewis and Clark turned back, waited, and then hired a local man to guide them along the route.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{b099a6dc-ccc2-4e77-b8c3-074d2340e6e1}{16}\" paraid=\"1230158571\">Lewis and Clark and their party were fortunate that Shoshone and Nez Perce people were willing to share knowledge of their homelands and assist these travelers on their journey.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The reservation stretches across 988,000 acres of wide-open plains and grasslands, and along both sides of the longest river in North America, the majestic Missouri River, or its native name of “Awati.”</p> <p>Lewis and Clark stayed with the Mandan when they passed through the Upper Missouri region on their expedition to the Northwest, including five months in the winter of 1804–1805. Sakakawea then joined the expedition as an interpreter and native guide. Because of her role in salvaging the expedition, she was honored with an image on the U.S. dollar coin. On the return trip, the expedition brought the Mandan chief Sheheke with them back to Washington, DC.</p> <p>The native lands of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people once extended from North Dakota across the Missouri River basin through western Montana and Wyoming. The Mandan, or “Nueta,” were prosperous farmers and traders, noted for their excellent maize cultivation and crafting of Knife River flint. The Hidatsa, or “Nuxbaaga” are considered a parent tribe to the Crow in Montana. The Arikara, or “Sahnish,” lived as a semi-nomadic people on the Great Plains.</p> <p>The Three Affiliated Tribes perfected the construction of earth lodge homes over hundreds of years of life on the harsh Northern Plains. Today, visitors can experience these sacred structures at the reconstructed Earthlodge Village on the shores of Lake Sakakawea near New Town. Also of interest to adventurers, is Buffalo Ranch, which provides tours and viewing of buffalo in their natural habitat.</p> <p>Three Affiliated Tribes Museum in New Town serves as a heritage center to display and preserve the history and culture of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara people. In addition, a new MHA Interpretative Center at New Town, North Dakota, will open in the fall of 2020, and dedicated to the Arikara people. The center features ten offices, a 250-seat event room, gift shop, coffee shop, kitchen for preparing traditional meals at events, and a classroom for cultural educational classes such as traditional food, beading, and tanning hides. An outside amphitheater with 500 seating is also under construction.</p> <p>In addition to the Missouri River, Lake Sakakawea offers excellent opportunities to enjoy the pristine waters of North Dakota. 4 Bears Casino & Lodge operates a yacht charter for public tours and private events, and Mossett Bay features boating, camping, and swimming. Also within the reservation, 760-acre McLean National Wildlife Refuge is managed as part of the Audubon National Wildlife Refuge Complex.</p> <p>4 Bears Casino & Lodge is a perfect base camp for visitors and offers rooms overlooking Lake Sakakawea, a full-service RV park, and lakeside cabins. Lodge amenities include an indoor pool, jacuzzi, sauna and exercise room. For fine dining, the Bison Room Steakhouse overlooks beautiful Lake Sakakawea and features North Dakota prime beef, fresh seafood flown in daily, and made-from-scratch desserts. Also inside 4 Bears Casino & Lodge, Cache Buffet features soups, salads, entrees and numerous specialty stations, including pizza, pasta and dessert bars. For a quick bite, the Corner Café serves burgers, fries, chicken strip baskets, and more.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The MHA Nation is located on the plains of North Dakota, and stretches over 988,000 acres. The Indian Reserve sits on wide-open tan bushy plains, green grasslands, and rolling hills as far as the eyes can see. The blue Missouri River runs through the middle of the reserve as well. All over the reserve are buildings called earth homes, of which the tribes built. These buildings are made of logs, branches, grass, sod, and earth. They take a dome shape, and have an opening at the top, and an entrance in the front.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Makoshika State Park is Montana’s largest state park, located just outside Glendive, along the Yellowstone River. It is a park of outstanding natural beauty, referenced in William Clark’s journal as the “birnt hills” from when Clark and his party camped in what is now the Glendive area on their return journey down the Yellowstone.</p> <p>Makoshika is a sprawling mass of badlands layered with color and awash in classic badland formations like caprocks, hoodoos and natural bridges. The habitat is almost entirely rugged badlands with stands of juniper and pine, with some open native prairie at the “top” of the park. Large mammals like mule deer and mountain lions (though they are rarely, if ever seen) inhabit the park. Native birds such as mountain bluebirds and turkey vultures return to Makoshika each year to breed. Many other bird species, including bald and golden eagles, can also be seen. Besides its outstanding natural beauty,</p> <p>Makoshika is also a world-class fossil bed and a place of incredible scientific importance, especially to paleontologists. The badlands of Makoshika are part of the celebrated Hell Creek Formation, famed worldwide as one of the richest caches of dinosaur fossils on the planet. Dinosaur fossils are routinely recovered from Makoshika, including the most popular dinosaurs like triceratops and Tyrannosaurus Rex. Several fossils of particular importance to science have been recovered from Makoshika.</p> <p>Dig expeditions from major scientific institutions such as the Museum of the Rockies, the Burpee Museum, the University of Wisconsin, Notre Dame University, and others come to the park every summer to search for new fossil finds.</p>",

Women also managed most of the building, framing the cottonwood posts and rafters, and filling the frame with willow branches, dried gasses and thick sod. Each house would take between seven and ten days to build and had to be reconstructed about every ten years. These homes were used until the late 19th century, when timber homes replaced the traditional style, and earth lodges became a ceremonial structure.</p> <p>Today, you can experience these sacred structures at the reconstructed Earthlodge Village on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation near New Town, North Dakota. Located on the picturesque shores of Lake Sakakawea, you can stay the night in an earth lodge, take a trail ride, hear stories of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara peoples from cultural interpreters, and experience living culture at powwows and other events throughout the year.</p>",

And to the surprise of Cameahwait, he knew one of them. It was his sister, Sacagawea, who had lived far away for years. And now she held a tiny baby in her arms.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6d317f15-90b1-46a8-ac45-733dc815989f}{38}\" paraid=\"200224464\">They jumped and danced, hugged and cried, overcome with this reunion that they might never have expected. Sacagawea saw others who she grew up with and tearfully embraced them, as well. She motioned to the visitors who she had been traveling with that she knew these people. They were her family.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>Middle Village History</h3> <p>Right along highway 101 on the north side of the Columbia River, east of Chinook, Washington, you’ll find Middle Village, the site of a significant Chinook village. For thousands of years, the Chinook people have lived along the Columbia River and their home near the river's mouth was strategically located to provide abundant food, such as salmon and shellfish. In addition, the nearby forests were home to game animals and the grasslands and marshes provided ample materials for making shelter, clothing and trade and household goods. The river provided a way for Chinook traders to travel to the south shore and up and down the Columbia.</p> <p>They developed a sophisticated, rich culture and enjoyed great success as traders. The waterway near Middle Village became a virtual trade \"water highway.\" During the 10 years before Lewis and Clark arrived overland at the this spot almost 90 trade ships from Europe and New England are documented to have crossed the Columbia River Bar to trade with Native Americans. These ships brought metal tools, blankets, clothing, beads, liquor and weapons to trade for beaver and sea otter pelts. By the time the Corps reached the site, the Chinook's had moved to their winter village and this village was unoccupied.<br /> <br /> In 2005, archeologists found abundant physical evidence to support the importance of the site as a Chinook trade village. More than 10,000 artifacts were uncovered, including trade beads, plates, cups, musket balls, arrowheads, Indian fish net weights and ceremonial items. The European artifacts are from both before and after the Corps' visit in 1805, and attest to the vitality of the Chinook social and economic life at the site.</p> <h3>Station Camp History</h3> <p>The Corps spent just 10 days here, but used Middle Village as a departure point for an overland trek to their first view of the Pacific Ocean and an exploration of the area. Historians called the spot \"Station Camp\" because it was Clark's primary survey station to produce a detailed and accurate map of the mouth of the Columbia River and surrounding area. This was the most detailed and accurate map he made during the entire trip.</p> <p>On Nov. 24, 1805, the explorers desperately needed a winter campsite, one rich with game and near friendly tribes who would trade for supplies. To assist in deciding where the Corps should winter, the captains took <em>\"Solictations of every individual.\" </em>This included <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/york.htm\">York</a>, who was an enslaved man, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sacagawea.htm\">Sacagawea</a>, a Lemhi Shoshone woman who was married to Toussaint Charbonneau. The majority chose to cross to the south side of the Columbia River, near modern-day Astoria, Oregon, to build winter quarters, which soon would be known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-clatsop-or.htm\">Fort Clatsop</a>. </p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>The Middle Village - Station Camp site focuses on the Chinook Indian Nation history, as well as telling the story of early contact, the Corps', and the town of McGowan. Middle Village - Station Camp was dedicated on August 18, 2012.<br /> <br /> The site is open during daylight hours. Check in at the visitor center at Fort Clatsop to pay any <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">park fees</a> and get additional information.</p> <p><br /> Middle Village - Station Camp is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a></p>",

Lewis wrote, “the water of this river possesses a peculiar whiteness, being about the colour of a cup of tea with the admixture of a tablespoonfull of milk. from the colour of it’s water we called it Milk river.” They correctly surmised that this was the “River which scolds at all others” or “Ah-mâh-tâh, ru-shush-sher” which the Hidatsa had first told them about during their stay at Fort Mandan. Whitehouse noted that, “We halted at a point above the Mouth of this River to dine, where Some of our party went a short distance up this River […they reported] that the River continued its breadth and depth as high up as where they had been—the Water Clear, and deep; the banks tolerably high, and the land very rich, and the country fertile, being partly Priaries and some Skirts of woodland.” <br /> <br /> The Milk River rises in the Rocky Mountains of northern Montana and flows for 721 miles, running north into the Canadian province of Alberta, and then southeast to the confluence with the Missouri River near Fort Peck, Montana. The distinctive color of the Milk River is the result of fine clay and silt sediments that erode along the river basin in Alberta and remain suspended in the waters. Ownership of properties sur-rounding the confluence is mixed between the <a href=\"http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake-Projects/Missouri-River-Dams/Fort-Peck/\">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.fortpecktribes.org/\">Fort Peck Indian Reservation</a>, and privately-owned land.<br /> <br /> Learn more at <a href=\"http://www.lewis-clark.org/article/1420 \">Discovering Lewis and Clark.</a>",

Since time immemorial, the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers have been sources of water for communities living along its banks. Indigenous families planted crops of corn, beans, and squash along the rivers. They relied on the regular flooding to both water the crops and provide nutrients to the soil. The land along the Mississippi was fertile enough to support the growth of large cities like Cahokia.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f06f6517-ccd2-4244-bcf8-55601902afd2}{55}\" paraid=\"1372586299\">Located near the confluence of two great rivers, Cahokia was a hub for trade and transportation. During its golden age between 1000 and 1350 CE, the population of Cahokia may have reached as many as 20,000 people. People from the Northern Great Plains used canoes and bison-skin boats to travel to this trading center. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f06f6517-ccd2-4244-bcf8-55601902afd2}{81}\" paraid=\"75781732\">The Spanish traveled up the Mississippi River in the 1500s. The French came a century later, followed by the British. Throughout this period, European traders and trappers used the same water routes that Indigenous travelers had utilized for millennia.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f06f6517-ccd2-4244-bcf8-55601902afd2}{117}\" paraid=\"869016423\">European powers fought over control of this river.To them, mastery of the river also meant dominion over the surrounding lands. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f06f6517-ccd2-4244-bcf8-55601902afd2}{141}\" paraid=\"964100258\">European settlers brought with them enslaved people of African descent. Black men worked on the trading vessels that traveled between towns on the Mississippi. The river could also be a source of freedom: many of those enslaved used the river and its thickly vegetated banks as a means of escape.</p> <p paraeid=\"{f06f6517-ccd2-4244-bcf8-55601902afd2}{171}\" paraid=\"627053825\">When Meriwether Lewis and William Clark arrived at the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers on a colonial mission in 1803, they entered a long tradition of people traveling the two rivers. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Moulton, the nation’s definitive editor of the Lewis and Clark journals, who served as the Center’s first In-Resident Scholar.<br /> <br /> Exhibits inside the center present interesting information and displays about the animals, birds, plants, fish, boats, and medicinal practices of the journey.  A 32-minute film is shown in the Center’s theatre and provides a sense of the sights and sounds of what it would have been like to travel with the brave explorers over 200 years ago.  And outside you can explore a full-sized replica of a Plains Indian earth lodge -- imagine living in the one-room home with your extended family of three or four generations. <br /> <br /> Also on the grounds are numerous trails of a variety of distances where you can hike through meadows and heavily wooded hills, and even escape to an overlook of the Missouri River in the valley below. <br /> As you walk up to the Center’s front doors, you can’t miss the full-size, 55-foot-long replica keelboat waiting to be explored.<br /> <br /> Throughout the year, the staff plans several special events which bring the story of the Lewis and Clark Expedition to life. Be sure to check their website for current hours, fees, and a list of upcoming events: https://lewisandclarkvisitorcenter.org.  The website also features a section especially for teachers and home-schoolers.  <br /> <br /> Inside the Center is a large gift shop filled with books, unique gifts, apparel, jewelry, and more.  The Missouri River Basin Lewis and Clark Visitor Center is located at 100 Valmont Drive, Nebraska City, Nebraska, which is approximately 45 miles south of Omaha.  ",

Hidatsa people referred to the river as the Yellow Stone (miʔciiʔriaashiish), named for the bluffs of yellow sandstone that frame the river in eastern Montana. French traders translated the Hidatsa name to French and called the river the Roche Jaune (“roche” means rock and “jaune” means yellow).  </p> <p paraeid=\"{43f8e104-53d9-4503-981a-731287d39cef}{22}\" paraid=\"478430226\">When Lewis and Clark finally reached the confluence, the party split up to determine which river was the Yellowstone and which was the Missouri. While they made observations based on the stars and the size of the river, Sacagawea told them which river she thought they should take—she had been here before.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{43f8e104-53d9-4503-981a-731287d39cef}{50}\" paraid=\"890479293\">The southern fork led to Shoshone communities, where Sacagawea had lived until she was twelve years old. Lewis and Clark were aiming for Shoshone territory. Sacagawea’s connections there were their best chance to procure horses to carry their boats, equipment, and supplies over the Rocky Mountains.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{43f8e104-53d9-4503-981a-731287d39cef}{90}\" paraid=\"308827378\">Reaching the Yellowstone was a familiar sight for Sacagawea and a cause for celebration for everyone. Lewis wrote that everyone was “in good health, and much pleased at having arrived at this long wished for spot, and in order to add in some measure to the general pleasure which seemed to pervade our little community, we ordered a dram [a serving of whiskey] to be issued to each person.” <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/pierre-cruzatte.htm\">Pierre Cruzatte</a> got out his fiddle and soon everyone was singing, dancing, and celebrating.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

S. of 30 yds wide Called big Monetou.” He documented that a “Short distance above the mouth of this Creek, is Several Courious Paintings and Carveing in the projecting rock of Limestone inlade with white red & blue flint, of a verry good quallity, the Indians have taken of this flint great quantities. We landed at this Inscription and found it a Den of rattle Snakes, we had not landed 3 minutes before three verry large Snakes wer observed on the Crevises of the rocks & Killed— at the mouth of the last mentioned Creek Capt. Lewis took four or five men & went to Some Licks or Springs of Salt water from two to four miles up the Creek on Rt. Side.”<br /> <br /> Manitou and Moniteau are variations on the Algonquian name for the Great Spirit. The eponymous creek and limestone bluffs were likely first so-named by early European explorers due to pictographic represen­tations of the Manitou and other related symbols. The construction of a tunnel for the Missouri–Kansas– Texas Railroad in the 1890s obliterated a large segment of the bluff along the west side of Moniteau Creek. Although the pictographs described by Clark at this location are no longer extant, there are preserved examples about four miles downriver at Torbett Spring. The Manitou Bluffs area is publicly accessible via the <a href=\"https://mostateparks.com/park/katy-trail-state-park\">Katy Trail State Park</a> at Rocheport.",

Near the mound to the N. stands a small town lately laid out called Elizabeth-town there are but about six or seven dwelling houses in it as yet, in this town there are several mounds of the same kind of the large one but not near as large, in various parts of this bottom the traces of old intrenchments are to be seen tho' they are so imperfect that they cannot be traced in such manner as to make any complete figure; for this enquire I had not leasure. I shall therefore content myself by giving a discription of the large mound and offering some conjectures with regard to the probable purposes for which they were intended by their founders; who ever they may have been.— </p> </blockquote> <p paraeid=\"{ac88bdd6-65e2-45f2-8148-90353cf277e5}{59}\" paraid=\"222227045\">In 1866, Elizabethtown and Mound City, established in 1831, were consolidated into the town of Moundsville. The name was chosen in honor of the many burial mounds built by the Adena Culture more than 2,000 years ago, the largest of which is known as Grave Creek Mound. Today, Moundsville offers a multitude of attractions, including the Four Seasons Pool & Fitness Center, a riverfront park, several playgrounds, and many wonderful shopping and dining opportunities.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ac88bdd6-65e2-45f2-8148-90353cf277e5}{97}\" paraid=\"429009061\">Those interested in Native cultures and the Adena burial mounds will enjoy a visit to the Grave Creek Mound & Archaeological Complex, which houses artifacts and exhibits focused on the life of the Adena People. For more information and operating hours, visit their website at <a href=\"http://www.wvculture.org/museum/GraveCreekmod.html\">WVDCH ­Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex</a>. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ac88bdd6-65e2-45f2-8148-90353cf277e5}{132}\" paraid=\"1229771996\">The West Virginia Penitentiary, built in 1876 in the Gothic architectural style, closed in 1995.

For Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery, their experiences with the Warm Springs Tribe was at times cordial and friendly, but other times distrustful and hostile. The Celilo Falls and The Dalles sites on the Columbia River were considered one of the most important fishing and trading centers of the northwest region. The importance of this area and the people who lived there were overlooked by the Expedition.</p> <p>Today, the Museum at Warm Springs provides visitors the opportunity to learn about this very same land, and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, which now represents the Wasco, Warm Springs and Paiute Peoples. The Paiutes were moved to the reservation in the late 1870s following the Bannock wars. Entering the museum begins with a walk next to a live stream, then into a circular stone drum, and up to an exquisite door with handles shaped like a bustle. The exterior, designed to resemble a traditional encampment among beautiful cottonwood trees, is situated alongside Shitike Creek which empties into the majestic Deschutes River. The impressive museum entry is the first glimpse into a rich, unique culture.</p> <p>The 25,000 square-foot museum provides an impressive sight to the public as well as a safe conservatory for the traditional treasures of the Tribes. Its mission includes educating the public as well as preserving the history, culture, and traditions of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. “We wanted the museum to tell the story of our People,” explains Delbert Frank, Sr., President of the museum’s Board of Directors in 1993 and an influential member of the Tribal Council. “We wanted it to tell the truth. To educate both the public and our own children. To tell them who we are.”</p> <p>After entering the building, the stream continues as a gray polished slate floor. Visitors encounter huge columns of what was once tall native trees of the Reservation. This is the main lobby of The Museum, and the entrance to the Permanent Exhibit Hall.</p> <p>The Permanent Exhibit details the culture and history of The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. “Technically one of the best unified exhibition plans in any museum in America,” states James Nason, Curator of New World Ethnology, Burke Museum, University of Washington, commenting on the permanent exhibit gallery. The curatorial department has one of the largest and most complete Native American artifact collections in the country, including an exquisite collection of Plateau Native American artifacts.</p> <p>The museum also features a rotating exhibit gallery, library and archives, education room with cooking facilities, conference/board room, artifact collection space and office, and an administrative area. The gift shop offers a tremendous array of locally-made beadwork and arts, Pendleton products, huckleberry products, jewelry, books and traditional and contemporary Native American music. Performances, demonstrations and other public events are held at a small outside amphitheater.</p> <p>In addition to special exhibits, annual events at the museum include the Warm Springs Tribal Member Art Exhibits in October, and the Annual Warm Springs Tribal Youth Art Exhibit in January.</p>",

A newer section covered with grey siding extends towards the front on the left, forming one side of a cement courtyard, 35 feet wide and 70 feet long. The right side and front of the courtyard are framed by broad wooden columns with a thick header. Banners hang from the right side of the header. The courtyard is reached by five cement steps on the front and right. To avoid the steps, follow the sloping sidewalk along the right side to the rear of the courtyard.<br /><br />At the far left of the building front is a bronze statue of Jim Bridger, 1804-1881. He stands, a horse's head drooping to his right, with right hand raised to shade his eyes as he gazes into the distance.<br /><br />The main entrance is at the rear of the courtyard through double doors in the older, brick part of the building. The welcome desk is directly in front of you as you enter.",

Currently, the museum possesses 600 art pieces, though new pieces continue to be added. Traveling exhibits are viewed by over 110,000 people per year, with visitors coming from all 50 states and over 40 countries. Not only does the museum strive to support diversity and versatility in its exhibits, but it also seeks to educate and grow the skills of quilters around the world. For those interested in learning to quilt, workshops are conducted throughout the year for people all skill levels. Especially popular is the annual School Block Challenge which encourages students to create a 16”x16” quilt block and gains national participation.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bb5a4c7f-3a56-499d-b43d-04ef272832fa}{205}\" paraid=\"2082011353\">The museum offers plenty of options for engagement including a volunteer program, membership program, and tour groups. Programs and gift shop merchandise are regularly rotated so visitors may experience the variety of skills, techniques, and designs utilized in creating such amazing works of art.

    "bodyText": "Near the old Cannon Beach Elementary School in Cannon Beach, Oregon, lies Necus’ Park. This small public park was once the site of a prosperous native village, known as NeCus’ to the local tribes, prior to colonization.<br /> <br /> It was here, in January 1806, that William Clark and a few members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, while searching for a 105-foot beached whale, met with members of the local tribes from whom they bought whale oil and blubber. Expedition member Hugh McNeal also nearly met his end here because of a plot to steal his clothes and blanket by a man visiting from a distant village. McNeal was saved by a Tillamook woman who, upon realizing she couldn’t stop him from going with the man, alerted the other men of the village to the danger.  <br /> Today, Necus’ Park is incredibly important to the Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes. In 2016, a 10-foot cedar statue of a young Clatsop man, called a welcoming pole, was erected along the bank of Ecola Creek at the park’s edge. Carved by native artist, Guy Capoeman, the welcoming pole commemorates a time, prior to the arrival of Europeans, when the tribes traveling to the Columbia River or Nehalem Bay would visit one another and attend celebrations and potlatches (gift-giving events to celebrate friendship between members).<br /> <br /> The statue is one of the highlights on the Cannon Beach Public Art Walking Tour, a 1.5-mile self-guided tour through the city. For more information on the walking tour, visit <a href=\"https://www.cannonbeach.org/things-to-do/cannon-beach-walks/public-art/\">Public Art Walking Tour | Cannon Beach, Oregon</a>.",

Each was home to an extended family—some 100 people may have lived in the village. They caught fish, and when the tide was low, they gathered crabs, mussels, snails, and barnacles. Some men in the village hunted seals and sea lions. To walk down to the beach, they carved handholds in the rocky cliff.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{143}\" paraid=\"1465818087\">White men and a Shoshone woman, members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, arrived at NeCus’ in January 1806 during a time of bounty and commotion: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cannon-beach-oregon.htm\">a huge whale</a> had just washed ashore!  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{185}\" paraid=\"203910835\">The whale blessed them with enough food for themselves and to trade with their neighbors, Clatsop and Chinookan people. Nehalem people were hard at work boiling the whale for oil and cutting up the blubber, to prepare it to eat or sell.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{213}\" paraid=\"348821851\">William Clark wanted to buy some of the whale blubber and oil, trading glass beads for it. He bought so much that some people might have wondered how he planned to carry it back. He did so with the help of others in his party, including Sacagawea. Maybe the people of NeCus’ Village were excited to have such a bustling town with so many visitors—what an opportunity, what a big party! Maybe some children liked meeting all of the visitors from across the region. Older people may have been happy for an excuse to reunite with old friends. And maybe some people were just plain tired of smelling the rotting whale, even if they liked the taste of blubber.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2e553370-7fce-44b3-9d51-8197b92d1518}{12}\" paraid=\"154739475\">Whatever they felt, NeCus’ Village was the place to be that January. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The Neill family lived in it from 1774 to 1795 on 262 acres that is now part of Schenley Park, one of two large city parks in Squirrel Hill. It was first built and occupied by a soldier stationed at Ft. Pitt. The complete story can be accessed by the link to the “Lewis and Clark Trail Experience,” on the Home Page of the Squirrel Hill Historical Society – <a href=\"https://squirrelhillhistory.org/\">https://squirrelhillhistory.org/</a></p> <p>The historic connection between the Neill Log House and Lewis and Clark’s Expedition is believed to have taken place in May of 1803, when Meriwether Lewis traveled to Pittsburgh to launch the keelboat he had constructed up-river from Pittsburgh. Several months later, he began his trip down the Ohio River from the Point, the confluence of the Three Rivers in Pittsburgh and early Gateway to the West.</p> <p>From here, Lewis traveled to the Falls of the Ohio at Clarksville, Indiana, across from Louisville, Kentucky. Soon after, he met up with William Clark.  It is said that “When they shook hands in Clarksville, the Lewis and Clark Expedition began.” More crew members were added and they traveled to winter quarters outside of St. Louis, in final preparation to journey west. This was all after earlier preparation on the rivers of Pittsburgh, where their keelboat was first constructed and launched.</p> <p>May of 1803 was Lewis’ second trip to Pittsburgh, having traveled earlier as a young Virginian volunteer to put-down the Whiskey Rebellion. On both trips, he journeyed from Maryland to Pittsburgh on the ancient Nemacolin Indian Trail, later called Braddock’s Road. There is also evidence that Lewis later traveled with two wagons, close-by the Neill Log House, on his last 4 miles overland to the Point. Early travelers on the Nemacolin Trail through what is now Schenley Park would water their horses at Snyder’s Springs, source of the historic Catahecassa Fountain at the Neill Log House. Research for all of this appears in articles on our linked site.</p> <p>Squirrel Hill is a scenic residential city neighborhood with a vibrant central business district, and the largest green-space in Metropolitan Pittsburgh with historic Frick and Schenley Parks. It is also home to both Chatham and Carnegie-Mellon Universities, and near the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Institute. Great dining, culture, recreation and, of course, history are all abundant here. Look for links to all of this on our website.</p> <p>To experience Squirrel Hill’s history, geography and notable sights, go to the interactive map of our neighborhood.

Bring your non-motorized boat or sign up for a<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/paddle-tours.htm\"> ranger guided canoe and kayak trip</a> during the summer months.</p> <p>The launch is part of the Lewis and Clark Columbia River Water Trail, a 146-mile stretch of water that follows the explorers' route on the Lower Columbia River from Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean, near Ilwaco, Wash. For more detailed information go to the<a href=\"https://www.estuarypartnership.org/water-trails/columbia-river\">Lower Columbia River Water Trail website</a>.</p> <p>Netul Landing also marks one end of the new Lewis and Clark River Trail. The river trail is a 1.5-mile gentle walk along the river to Fort Clatsop.

    "bodyText": "<h3>The Corps of Discovery and the Nez Perce</h3> <p>Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and their Corps of Discovery traveled through Nez Perce country in the fall of 1805. After some initial apprehension, the Nez Perce embraced the expedition and provided help when the party was nearing starvation. After journeying further west, Lewis and Clark returned in the spring of 1806. They spent more time with the Nez Perce than any other tribe encountered during their expedition.</p> <p>Lewis and Clark engaged in a diplomatic exchange with Nez Perce chiefs. The captains sought to establish trading posts and intertribal peace in the region. The Nez Perce were willing to cooperate as long as guns and other weaponry were provided to the tribe.</p> <p>Like their Shoshone neighbors, the Nez Perce were without guns or ammunition. This left them vulnerable to their enemies who could obtain weapons from Canadian traders and also hampered their ability to hunt buffalo. The Nez Perce were known for their horsemanship and breeding, especially the Appaloosa horses, which provided a great advantage in traversing long distances in order to hunt and fish.</p> <h3>The Flight of 1877</h3> <p>Chief Joseph’s father refused to sign the 1863 Treaty. On June 15, 1877, The Wallowa Band of  Nez Perce (Nimíipuu) fled their homelands in Wallowa Valley in northeastern Oregon to escape being forced to move to the reservation in Idaho. They hoped to evade violent engagements with settlers and the United States Army and find a more peaceful existence living according to their traditions. An estimated 750 to 800 men, women and children and 250 warriors were pursued by military which included the 7th Infantry and 7th Calvary of the U.S. Army. They set off near Wallowa Lake in eastern Oregon and traveled a circuitous 1,170 miles over five months through Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. The Tribe planned to ally with the Crow for security, but when the Crow refused aid, the Tribe headed toward the Canadian border.</p> <h3>Route through Yellowstone National Park</h3> <p>They entered Yellowstone National Park on August 23. Only a small part of the route taken by the Nez Perce who fled from the US Army in 1877 went through Yellowstone (established in 1872), and they largely eluded their pursuers while there.</p> <p>During their time here, the Nez Perce encountered about 25 visitors in the young park, some more than once. Warriors took hostage or attacked several of these tourists, killing two. The group continued traveling through the park and over the Absaroka Mountains into Montana. </p> <h3>Nez Perce Commemorative Sites in Yellowstone</h3> <p>Although none of the officially designated historic sites associated with the Nez Perce are located in Yellowstone, the historic trail goes through the park, and it is considered a sacred place by many Nez Perce who have continued to honor their ancestors and carry on their memories through ceremonies conducted in the park.</p> <h3>End of the Flight</h3> <p>Leaving Yellowstone, the Nez Perce continued their flight to Canada. Along the way, the Nez Perce warriors valiantly fought U.S. military and citizen volunteers across a series of battles. But starved and exhausted from the journey and persistent clashes, the brave Chief Joseph surrendered following a battle near Bears Paw Mountains in Montana, less than 40 miles from the Canadian border. It is here that it is believed the flight ended and Chief Joseph said, “From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.”<br /> <br /> Led by Chief White Bird, nearly 300 Nez Perce men, women and children managed to escape the battle at Bears Paw and make their way into Canada where they joined Sitting Bull and the Lakota near Fort Walsh. Following surrender, the Nez Perce were sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and eventually to reservations in Oklahoma, where deplorable conditions led to the death of most babies born on the Indian Territory. Today, the trail represents a sacred journey, connecting the surviving Nez Perce people to the past, present and future.</p> <h3><strong>Auto Tours:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Travelers can retrace the Nez Perce National Historical Trail by car along more than 1,500 miles of federal, state and county roads narrated by the Auto Route, with trail signs along the way.</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/maps-pubs/?cid=fsbdev3_055663\">Auto Tour Pamphlets </a>with maps, history and points of interest of all eight segments of the trail</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=45.890008,-116.828613&spn=1.911731,3.295898&hl=en&msa=0&z=8&source=embed&ie=UTF8&mid=zv7KavdVnCwU.kid9pjyMdX-c\">Google Map </a>of Nez Perce Historic Trail Auto Tour</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Hiking/Horseback Tours</strong></h3> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.discovernw.org/store_1877-nez-perce-flight-nez-perce-nee-me-poo-national-historic-trail-map_18998.html\">Trail Map </a>with modern-day travel routes and sites to visit along the trail.</li> <li>Essential Trail Companion: Following the Nez Perce Trail, A Guide to the Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trail with Eyewitness Accounts by Cheryl Wilfong</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPwhQoY6BdkOyoCAPkATlA!/?ss=110199&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=null&navid=151120000000000&pnavid=151000000000000&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&ttype=main&pname=Nez%20Perce%20National%20Historic%20Trail-%20Outdoor%20Safety%20&%20Ethics\">Outdoor Safety & Ethics </a>&<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/home/?cid=stelprdb5245913\"> FAQs</a></li> <li>Each summer, the Nez Perce Trail Foundation offers a week-long driving, hiking and camping <a href=\"http://nezpercetrail.net/summer-educational-trail-tour/\">educational tour </a>of the trail, visiting sites that include Wallowa Valley, Lolo Trail, Nez Perce National Historical Park, Big Hole Battlefield and Tamkaliks Celebration & Friendship Feast.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Quick Facts:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Bear Paw Battlefield is the site of the final conflict of the Nez Perce War and Flight of 1877.</li> <li>Beartooth All-American Road: Lush forests become alpine tundra in just a few miles on the highest elevation road in the Northern Rockies, with access to Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>The Chief <a href=\"https://travelwyoming.com/listing/yellowstone-national-park/chief-joseph-scenic-byway\">Joseph Scenic Byway in northwest Wyoming</a> links the town of Cody with the Beartooth Highway and the Northeast Gate of Yellowstone National Park.

    "audioDescription": "Nez Perce National Historic Trail921 wordsThere are 4 sections in this description.Section 1 (314 words)You are standing in front of a large wayside exhibit located alongside Nez Perce Creek Pullout. The exhibit kiosk is trimmed with brown wood and shaded by a shingled gable roof; it stands atop a low stone base. There is one panel on each side of the exhibit. The panel on the north side of the kiosk is entitled \"\"Chance Encounter.\" A large painting features several Native American people-men, women, and children-either sitting or standing in a grassy meadow. In the center of the painting, one man sits atop a pale horse. A caption on the painting's right side tells us:\"On a summer night in 1877, hundreds of \"non-treaty\" Nez Perce-bands refusing confinement on a reservation-camped near here. They journeyed 1,170 miles (1,883 kilometers) in their quest for freedom.\"More text below the exhibit title reads: \"Across the meadow, a fire burned in the campsite of nine tourists on the night of August 23, 1877. The Cowan party had unknowingly camped near hundreds of Nez Perce men, women, and children who were under violent pursuit by the United States Army. Through the darkness, the Cowan's firelight flickered and was spotted by Hemene Moxmox (Yellow Wolf) and other Nez Perce scouts. With the heightened instincts of war-torn hearts, the scouts entered the camp at daybreak. They dared not risk the Army learning the whereabouts of their people. Instead of taking chances, they took the tourists with them.\"The coming hours revealed human emotions found in any war: fear, anger, and compassion. A Nez Perce leader, Wa-wook-ke-ya Was Sauw (Lean Elk), released the campers with a warning to stay hidden, but the small group was later overtaken. This time tempers flared. George Cowan was shot and left for dead, but eventually made a full recovery. Others sustained shots or escaped. Emma Cowan and her siblings were released unharmed the following day.\"Section 2 (236 words)The panel on the south side of the exhibit kiosk is entitled \"Nez Perce War: Journey through Yellowstone.\" Text below the exhibit title reads:\"On August 23, 1877, more than 600 men, women, and children camped in the woods near here. Sustained by courage, social structure, and knowledge of the land, they were midway from their homeland in Eastern Oregon to the hope of freedom in Canada. They carried with them the burden of grief from the loss of their homeland and the sharp pain of losing loved ones.\"With them were two thousand horses. Behind them were hundreds of soldiers. Within them were strength, endurance, and the ability to face enemies and atrocities. This was the Nez Perce War of 1877.\"Section 3 (228 words)More text highlights the history of the times leading up to the conflict and the war itself: \"Mounting Pressure. For more than two decades, the Nez Perce endured pressure to sign away their homeland and live on a reservation. In I 877, United States government representatives ordered \"non-treaty\" Nez Perce-bands standing firmly against confinement-onto the reservation.\"The War Begins. Conflict erupted, followed by battle in White Bird Canyon. The soldiers were quickly defeated. General Howard arrived with reinforcements, but the Nez Perce eluded them in rugged terrain.\"As the war continued, Chiefs Toohoolhoolzote, Five Wounds, Rainbow and others strategized tactics. Chief Heinmot Tooyalakeket (Chief Joseph, left) led the elderly men, women, and children.\"\"Tragedy at Dawn. The Nez Perce gained many miles on General Howard. But on August 9th, Colonel Gibbon's soldiers swooped into the sleeping Nez Perce camp, killing men, women, and children. Warriors leapt to defend their people.\"Like many others, Chief Joseph's wife was wounded severely at Big Hole. In combat, he protected their newborn in his arms.\"Hope and Heartache. The Nez Perce out-maneuvered and battled their foes repeatedly, upheld both young and old, and withstood unthinkable losses. Under unrelenting pursuit, they traveled 1,170 miles, eventually falling short on supplies. In the bitter cold of late September, just 40 miles from Canada, they were overtaken. With hearts heavy and torn, they surrendered.\"Section 4 (231 words)Also featured on this panel is a large map drawing detailing the route of the Nez Perce and the commands of General Howard, Colonel Gibbon, Colonel Sturgis, and Colonel Miles during the Nez Perce War of 1877. A half dozen army forts are also marked on the map.The route of the Nez Perce leads from the west in Oregon Territory, northeast through Idaho Territory toward Fort Missoula in western Montana Territory, then south and east again to Camas Meadows in eastern Idaho Territory. From here, the route heads further east and then north through Wyoming Territory to Canyon Creek in south central Montana Territory and finally through Bear Paw in the north central section of Montana Territory. Indicated by black \"x\" marks are battle sites at Clearwater and White Bird Canyo",

Others enlisted when they signed up.  <br /> <br /> Kentucky was a place where White settlers were arriving and Shawnee, Delaware, and other Indigenous people were still living. Many of the men from Kentucky had experience surviving in the woods, as well as on the infrastructure left by Indigenous residents of the valley.  <br /> <br /> The men that William Clark recruited in Kentucky are often called the “Nine Young Men from Kentucky.” This term comes from the 1814 narrative of Lewis and Clark’s journey, published by Nicholas Biddle. It accounts for men who joined with Clark at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/falls-of-the-ohio-old-clarksville-site.htm\">Falls of the Ohio between Louisville and Clarksville</a>. It does not include York, even though York joined at this time and also lived in Kentucky, where he was enslaved by Clark. <br /> <br /> York was about the same age as William Clark. Clark “inherited” York when Clark’s father died. York had a wife (he was one of only four expedition members who were married). <br /> <br /> The lens through which we view the Lewis and Clark Expedition is often still influenced by those who wrote the journals and those who published accounts of them.  <br /> <br /> After the “Nine Young Men” (details on the individuals <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bios-of-the-ten-men-from-kentucky.htm\">here</a>), other recruits enlisted when the expedition was at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/camp-dubois-illinois.htm\">Camp Dubois</a>.

Sergeant John Ordway observed that “the water Shoots in to the Missiouri verry Swift, & has thrown the Sand out, which makes a Sand bar & Sholes from the mouth a considerable distance.” The shoals and the rapids, according to William Clark, made the river “not navagable for even Canoos without Great difficulty.” Clark managed to eke his way a few miles up the river, however, where he saw an empty Ponca village (everyone was out on a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/independence-creek.htm\">bison hunt</a>). </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{58}\" paraid=\"787271977\">To Ponca people, the rivers and surrounding landscape are a source of sustenance, physically and spiritually. This is their homeland.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{80}\" paraid=\"1310773078\">Stories passed down by Ponca elders describe the area around the Niobrara as Wašé, or plenteous. The silty deposits in the river bottoms created fertile soil for cedar, oak, and elm trees. Ponca families farmed in the bottomlands, growing corn, squash, and pumpkins. Fish flourished at the confluence of the Missouri and Niobrara Rivers. The high bluffs and sheltered gullies teemed with mule deer, bison, geese, and other game.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{92}\" paraid=\"1539239419\">Ponca camps and villages could be found as far north as the Black Hills of South Dakota and as far south as the Platte River. But, according to Ponca elder Louis Headman, the Niobrara “was the last area of land they considered theirs before the removal” to reservations in Kansas and Oklahoma.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p paraeid=\"{154f891e-a0db-4853-ad9f-37e83e605222}{241}\" paraid=\"8\">On March 30, 2009, the United States Congress designated the <a href=\"http://www.northernplainsheritage.org/\">Northern Plains National Heritage Area (NOPL NHA)</a> into existence. The Northern Plains Heritage Foundation is the coordinating entity for the heritage area who celebrates traditional and modern native cultures, farming and ranching heritage, and its infinite legacies. </p> <p paraeid=\"{154f891e-a0db-4853-ad9f-37e83e605222}{252}\" paraid=\"9\">The Northern Plains National Heritage Area is rooted in the historical significance of the Missouri River. The first peoples traversed this landscape in the Paleo and Archaic eras. Settlements of the region trace back to the ancestral homelands of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people who utilized the fertile Missouri River bottomlands for agrarian purposes. The Oceti Sakowin ( known as “The Great Sioux Nation” in the 19th century) have ancestral ties to this nationally important lived-in landscape.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6435e32d-15f2-4c3d-8cb8-a7b28a6a5cee}{5}\" paraid=\"10\">Lewis and Clark spent 1803-1804 wintering here and the Mandan and Hidatsa people helped them during their long journey. This is also where Lewis & Clark met Sakakawea (or \"Sacagawea\"). Indigenous communities formed relationships with the early European fur traders from the 1730s to the 1860s. Numerous European artists, such as George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, dedicated time visiting the area to paint portraits of the Mandan people and the landscapes they inhabited. Through this, the Mandan are one of the most documented indigenous groups in all of North America.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6435e32d-15f2-4c3d-8cb8-a7b28a6a5cee}{20}\" paraid=\"11\">With westward expansion and the tension created by encroaching Euro-American settlements, the area became the battleground for the U.S. Dakota Wars of 1862-1865. The arrival of Jay Cooke’s Northern Pacific Railroad to the area in 1872 brought a new wave of European immigration to the region. With the establishment of the railroads, global immigration descended into the area. In 1883, the Northern Pacific Railroad completed construction of a permanent bridge that spanned the Missouri River at Bismarck. Completion of the bridge in 1883 coincided with the first agricultural economic “boom” in Dakota Territory. Immigrant farmers established cooperative and social activities that influenced local politics to push for their own economic agency. In 1919, a North Dakota state-owned Mill, a state Elevator, and the Bank of North Dakota were established to allow farmers and ranchers better local market control. </p> <p

    "bodyText": "<p>Founded in 1853, Oak Hill Cemetery has a historic 175-acre cemetery within the City of Evansville with more than 70,000 interments. Perhaps the most hallowed ground in the Cemetery was the interment sections which contained the remains of soldiers who died in battle or in Evansville hospitals from battle-incurred wounds during the Civil War. The remains of 500 Union men, 24 Confederate soldiers and 98 local dead were buried in three separate sections—all victims of Civil War battles. In 1868, the city began efforts to secure designation of the Union veterans’ areas as federal property, eventually succeeding with a Congressional appropriation and recognition in 1898. Several years later, in about 1903, the Fitzhugh Lee Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy erected a monument in remembrance of the 24 soldiers who died for the South. A memorial for local Union dead was added in 1909.</p> <p>Established in 2017, the William Halbrooks Arboretum at Oak Hill Cemetery was named for William Halbrooks, Oak Hill’s third superintendent.Its purpose is to provide a quiet and healing landscape for mourners while respecting the history and dignity of those interred at Oak Hill Cemetery. It will promote public awareness and appreciation of urban greenspaces by providing a safe, serene and beautiful setting. “This is a tremendous accomplishment that represents a team effort in achieving the certification for our historic facility,” said Chris Cooke, Superintendent. This accreditation” represents the culmination of many hours of labor put in by countless volunteers as well as a generous grant from the Southwestern Indiana Master Gardener Association,” he added. “Without each and every one of them, we would not have reached this goal.” A core goal of the Arboretum is to protect and cultivate existing trees and woody shrubs, while augmenting the historic landscape by selecting and appropriately locating new acquisitions. Additionally, it will promote general awareness and appreciation for trees and landscaping through social media, publications and public events.</p> <p>More than 120 individual tree species are represented within the Halbrooks Arboretum including juniper, holly, blue spruce, tulip tree, dogwood, catalpa, sycamore, locust, Japanese ginkgo, magnolia, and varieties of pine, oak, cedar, maple, and willow.</p> <p>The Halbrooks Aboretum has achieved Level II Accreditation from <strong><a href=\"http://arbnet.org/accreditation/levels-accreditation/level-ii-criteria\">www.ArbNet.org</a></strong>.</p> <p>Oak Hill Cemetery and Arboretum is centrally located off Highway 41 just north of the Lloyd Expressway and offers traditional ground spaces, mausoleum chapel, cremation garden, and a Veterans’ Memorial Plaza.</p>",

Its white top of exposed shale stood out prominently. At its base, they saw “a Village of Small animals that burrow in the grown [ground].” </p> <p paraeid=\"{47659420-962a-4308-9475-4d00a2db7669}{195}\" paraid=\"47730404\">The animal’s behavior intrigued Lewis and Clark and they made copious notes in their journals describing the small creatures. Lewis called them “barking squirrels,” noting “they will generally set and bark at you as you approach them, their note being much that of the little toy dogs, their yelps are in quick succession and at each they a motion to their tails upwards.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{47659420-962a-4308-9475-4d00a2db7669}{219}\" paraid=\"2081370960\">The crew spent the afternoon attempting to capture a prairie dog alive. They began by digging into a prairie dog burrow. They dug down six feet with no success. They finally resorted to using water hauled three-quarters of a mile from the Missouri River to flush out the animals. Five barrels of water later, they finally succeeded in capturing a single prairie dog. John Shields later killed a second prairie dog, which the captains ate.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{47659420-962a-4308-9475-4d00a2db7669}{241}\" paraid=\"849453922\">Lewis and Clark wanted to capture a prairie dog to fulfill President Thomas Jefferson’s instructions to make note of “the animals of the country generally, & especially those not known in the U.S.” The captured animal joined the expedition for a short time.

Clark wrote that he “came to at 3 oClock at the Kohokia Landing, which is at the mouth of Kohokia Creek ¾ of a mile from the Town, and in view of St Louis which is about 2 ½ miles distant.” While encamped at nearby Wood River into May 1804, Lewis and Clark used the Cahokia Courthouse as a headquarters for collecting infor­mation, meeting with territorial leaders, gathering supplies, and corresponding with President Thomas Jefferson through Postmaster John Hay. The courthouse greatly facilitated their ability to comprehensively plan the expedition.</p> <p>The courthouse, initially built as a dwelling in the 1730s, is a unique remnant of the French presence in Illinois. Converted to a courthouse in 1793, for the next 20 years it served as a center of political activity in the Northwest Territory. It was dismantled in 1901, re-erected twice, and reconstructed on its original site in 1939. The structure is an excellent example of early French log construction known as poteaux-sur-solle. Upright hewn logs are seated on a horizontal log sill; the spaces between logs are filled with stone and mortar chinking. The building rests on its original stone foundation and contains four rooms that originally functioned as a courtroom, a schoolroom, and legal offices.

Sergeant Ordway wrote, “we passed the mouth of the Mahar Creek below an Island S. Side of the Missouri R. we proceeded on to the lower point of another Island N. S. opposite to which we Camped on S. Side Near the Mahar Village, I and 3 more of the party went out to the Village or to the place where it formely Stood. […] we came to where their had been a village of about 300 Cabbins called the Mahar village. it was burned about 4 years ago immediately after near half the Nation died with the Small pox, which was as I was informed about 400, we found none of the natives about the place they were out hunting the Buffelow, we ascended the hill above the village on which was all the Graves of the former.”<br /> <br /> Located near present-day Homer, Nebraska, the Omaha Big Village was founded circa-1775. The Omaha Tribe thrived under Chief Blackbird, controlling the fur trade on the Upper Missouri River. By 1795, their village had grown to approximately 1,100 people. That same year, James Mackay established a nearby fur trading post for the Spanish, known as Fort Charles. (Although the post operated for only a few years, Clark mapped its location in 1804, indicating that remnants remained intact.) By 1800, a smallpox epidemic killed approximately one-third of the tribe’s population, including Chief Blackbird. The diminished village was occupied until 1845. The Omaha Big Village archeological site is located on private property, with restricted public access, but may be publicly viewed from a pull-off along US-75.",

The site, located near the confluence of the Heart River with the Missouri River, was a former Mandan settlement that has come to be known as On-A-Slant Village. Estimated to have included about 75 earthlodges and perhaps 1,000 residents, the village had likely existed for over 200 years before a 1781 smallpox epidemic decimated the population.<br /> <br /> A military post named Fort Abraham Lincoln was established at the site in 1872. It became a base of opera­tions in the U.S. Army’s campaign against the Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne nations during 1876 and 1877. The fort was abandoned in 1891, after the completion of the railroad into Montana reduced its strategic importance. The site was designated <a href=\"http://www.parkrec.nd.gov/parks/falsp/falsp.html\">Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park</a> in 1907. Five earthlodges have since been reconstructed on the site of On-A-Slant Village, and interpretive tours offer an introduction to historic Mandan culture. The site retains archeological evidence of the original village.",

But nothing had actually changed in the meadow itself. What had changed was Lewis and Clark’s knowledge about it. During the year between their visit to the site, Nez Perce people had shared with these visitors their knowledge of this meadow and of the camas that grows in it.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19b1d9be-e8f1-4751-b51c-1acd040b4bec}{75}\" paraid=\"886207110\">Camas is a plant with an edible root that grows in marshy areas in this mountainous region. For generations, Nez Perce people tended these camas fields to encourage the growth of the nutritious plants.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19b1d9be-e8f1-4751-b51c-1acd040b4bec}{103}\" paraid=\"991511244\">It was harvest season when Lewis and Clark passed through in September 1805, and camas was one of the first things that Nez Perce people generously shared with them.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19b1d9be-e8f1-4751-b51c-1acd040b4bec}{117}\" paraid=\"1348276762\">When Lewis and Clark’s party returned the following June, they arrived just before the camas bloomed. Nez Perce people told them to wait to cross the Rocky Mountains until the snow had melted, but the visitors tried to continue eastward. They turned around in just a few days. For their next attempt, they waited until Nez Perce people said the time was right and paid a Nez Perce man to accompany them.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19b1d9be-e8f1-4751-b51c-1acd040b4bec}{169}\" paraid=\"326580665\">For generations, Nez Perce people had traveled the Lolo Trail and stopped at this meadow to harvest camas. They knew the best time of year to travel, and they knew—and cared for—the plants that were edible along the way. They shared their knowledge and foodways with the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition—and in so doing, they helped them stay alive.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{19b1d9be-e8f1-4751-b51c-1acd040b4bec}{219}\" paraid=\"741018600\">Camas continues to be an important plant for Nez Perce people and for many other Indigenous communities in this region. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

As a tourism attraction, the portraits of Paducah’s past inspire both young and old like icing on the cake for this charming western Kentucky river town.</p> <p>Originally sponsored and funded by the private sector, an all-volunteer group of dedicated citizens started and continues to coordinate the City-maintained attraction. Now in its 25th painting season, Dafford muralists return annually to touch up or sometimes entirely repaint images. Books, postcards, posters, prints, t-shirts and coloring books are sold to support maintenance. Book signings and special events celebrate the project. Tours hosted by Paducah Ambassadors are a favorite while self-guided walking tours are popular year round. View all images and learn more about the project: PaducahWallToWall.com to learn more.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/patrick-gass-and-john-ordway.htm\">Patrick Gass</a> was ninety-eight years old when he died on April 2, 1870. He is buried in Brooke Cemetery in Wellsburg, West Virginia, along with his wife, Maria Hamilton (who died almost twenty-five years before her husband).  <br /> <br /> Gass was the last living member of Lewis and Clark’s crew. Did any of his neighbors in Wellsburg know about his life story? <br /> <br /> Born in Pennsylvania’s rolling hills, Gass spent his childhood in Pennsylvania and Maryland. He joined the Army as a young man and spent two years serving in what the United States then called the Northwest Territory, which consisted of much of the land around the Ohio River. The Army troops that Gass served with were here to clear Indigenous people from the region to make room for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-in-steubenville.htm\">White settlers</a>.  <br /> <br /> Gass trained as a carpenter and helped build <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-kaskaskia.htm\">Fort Kaskaskia</a>. He did most of the carpentry and design for Lewis and Clark, including the construction of the crew’s winter quarters in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-mandan.htm\">Mandan territory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-clatsop-stealing-the-canoe.htm\">Clatsop territory</a>. Having a carpenter on the crew was also handy when a boat needed repairs.  <br /> <br /> After Sergeant Charles Floyd’s death, Gass was elected by his peers to step into the role of sergeant. He kept a journal as part of his duties in the new position, despite lacking a formal education.  <br /> <br /> After he arrived home from the expedition, a schoolteacher named David McKeehan asked Gass if he would consider publishing his writings from the trip. McKeehan filled out missing holes and polished up the story to make it easier to read—more of a narrative than diary entries. McKeehan published the book in 1807. It was the first published account of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (Lewis and Clark’s journals were not published until 1814).  <br /> <br /> Gass made little money from sales of the book. He sometimes struggled to feed his family in Wellsburg. And then, the man who first popularized the Lewis and Clark Expedition died quietly almost sixty-five years after the journey finished.38 <br /> <br /> Did anyone in Wellsburg ever read Gass’s book? Did people traveling up and down the river know that one of the people who helped the U.S. government colonize the western parts of continent was quietly living here, raising children and farming? <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

Of French descent, Dorion was born in Quebec City in 1740, but had already migrated to the area around today’s Yankton, South Dakota by 1774. By 1804, he was considered a seasoned veteran of the region and his knowledge of the geography and the Lakota people and language made him invaluable to the Captains. So they hired him to be a translator and consultant, at least until they passed the Lakota’s territory.<br /> <br /> When the Expedition reached the mouth of the James River (just east of the city of Yankton today), Dorion was dispatched to gather members of the Yankton Sioux for a meeting at Calumet Bluffs. There he translated Lewis’s long speech and helped the Captains document details about the Native peoples’ culture.  <br /> <br /> A few days later, Lewis and Clark convinced several chiefs of area tribes to go with Dorion to St. Louis and on to Washington City to meet President Jefferson. When Dorion traveled south (downstream) with the chiefs, the Corps returned to their upstream journey. <br /> <br /> Dorion continued trading in the region and in 1806 was commissioned by the U.S. War Department to be a sub-agent along the Missouri and the western tributaries. He assisted William Clark in 1807 by coordinating a meeting with several chiefs. <br /> <br /> Dorion died in 1810 and was buried along the Missouri River, where his body remained until about 1890 when Yankton brick makers digging for clay uncovered it. The location was lost through time, but was rediscovered by local historians around 1999. Since then, Yankton officials erected a monument in 2002 at the intersection of West 2<sup>nd</sup> and West Riverside Drive in Yankton, at the grave’s location.",

The expedition’s first introduction to the region was on the evening of Monday, September 24, 1804 when Lewis, Clark and their entourage of forty three men and three boats anchored across the river from Pierre, in what is now Fischers Lilly Park in Fort Pierre. On their return trip in 1806, Lewis and Clark returned to the area, this time camping on the Pierre side of the river, spending the night on LaFramboise Island, which they called Bad Humored Island as a reference to the difficulties they encountered with Blackfoot’s band of Sioux Indian.</p> <p>Today, both of these sights, Fischers Lilly Park and LaFramboise Island, can be visited along with the thriving towns of Pierre and Fort Pierre, located on opposite sides of the Missouri river. The area is known for its political significance as capital of the state, high density of museums and historic sites, and its plethora of outdoor recreation activities including fishing and water sports on the Missouri river, sporting facilities such as golf and disc golf courses, and hunting and bird watching in the Fort Pierre National Grassland and surroundings.

Lewis wrote of the Platte, “by a boiling motion or ebolition of it’s waters occasioned no doubt by the roling and irregular motion of the sand of which its bed is entirely composed...particles of this sand...hurried by this impetuous torrent in large masses from place to place in with irristable forse, collecting and forming sand bars in the course of a few hours which as suddingly disapated to form others...” They conducted experiments to measure the water’s velocity, comparing it to the slower currents of the Missouri and the Mississippi. Lewis and Clark ventured on foot a short distance up the Platte River and crossed it, noting that the depths did not exceed “over 6 or 7 feet.”<br /> <br /> The Platte River Confluence can be publicly accessed via the <a href=\"http://visitcasscounty.com/outdoor-activities/schilling-wildlife-management-area/\">Schilling Wildlife Management Area</a>, enabling visitors to view the confluence within a natural setting comparable to what members of the expedition would have experienced. The character of the Platte River has evolved since 1804, as the channel width and current have both diminished, primarily due to the diversion of water along multiple points upstream for agricultural irrigation. Although greatly reduced, the confluence of the Platte remains in essentially the same historic location.",

When British General John Forbes arrived in 1758, the French forces found themselves outnumbered. Realizing the gravity of their situation, the French burned the fort to the ground and promptly left. Now in control of the area, the British soon built Fort Pitt, a five-sided structure with bastions, on the same site that was, at the time, one of the largest forts in North America.

    "bodyText": "While several Native tribal names translate the name of the river in mid-Montana as “Elk,” the French named it “Rochjhone” which translates to “Yellowstone.”  William Clark and his exploratory party came to the Yellowstone in mid-July 1806, anxious to rendezvous with Captain Lewis and his small group.  <br /> <br /> On Friday, July 25, Clark wrote in his journal, “This rock which I shall Call Pompy's Tower is 200 feet high and 400 paces in secumphrance… The nativs have ingraved on the face of this rock the figures of animals &c. near which I marked my name and the day of the month & year.”<br /> <br /> The only remaining on-site physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Pompeys Pillar National Monument is managed by the Bureau of Land Management, and is about 30 miles northeast of Billings, Montana.<br /> <br /> Today, in addition to Clark’s engraving, Pompeys Pillar is marked with over 5,000 of other etchings, petroglyphs, and pictographs.  The Pillar was used for centuries as a favored campsite by Crows and other Native peoples as they traveled through the area on hunting, trading, war, or other expeditions.  Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggest that the Pillar was also a place of ritual and religious activity.  Then throughout the 19th century, fur trappers, military expeditions, railroad workers, and early settlers used the sandstone as a registry of their passing. <br /> <br /> The Interpretive Center presents the journey of William Clark and his detachment down the Yellowstone River in 1806.  It also addresses native culture, flora and fauna, the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and the historical significance of Pompeys Pillar throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.  A number of J.K. Ralston paintings and sketches are on display, and an adjacent gift shop provides artwork, books, jewelry, and toys. <br /> <br /> The day-use area is perfect for picnicking, relaxing, and enjoying the Yellowstone River.  The 51-acre monument is open daily, with hours changing seasonally; a per-vehicle fee is charged.  Even when the Monument is closed, visitors may still walk into the site during daylight hours.  The walk from the gates to the Pillar is about 3/4th of a mile. <br /> <br /> <br /> For fees, current hours, and other information about the area restrictions, or for general information about Pompeys Pillar, go to: <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/montana-dakotas/pompeys-pillar\">https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/montana-dakotas/pompeys-pillar</a><br /> <br /> Photo:  Bureau of Land Management<br />  ",

According to the European legal theory the “Doctrine of Discovery,” proving that you had been somewhere could help you claim to own it down the road—but only if you were White.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4f6a461e-0576-4a07-b276-e88ac12c5061}{79}\" paraid=\"731882503\">At Iishbiiammaache, Clark was just one of many people to pass through this spot. He may have been writing his name to stake a claim, or he may have just wanted to add his mark to the many who came before him.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The land is located on the ancestral homeland of the Ponca people and was part of their reservations in the 1800-1900’s. The building where the museum is located was built in the 1930’s with the help of the Civilian Conservation Corps to serve as the headquarters for tribal government and as a community building for the Northern Ponca members. It has since been repurposed as an office site and museum displaying Ponca artifacts from different eras to tell our story.</p> <p>The Tribe’s Powwow Arena was placed next to the Museum for that historical and cultural significance. Considering the fact that many Ponca members no longer live in Niobrara, it provides an opportunity for them to come back to the homeland and feel that connection to the earth. The Annual Norther Ponca Powwow is held on the 2nd weekend of August and is open to all who wish to join in a celebration of Ponca culture.</p> <p>Around the Powwow grounds and Museum, an educational trail was put in. Along this path are statues that depict traditional Ponca stories such as How the Rabbit Caught the Sun and the Coyote and the Turkeys. There is also a recreation of a traditional Ponca earth lodge for visitors to enter and experience. During work hours, staff is available at the museum to give guided tours to tell these stories and explain more about Ponca history and culture.</p> <p>The crowning jewel is the statue of Chief Standing Bear overlooking the grounds. Now with a road and a parking lot, the statue represents an important moment in Ponca history when Chief Standing Bear fought for the right, in court, for the Ponca to return to Niobrara after being relocated to Oklahoma. If visitors are lucky, the Tribe’s buffalo herd can be visible from here, too.</p> <p>Come visit to learn more about the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska!</p>",

The term was common in 1805, but we do not use it very often today. A portage is when you take your boat out of the water and carry it overland for period, usually to get around dangerous waterfalls, shallow water, or pass between two separate bodies of water.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1846facf-c9ae-4af7-875d-edaf7a9ae27d}{220}\" paraid=\"211568191\">This portage was exceptionally difficult because it involved an eighteen-mile overland trek that required going up and down “several deep ravines.”253 Men in the expedition double-soled their moccasins to protect their feet from prickly pear cactus needles and sharp points of earth caused by bison trampling on it after heavy rains.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{29e639e8-1340-429e-85ac-40d8b60376ae}{19}\" paraid=\"1104958586\">One day during the portage, a thunderstorm blew through with huge hail. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a> lost her <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/birth-of-pomp.htm\">baby’s</a> cradle, and she and her <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">husband</a> almost drowned. York was stranded on the plains during the torrent, and several other men, who wore no hats and few clothes, were left bruised and bloodied by the massive hailstones.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{29e639e8-1340-429e-85ac-40d8b60376ae}{69}\" paraid=\"1601503715\">The weather continued to be extreme, and unrelenting heat exhausted them. Everyone complained about the mosquitos. On easier days, they caught fish, hunted bison, and repaired their guns.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{29e639e8-1340-429e-85ac-40d8b60376ae}{113}\" paraid=\"1565652235\">They built wheeled carts to tow their canoes and luggage over those steep ravines and unforgiving ground. They left behind some boats, and Clark led some men to carve new dugout canoes above the falls. They dug another <a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/portage-route.htm\">cache</a> to lighten their load. At one point, the wind blew so hard at their back that they hoisted the sail of the canoe. “this is Saleing on dry land in everry Since of the word,” wrote John Ordway.</p> <p paraeid=\"{29e639e8-1340-429e-85ac-40d8b60376ae}{173}\" paraid=\"2113707229\">On July 15, over a month after they arrived at this stretch of river, they loaded up the canoes and set off again. This was the hardest portage that they experienced. And perhaps related, it was one of the only portages where they received no help from Indigenous people. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Terry is part of Montana’s rich cultural history and is located directly on the Lewis & Clark and Yellowstone trails with many different significant historical resources and landmarks along the way including Buffalo Hunter Graves, Milwaukee Bridge, home of pioneer photographer Evelyn Cameron, Terry Badlands Wilderness Study Area—Calypso Trail, a national registered landmark—Warren through truss bridge (Montana’s longest at 1,142 feet, built in 1944), Powder River Bridge, Prairie County Museum and Cameron Gallery, Kempton Motel, Evelyn Cameron Heritage-Rialto Theater, and the Grandey School Building.</p> <h4>Yellowstone Trail</h4> <p>The Yellowstone Trail was the first transcontinental highway across the northern United States as transportation transitioned from railroad to auto travel. The Yellowstone Trail originally followed existing wagon roads, but changed over time as new roads were built. The Yellowstone Trail passes through Prairie County from Mildred to Fallon to Terry and westward to Miles City. Look for Yellowstone Trail markers to guide you through Prairie County and to visit some historic points of interest. Following are historic sites marked along the trail.</p> <h4>Captain Clark’s Camp</h4> <p>Captain William Clark’s party of the Lewis & Clark Expedition camped one-and-a-half miles below where the Powder River runs into the Yellowstone River on the left bank under a large cottonwood tree on July 30, 1806 on his way to rejoin Lewis at the mouth of the Yellowstone.</p> <h4>Terry Supply Station</h4> <p>The Terry Supply Station was established June 7, 1876 to supply military operations in the area. Supplies were transferred from Stanley’s Stockade at Glendive by Captain Marsh on the steamer “Far West”.</p> <p>Private George of the 7th Cavalry was badly shot during the Battle of the Little Big Horn on Reno’s Hill. He died on July 3, 1876 on the Far West steamer from those injuries. He was buried by the river bank. There is a gravesite for Private George about seven eighths of a mile northwest of this sign.</p> <p>Scout Wesley Brockmeyer was killed near the mouth of the Powder River on August 2, 1876 in a skirmish between US Infantry and Sioux and Cheyenne warriors. The infantry eventually drove off the warriors with a 12-pound cannon.</p> <h4>Father DeSmet-Sitting Bull Council</h4> <p>Father DeSmet, accompanied by Trader Galpin and his wife, traveled overland from the Missouri River to meet the Hunkpapa Sioux at the Sitting Bull Council on June 20, 1868 for a peace conference. Runners from Father DeSmet’s party were sent ahead to Chief Sitting Bull’s camp and Sitting Bull sent his men back to let Father DeSmet know he would be welcomed. Father DeSmet met at Sitting Bull’s camp about four miles above the mouth of the Powder River, near where Camp Creek empties into the Yellowstone. The camp was made up of 500-600 tipis, 4,000-5,000 Sioux Indians, and thousands of horses. DeSmet was not able to convince Sitting Bull to sign a peace treaty, but the council was considered a success because Sitting Bull did agree to allow some white travel and settlement.</p> <h4>Powder River Stage Station</h4> <p>The Powder River Stage Station was one of the stops on the Fort Keogh-Bismarck stage coach route. It operated from 1878 until 1883 when the railroad became the primary means of transportation to Miles City.</p> <h4>Milwaukee Railroad</h4> <p>Work on the 225-mile eastern Montana section of the Milwaukee Railroad took place from 1907-1908. The Milwaukee Railroad ran through a region of river and creek valleys, making for the building of many bridges. The Yellowstone River was crossed three times between Terry and Miles City. The first crossing is five miles West of Terry, the second 25 miles further west at the Tusler Crossing, and the third crossing was five miles west of Miles City. Supplies to build the Milwaukee Railroad first came by rail on the Northern Pacific tracks, then across the Yellowstone River by boat, ferry, and cable. The Old Milwaukee Railroad Bridge is about three miles west on Milwaukee Road.</p> <h4>Calypso Trail</h4> <p>Calypso Trail was a stop on the Milwaukee Railroad. The community had a school and a ferry crossing in addition to the railroad section houses. An interpretive sign reached by crossing the Old Milwaukee Railroad Bridge marks the beginning of the Calypso Trail. The rustic five-and-a-half mile trail leads to the scenic Terry Badlands.</p>",

Twice during the expedition, he got lost, and on many occasions he forgot important items—like his tomahawk—and had to retrace his steps to retrieve the property.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8afed2c6-751b-4729-b791-66ed15831f3d}{168}\" paraid=\"2059624470\">Shannon was born in Pennsylvania around 1785. In 1800, his family moved to Ohio to farm land that formerly belonged to Indigenous people and that the U.S. government was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-in-steubenville.htm\">doling out</a> to White settlers. Shannon followed Meriwether Lewis to Kentucky to enlist in the Army and join the expedition. At eighteen, he became the youngest member of the expedition. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8afed2c6-751b-4729-b791-66ed15831f3d}{206}\" paraid=\"1297639477\">Shannon’s first misadventure started in the summer of 1804. On August 26, Shannon and George Drouillard set out to search for two horses that had strayed. The men separated to cover more territory. When Drouillard came back to camp the next day, Shannon had not returned. The captains sent search parties, but Shannon remained missing for sixteen days.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8afed2c6-751b-4729-b791-66ed15831f3d}{238}\" paraid=\"1443196545\">They finally encountered Shannon on September 11. He had apparently found the horses early on but misread some tracks and assumed the expedition had passed him. Shannon therefore proceeded upriver expecting to meet the party, but they were actually downstream of him.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9c78fe7b-97a9-44a1-84e3-07635260e5bb}{1}\" paraid=\"877271837\">When they found Shannon, he was sitting beside the river, “nearly Starved to Death” waiting for a boat to pass. He hadn’t eaten for twelve days, having run out of ammunition for his gun. He foraged some wild grapes and managed to kill a rabbit “by shooting a piece of hard Stick in place of a [musket] ball.”</p> <p paraeid=\"{9c78fe7b-97a9-44a1-84e3-07635260e5bb}{15}\" paraid=\"518279971\">Ponca and Omaha people who lived here knew how to feed themselves and how to find their way home based on thousands of years of ancestral knowledge. Shannon did not. There was food in these woods, there were trails to follow—he just was not from here and did not know where to find them.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

It also served as a fledgling community and government center for the area. In November of 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark stopped to visit with Lorimier's family and purchase supplies for the expedition ahead. <br /> <br /> The reconstructed house displays several exhibits depicting the lives of the area's early settlers. Visitors can peruse 19th-century merchandise in Lorimier's Trading Post or visit the Lorimier Room to see how a home of this period may have been decorated. In the Girardeau Room, a large map of the territory under control of Don Louis Lorimier for the Spanish Government is on display. Visitors can also walk through the Historic Gardens on the north side of the house which contains flowers, vegetables, and herbs typical of a garden in 1803. <br /> <br /> Today, the Red House Interpretive Center is maintained by the City of Cape Girardeau and is open to visitors from May to October. Admission is free. Guided group tours are available on weekdays by appointment only. Call (573) 339-6340.<br />  ",

Clark wrote, “we arivied at the enterance of Quinnett Creek which we assended a Short distance and Encamped at the place we had Called rock fort Camp.” This time their primary focus was negotiating with tribes for the acquisition of horses and other goods. They broke camp on April 18 to portage the rapids upriver.</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Located in The Dalles, the 5.5 acre property commemorating the Rock Fort Campsite was conveyed to Wasco County ownership from the Union Pacific Railroad in 1976.

In 1805, some White visitors with lots of luggage paid Wasco-Wishram people to help them around these dangerous waterfalls, as others had done before them.

Wasco-Wishram people remembered the travelers from last time and asked for more music and dancing. They taught the visitors games through which players could win goods. The visitors wanted horses, but no one had any to spare.

The Salish, called “Flathead” by members of the expedition, gave them a warm welcome. Ord­way wrote, “when our officers went to their lodges they gave them each a white robe of dressed skins, and spread them over their Shoulders and put their arms around our necks instead of Shakeing hands as that is their way they appeared glad to See us. they Smoaked with us, then gave us a pleanty Such as they had to eat…” Lewis and Clark spent the next day communicating with chiefs (complicated by the task of translat­ing across several languages), exchanging gifts, bartering goods, and purchasing horses.

A roadside pull-off is lined by an array of interpretive signage that detail the story of Lewis and Clark’s visit, later exploration and development, and the settlement of Sula.

Sacagawea <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/birth-of-pomp.htm\">had a baby</a> at age sixteen, and her son had a French name, like his father.</p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{84}\" paraid=\"57537365\">We know she was happy to reunite with her Shoshone family and friends.

These men, on a colonizing mission, saw her usefulness while also discriminating against her based on her race and gender. How was Sacagawea different than the woman we read about in those journals?  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{182}\" paraid=\"1372147630\">Whoever she was, Sacagawea has captured the imagination of so many people over the last two hundred years. In the 1910s, women fighting for suffrage used Sacagawea as an example of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-vote-at-station-camp.htm\">a woman casting a vote</a>. In 2000, the U.S. Mint put an image of Sacagawea and her baby on a dollar coin. There are more statues of Sacagawea in this country than of any other American woman. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e7595911-1513-40d1-9e9e-92aea697d0bf}{214}\" paraid=\"1122002545\">Perhaps it is because she was a woman—with a baby!—in a male space. Perhaps it is because she had a foot in so many cultures. Very likely we remember her because, unlike other Indigenous women, White men wrote about her, and those words lived on in print.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{218}\" paraid=\"2000674275\">Lewis and Clark arrived at the confluence the Snake and Columbia rivers on October 16, 1805, where Sacajawea Historical State Park is today. They were immediately met by Yakama and Wanapum who sold them much needed food and gave them information about the area. The following day, William Clark explored the Columbia River to the north in search of another river he heard about from local Native Americans the night before. After paddling up-stream for about 10 miles (16 km), Clark and his two companions found the mouth of what is now the Yakima River at present-day Richland, Washington. By 1810, fur traders had followed explorers into the Pacific Northwest.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{228}\" paraid=\"2126314892\">Following the War of 1812, the United States and Great Britain jointly occupied this region from 1818 until1846, when the Oregon Treaty finally decided the border between the two nations. During this period, the British controlled the fur trade and local economy but were unable to successfully colonize the region. US settlers, on the other hand, increasingly moved into the region, arriving either by sea or over the Oregon Trail. </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{234}\" paraid=\"1132912260\">Roman Catholic missionaries arrived in the region in 1826 to minister to the French-Canadian and Native American trappers employed by the fur companies. Protestant missionaries began to arrive 10 years later. Perhaps the most well-known of those were Dr. Marcus Whitman and Narcissa Whitman, who in 1836 established a mission among the Cayuse Indians and fur trappers in the Walla Walla Valley. While the missionaries were not successful in their efforts to convert Cayuse Peoples to Christianity and a settled agricultural lifestyle, the mission station provided aid to some Oregon Trail immigrants from 1843-1847. </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{240}\" paraid=\"893900717\">In 1847, a devastating outbreak of measles occurred among the Cayuse, killing nearly half the tribe. Dr. Whitman’s medical care seemed to work on the white measles patients, however appeared to be ineffective in helping the Cayuse patients with measles. Some Cayuse people feared that Dr. Whitman was intentionally poisoning them instead of healing them. These fears were not ill-founded; there had been multiple poisoning incidents stemming from the mission station in the years leading up to the measles epidemic. Dr. Whitman was cautioned multiple times that he was endangering himself if he stayed. On November 28, 1847, he was once again warned to leave the mission. He did not heed this last warning. By evening of the following day both missionaries and many of the adult men at the mission were dead. Forty-seven others at the mission station were held hostage for one month.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{246}\" paraid=\"1863855212\">Officials of the British Hudson’s Bay Company arranged the release of the 47 people still at the mission site. News of the event quickly spread across the continent and back to the United States where reactions were so severe that Congress moved to create the Oregon Territory in 1848. As a result of the actions at the mission station the Oregon Volunteer Militia and, later, the US military fought the Cayuse War against the Cayuse Nation, leading to further deaths and suffering. To end the persecution they faced from the military, Cayuse leaders surrendered five men in 1850.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{252}\" paraid=\"260227017\">In 1855 several thousand tribal members from present-day Idaho, Oregon, and Washington met in the Walla Walla Valley to discuss agreements between sovereign tribal nations and the United States. In less than a month, leaders from both sides signed three treaties that created the Nez Perce, Umatilla-Cayuse-Walla Walla, and Yakama reservations. These treaties were ratified in 1859 and became supreme law of the land, part of the constitutional fabric of the United States. These treaties guarantee the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Nez Perce, and Yakama nations legal status and their government-to-government relationship with the United States. These treaties are still in place today. The Wanapum people never fought white settlers and never signed a treaty with the US government. As a result, they did not retain federally recognized land rights. </p> <p paraeid=\"{df73a8d7-b9ab-4232-9eb6-eec3316158b9}{5}\" paraid=\"1320234732\">The treaties of the Walla Walla Council of 1855 also guaranteed Native American signatories access to resources such as salmon, game, and medicinal plants at their “usual and accustomed places,” retaining some of their traditional lifeways even though they lost million acres of land and billions of dollars in resources. The influx of white settlers that continued throughout the 1800s and 1900s severely impacted indigenous communities and led to conflict between Native Americans and settlers over environmental resources. This conflict continues today.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{df73a8d7-b9ab-4232-9eb6-eec3316158b9}{11}\" paraid=\"1124500813\">Native Americans were again displaced from a portion of their traditional homelands with the arrival of the Manhattan Project in 1943. The Manhattan Project’s need for a large safety and security perimeter would further dispossess Native Americans when the federal government appropriated 670 square miles (1740 sq kilometers) of land for the Hanford Site. Tribes lost access to their “usual and accustomed places” for fishing, hunting, and gathering on the Hanford Site that were guaranteed to them in the treaties of 1855. Today, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Nez Perce, Wanapum, and Yakama nations actively consult with the US Department of Energy at Hanford to ensure protection of their sacred places and tribal resources, including the Columbia River, on the Hanford Site.  </p> <h2 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d93888d2-45b8-4c47-bca6-2707f8d0ebc4}{243}\" paraid=\"1124500813\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d93888d2-45b8-4c47-bca6-2707f8d0ebc4}{243}\" paraid=\"1124500813\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><br /> The <a href=\"https://www.parks.wa.gov/575/Sacajawea\">Sacajawea Interpretive Center</a> features interactive exhibits on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacajawea, and the Sahaptian-speaking tribes of the region.

They had briefly visited the area on November 3, 1805, and named the tributary “Quick Sand River.” Lewis now noted there was one “large wooden house” of the Watlala Nation nearby, remarking, “when we decended the river in November last there were 24 other lodges formed of Straw and covered with bark near this house; these lodges are now distroyed and the inhabitants as the indians inform us have returned to the great rapids of this river…” They learned a great deal about Sandy River from area villagers and sent Sergeant Pryor to explore as far upriver as possible within a day. With game relatively plentiful, the captains resolved “to remain at our present encampment or some where in this neighbourhood untill we had obtained as much dryed meat as would be necessary for our voyage as far as the [Nez Perce].” During this time they also made detailed celestial and natural observations.

They thought that a river next to it, which Clark called the “quicksand river,” (now known as the Sandy River), was the larger stream.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{47976350-ec83-4dc8-90b4-9e77d919db5a}{132}\" paraid=\"161135171\">On their trip back up the Columbia in 1806, Chinookan and Kalapuyan people who lived here kept telling the visitors that the Sandy River was not a substantial river. They informed them that there was a larger one, the Multnomah (now called the Willamette). After first arguing, the travelers eventually believed the locals.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{47976350-ec83-4dc8-90b4-9e77d919db5a}{166}\" paraid=\"1545039858\">The next day, Lewis and Clark’s party saw several Upper Chinook men paddling in a canoe—nothing unusual, since the Columbia River (imaɬ or iyagaytɬ imaɬ, in Chinookan, meaning “great water”) was a busy highway. </p> <p paraeid=\"{47976350-ec83-4dc8-90b4-9e77d919db5a}{206}\" paraid=\"468414567\">They told the party that two of the men in their boat were from near the waterfalls (Multnomah Falls) upstream. One drew a map of “this river which they called <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?places=Willamette%20%28Multnomah%29%20River\">Mult-no-mâh</a>” . . . “which they drew on a mat with a coal.” Another agreed to guide Clark and seven other men up the river. He took as payment from Clark a “birning glass,” a lens that focused sunlight and helped spark a flame. </p> <p paraeid=\"{47976350-ec83-4dc8-90b4-9e77d919db5a}{253}\" paraid=\"1135972114\">This Chinook man brought the men up the Multnomah River, stopping by his village on the way. Clark described this man’s house and explained that the ruins of many more houses were behind it—the man explained many people of their town had died of smallpox twenty-five or thirty years before. </p> <p paraeid=\"{afa70d2a-260a-4c53-a405-04afe0aa2b5e}{32}\" paraid=\"310698843\">Clark described the depth and length of the river in terms of whether it could accommodate large ships. He did this because this expedition was not just to casually observe this land, but to prepare the way for American traders and settlers. A river of sufficient depth could accommodate a port for large ships to bring goods from around the world.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{afa70d2a-260a-4c53-a405-04afe0aa2b5e}{64}\" paraid=\"653381956\">Chinook and Kalapuya people already knew how great the Willamette River was—they lived along it in densely populated towns. They could, and did, tell their visitors what they knew about the river.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Lewis named Werner Creek, now called the Clearwater River.</p> <p>We are a small community in the God-given green valley on the southwest side of the Crown of the Continent, the largest intact ecosystem in the continental United States. The local scenery and wildlife along Highway 83 is between the world class Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks. Seeley Lake is a never-never land for shutterbugges – they’ll never run out of things to photograph.</p> <p>Relatively few people hold title to the wildlands surrounding Seeley Lake. Although there is enough private land in the valley to accommodate 10,000 (now 2,000) people, the vast majority of the open space is public, dominated by National Forest Land. The forest is dotted with lakes and wetlands throughout the countryside. Grasslands at the southern end of the valley begin the progression of ecotones through mid-elevation mixed tree species up to subalpine higher mountains.</p> <p>Our valley is blessed with an incredibly wide spectrum of biologic diversity. Our ecosystem is influenced by the convergence of maritime from the west, some arctic from the north, Great Plains from the east and high plains from the south.</p> <p>Our wildlife is still wild. The mid to upper portions of the Blackfoot Valley remains one of the few places along the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail where one may encounter a grizzly bear. Several noted species of wildlife are in the valley, including several top of the food chain varieties (grizzly bears and gray wolfs). Birders think this is the best area within 100 miles. Avifauna ecosystem niches are spread from elevation ranges of 4000 feet to 8000 feet above sea level — grasslands to subalpine environments. If birds move too fast, enjoy a heaven of wild flowers with colors moving throughout the seasons.</p> <p>Seeley Lake is at the epicenter of wilderness. The Bob Marshall-Great Bear-Scapegoat Wilderness Complex lies just beyond the skyline to the east. The Swan Mountain Wilderness beckons from the northeast. And the Rattlesnake Wilderness touches the southwest corner of the valley. Seeley Lake is only a few hours hike or horseback ride from the wild­erness edge. A primitive road from Jocko Pass links us to the Jocko Valley and Flathead Indian Reservation on the western side.</p> <p><strong>We have plenty of breathtaking experiences.</strong></p> <p>Our scenery is relaxing while many hikes can be breathtaking. Not all who wonder around are lost. They are just looking for rocks. You can find a different outdoor experience every day of the year. If you return to a special summer place when it has four feet of snow, it will be so different you’ll swear you’ve never been there before.</p> <p><strong>Enjoy our relaxing hospitality.</strong></p> <p>Visit like the snow geese enroute to other lands, like the loons that stay as long as they can or our resident ravens.</p> <p>Our people are very accepting and accommodating, respectful of other opinions and preferences. Most are outdoor enthusiasts sharing experiences rather it be motorheads or traveling by shanks mare. Water based recreation opportunities are on lakes and streams, liquid or frozen. People have been snowmobiling here for 40 years and still haven’t run out of new nooks to explore. Newer residents are overwhelmed with choices of places to explore. Lifetime residents accept the fact they can never do it all.</p> <p>Visitors have a choice of accommodations ranging from camping in a primitive environment or with modern conveniences. Select a siwash camp under a tree, developed campground, rent a cabin, stay in a motel, or find a vacation rental. Those who prefer brighter lights can visit for the day from Missoula.</p> <p>Seeley Lake is the regional hub for leisure travel. People here can enjoy the attractions with a one to three hour drive in some of the larger Montana cities — Missoula, Helena, Butte, Great Falls and Kalispell. Those folks are the bulk of our visitors. Those airports can also be starting points for exploring here and beyond Montana.</p>",

The “Rediscovering Lewis and Clark: A Journey with the Rooney Family” exhibit traces the footsteps of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark through a modern retelling of the journey using artifacts and photographs donated by the Rooney Family. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{49c67f69-849e-4ad9-b188-79214ac63da8}{77}\" paraid=\"485538994\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">For more information, call (412) 454-6000 or visit <a href=\"https://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/\">https://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/</a>. </p>",

The night before his death, Clark remarked, \"Serjeant Floyd is taken verry bad all at once with a Biliose Chorlick we attempt to relieve him without success as yet, hr gets worst and we are much allarmed at his Situation, all attention to him.”<br /> <br /> On August 20, 1804, Floyd passed away, most likely from peritonitis, caused by the inflammation or rupture of his appendix. He died from an illness that even the best doctors of the day could not have cured. Clark wrote:<br /> <br /> “. . . Serj. Floyd died with a great deal of composure. Before his death he said to me, \"I am going away. I want you to write me a letter.\" We buried him on the top of the bluff ½ mile below a small river to which we gave his name.

Clark wrote, “we Came to make a warm bath for Sergt. Floyd hopeing it would brace him a little, before we could get him in to this bath he expired, with a great deel of composure, haveing Said to me before his death that he was going away and wished me to write a letter— we took Buried him to the top of a high round hill over looking the river & Countrey for a great distance Situated just below a Small river without a name to which we name & call Floyds river, the Bluffs Sergts. Floyds Bluff— we buried him with all the honors of War, and fixed a Ceeder post at his head with his name title & Day of the month and year Capt Lewis read the funeral Service over him after paying everry respect to the Body of this desceased man (who had at All times given us proofs of his impatiality Sincurity to our­selves and good will to Serve his Countrey) we returned to the Boat & proceeded to the Mouth of the little river 30 yd. wide & Camped a butifull evening.” Floyd would be the only member of the Corps of Discovery to die during the expedition.<br /> <br /> In 1857, erosion induced by the Missouri River partially exposed Floyd’s grave. Local settlers recovered and reinterred most of the skeletal remains in a different location on the bluff. The grave was moved again in 1895. The Sergeant Floyd Monument, a 100-foot high sandstone obelisk, was built in 1901. Floyd’s remains were moved a third time and reburied at the base of the monument. Located along US-75 in Sioux City, Iowa, the monument is within a 23-acre park overlooking the Missouri River valley.</p>",

His father, Robert Clark Floyd, had served with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/locust-grove-kentucky.htm\">George Rogers Clark</a>, William Clark’s brother, in the American Revolutionary War. The two families kept in touch over the years. William Clark probably knew Charles Floyd as the constable of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/falls-of-the-ohio-old-clarksville-site.htm\">Clarksville</a>, where Clark lived.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{134}\" paraid=\"1566322574\">When it came time to recruit men for the expedition, Clark reached out to Floyd. Just twenty-one years old, he enlisted on August 11, 1803, along with <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bios-of-the-ten-men-from-kentucky.htm\">several other young men from Kentucky</a>. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant in April 1804. </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{158}\" paraid=\"882461934\">Floyd fell ill sometime toward the end of July 1804. On July 31, he wrote, “I am verry Sick and Has ben for Somtime but have Recoverd my helth again.”178 The recovery was short lived. He became sick again on August 15 and “remained so all night.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{202}\" paraid=\"2015956081\">Diagnosed with “bilious colic” at the time, Floyd likely had a ruptured appendix. None of the members of the expedition had <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/medicine-on-the-lewis-and-clark-expedition.htm\">formal medical training</a>, but Lewis and Clark did what they could for their ailing crew member. York was Floyd’s principal caretaker, and Clark helped care for Floyd during his last nights. Floyd died “with a great deel of composure” on the afternoon of August 20, 1804, after telling Clark that “he was going away and wished me to write a letter.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{238}\" paraid=\"1506754026\">On the day Floyd died, Clark wrote in his journal, “I am Dull & heavy.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{246}\" paraid=\"2122786144\">It cannot have been easy for Clark to watch his family friend die, especially so far from home and loved ones. After a brief funeral service, the expedition members buried Floyd on top of a hill overlooking the Missouri and surrounding plains. They marked the grave with a cedar post, onto which they engraved Floyd’s name.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{afe006f1-caac-4021-8bcd-e34ee06cbe6b}{252}\" paraid=\"565305150\">Floyd’s death may have felt like a reality check for other members of the expedition. Who might be the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fight-site-called-the-murder-site-or-kill-site-by-the-blackfeet-nation.htm\">next to die</a>?  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

The Center is a self-guided museum featuring rotating and permanent exhibits. Dedicated to sharing Shawnee culture, the center hosts a variety of events that allow visitors to take part in, and experience, this vibrant heritage.</p> <p>The Center’s mission is to provide a place for Shawnees to tell the story of their past, how that past informs and shapes Shawnees today, and who they see themselves becoming tomorrow. Through interactive exhibits visitors can listen to stories of the past, learn about traditions, and help envision the tribe’s future.</p> <p>The Shawnee exhibit visually tells the story of the Shawnee people through objects that represent essential aspects of Shawnee life— both today and throughout history. The installation displays no written information. Shawnee language, like many indigenous languages, is not traditionally a written language. History and ways of life are deeply rooted in oral tradition, with knowledge being shared and sustained from one generation to the next. While much has been written about Shawnee culture, a considerable amount of the information is incomplete. From sacred ceremonies to family stories, the exhibit supports Shawnee people in telling their own story. It invites conversation and investigations about Shawnee culture, with consideration for different ways of learning, sharing, and preserving.</p> <p>The Shawnee Tribe Cultural Center also features work by tribal artists, like that of Shawnee artist Gibson Byrd, who was a lifelong artist and educator. To honor his passion for art and teaching, interactive art exploration activities accompany the display. Past shows include “From Ancient Hands,” the center’s inaugural, award-winning exhibition featuring historic Shawnee pottery as well as contemporary pottery made in partnership with community members as well as scholars and scientists.</p>",

It hosts free photo and art exhibitions, and offers free programs, events and activities that explore themes of the land, rivers and people of the region. Themes are as diverse as agriculture, Mighty Mo fishing, heritage food and music, and Native Games days.  The 10,000-square foot Encounter Center features galleries, an activity room, an amphitheater, and areas for outdoor games and events. The Stanley Evans Auditorium hosts lectures, music and theatre programs, movies and panel discussions. An enclosed pathway known as “The River Connection” invites visitors to encounter maps and images of the Missouri River.<br /> <br /> The Interpretive Center and Betty Strong Encounter Center are both open Tuesday – Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 12 noon to 5 p.m.  Admission is free.  Access is easy, just off I-29, at 900 Larsen Park Road.  <br /> <br /> While in the Sioux City area, you’ll want to visit the Charles Floyd Monument, just five miles from the Centers.  Here on a bluff overlooking the Missouri, you can honor the memory of the first U.S. soldier to die west of the Mississippi River. <br /> <br /> For more information on the Sioux City Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center and the Betty Strong Encounter Center, go to: <a href=\"https://www.siouxcitylcic.com/\">www.siouxcitylcic.com.</a>",

That evening, the expedition camped among a grove of cottonwoods across the river (along the north bank) and nearly a mile upstream from a tributary they named “Slaughter River.” Lewis and his detachment camped there again on July 29, 1806, during the return journey and two days after the fight at Two Medicine.<br /> Today Lewis and Clark’s Slaughter River is known as Arrow Creek and is located within the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/montana-dakotas/upper-missouri-river-breaks\">Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument</a><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">. In 1967, the Montana Department of Fish and Game designated the site as a primitive boat access recreation area. Currently, the camp area includes a shelter and two privies. The Lewis and Clark Camp at Slaughter River is primarily publicly accessible via boat, but it can also be reached overland by a rugged two-track drive that leads from 8 Mile Bench Road. The overland route is restricted and requires access permission from the BLM.The Camp at Slaughter River was one of the few sites used by the explorers on both their outgoing and return trips. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">They first camped here on May 29, 1805. They had discovered the remains of over 100 buffalo, which they assumed were killed at a buffalo jump. Indigenous peoples in the high Plains used jumps to kill buffalo before the advent of steel-tipped arrows, lances and rifle-muskets. They would draw a herd to the edge of a butte, cliff, or river gorge and then instigate a stampede that forced the buffalo over the edge. Lewis explained:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>   <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">“. . . for this purpose one of the most active and fleet young men is scelected and disguised in a robe of buffaloe skin, having also the skin of the buffaloe's head with the years and horns fastened on his head in form of a cap, thus caparisoned he places himself at a convenient distance between a herd of buffaloe and a precipice proper for the purpose.the other indians now surround the herd on the back and flanks and at a signal agreed on all shew themselves at the same time moving forward towards the buffaloe; the disguised indian or decoy has taken care to place himself sufficiently nigh the buffaloe to be noticed by them when they take flight and runing before them they follow him in full speede to the precipice.the decoy in the mean time has taken care to secure himself in some cranney or crivice of the clift which he had previously prepared for that purpose. the part of the decoy I am informed is extreamely dangerous, if they are not fleet runers the buffaloe tread them under foot and crush them to death, and sometimes drive them over the precipice also, where they perish in common with the buffaloe . . .”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"> </p> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">The Corps wrongly attributed the jump to Blackfeet members, whose two-week-old campsite was found earlier in the day. Instead, the buffalo had simply drowned in the river and piled up on the bank when the ice broke. The presence of these buffalo was the inspiration for naming the nearby creek Slaughter River (now Arrow Creek).

During their stay, the expedition purchased dozens of dogs to eat and received gifts of fish, horse meat, and fire kindling.

    "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\">On August 25, 1804, Lewis, Clark, and several of their men walked nine miles to Spirit Mound from their camp on the south bank of the Missouri River. They were determined to see the mound that was so feared by the indigenous people of the area. In his journal Clark explained the legend of Spirit Mound:<br /> <br /> “. . . and by the different nations of Indians in this quarter is Suppose to be the residence of Deavels. That they are in human form with remarkable large heads, and about 18 inches high, that they are very watchful and are arm'd with Sharp arrows with which they Can Kill at a great distance; they are Said to kill all persons who are So hardy as to attempt to approach the hill; they state that tradition informs them that many Indians have Suffered by these little people.So much do the Maha [Omaha], Soues [Sioux], Ottoes [Otoes] and other neighboring nations believe this fable, that no Consideration is Sufficient to induce them to approach the hill. One evidence which the Inds give for believing this place to be the residence of some unusial Spirits is that they frequently discover a large assemblage of Birds about this mound . . .”<br /> <br /> The intense heat fatigued everyone, especially Lewis’s dog Seaman who was sent back to the river to rest. Finally, Lewis and Clark reached the top of Spirit Mound where they \"beheld a most beautiful landscape; Numerous herds of buffalo were seen feeding in various direction; the Plain to the North N.W. and N.E. extends without interruption as far as can be seen.\"<br /> <br /> Today, Spirit Mound is one of the few remaining physical features on the Upper Missouri River that is readily identifiable as a place Lewis and Clark visited and recorded.<br /> <br /> Spirit Mound is a High Potential Historic Site on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> On August 25, 1804, Lewis, Clark, and ten other men hiked about nine miles north of the Missouri River to visit Spirit Mound. According to Clark, the Omaha, Sioux, and Oto tribes traditionally believed that the hill was inhabited by devils “in human form with remarkable large heads and about 18 Inches high”. They were said to be “Very watchfull” and “arm’d with Sharp arrows with which they Can Kill at a great distance”. The men encountered no such inhabitants, but found a hill “Situated on an elivated plain in a leavel and ex­tensive prarie […] with a Steep assent to the hight of 65 or 70 feet, leaveing a leavel Plain on the top of 12 feet in width & 90 in length”. Clark observed that soil consistencies with the surrounding terrain indicated the “mound” was a natural landform. He wrote of the view, “from the top of this Mound we beheld a most butifull landscape; Numerous herds of buffalow were Seen feeding in various directions, the Plain to North N. W & N E extends without interuption as far as Can be Seen.”<br /> <br /> In 1868, European-Americans began to settle in the area. Over time, Spirit Mound was extensively degrad­ed by the impacts of livestock and crop production. By the early 1980s, the landscape was cluttered with over 20 buildings, a feedlot, agricultural fields, roads, fences, and about 1,500 non-native trees. The locally-formed Spirit Mound Trust worked with the Land and Water Conservation Fund to purchase the 320-acre site from private owners, and then donated it to the state of South Dakota for restoration and preservation. The Spirit Mound Historic Prairie was established as a state park in 2001, with a focus on prairie restora­tion. In 2004, the Spirit Mound Summit Trail was designated as a national recreation trail.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Diverse Meanings - Diverse Cultures</strong><br /> Spirit Mound has taken on a variety of cultural meanings that reflect the beliefs of the diverse peoples that make up the American population. It is an important point of contact between the American Indians and Euro-Americans. It exemplifies a sometimes uneasy fusion of these two major cultural traditions.</p> <p><strong>Native Meanings - The Mandan</strong><br /> For American Indians, Spirit Mound is both physical location and spiritual place, a place of contact between the natural and the supernatural world. The sacred Turtle Drums of the Mandan were created at Spirit Mound. At Spirit Mound, Lone Man saved the Mandans' ancestors from a great flood. The first shrine built to commemorate Lone Man's saving the Mandan was built at Spirit Mound.</p> <p><strong>Native Meanings - Yankton (Sioux)</strong><br /> For the Yankton (Sioux), Spirit Mound is associated with the <em>Can O'ti na</em>, Little Tree Dwellers/Little People. Long ago two tribes battled to a stalemate. They both sought help from the spirits at Spirit Mound. They tried to manipulate the spirits for their own purposes. Their manipulation failed, but it brought two types of spirits into this world. The larger Spirits moved west to become Sasquatch, but the <em>Can O'ti na</em> stayed in the area and can still be seen there today.</p> <p><strong>Native Meanings - Lakota (Sioux)</strong><br /> In Lakota (Sioux) tradition, Spirit Mound is also associated with the <em>Can O'ti la</em>. In the distant past, Iktomi (Trickster) persuaded the Raccoon people to try to change their nature. The <em>Can O'ti la</em> are descendants of two modified Raccoon children. As the <em>Can O'ti la</em> grew, they walked upright and used their paws like hands. They also became mischievous and played tricks on men. Men were led astray and sometimes died. Later in time at Spirit Mound, the Can O'ti la were transformed into spirit helpers of men. Spirit Mound is the origin point for the <em>Wo'piye Can O'ti la</em>, the Little Tree Dweller's Medicine Bundle. This medicine bundle is still in use today by the Lakota of the Dakotas and Nebraska.</p> <p>This coming together of the American Indians and Euro-American peoples had a downside. At Spirit Mound, the Winged One predicted that the <em>Can O'ti la</em> would be forced away from Spirit Mound when the true children (European-Americans) of the trickster <em>Iktomi</em> arrived. For some, Lewis & Clark's visit to Spirit Mound marks the beginning of the end of Lakota traditional lifeways.<br /> <br /> For more information, visit the <a href=\"http://www.spiritmound.com/\">Spirit Mound Trust</a> website. </p>",

The following day he wrote, “this mountain has a singular appearance it is situated in a level plain, it’s sides stand nearly at right angles with each other and are each about a mile in extent. these are formed of a yellow clay only without the mixture of rock or stone of any size and rise perpendicularly to the hight of 300 feet. the top appears to be a level plain and from the eminence on which I was yesterday I could see that it was covered with a similar cost of grass with the plain on which it stands. the surface appears also to possess a toler­able fertile mole of 2 feet thick, and is to all appearance inaccessible. from it’s figure we gave it the name of fort mountain. those mounds before mentioned near the falls have much the same apeparance but are none of them as large as this one.” Although the expedition, by Lewis’ measurements, never approached closer than within eight miles as they passed upriver, the distinctive landmark dominated the landscape. Lewis recognized it again during the return when he crossed the Continental Divide on July 7, 1806, and wrote, “the fort mountain bears North Eaast, and appears to be distant about 20 Miles.”<br /> <br /> Square Butte is a laccolith, formed millions of years ago by an intrusion of magma up through weaker layers of rock. It is grouped with two other nearby laccolith formations – Shaw Butte and Crown Butte. Although privately owned and publicly inaccessible, Square Butte remains an unmistakable and highly visible land­mark with an appearance that has been only minorly altered over time.",

On the return jour­ney, “the party rejoiced at the Sight of this hospital village” and they stayed overnight on September 20-21, 1806.</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">The earliest European settlement on the Missouri River, St. Charles began as an outpost for traders circa 1769. By the time of the 1804 Louisiana Purchase, the French inhabitants of the town were surrounded by American settlers in the countryside. As both river and land transportation increased, St. Charles grew in prominence. It became Missouri’s first state capital, from 1821 to 1826. The St. Charles Historic District encompasses an area eight-and-a-half blocks long and one-and-a-half blocks wide and includes buildings constructed between 1807 and the 1890s. Frontage along the west bank of the Missouri River includes a commemoration of Lewis and Clark in the approximate area of their campsite. The Lewis and Clark Boat­house and Museum is located nearby.</span></span></span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\"> </p> <div> </div>",

The village consisted of about a hundred houses inhabited by mostly French-Canadian settlers. There were also Osage and Kickapoo towns nearby. According to Clark, when the boats arrived in St. Charles about noon on May 16 “a number Spectators french [sic] & Indians flocked to the bank to See the party.” The group remained in St. Charles until Lewis arrived on May 20.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1ec972f8-30e2-4226-b878-0a565d8836a4}{181}\" paraid=\"1313891788\">While in St. Charles, the captains hired about a dozen mostly French-Canadian boatmen, or engagés, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/pierre-cruzatte.htm\">Pierre Cruzatte</a> and François Labiche. Many of the engagés had traveled and traded on the Missouri. They knew the river and could help navigate its trickier sections. Cruzatte, who Clark called “our principal waterman,” was especially skilled at reading river waters and saved the party from disaster on many occasions. </p> <p paraeid=\"{1ec972f8-30e2-4226-b878-0a565d8836a4}{235}\" paraid=\"1162298001\">The engagés also served as hunters and interpreters. Cruzatte and Labiche were Métis, people with both Indigenous and European, mainly French, heritage. Cruzatte and Labiche each had a French-Canadian father and an Omaha mother. They spoke multiple languages and had first-hand knowledge of many of the Indigenous communities along the river.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{17df10fa-f52c-4bfb-a28f-67e8977a5422}{46}\" paraid=\"2103321137\">For example, Labiche had experience trading with Otoe communities and spoke some Chiwere, the Siouan language spoken by Otoe people. When the expedition encountered a group led by the Otoe leader We ‘ar ruge nor (Little Thief), Labiche served as an envoy and interpreter. Cruzatte, Labiche, and the other French and Métis boatmen helped to ensure the success and safety of the expedition from beginning to end.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

As men left home to fight abroad, their families faced real hardship – frequently the salaries they earned as soldiers were far less than what they earned in civilian life (in order to alleviate this and to encourage enlistment, the Tootle-Lemon Bank in St. Joseph announced that it would cover the wage gap for any of its employees who enlisted).</p> <p>Learning to make ends meet with fewer resources was a particular challenge for households.

The building undertook an extensive renovation and restoration in 2018, and today the St. Nicholas Landmark offers upscale pub favorites, amazing entrees and specials, and fresh, local craft beer brewed at its sister location, the St. Nicholas Brewing Co., in nearby Du Quoin, Illinois.

It is difficult to view the landmark, as it is privately-owned and not visible from the river. The expanse of bottomland below Sugar Loaf Rock is the property of the Central Missouri Correctional Center, which restricts public access. The hilltop mound described by Clark remains extant, and the summit of Sugar Loaf Rock overlooks a sweeping vista of the river valley.",
    "audioDescription": "Above the river there is about 100 acres of land. On the top of the hill there is a six foot foot mound. There is a cave with dark projecting rocks above and around the opening and a 50 foot rise of limestone above it.",

Really sick.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{12}\" paraid=\"911131612\">Her French-Canadian husband, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, volunteered her for this American military mission. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark knew that they would need to trade for horses with Shoshone people—who Sacagawea had lived with for over a decade—to cross the mountains.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{48}\" paraid=\"1566517783\">She had her infant son, Jean Baptiste, with her. He was only four months old at the time.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{72}\" paraid=\"676588433\">What was it like to be so sick? Did her husband rock the baby to sleep while she laid in the shade of the pirogue? </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{78}\" paraid=\"570431242\">Clark and Lewis took all measures to help Sacagawea. They needed her. They could not get over the Rocky Mountains without her help. They needed her to live. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{94}\" paraid=\"943070407\">Clark bled Sacagawea for a few days (a popular treatment in Western medicine at the time), but it likely only made her symptoms worse. He also gave her salts, bark, and opium. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{124}\" paraid=\"757698567\">A week into her illness, the expedition reached a sulfur spring. Indigenous and non-Native people across the continent drank from sulfur springs to help heal a range of maladies.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{138}\" paraid=\"17411942\">Soon after Sacagawea drank from the spring, she felt better. It may have been that the illness just ran its course, but regardless, she recovered and helped the group through the Great Falls portage a few days later.</p> <p paraeid=\"{0db5af23-34a2-4a95-92e4-8e56a0136625}{154}\" paraid=\"625973615\">Was Sacagawea still weak in those days after she drank from the spring? Could she hold her baby without feeling faint? She must have known how desperately the American men needed her—did that give her solace or add pressure to her recovering body and mind? <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

While here, they also met with members of the local Chinook tribes.<br /> <br /> Clark recorded the visit in his journal, stating: <blockquote> <p>“A fair morning Sent out 6 hunters, and we proceeded to make the following observations <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/item/lc.jrn.1805-11-24#n26112407\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> a Chief and Several men of the <em><a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?lc_native_nation_ss=Chinook%20Indians\">Chin nook</a> </em>nation Came to Smoke with us this evening one of the men brought a Small Sea otter Skin for which we gave Some blue beads— this day proved fair which gave us an oppertunity of drying our wet articles, bedding &c. &c. nothing killed to day except one Brant. the variation of the Compass is 16° East.”</p> </blockquote> The vote itself was recorded by John Ordway, an expedition member, who wrote: <blockquote> <p>“clear pleasant morning. a white frost Several men went out a hunting we put out our baggage to air. The Calumbian River at this place is three miles 660 yards wide. Some of two nations of Indians came to our Encampment the Clatsop and Chinuck nations they behave very well as yet. our officers conclude with the oppinion of the party to cross the River and look out a place for winters quarter<span style=\"font-size: 10.5px;\">  </span> Some where as near the ocean as possable on the account of makeing Salt.”</p> </blockquote> The vote regarding the expedition’s winter quarters is thought to be a rather momentous event in early U.S. history as the first vote in the Pacific Northwest. It’s considered especially noteworthy because Clark’s slave, York, and Sacagawea also voted.<br /> <br /> Several years later, in 1851, Tansy Point served as the meeting point between the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Oregon Territory, Anson Dart, and representatives from several Chinook nations. The results of these meetings are collectively known as the Tansy Point Treaties. Sadly, the treaties were never ratified by the U.S. government, and the participating tribes lost their land without receiving any of the promised rights outlined in the treaties. They still struggle for federal recognition to this day.  <br /> <br /> Visitors to the Tansy Point will find spectacular views of the Columbia River and the town of Astoria, located three miles away. A scenic overlook with interpretive panels known as the Lewis and Clark Observation Platform marks the historical location of Lewis and Clark’s stay.<br /> <br /> The observation platform can be found by following the Warrenton Waterfront Trail. The trail runs for 4.7 miles through the city of Warrenton. Parking for the trail can be found at both its northern end at Seafarer’s Park and its southern end at Skipanon River Park, with an additional parking area located near the trail’s middle at Eben H. Carruther’s Memorial Park on Fort Stevens Highway. The trailhead at Eben H. Carruther’s Memorial Park is the closest one to Tansy Point.<br /> <br /> For more information on the Warrenton Waterfront Trail, visit <a href=\"https://www.traillink.com/trail/warrenton-waterfront-trail/#trail-detail-parking\">Warrenton Waterfront Trail</a>.

They have been lost to erosion or changes in the river, both natural and man-made (whether dams and other developments).  </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e684b9d-4d03-4aa3-9d88-139b4eecbca9}{148}\" paraid=\"1524394268\">Tavern Cave, however, remains much as it was when Lewis and Clark visited on May 23, 1804, a few days after leaving St. Charles, Missouri. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e684b9d-4d03-4aa3-9d88-139b4eecbca9}{154}\" paraid=\"1421427953\">For thousands of years, Indigenous people used Tavern Cave as a shelter. Later, European-American fur traders and other Missouri River travelers also utilized it. The cave entrance is at the base of a large sandstone bluff on the south bank of the river. Rocks jutting out over the cave opening made it a highly visible landmark. Many maps of the area, including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/life-at-camp-dubois.htm\">Mackay-Evans map</a>, noted its location. Names and markings etched into the cave wall showed the centuries of use. Clark remarked that “many names are wrote up on the rock,” and he felt compelled to add his. Some of the markings, possibly even Clark’s, still exist today. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5e684b9d-4d03-4aa3-9d88-139b4eecbca9}{186}\" paraid=\"1654042460\">Tavern Cave is notable for another reason. Lewis nearly fell to his death climbing on the rocks above the cave. According to Clark’s account, Lewis attempted to scale the sandstone cliffs to the rocks protruding out over the cave entrance. The brittle sandstone could not withstand Lewis’ weight, however, and he lost his footing. He fell about twenty feet before he “Saved himself by the assistance of his Knife,” presumably driving it into the rock wall to break his fall.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In 1804, The Corps of Discovery, a specialized Military Unit, set out under orders from President Thomas Jefferson to explore the Louisiana Purchase. The expedition arrived in present day Montana on April 27, 1805 and on June 13, Captain Meriwether Lewis was witnessing:</p> <blockquote> <p>“…the grandest sight I ever beheld…whin my ears were saluted with the agreeable sound of a fall of water and advancing a little further; I saw the spray arise above the plain like a collumn of smoke . . . which soon began to make a roaring too tremendous to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri…”</p> </blockquote> <p>-Captain Meriwether Lewis</p> <h3>The Great Falls | Ryan Dam</h3> <p>The best view of The Great Falls is done from the highest peak at <a href=\"https://www.visitmt.com/listings/general/recreation-area/ryan-island-park-picnic-area.html\">Ryan Island Park</a>, which is accessed from a suspension bridge across the Missouri River. After traveling a two-lane road that provides views of the expansive high plains and agricultural land, you will arrive at the viewing point of the Great Falls, located at 160 Ryan Dam Road.</p> <p>There are few hints given along the way of the canyon or the river contained at the end of the road. The roar of the falls is best witnessed in the Spring, just like Captain Lewis experienced. The canyon walls show the arduous task of portaging around the Falls that laid ahead of the Expedition. Although Ryan Dam, constructed in 1915, controls the flow of the water over the falls, the enormity of The Great Falls is still impressive. The dam follows the natural break in the landscape that created the falls and was more than 80 feet high when first seen by Captain Lewis. Today, The Great Falls stand 148 feet due to the dam.</p> <h3>Crooked Falls</h3> <p>Upstream 7 miles from the Great Falls, Crooked Falls flows over an irregular shelf, 19 feet high and 300 yards across. Untouched by a dam, and inaccessible by vehicle, Crooked Falls can be witnessed today just as the Expedition saw it in 1805.</p> <h3>Rainbow Falls | Rainbow Dam</h3> <p>Recorded by Captain Lewis as “Beautifull Cascade” in his journal, Rainbow Falls’ “cascade of about fifty feet perpendicular” was untouched when the dam was constructed in 1910. You can see the magnificent Rainbow Falls at 6401 Giant Springs Road.</p> <h3>Colter Falls</h3> <p>A half mile upstream from Rainbow Falls, the smaller, 6 foot Colter Falls could be found. Set behind Rainbow Dam, these falls are now submerged.</p> <h3>Black Eagle Falls | Black Eagle Dam</h3> <p>Nearest to Great Falls’ city limits, Black Eagle Falls are 2.5 miles above Rainbow Falls. At 26 feet high and 600 yards, these falls were the first to be dammed in 1890. From the top of these falls, the confluence of the Missouri River with the Sun River is visible and from the bottom, Black Eagle Memorial Island Park gives you the closest breathtaking vantage possible. These dramatic falls are located at 5401 River Drive North.</p> <h2>The Dams</h2> <h3>Morony Dam</h3> <p>The old town site of Morony still stands and offers a glimpse into where present-day Great Falls almost was. Below Morony Dam is great fishing and a natural spring, Sulphur Springs, accessible by foot or bicycle on River’s Edge Trail.</p> <h3>Cochrane Dam</h3> <p>Cochrane is the newest dam, constructed in 1958, between The Great Falls and Crooked Falls and is only seen along the River’s Edge Trail while walking or biking.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>History</h3> Much of the Corps' stay on the North Coast was spent securing sustenance for the winter and provisions for the trip home. On December 28, 1805, the Lewis & Clark Expedition sent out a detachment of five men in search of a good place to make salt. The expedition, which had been wintering at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-clatsop-or.htm\">Fort Clatsop</a>, had run out and were in desperate need of more. Salt was important for meat preservation and thus for the crew’s survival on the trip back home. The rivers near the fort weren’t salty enough, and so a better place had to be found. The men found an ideal spot on the Pacific Ocean approximately 15 miles from Fort Clatsop where they set up the salt processing camp.<br /> <br /> Making salt required a bit of planning and a lot of work. Sea water had to be collected and allowed to sit till the sand sank to the bottom. Then the men had to collect a large supply of firewood and build a stone furnace, on top of which they placed five kettles that had to boil 24 hours a day to produce the salt. Captain William Clark and few additional men joined the others at the salt works a little over a week later on January 9, arriving in the early afternoon. The group stayed at the salt works until February 20, when they left with 3.5 bushels (about 28 gallons) of “Excellent, fine, strong & white” salt. <p> </p> <h3>Today</h3> Today, visitors can see the site believed to be the expedition’s salt works. It was identified by a rock cairn and the testimony of Jenny Michel, born in 1816 to a Clatsop man who had pointed the place out to her when she was a child. According to her father, this was the place he had seen white men boiling water.<br /> <br /> The site is located on the Promenade. At the intersection of US Highway 101 and Avenue G, turn west to Beach Drive, then left to Lewis and Clark Way. Park where available without blocking private driveways. Walk west on Lewis and Clark Way to the Salt Cairn.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "Nestled between buildings on the Promenade, the salt works cairn sits inside a small stone courtyard surrounded by a brick and wrought iron fence. A plaque tells of the Lewis and Clark Expedition's time here at the site, and how Jenny Michel, born in 1816 and whose father remembered the white men, identified this site for the Oregon Historical Society in 1900, five years before her death.",

In 1804, Sergeant John Ordway described a landscape teeming with deer and large flocks of geese. He noted rich river bottoms “covered with different kinds of Timber.” For Ponca people who called the area home, the land and rivers provided physical and spiritual nourishment.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{162}\" paraid=\"1636669915\">In the 200 years since Ordway wrote those words, the construction of settlements, farms, dams, and other infrastructure have altered the rivers and surrounding landscape. </p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{184}\" paraid=\"273957235\">Today, farms and ranches cover the prairies above the river. Pollution from nearby towns and cities leaches into the river, affecting fish and other wildlife. Most significantly, the closest upstream dam, the Gavins Point Dam, slows the current of the Missouri and catches the mud it would naturally wash downstream.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{208}\" paraid=\"190814443\">Built in 1952, Gavins Point was one of many dams that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed on the Missouri River as part of the Missouri Basin Program (also commonly called the Pick-Sloan Plan). Congress voted to build these dams, claiming that they were needed for flood control, irrigation, and hydroelectricity generation.</p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{230}\" paraid=\"1836725613\">Before the dams, spring and summer rains frequently caused flooding along the Missouri. For Ponca people, the floods provided fertile soil and needed moisture for their gardens in the bottomlands.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{00371f28-044b-4c43-b588-a3ddfb485c6e}{244}\" paraid=\"73437295\">The dams mitigate floods, help to irrigate farms, and generate electricity.

Indigenous residents of the valley, including Delaware, Shawnee, Haudenosaunee, and other people who had <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/ohio-river-valley-a-place-for-refugees.htm\">come to the valley as refugees</a> lived in the Ohio River Valley in the late 1700s. Shawnee communities were known for accepting refugees from other Indigenous communities and their careful diplomacy helped foster pan-Indigenous confederacies out of the valley in the late 1700s.  <br /> <br /> French traders frequented the Ohio in the seventeenth century, and by the early 1800s, many people in the valley had mixed Indigenous-French heritage.  <br /> <br /> Following the American Revolution, a huge influx of White, American settlers came to the region, thanks to state and federal policies promoting settlement on lands violently seized from Indigenous people. Thousands of American settlers took<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/locust-grove-kentucky.htm\">roads through Kentucky</a> or floated down the Ohio on flatboats to claim these lands. Lewis passed several American settlements in 1803, and at one point, bought corn and potatoes from an American farmer. <br /> <br /> The water was low, which delayed their journey. To keep moving, they rowed, used poles to push the boat downstream, and at one point, “cut a channel through the gravel with our spade and canoe paddles and then drag the boat through.” These were all techniques that the many people who navigated the Ohio’s busy waters had likely used before.  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a>",

Clark wrote, “Capt Lewis & my Self walked up, to the top which forms a Cone and is about 70 feet higher than the high lands around it, the Bass is about 300 foot in decending this Cupola, discovered a Village of Small animals that burrow in the grown (those animals are Called by the french Pitite Chien).” They managed to kill one prairie dog and capture a second, which joined the expedition and survived the winter at Fort Mandan. In the spring, it (along with other collected specimens) was sent downriver and transported to Washington, D.C., to be received by President Jefferson on October 4, 1805. Lewis and Clark are credited with the first scientific description of the prairie dog, or Cynomys ludovicianus. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the Tower has changed very little since it was first documented by Lewis and Clark. Located about a half-mile south of the Missouri River in Boyd County, Nebraska, the landform rises an ad-ditional 70 feet above a line of bluffs along the southern edge of the Missouri valley.

William Clark polled everyone on November 24, 1805, and tallied their votes in his journal.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{72}\" paraid=\"401436884\">Clark recorded the vote of York, a Black man he enslaved. This was decades before Black men had the right to vote in the United States. Several years after the Lewis and Clark Expedition, York asked for his freedom. Clark denied his request. How meaningful was York’s vote, if he still was not free? </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{108}\" paraid=\"1376804430\">Clark also asked Sacagawea’s opinion on where to stay over the winter. Her vote was not tallied, but Clark made a note that she wanted to stay somewhere with lots of wapato, to make sure they had enough food for the winter. The group decision did not heed her concerns, but her point played out: they spent much of the winter trading with the Clatsop for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/wapato.htm\">wapato</a> and other food. And their health suffered at times when they had only dried salmon or spoiled elk meat to eat. </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{166}\" paraid=\"1297852312\">Ultimately, Lewis and Clark’s party decided to stay south of the Columbia River, where the Clatsop people lived and where there would be easy access to the ocean. The hunting would be good there, it was close to the ocean for salt-making, and they hoped the rain wouldn’t be as bad. </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{178}\" paraid=\"641365020\">Sacagawea voicing her opinion in 1805 gained more attention a century later. The women’s suffrage movement used Sacagawea’s input at Station Camp as a symbol of why women deserved the right to vote. That right came at the national level in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. However, barriers to suffrage still existed for people of color, including Indigenous women, until well into the twentieth century.</p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{218}\" paraid=\"1878192478\">Sacagawea and York gave their opinions to the White men leading the expedition—an expedition that neither of them freely chose to join. But did their votes make a lasting difference for Black people, Indigenous people, or women?  <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

Today, the Tribes still thrive in their homeland and the Center honors this rich cultural heritage.</p> <p>“Our elders knew the curves of the hillsides and the lines of the trails as intimately as they knew the curves and lines of their mother’s faces.

It was here that Sacagawea had previously been kidnapped by the Hidatsa during a raid on a Shoshone camp. Clark, who led a scouting party ahead of the main body, wrote, “we proceeded on a fiew miles to the three forks of the Missouri those three forks are nearly of a Size, the North fork [Jefferson River] appears to have the most water and must be Considered as the one best calculated for us to assend middle fork [Madison River] is quit as large about 90 yds. wide. The South fork [Gallatin River] is about 70 yds wide & falls in about 400 yards below the midle fork. those forks appear to be verry rapid & Contain Some timber in their bottoms which is verry extincive.” Lewis arrived two days later and wrote, “beleiving this to be an essential point in the geography of this western part of the Continent I determined to remain at all events untill I obtained the necessary data for fixing it’s latitude Longitude &c.” They spent several days exploring the area and making observations while the company hunted, rested, and refitted. Initially uncertain, Lewis and Clark determined the Jefferson River their best route forward in anticipation of meeting the Shoshone and gaining their assistance. Clark camped at the forks again on July 13-14, 1806, while enroute to the Yellowstone River valley during the return journey.<br /> The confluences of the Three Forks of the Missouri join along the boundary between Broadwater and Gallatin counties, about three miles northeast of the town of Three Forks and within the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"http://stateparks.mt.gov/missouri-headwaters/\">Missouri Headwaters State Park</a><span style=\"line-height:1.38\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><span style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><span style=\"white-space:pre-wrap\">.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br />  </p> <div> </div>",

They had learned about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/confluence-of-the-columbia-and-snake-rivers.htm\">great river</a> that that led to the ocean from the Indigenous people who had visited it many times, and the non-Native traders who had docked their ships at the river’s mouth.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1788c8c6-39e8-40d4-82b1-4d99eee2d04b}{62}\" paraid=\"1690832179\">When the party reached the Missouri Headwaters, they had two main objectives. First, find the Shoshone people and pay for Shoshone guidance and horses to help carry the expeditions’ things over the mountains. Second, find the pass (again, with help from Shoshone people) that would bring them closest to the Columbia River headwaters. This would shorten their overland journey significantly, since traveling by boat was easier and more efficient than by land.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1788c8c6-39e8-40d4-82b1-4d99eee2d04b}{134}\" paraid=\"1868182088\">They looked for signs that someone had recently been at the headwaters but found none. They split into smaller groups to check out the different tributary streams and see which one they wanted to go up. </p> <p paraeid=\"{1788c8c6-39e8-40d4-82b1-4d99eee2d04b}{172}\" paraid=\"1432425384\">With no Indigenous people present at the headwaters, their anxiety heightened. Lewis worried how they would decide which of the three forks would bring them to Shoshone communities.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1788c8c6-39e8-40d4-82b1-4d99eee2d04b}{192}\" paraid=\"1390181724\">But they had a Shoshone person with them: Sacagawea. She had been here before. Her Shoshone relatives camped here seasonally, and it was at one of these camps that her Hidatsa family captured (or recaptured) her almost five years earlier.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1788c8c6-39e8-40d4-82b1-4d99eee2d04b}{216}\" paraid=\"1491873393\">Sacagawea must have known that in July her Shoshone relatives would have still been fishing on the other side of the mountain, along the Lemhi and Salmon Rivers (tributaries to that great river that reached the ocean). She would have known that they did not come over the mountains to this area until September.</p> <p paraeid=\"{1788c8c6-39e8-40d4-82b1-4d99eee2d04b}{244}\" paraid=\"1650044219\">Did she try to tell Lewis and Clark?

On November 27, they proceeded “around a verry remarkable point which projects about 1½ Miles directly towards the Shallow bay the isthmus which joins it to the main land is not exceding 50 yards and about 4 Miles around.” Clark named it “Point William” and wrote, “below this point the waves became So high we were Compelled to land unload and traw up the Canoes, here we formed a Camp on the neck of Land which joins Point William to the main at an old indian hut.” The main party remained while Lewis took a detachment on November 29 to scout for suitable winter quarters. The interim days were miserable with nearly continuous winds and rain, and “nothing to keep our Selves or Stores dry, our Lodge nearly worn out, and the pieces of Sales & tents So full of holes & rotten that they will not keep any thing dry.” The men explored the point and surrounding area while hunting for game. Lewis returned on December 5 to report he “found a good Situation and Elk Suffient to winter on.” The expedition departed two days later.

In 1830, the United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. This law required native tribes to vacate their ancestral lands and relocate to reservations in Oklahoma, then simply called Indian Territory. Then, in 1835, a small group of the Cherokee Nation signed the Treaty of New Echota, which divided the Cherokee People into two factions—those that supported the treaty and those that opposed it.<br /> <br /> In May 1838, the U.S. Army, bolstered by various state militia groups, forcibly removed over 16,000 Cherokee from their homelands so that white settlers could move in. This journey, now referred to as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears</a>, saw more than a thousand Cherokee, mainly the old, young, and infirm, perish on this brutal forced march. Thousands more died shortly thereafter from the exposure, disease, and starvation they had suffered while en route to the reservations.<br /> <br /> The park’s visitor center offers exhibits focused on both the forced removal of the Cherokee People and the area’s natural history. A 23-minute documentary titled “Trail of Tears” is also available on demand. Interpretive programs are scheduled throughout the summer from Memorial Day through Labor Day.  <br /> <br /> Those looking to spend time outdoors will enjoy boating, fishing, hiking, and swimming. There are also two playgrounds within the park.Picnic sites are scattered throughout the park, some of which are accessible to those with disabilities. The park’s two covered pavilions are available for rent or, if not reserved, can be used on a first-come-first served basis for free. The campground offers basic, electric, and sewer/water/electric/water campsites, along with a special use camping area reservable for groups only.<br /> <br /> To reserve a pavilion, call (573) 290-5268. Camping reservations may be made by calling (877) 422-6766. To reserve the special use camping area, call (573) 290-5268.

The next day Clark wrote, “Concluded to Delay to day and make Some observations, as at this place the rout which we are to prosue will pass up the Travelers rest Creek, The day proved fair and we took equal altitudes & Some luner observations. The Latd. 46° 48’ 28” as the guide report that no game is to be found on our rout for a long ways, ads an addi­tion to the cause of our delay to precure Some meat, despatched all our hunters in different directions, to hunt the Deer which is the only large game to be found.” There was a friendly encounter with three Flat­head warriors, in pursuit of two men from another tribe who had stolen horses from them. On the morning of September 11, the expedition broke camp and continued westward into the mountains on the Lolo Trail. They returned to the area on June 30, 1806, and camped for three nights. Upon the July 3 departure, Clark took a contingent to explore the Yellowstone River, while Lewis headed for the Missouri and Marias rivers. </span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">While Lewis and Clark named the creek, not the camp, Travellers Rest, in popular use it now refers to the geographic location of the camp site, reinforced the establishment of the Travellers Rest National Historic Landmark and </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href=\"http://stateparks.mt.gov/travelers-rest/\">Travelers’ Rest State Park.</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\"> Conversely, the creek itself has since been renamed Lolo Creek.

Roads such as this one were marked by the parallel ruts left by travois. A travois consisted of two attached, load-bearing poles hitched to a horse or dog with a collar. As the animal pulled the travois, the two poles dragged along the ground. While much of the historic road has since been eradicated through agriculture, the five-acre Lewis and Clark Travois Road site encompasses intact remnants of the road system. Although privately owned, the area may be publicly viewed from a pull-off along US Route 12.</span></span></span></p> <div> </div>",

The Blackfeet nation were enemies to many of the tribal nations that the Corps of Discovery were in alliance with, such as the Nez Pearce and Shoshone nations. The Blackfeet Nation was also understandably unwelcoming to white men. It is no surprise that when Meriwether Lewis and three others, George Drouillard (an interpreter hunter, and cartographer), and brothers Joseph and Reubin Field (two of the expeditions top hunters) were walking on Blackfeet Territory and happened on a group of young Blackfeet tribesmen, there was fear of an outbreak of violence. However, the expedition narrowly avoided any violence during the initial meeting.</p> <p>On the evening of July 26, 1806, the camp was awoken to the sound of Blackfeet attempting to steal firearms. Unsuccessful in their attempt, two to three Blackfeet tribesmen were killed while the rest escaped. Quickly after this encounter, the campsite was packed up and the expedition fled in fear of a larger attack.</p> <p>In addition to the Two Medicine Fight Site being the first encounter with the Blackfeet Nation and first violent encounter, it was also the first military conflict between the US and a plains tribe.</p> <p>Today, the Two Medicine Fight Site is still in the Blackfeet Indian territory on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.

Yelleppit invited them to spend several days at his village near the confluence of the Walla Walla River. Receiving a warm welcome, the expedition spent the next few days engaging in trade, council, and socializing with the Wallulapum.

Hiking trails that climb into the highlands south of the confluence offer panoramic views of the Wallula Gap, a dramatic landscape formed by eroded basalt anticlines that was first documented by Lewis and Clark as they canoed downriver on October 18, 1805. Clark described it as a “range of high Countrey at which place the rocks project into the river from the high clifts.” Away from the infrastructure congested about the mouth of the confluence, much of the natural landscape retains the historic appearance witnessed by the expedition.</span></span></span><br />  ",

Spanning several thousand acres, the open flatland was a relief after the crew's trek through the Rockies. The Corps were exhausted and nearly starving, so making contact with the Nez Perce was crucial.",

Two days later, Lewis arrived with the main expedition. All were famished and exhausted. Lewis found himself “growing weak for the want of food and most of the men complain of a similar deficiency and have fallen off very much.” The Nez Perce generously welcomed and fed them meals of camas, dried salmon, and berries. Whether due to bacteria or a sudden change in diet, nearly the entire expedition became extremely sick. They departed Weippe Prairie on September 24 to prepare for their descent of the Clearwater River. Lewis and Clark reunited with the Nez Perce on May 3, 1806, during the return journey. Delayed by lingering winter in the mountains, they camped along the Clearwater River until June 10, then relocated to Weippe Prairie. On June 15, the expedition made its first attempt to cross the mountains, but found conditions to be impassable. They returned to Weippe Prairie on June 19 and remained another five days. Their final departure was on June 24. Six days later, they arrived at Travellers Rest. During the times spent with the Nez Perce, bonds of mutual friendship and respect were forged. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"color:black\">The Weippe Prairie National Historic Landmark covers approximately 3,120 acres, the majority of which is privately owned.

Meriwether Lewis gives a brief description in his journal when he writes on September 7, 1803, that he and his men “passed Charles town on the E. shore above the mouth of Buffaloe over which there is built a handsome wooden bridge, this has the appearance of a handsome little Village, containing about forty houses.” Notably, Patrick Gass, a sergeant and the chief carpenter of the expedition, later settled in Wellsburg, where he died in 1870 at the age of 98. He was the oldest surviving member of the expedition. </p> <p paraeid=\"{562258c8-8b6b-4ab4-9ef2-0a0b905e9301}{151}\" paraid=\"222227026\">Wellsburg boasts a number of historic locations for visitors to see. In 1982, the Wellsburg Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Included in this section of the town are Millers Tavern and the Wellsburg Wharf, both notable for predating the expedition and among the collection of village structures noted by Lewis. Millers Tavern, built in 1797, houses the Brooke County Historical Museum. Also located in the historic district is the Patrick Gass Cottage, originally built 1797, which Gass occupied during the final decades of his life. </p>",

    "bodyText": "In late July of 1804, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark arrived in present-day Council Bluffs. The Western Historic Trails Center, located on the banks fo the Missouri River in Council Bluff, Iowa, details their journey from St. Louis to the Pacific. Known as the Loess Hills region, unique deposits of windswept loess soils left behind by the last Ice Age rise 200 feet above the plains along the river. <br /> <br /> The Western Historic Trails Center is the perfect place to spend an afternoon learning about history, enjoying a musical performance, or even just to stretch your legs. The building itself was designed and built by the National Parks Service as a center of exploration in 1997. Here, visitors have the opportunity to retrace the steps of pioneers who came after Lewis and Clark, walking not only the trail blazed by the two intrepid explorers but also the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Mormon Trail.<br /> <br /> Exhibits include sculptures by Timothy Woodman, photos, maps, and quotes pertaining to the trails and America's history of Westward Expansion. Outdoor picnic areas offer a tranquil place to enjoy the sunshine and scenery. Walking and biking paths wind through 400 acres of prairie along the scenic Missouri River, offering a glimpse into what the two explorers and the Corps of Discovery observed more than 200 years ago. <br /> <br /> Admission is free. School and group tours are available, but require advance scheduling by calling the center at (712) 366-4900. Visitors are also encouraged to check the center's website and calendar for upcoming events at https://iowaculture.gov/history/sites/western-historic-trails-center. ",

One of the men caught what was likely a channel catfish, which inspired the encampment’s name – White Catfish Camp. They stayed until July 26, replenishing food, refitting equipment, and attempting to contact the Otoe and Pawnee tribes. Clark wrote, “This being a good Situation and much nearer the Otteaus town than the Mouth of the Platt, we concluded to delay at this place a fiew days and Send for Some of the Chiefs of that nation to let them Know of the Change of Govern­ment, The wishes of our Government to Cultivate friendship with them, the Objects of our journy and to present them with a flag and Some Small presents.” A party sent overland located an Otoe village near the confluence of the Elkhorn and Platte rivers, but found it empty. The expedition again stayed at this camp during the return journey on September 8, 1806.<br /> <br /> The exact location of White Catfish Camp is unknown. Although Lewis and Clark camped on what is now the Iowa side of the Missouri, the site is now most likely submerged by the river channel. The Iowa side of the river is privately owned, but on the Nebraska side <a href=\"http://www.fontenelleforest.org/\">Fontenelle Forest </a>(a National Natural Landmark) pro­vides public access via an excellent system of hiking trails that include Lewis and Clark interpretive wayside exhibits.",

Lewis characterized the landscape as exhibiting “a most romantic appearance,” and further described the distinctive geography, writing “The bluffs of the river rise to the hight of from 2 to 300 feet and in most places nearly perpendicular; they are formed of remarkable white sandstone which is sufficiently soft to give way readily to the impression of water; two or thre thin horizontal stratas of white free-stone, on which the rains or water make no impression, lie imbeded in these clifts of soft stone near the upper part of them; the earth<br /> on the top of these Clifts is a dark rich loam, which forming a graduly ascending plain extends back from ½ a mile to a mile where the hills commence and rise abruptly to a hight of about 300 feet more. The water in the course of time in decending from those hills and plains on either side of the river has trickled down the soft sand clifts and woarn it into a thousand grotesque figures”. Taken by the seeming architectural quality of the natural rock formations, he wrote that “nature presents to the view of the traveler vast ranges of<br /> walls of tolerable workmanship, so perfect indeed are those walls that I should have thought that nature had attempted here to rival the human art of masonry had I not recollected that she had first began her work.”<br /> <br /> The White Cliffs are located in the <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/montana-dakotas/upper-missouri-river-breaks\">Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument</a>, which was established in 2001. The picturesque landscape is primarily characterized by formations of Virgelle Sandstone that have eroded over millions of years. The area is publicly accessible by water and land.<br /> <br /> Learn more at <a href=\"http://www.lewis-clark.org/article/2911 \">Discovering Lewis and Clark.</a><br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "Clusters of white sandstone cliff like spires. The bluffs range from two to 300 feet tall with flat tops that are darker in color. The cliffs in the plain start smaller in the front and gradually increase in height as they extend back to the hills about a half to one mile.",

However, while encamped opposite the Sandy River Delta on April 2, 1806, Clark learned from two natives of “a large river which dis­charges itself into the Columbia on it’s South Side Some Miles below us. […] they drew [a sketch] on a Mat with a coal, it appeared that this river which they Call Mult-no’-mah discharged itself behind the Island we call the image Canoe island, and as we had left this Island to the South both in decending & assending the river we had never Seen it. they informed us that it was a large river and runs a Considerable distance to the South between the Mountains. I deturmined to take a Small party and return to this river and examine its Size and Collect as much information of the nativs on it or near its enterance into the Columbia of its extent, the Country which it waters and the nativs who inhabit its banks.” Clark, with six men and a guide, explored about seven miles up the Willamette River. Clark favorably noted, “The Current […] is as jentle as that of the Columbia glides Smoothly with an eavin surface, and appears to be Sufficiently deep for the larg­est Ship.” He returned to camp on April 3.<br /> <br /> The landscape character has altered significantly since 1806 due to riverfront industrialization and channel dredging.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Winter Camp at Wood River is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail</a>. <br /> <br /> Clark established the winter quarters for the expedition on the south side of the Wood River on a site previously identified by Lewis. On December 12, 1803, Clark wrote, “I came to in the mouth of a little River called Wood River” and the following day he “fixed on a place to build huts Set the men to Clearing land & Cutting Logs.” While there it was Clark’s responsibility to train the men of the newly-formed Corps of Discovery. Meanwhile, Lewis spent the winter in St. Louis gathering supplies and equipment. On March 9, 1804, Lewis attended a ceremony in St. Louis for the transfer of the Upper Louisiana Territory to the United States. After two months, the expedition left for St. Charles, Missouri, where Lewis joined them a week later. During the return trip, the expedition revisited the camp site on September 23, 1806. Clark noted that “here we found a widdow woman who we left here & has a plantation under tollarable good way Since we have been on the Expedition.”</p> <p>The winter camp was originally sited on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River. Since that time, the Mis­sissippi’s channel has shifted eastward, the mouth of the Missouri River has shifted southward, and a new channel for the Wood River was dredged. Consequently, the historic site of the Winter Camp at Wood River is now located on the west side of the Mississippi River, in Missouri. Nearby interpretation of the camp is found at the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site reconstruction in Hartford, Illinois.</p> <p>After the Corps of Discovery departed Camp Dubois on May 14, 1804, Sergeant Patrick Gass recorded his thoughts: “..in the evening we encamped on the north bank six miles up the river. Here we had leisure to reflect on our situation, and the nature of our engagements: and, as we had all entered this service as volunteers, to consider how far we stood pledged for the success of an expedition…”</p> <p>Camp Dubois sat at the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, near present day Hartford, Illinois. Between December 1804 and May 1805, Camp Dubois housed the men of the newly formed Corps of Discovery. During those months dedicated to final preparations for the long journey, these men brawled and drank and disobeyed. And yet as they prepared, the men began the slow process of becoming a corps, a unit.</p> <p>William Clark guided this transformation. While Meriwether Lewis wintered in St. Louis, securing provisions and consulting fur traders’ journals, Clark delegated and disciplined. Courts-martial and confinement were standards of military discipline. Hard work taught the men to rely on one another and prepared them for the long voyage. Turning mischief to skill, the men held shooting matches with local farmers and honed their marksmanship.</p> <p>Camp Dubois proved to be the expedition’s first test of cohesiveness. Living and working together prepared Corps members like Gass to face the trials the journey would bring. Still, on that spring morning in 1804, it was not without anticipation and trepidation that they “proceeded on under a jentle brease up the Missouri.”</p> <p>More information about Camp Dubois is available in the following books and web sites.</p> <p><strong>Books</strong><br /> <em>The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, vol. 2</em>.<br /> Edited by Gary E.

After a hike of several miles, Lewis “ascended the hills from whence I had a most pleasing view of the country, perticularly of the wide and fertile vallies formed by the missouri and the yellowstone rivers, which occasionally unmasked by the wood on their borders disclose their meanderings for many miles in their passage through these delightfull tracts of country.” The five men camped on the Yellowstone riverbank overnight. The following day Lewis “dispatched Joseph Fields up the yellowstone river with orders to examine it as far as he could conveniently and return the same evening; two others were directed to bring in the meat we had killed last evening, while I proceeded down the river with one man in order to take a view of the confluence of this great river with the Missouri”. By noon the main group arrived by river, and Lewis and Clark took measurements at the confluence. <br /> <br /> Public visitation is facilitated by the <a href=\"http://www.history.nd.gov/historicsites/mycic/index.html\">Missouri-Yellowstone Confluence Interpretive Center</a>, a museum that is operated by the <a href=\"http://www.history.nd.gov/index.html\">State Historical Society of North Dakota</a>.

The 8 foot sculpture was commissioned by the city of Louisville in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark’s historical trip. It pays homage to the contributions of York, born a slave and the childhood companion of Clark, and his significant role in Lewis and Clark’s Corps of Discovery expedition from 1803 through 1806. The York Statue sits atop the Belvedere, located at the corner of Fifth & Main Streets, overlooking the Ohio River.</p> <p>The following is taken from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/york.htm\">content created by the National Park Service</a>:</p> <p>Little is known about the life of York. He was an enslaved man owned by William Clark, and later became a member of the Corps of Discovery. William Clark inherited York as property when the elder Clark died, and the two were around the same age. York was one of only two members of the original Corps who was married.</p> <p>York is often mentioned in the journals kept by both Lewis and Clark throughout the course of the Expedition. These journal entries indicate that he experienced freedoms that few enslaved people had, though these freedoms would be revoked upon his return to the Clark plantation.</p> <p>The journals indicate that York was allowed to hunt, which was notable because African Americans weren’t generally allowed to handle guns. He became the primary caregiver to Charles Floyd, who died during the Expedition from what is believed to have been appendicitis. He risked his life to save Clark, Sacagawea, and her son when they were caught in a flash flood. York is also credited with being the first African American to have a vote equal to that of a white man. In November 1805 the Corps held a vote to decide where to camp for the winter, and both York and Sacagawea cast votes on that location.<br /> <br /> When the Corps of Discovery returned from the Expedition, each member – except York – received double pay and 320 acres of land. York, on the other hand, returned to slavery. Clark denied York’s initial requests for freedom, recording in 1808 that:</p> <p><em>“I did wish to do well by him. But as he got Such a notion about freedom and his emence Services…I do not think with him, that his Services has been So great/or my Situation would promit me to liberate him.”</em></p> <p>York was finally freed sometime after 1815. With his freedom, Clark gave York a wagon and team of horses, with which York created a hauling business. By 1832, however, Clark told author Washington Irving that York’s business failed, and that he had contracted cholera and died in Tennessee. The location of his burial is unknown.</p>",

    "bodyText": "The Youngs River was originally discovered by Lieutenant William Broughton of the Vancouver Expedition in 1792, who named it in honor of Admiral Sir George Young of the Royal Navy. It would be another fourteen years before the spectacular Youngs River Falls would be discovered by Sergeant Patrick Gass, a member of Lewis and Clark’s Corps of Discovery. On March 1, 1806, Gass noted the discovery in his journal, saying: <blockquote> <p>“We had a cloudy wet morning. I set out with 8 men and 4 hunters to bring the meat of the elk that had been killed, which was at a greater distance from the fort than any we had yet brought in. There is a large river that flows into the southeast part of <a href=\"https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/search?places=Baker%20%28Haley%27s%29%20Bay\">Hayley's Bay</a>; upon which, about 20 miles from its mouth, our hunters discovered falls, which had about 60 feet of a perpendicular pitch.”</p> </blockquote> Located just ten miles south of the city of Astoria, Oregon, Youngs River Falls is a popular summer recreation spot for swimming. Here, the warm waters of the Youngs River tumble over a rocky 54-foot drop to a pool below, the deepest point of which is between five to seven feet and surrounded by dense forest. From the parking lot, a short 0.25-mile trail leads downhill from the parking lot to the base of the waterfall. The waterfall can also be seen from the parking lot.<br /> <br /> Admission to the site is free and is open year-round for day-use only. Dogs are welcome but must be kept on a leash. Climbing and cliff jumping are not permitted. For more information, visit https://oregondiscovery.com/youngs-river-falls.",
    "audioDescription": "A short quarter-mile trail leads downhill to the waterfall base. There, the Youngs River cascades over a 54-foot high and 45-foot wide cliff wall into a deep pool rimmed with large rocks and boulders.",

To reach access, walk down hill, out of parking area and cross the paved road and railroad tracks, walking towards Kellams Bridge (vehicular bridge). On the left side of the bridge, there is a small gravel path leading down towards the water. This path is located next to a vehicular gate and is also marked by a large rock adjacent to the start of the path. A loose rope is tied in between this rock and to a tree on the path, providing a loose handrail down the path. The path is steep, uneven, and rocky. after approximately 20 feet, the path will meet the river.",

It was used as an office and residential space for toll collection until 1955, where it was then used just as an office space and tollbooth. Upon the acquisition of the aqueduct by the National Park Service, the tollhouse became an interpretive center.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{2b3c78ed-cad4-417b-a668-6c219c3f6706}{174}\" paraid=\"21667167\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Inside the toll house, visitors can view a recreated interior of what a canal boat cabin may have looked like. Outside the toll house, the Roebling Bridge offers excellent views of the river and just north is an parking lot and access to the Towpath trail which runs along the old D&H towpath. Although the D&H canal is no longer in use, portions of the historic canal still remain within the boundaries of Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Small, light blue one-story house with white trip and a front porch. The house sits of the New York side of the John Roebling Aqueduct/Bridge. To enter the house, one must approach the house from the side facing away from the river, walking up a shallow set of curving outdoors steps that wraps around the house to the front porch. The front of the house has a wood, brown and white front door flanked by two windows with a wooden bench on the left side of the porch (when facing the front door). An American flag sits at a slight angle in a holder attached to a corner porch support pillar. The porch is covered with a dark roof. The house roof is A-frame styled. An informational wayside is several feet away from the porch, in the direction of the bridge. Inside the toll house is 2-room space with hardwood floors. You enter the main room, which is a large open space. Brochures sit on the windowsill to one's immediate left when entering the space, as well as on the wall to one's immediate right. A small part of the room about five feet forward and slightly to the right is sectioned off with a recreated scene of what a canal boat cabin looked like inside, with bunk beds, 19th century clothing on hooks, a gingham clothed table with dishware and fake food, and a simple, rectangular fake wood burning stove.",

The Delaware Aqueduct is also designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark. The Delaware Aqueduct continued to function as a vehicular bridge until 1979. In 1980, the National Park Service purchased the aqueduct to be preserved as part of Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River. Almost all of the Delaware Aqueduct's existing ironwork — cables, saddles, and suspenders — are the same materials installed when the structure was built. Today, you may walk across the former aqueduct, following the path taken by canalers and their mules over a century ago.

    "audioDescription": "A bridge, about 400 feet long, stretching over a river. The bridge has two main support structures that sit in the river, keeping the bridge flat over the water. Each support is made of stone bricks, each shaped with the side that faces upstream shaped at a roughly 50 degree angle. On each support, a wooden ice breaker structure is attached, with the sloped part of the support covered with planks of wood, and a large, wooden structure coming off which sits on top of the river, pointing upstream. The icebreaker part on the river are roughly as tall as a person and roughly 50 feet long. The main part of the bridge is covered in approximately 100 wooden beams or braces oriented vertically along each side. You can barely make out what looks like a red cord or cable behind the wooden braces that threads from one end of the bridge to the other, each end curving downwards with the cable lifted at the center of the bridge, so the cable makes a very wide, shallow \"w\" shape. To walk onto the bridge, there are entrances on each side of the river that lead up to a paved walking path along both sides of the bridge. Three of the entrances are ramps with handrails, and the fourth entrance, the entrance on the New York side that is faces downstream and is next to the tollhouse, has stairs with a ramp. Both sides of the bridge also have parking lots, on the New York side, it is located on the upstream side of the bridge, and on the Pennsylvania side, it is located on the downstream side of the bridge. Both parking lots have latched trash receptacles and the Pennsylvania parking lot has seasonal restrooms.",

It was in this Lackawaxen home that Grey’s professional writing career began. He lived at this property from 1905 to 1918, and during his time here penned some of his most famous pieces of literature, including his best-known work, Riders of the Purple Sage (1912). Grey would go on to be one of the most successful American authors of the 20th century, publishing over 80 books, many of which were later adapted to movies. He is considered one of the most influential authors of the American western genre.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{189942b8-5bff-4407-afae-74fec39d8230}{156}\" paraid=\"1619401148\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The house was completed in 1906. It was the largest of several structures built for members of Zane Grey’s extended family. The house was originally occupied by Zane Grey’s brother and sister-in-law, Romer and Rebecca Grey, while Zane Grey and his wife, Dolly, lived in a nearby farmhouse. Romer and Rebecca deeded the house to Dolly in 1914. Zane funded two major expansions to the house between 1914-16, greatly expanding the home. After 1918, the Greys moved to California, and the house was used very rarely by the family, before eventually being sold in 1945 to Helen Davis, who converted it to an inn. In 1973 the inn was converted to a museum dedicated to the prolific author and was acquired by the National Park Service in 1989 to be included in Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fc568231-bfad-4534-b9c3-d2c178a7effd}{131}\" paraid=\"420981313\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Today, self-guided museum exhibits are available seasonally from Memorial Day to Labor Day for visitors to explore on the first floor of the house, including a recreation of Zane Grey’s writing space. A public river access is across the street from the house where visitors can access the river for boating and fishing. During weekends in January and February, the museum is open for the Bald Eagle watching season. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Two-story gray-green house with white trim and third-story attic. Has a white wraparound covered porch and a brown, wood-singled roof. The house is quite long and sits on a slope, so that when facing the front of the house, the left side sits on top of the hill and the right side of the house is supported by wood supports so the house sits level. The supports are painted white with a green-gray wood lattice preventing someone from walking underneath the house. Stone steps with wood railing lead up to the porch from the bottom of the slope, leading from right to left. The front door is on the left side of the house and is made of brown wood. On the door's sides there are large, wide windows with white trim. Right of the window to the right of the front door is another door which is white with a square window. To this white door's white is one last window. The second floor has six windows, five of them are vertically-oriented rectangle shapes with white and green striped awnings over them. The rightmost window is a horizontally-oriented rectangle with no awning. The attic space as two sets of double windows, the one on the left being larger. Two brick chimneys, one on the right and one of the left, poke out from the roof. Behind the house there are tall leafy trees. When entering the museum from the front door one enters a room with a small, open gift shop area to the immediate left and exhibits straight ahead and to the right. On the right wall is a doorway which leads to a room with exhibits along the walls. In the main room if one walks left and then turns right at the end of the gift shop area then they will walk into another small exhibit area.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Over the course of her lifetime, Clara Barton was a dedicated Civil War nurse, an active women’s rights suffragette, and the founder and first president of the American Red Cross. She lived in the house on the property for a brief time in 1891, and then again from 1897 until her death in 1912. </p> <p>From 1891-97, the house served as an American Red Cross warehouse, and it was the organization’s national headquarters from 1897-1904. The Red Cross continued to use the house as a warehouse for relief supplies, stationery, and Red Cross publications. </p> <p>Inside, the first floor includes a parlor room, dining room, offices, and a kitchen. The second floor was for bedrooms, including Ms. Barton's room at the rear of the house. Look up to the third floor and note the windows with red crosses in them. Some of the interior walls and ceilings are covered with muslin, the same material used in bandages.</p> <p>During her residence here, Barton developed the landscape into a miniature farm that was primarily self-sustaining, including crops, stables, and a chicken coop. This agricultural use of the landscape is no longer evident; development at the Glen Echo amusement park including roller coasters and the modern parking lot built over most of the farming operation. Many of the trees and plants that grow today are not consistent with the historic function of the grounds. However, the Clara Barton House is the most significant building associated with her time at Glen Echo, and it remains intact.</p> <p>In the years following Ms. Barton's death in 1912, her colleague, Dr. Julian Hubbell, replaced the porch with a columned, one-story porch. His twin nieces inherited the house in 1929 and converted the interior to rent-producing apartments, added baths and kitchens, and a garage with screened porches above at the western rear corner. </p> <p>Congress declared the Clara Barton House a National Historic Landmark on January 12, 1965, and in 1974 passed legislation establishing the house and grounds as the Clara Barton National Historic Site. This property was acquired by NPS in April 1975 through a donation from the Friends of Clara Barton. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gwmp/planyourvisit/fortmarcy.htm\">Fort Marcy</a> and nearby Fort Ethan Allen, among other batteries on the northern bank of the Potomac River, were built to protect Leesburg Pike and Chain Bridge. Construction began in 1861. When Fort Marcy was completed, it had a perimeter of 338 feet and mounted 18 guns, a 10-inch mortar and two 24-pounder Coehorn mortars.</p> <p>The hill on which the fort is located was known as Prospect Hill. Originally the fort was called Fort W.F. Smith after Major General William F. Smith, the troops of whose division began construction of the work. His division crossed Chain Bridge on the night of September 24, 1861, and immediately commenced construction of Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen. The 79th New York Highlanders, the 141st Pennsylvania and the Iron Brigade also helped complete the work in the fall of 1862. A force of about 500 contrabands were employed. The 152nd New York worked on the entrenchments, which are still in a very good state of preservation. The site of Fort Marcy is near the location where the famous, but bloodless duel between Henry Clay and John Randolph was fought in 1826.</p> <p>The fort was not entirely completed until the fall of 1862. It is a relatively undisturbed fort and was named in honor of a native of Massachusetts, the Honorable Randolph B. Marcy, a distinguished soldier, father-in-law, and Chief of Staff to Gen. George B. McClellan. Detachments of the 4th New York Heavy Artillery, 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and the 130th Pennsylvania infantry were among the troops that performed garrison duty here during the war. An interesting incident of history is that the body of troops, which afterwards became famous, and the \"Iron Brigade\" was originated at this fort in the summer of 1861. It was composed of the 19th Indiana, the 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin Regiments. The 24th Michigan was added to the brigade soon after the battle of South Mountain. These regulars remained together until the close of the war.</p> <p>After the Civil War ended Fort Marcy was returned to its original owners, the Vanderwerken family. The land remained in the Vanderwerken family until after World War II, when the DeLashmutt family purchased the property.</p> <p><span>\"</span>Thoughts on Fort Marcy,<span>\" is a poem written by Lillian Money-Read that was published in the </span><em>The Washington Post</em><span>, April 12, 1936. The poem is an eloquent tribute to not only Fort Marcy, <span>but the other forts in the Defenses of Washington system that have, over time, been covered by deciduous forests of American elm, yellow-poplar, and white ash. <span>Today these remnant earthworks</span><span> are a silent reminder of the protective shield that surrounded the nation’s capital during the Civil War years. </span></span></span></p> <p align=\"left\"><strong> </strong></p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Thoughts on Fort Marcy </strong>by Lillian Money-Read:</p> <p align=\"left\">The woodland drips with sun-warmed April rain,<br /> The trees are colorful with new–oped leaves,<br /> With half-blown buds the dogwood trees are snowed,<br /> The maple-tassels, green with scarlet cleaves.</p> <p align=\"left\">May apple flings its sweetness on the air,<br /> Translucent stemmed, the big dark violet<br /> And pied spring beauty, bride of early morn<br /> Bloom in the vivid moss with shy bluet.</p> <p align=\"left\">My dog bounds down and leaves a darkened trail<br /> Along the silvered hillside, wild with mirth,<br /> His mouth is spread, his limpid eyes a-shine,<br /> His muzzle wet with brown, sweet-smelling earth.</p> <p align=\"left\">On fair Fort Marcy, thus I dream today.<br /> And hear the swollen creek rush to the river,<br /> With muffled roar like a dreadful battle din<br /> Which made, of old, these frightened forests shiver!</p> <p align=\"left\">Ah, bright the ferns that clothe these silent moats,<br /> And sweet the lanes where walked the sentinel,<br /> Yet scarce a flower springs on this haunted ground<br /> But marks the place where some young soldier fell!</p> <p><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>",

Fort Warburton was built on the Maryland side in 1808 as tensions escalated between the United States and England. During the War of 1812, as British troops marched overland into Washington, the fort was destroyed by its own garrison to prevent capture. This embarrassing incident led to the court martial of the fort's commander, Captain Samuel Dyson, and the construction of a more substantial fort in 1824, the one you see across the river today, known as Fort Washington.<br /> <br /> In 1861, Fort Washington was the only fortification defending the capital at the outset of the Civil War. To defend the federal city, 68 additional earthen forts were quickly constructed around the city. While no river attack occurred during the Civil War, this area continued to be a place for coastal defense. Just prier to the Spanish-American War (1898), this side of the Virginia shore began to be fortified with cannons to compliment the cannons at Fort Washington. This area was named Fort Hunt and the military accelerated construction and rehabilitation of both forts with modern artillery and a submerged minefield between the forts. By the 1930s, the forts were deemed obsolete, closed and given to the National Park Service. However, during World War II, Fort Hunt was reactivated as a top secret military intelligence camp and POW interrogation center. Today, both forts stand as silent reminders of the nation's military history. ",

It spans about six hundred fifty feet wide and runs five hundred fifty yards west along the Potomac River. A channel separates Gravelly Point from the end of a National Airport runway to the east. Airplanes land and takeoff throughout the day, flying only a few hundred feet above the field.<br />Soccer and other athletic fields line the area and trees and picnic tables are scattered around the edge of the field. Mount Vernon Trail runs along the northern side as it passes through from east to west. A boat ramp feeds into the Potomac River from the southeastern end of the point.<br />Portable restrooms and bicycle racks sit north of the bicycle trail at the west end of the park.<br />North of the parking lot, on the north side of the Mount Vernon Trail is a six-square-inch bronze plaque set in cement on the ground. An inscription on the plaque reads:<br />GOVERNOR'S GROVE<br />THIS GROVE OF DOGWOOD TREES WAS PLANTED BY THE WIVES OF OUR STATE GOVERNORS<br />MARCH 18, 1967<br />Across Mount Vernon Trail to the west is a four by three-foot wayside titled at the top:<br />Gravelly Point<br />The sign features a map of the Potomac River and Mount Vernon Trail along the left side and provides trail and bicycling rules and etiquette, and park information on upcoming events.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "During WWII, the US helped liberate the Netherlands from Nazi occupation. After the war, the US helped rebuild European economies. The people of the Netherlands gave Americans this carillon to thank them.<br /> <br /> A carillon is a percussion instrument of bells. Each bell in this town is bronze and inscribed with poetry and emblems. The bells represent various aspects of Dutch society such as art, science, agriculture, the youth of the Netherlands, and more. <br /> <br /> When a musician plays, they use a large keyboard of pegs in the top level of the tower. Wires connect each peg to a clapper that strikes a bell. The keyboard of pegs is laid out like a piano keyboard.<br /> <br /> The bell that makes the lowest musical note is six feet nine inches wide and weighs 12,654 pounds. The highest note comes from a bell that is eight inches wide and weighs 26.5 pounds. <h3>Harmony of Friendship</h3> The Netherlands Carillon has moved around the Washington, D.C. area and grown over time. In 1952, Queen Juliana presented the carillon symbolically to President Truman in Meridian Hill Park. <br /> <br /> In 1954, 49 bells were installed in a temporary structure in West Potomac Park. While the bells rang from there, construction on a permanent carillon began here. <br /> <br /> Dutch architect Joost W.C. Boks designed the 127-foot-tall tower. The geometric design recalls the style of Dutch artist Piet Mondriaan. The tower was the first modernist steel memorial on the National Mall. <br /> <br /> On May 5, 1960, the bells were celebrated in their new permanent home, the Netherlands Carillon. May 5 is Liberation Day in the Netherlands. It marks the end of Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during WWII.<br /> <br /> In 1995, 50 years after WWII, Netherlands Prime Minister Kok presented President Clinton with a 50th bell.<br /> <br /> In 2022, after a two-year rehabilitation project, the carillon was rededicated. Three more bells were added, making this a \"grand carillon\" with 53 bells total. One bell is for General George C. Marshall who helped rebuild Europe after WWII with the Marshall Plan. Another commemorates First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's advocacy for human rights. The final of the three new bells honors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s lifelong work advancing civil rights. <br /> <br /> Two bronze lions guard the carillon. Cast by Dutch sculptor Paul Koning , these lions symbolize the Dutch royal family. In spring, thousands of tulips decorate the grounds. ",

    "bodyText": "\"Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose\" - LBJ<br /> <br /> The Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac is a living memorial, surrounded by a grove of white pines and dogwoods bordered by azaleas and wildflowers. The focal point of the memorial is a 19 foot monolith made of sunset red granite quarried 35 miles from President Johnson's Texas ranch home. The granite monolith weighs about 43 tons and is estimated to be one billion years old. The stone was chiseled to embody Johnson's rugged, dynamic personality. Surrounding the memorial is a broad grassy meadow that provides visitors a place for physical and mental rejuvenation. <br /> <br /> The living memorial reflects the Johnson administration's commitment to preserving the nation's natural heritage. President Johnson designated 3.6 million acres of land as park land and signed into law the Wilderness Act and Clean Air Act. Around the base of the memorial are four quotes chosen by Lady Bird Johnson that reflect important elements of Johnson's Great Society program. One of the main goals of the Great Society was to promote the upward mobility of society and increase the quality of life for average Americans. Johnson's programs included over 60 educational bills and his signature \"war on poverty\" that created programs such as medicare, Johnson's first legislative accomplishment was the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, the first civil rights policy for almost 100 years that outlawed segregation in America. Over 1000 pieces of legislation became law during his 5-year administration.  <h3>\"Where flowers bloom, so does hope.\"- Claudia Alta Taylor \"Lady Bird\" Johnson</h3> <br /> First Lady Claudia Alta Taylor Johnson, known as Lady Bird, is famous for her nationwide beautification initiatives. When she served as first lady from 1963 to 1969, she championed legislation concerning pollution, conservation, urban renewal, and numerous environmental rehabilitation concerns. She is credited with raising the president's awareness of women's rights equality, furthering environmental stewardship, and promoting the war on poverty. After Lyndon Johnson's presidential term, Lady Bird continued to serve her country by holding advisory positions in later administrations. <br /> <br /> Across the footbridge is an island named Lady Bird Johnson Park. The island was originally named Columbia Island because it is actually part of the District of Columbia and the waterway between the island and Virginia was dubbed the Boundary Channel. The man-made island was built in the early 1900s to facilitate the construction of Arlington Memorial Bridge. In the 1960s, Lady Bird Johnson took action through her beautification committee to coordinate the planting of over a million daffodils, a few thousand dogwood trees, and other native vegetation on the island. <br /> <br /> The island is only one example of places Lady Bird worked to beautify in the District of Columbia. In 1968. Johnson's Secretary of Interior, Stewart Udall renamed this island Lady Bird Johnson Park to honor Lady Bird for her extensive work in revitalizing public parks and green spaces across the country.",

Though no visible remains of Battery Rodgers exist today, the complex once included the fortification, barracks, hospital and a slaughterhouse built especially to feed troops in Alexandria. <br /> <br /> Battery Rodgers was powerfully equipped with five 200-pound Parrott rifles and one 15-inch Rodman gun, but no shots- or men- were ever fired on enemy ships by its guns. This view of the battery shows the 15-inch Rodman gun and the powder magazines overlooking Battery Cove. In 1911, the cove was filled in by the Army Corps of Engineers, creating 46.5 acres of new land, including the spot on which you're standing.

Turn right and follow the parking lot to the south about eight hundred feet. <br />At the end of the parking lot a pedestrian bridge leads left over the Potomac River. To the right is a curved stone wall, about two feet tall. One-foot thick and thirty feet long. Set about ten feet south of the stone wall, just beyond a row of black, arched bicycle racks is a two by three-foot wayside.<br />The tan sign is titled across the top in black letters:<br />American Indian Villages and Captain John Smith<br />In the center of the sign is a sketched map dotted with trees, winding rivers, and tributaries. Written in large letters on a scroll at the top is: \"VIRGINIA.\" In the bottom left corner is written: \"The Virginian Sea.\" Identified toward the center of the map in white letters are:<br />Tuscan Cross<br />Namassingakent<br />Assaomeck<br />Namoraughquend<br />Text below the map reads:<br />Captain John Smith's Map of Virginia (above), first published in 1612, is one of the best known maps of colonial America. The three seasonal fishing camps that Smith recorded are identified above. The Tuscan cross marks the Great Falls - the farthest limit of Smith's exploration.<br />If the map appears \"sideways\" it is because \"up\" is west rather than north. In the 1600s, mapmakers customarily drew maps from the perspective of a sailor approaching land from the sea.<br />Text along the left side of the sign describes Captain John Smith's exploration of the Potomac River:<br />On June 16, 1608, Englishman Captain John Smith and fourteen other men from the Jamestown colony entered the Potomac River aboard a two-ton open barge in search of a glistering metal the [natives] told us they had from Patowmeck. They explored upriver as far as the Great Falls. Along the way, Smith recorded many American Indian villages, which he later included on his map of Virginia.<br />The first three villages below the falls, on the right bank of the Potomac, were located on lands now part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The names of these villages, as heard by Smith and spelled in Elizabethan English, were Namoraughquend, Assaomeck, and Namassingakent. Translated from Eastern Algonquian into English they mean \"fishing place,\" \"middle fishing place,\" and \"fish-plenty of.\" The village of \"fishing place\" was probably between present-day Theodore Roosevelt Island and the Pentagon.<br />From late winter through August, anadromous fish (that live in salt water but spawn in fresh) like herring and sturgeon, swam upriver to the falls. When Smith first observed these three villages it was late June, after the native peoples had planted their crops. Very likely, the villages were seasonal fishing camps and not more-permanent agricultural towns.<br />The top right column features a color drawing of four Native Americans is a canoe. Two men row with long paddles at either end. Two other men stand in the water above while fish swim around them. An image at the bottom of the column shows two fish grilling on a wooded rack above an open fire as two other fish dry on sticks to the right of the grill.<br />Text between these two images reads:<br />In 1584-85, Englishman John White, a member of the Roanoke Colony, drew a series of watercolors depicting the life of the North Carolina Algonquians, who shared a culture similar to that of their linguistic cousins of the Potomac River. The image above depicts Indians fishing from a dugout canoe, including a fish weir for trapping fish (shown in the background).<br />The image below shows how they broiled fish over an open fire.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

To speed delivery of cargo ships needed for the war effort, the Virginia Shipbuilding Corporation hired thousands of workers and ordered tens of thousands of tons of steel. The yard's 7,000 workers and support staff used mass production techniques developed by the auto industry to move materials and speed the assembly of simple, pre-fabricated steel components. The first ship, the SS Gunston Hall, took just over a year to complete. </p> <h3>Calling All Hands</h3> <p>Employees of the shipyard knew they were racing the clock to build the ships needed to win the war. To turn out ships as quickly as possible, the U.S. Emergency Fleet Corporation sought both experienced shipbuilders, and anyone who could use construction tools.</p>",

President George Washington favored a 10-mile square territory along the Potomac River that encompassed the economically important ports of Georgetown and Alexandria. In 1791, the first boundary stone for the federal district- the south cornerstone- was laid with great fanfare right here on Jones Point. The District of Columbia was incorporated ten years later. Alexandria remained within the capital boundaries until an 1846 Act of Congress returned the land west of the Potomac River to Virginia the following year. </p> <h3>The Survey</h3> <p>Major Andrew Ellicott, owner of one of the finest sets of surveying instruments in the country, was put in charge of the D.C. boundary survey and established the first base camp on Jones Point. On-site measurements and round-the-clock astronomical calculations were conducted by Benjamin Banneker, a free black, self-taught in math and astronomy. <br /> <br /> After laying the first cornerstone here at Jones Point, Ellicott's team embarked on a 40-mile journey that took nearly two years. They created the boundary lines of the capital by clearing 20 feet of land on each side, then setting upright stones at each mile interval. Today, 37 of the original 40 stones remain. Look for them in woods, parking lots and even private yards. </p> <h3>L'Enfant's Folly</h3> <p>Although federal buildings were never intended to be constructed in Alexandria, Pierre L'Enfant, designer of the plan of Washington, hoped to extend the axial arrangement of the federal city across the river. His proposal was to erect a picturesque marker on Jones Point to complete the long vista from the White House.</p>",

Because of the constant stream of visitors, Washington referred to his home as \"a well-resorted tavern.\" Ever after Washington died, visitors continued to visit his home, see the grounds, and pay their respects at his tomb.<br /> <br /> Throughout the 19th century, travelers had two ways of getting to Mount Vernon from either Washington, DC or Alexandria. They could travel by boat on the Potomac River or by land on a horse or carriage. Travel by land was long and difficult as the only road that connected the two was further inland on a path that is now approximated by modern day Route One. In 1892 an electric railway opened that connected Mount Vernon to Alexandria and Washington, DC. Finally, in 1932 (the 200th Anniversary of Washington's birth) the George Washington Memorial Parkway opened up connecting the cities to Mount Vernon. The Parkway, a unit of the National Park Service, provided a proper and suitable scenic path to allow patriotic pilgrims to travel to the home of George Washington. <br /> <br /> In 1972, the Mount Vernon Trail was originally created as a small fitness path but has grown to be a major trail for hikers and bikers interested in traveling the length of the Parkway. Today, as many as 1 million people make the pilgrimage to visit Mount Vernon every year. While they many not know it, they are following a path that has been traveled millions of times before by people interested in learning more about and honoring George Washington. ",

The placement of the stone monolith marks the place where LBJ and the First Lady came to relax and enjoy their favorite view of Washington. This park offered an escape and place of peace (both physically and mentally) for the President and his family during his tumultuous years in office. Because LBJ loved this spot, his friends and family chose this place for his memorial after he passed away in 1973.<br /> <br /> Living memorials became more and more popular in the 20th century. Just over a mile north of here, along the George Washington Memorial Parkway, is another presidential living memorial, Theodore Roosevelt Island. This island was turned into a living memorial to President Roosevelt in honor of his conservation activities and love of the outdoors. President Lyndon Johnson was also an active conservationist, so it is fitting that this memorial celebrates his legacy. By providing a place visitors can actively recreate or relax, visitors can enjoy the view as Johnson did during his time in Washington. ",

From the intersection of Boundary Channel Drive and Boundary Access Road, travel north on Boundary Channel Drive ninety feet. Turn right and enter the parking lot.<br />Two benches are set at the mid-point of a sidewalk that sits between parking lots to the north and south. A wood sign behind the two benches and set amongst pine trees and vegetation is inscribed to read:<br />THE<br />LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON<br />MEMORIAL GROVE<br />ON THE POTOMAC<br />Walkways on either side of the sidewalk lead down to a platform along Boundary Channel. The approximately seventy-square foot wooden deck has a three-foot tall railing along the north and south sides and a pedestrian bridge that carries over the river to a heavily wooded island on the other side. The back, west side of the plaza has a seven-foot-high stone wall and set in the center a three by four-foot wood panel. A black sign on the panel reads:<br />Lyndon Baines <br />Johnson Memorial<br />Grove on the Potomac<br />Dedicated on April 6, 1976, as a living<br />Memorial to our thirty-sixth president.<br />National Park Service<br />U.S. Department of the Interior<br />Follow the trail across the footbridge to enter the grove<br />Two waysides sit at the right side of the entrance to the bridge. Similar to the sign along the back wall, the left sign reads:<br />Lyndon Baines <br />Johnson Memorial<br />Grove on the Potomac<br />The right sign is titled at the top:<br />The Boundary Channel<br />The background of the sign is a drawing of the Potomac River flowing along the southern edge of Washington and meeting Eastern Branch along the bottom. An area of Virginia jutting out into the Potomac is labeled \"Alexander's Island.\" Text along the bottom of the sign reads:<br />A surveyor's map from 1794 shows the narrow bog that attached Alexander's Island to the Virginia Shoreline.<br />Text on the left describes a lengthy dispute over the jurisdiction of Columbia Island:<br />England's King Charles I granted the entire Potomac River to Maryland in 1632. Four centuries later Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia were still arguing over their mutual boundary.<br />Alexander's Island was one controversial site. It was known for its \"bogs and swamps and frogs.\" At low tide the island was attached to - and claimed by - Virginia. At high tide the Potomac River encircled it, making it part of the District of Columbia<br />Tensions over Alexander's Island exploded in 1904. A group of enraged men carrying axes and sledgehammers raided the Alexander Island Race Track in an attempt to close it. The District of Columbia did not permit race track betting, while Virginia did.<br />In 1915 the Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the Potomac River. In the process they completely removed the swampy landmass that was Alexander's Island. In its place they created the Boundary Channel, which runs beneath this footbridge, and Columbia Island, which is visible across the channel from you.<br />In 1934 Congress determined that, while Alexander's Island had once definitely been part of Virginia, its destruction shifted the shoreline of the Potomac River. The Boundary Channel became the new official border for Virginia, and the man-made Columbia Island was unquestionably part of Washington, D.C.<br />On the right side of the sign is a map of the Potomac River along the southern point of Washington, Boundary Channel, Columbia Island and an area across the river in Virginia labeled \"Arlington Canyonment.\" Text below reads:<br />The Boundary Channel and Columbia Island on a World War II map.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Continuing north about one mile along the Mount Vernon Trail will take you to the Navy and Marine Memorial, on the right side of the trail and set along the Potomac River.<br />The aluminum sculpture shows six seagulls flying above the crest of a wave, in a line roughly forming at the top left of the wave and extending to the opposite side. The highest gull floats thirty-five feet above ground and the monument measures thirty feet wide. A seventh gull flaps in front of the breaking wave, almost blending into the rolling curves that dominate the center of the sculpture.<br />An inscription on an escutcheon set under a cresting wave at the south side of the sculpture reads:<br />TO STRONG SOULS AND READY VALOR OF THOSE MEN OF THE UNITED STATES WHO IN THE NAVY THE MERCHANT MARINE AND OTHER PATHS OF ACTIVITY UPON THE WATERS OF THE WORLD HAVE GIVEN LIFE OR STILL OFFER IT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HEROIC DEEDS. THIS MONUMENT IS DEDICATED BY A GRATEFUL PEOPLE.<br />Two reliefs are set on the back corners of the memorial sculpture. One features a sailing ship above a lighthouse. The other is of an eagle with its talons on an anchor set behind it and a tall ship in the background. Stairs at both back corners lead down past a flowerbed that rings the memorial to a brick path perimeter. Set along the east side is a blue two by two-foot wayside titled: <br />Navy and Marine Memorial<br />Dedicated to Americans Lost at Sea<br />Text below reads:<br />In war and in peace, in commerce and in travel, in rescue and in discovery, in fisheries and in research, this nation has forged a bond with and a dependence on the sea. This monument of waves and gulls memorializes our national life at sea. It is dedicated to the thousands of Americans who have perished in the sea and to those whose destiny still is linked with our naval and maritime services. The reliefs on the sides of the pedestal of the memorial illustrate, by direct of symbolic representation, all these activities.<br />Plaque presented by the United States Coast Guard in 1990 on the occasion of its Bicentennial.<br />The memorial sits about two hundred feet west of the edge of the Potomac River and features a view of the Washington Monument across the river.

    "audioDescription": "(840 words)The Netherlands Carillon is located south of the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial and north of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.From the intersection of 14th Street North and North Meade Street, travel east into the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial grounds and follow the pedestrian path south about seven hundred fifty feet.The Netherlands Carillon sits on a hill approximately one hundred feet above the Potomac River, and offers a scenic view of the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, Post Office Tower and United States Capitol. The structure is an open steel tower reinforced by steel plates. It stands approximately one hundred twenty-seven feet high, twenty-five feet deep, and thirty-six feet wide. Three rows of bells hang from a top section of the tower. It sits on a quartzite plaza ninety-three feet square and enclosed by a one-foot high, three-foot wide lava stone wall. An engraving on the front base of the structure reads:FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE NETHERLANDS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICATwo bronze lions guard the plaza front steps. A rectangular staircase leads to an observatory platform from which a small circular staircase winds up to the glass-enclosed playing cabin eighty-three feet above the ground. Planted on the surrounding grounds to the east are thousands of tulip bulbs and other flowers grouped in beds. A grove of trees lines the back area to the west.An engraving on the right back of the structure reads:CONSTRUCTED BY PETIT & FRITSEN AARLE-RIXTELTHE NETHERLANDSAn engraving on the inside panel of the back wall reads:BELLS FOUNDED BY H.T.& A.H. VAN BERGENB. EIJSBOUTSPETIT 7 FRITSENTHE NETHERLANDSA brown sign on the left side of the tower's stairwell reads in white letters:CARILLONNEUR OF THE DAYFifty feet northeast of the tower are two three by four-foot waysides. The left sign, titled: \"Modern Liberation,\" features an overhead photograph of the tower along the left side. A circular pattern of colorful flowerbeds set in front of the tower is displayed in the center of the sign. Text across the tower reads:From the People of the Netherlands to the People of the United StatesAlong the right is an image of a lion statue taken from behind as it faces east towards the Lincoln Memorial. Text above details the dedication of the Netherlands Carillon:The Netherlands Carillon was dedicated on May 5, 1960, on the 15th anniversary of the Netherlands' liberation from Nazi Germany. In gratitude for American aid received during and after World War II, the Dutch people rallied to support the memorial proposed by the Dutch government. This democratic cooperation reflected our two nations' solidarity behind democratic principles, especially as the Cold War grew in intensity.Dutch architect Joost W.C. Boks designed the 127 foot tower on contrast to older European architecture that some considered to be fascist. The tower's abstract design, with its Piet Mondrian-like rectangular shapes, raised some eyebrows because it was the first modernist steel memorial associated with the otherwise classical stone architecture on the National Mall. Today the Netherlands Carillon-in view of the Capitol, Washington Monument, and Lincoln Memorial - stands as an exclamation point on the symbolic lines of Washington, D.C.The right sign is titled: \"Harmony of Friendship.\" On the right side is a closeup image of a curved piece of steel engraved with figures and symbols along the top, a Dutch message across the middle, and designs of lions, shields, and V-shapes crossed with vines and berries. Below, a man sits at a wooden structure with a series of levers. Text beneath reads:Edward M. Nassor, volunteer carillon director, plays the bells with his hands on the clavier â€˜batons' and feet on the pedals.On the right is a black and white image of a seated woman in fur coat waving next to a smiling man in rimmed glasses. Text below reads:In 1952, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands presented a silver bell to President Truman as a promise of the carillon.Text on the left describes the gift of the carillon from Queen Juliana:With the gift of a carillon Queen Juliana of the Netherlands presented something truly Dutch to the American people. The fifty bells are inscribed with a verse from a poem and an emblem representing each of the Dutch provinces and different aspects of Dutch society. Describing the gift, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands said,So many voices in our troubled world are still unheard. Let that be an incentive for all of us when we hear the bells ringing.The Dutch royal family guard the Carillon bells in the form of two bronze lions made by Dutch sculptor Paul Philip Koning. The flower beds shaped like musical notes took root with 10,000 tulips donated by the people of the Netherlands in support of Lady Bird Johnson's beautification efforts in 1964.Text at the bottom of the sign reads:For concert schedules and more details on the Netherlands",

    "audioDescription": "(543 words)<br />The Theodore Roosevelt Memorial is located on the north end of Theodore Roosevelt Island, an eighty-eight-acre natural area on the Potomac River between Virginia and Washington, D.C.<br />Travel north on George Washington Memorial Parkway about one-third of a mile from the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge. Turn right to enter the parking lot and follow it to the south about eight hundred feet. <br />At the south end of the parking lot a pedestrian bridge leads left about three hundred feet over the Potomac River. At the end of the bridge turn right and proceed about two hundred feet along a gravel trail. Stay left at the fork and continue another two hundred feet, staying left again at a second fork in the gravel trail. Set at the north end of an open clearing in the forest is the seventeen-foot high bronze statue of Roosevelt.<br />The Roosevelt statue stands with his right hands raised high above his head, and his left hand is extended slightly forward with his palm open. He wears a vest and long coat, mustache and rimmed glasses.<br />A thirty-foot granite monolith stands behind the statue, and four twenty-one-foot-tall slabs inscribed with quotes line the plaza area behind him.<br />Inscribed at the front base of the bronze statue is:<br />THEODORE ROOSEVELT<br />1858 and 1919 are inscribed in the top corners, separated by flower medallions, which also bracket Roosevelt below.<br />A brick and granite plaza one hundred thirty feet long, one hundred ten feet wide leads up to the statue from the entrance at the south end. Benches are set along either side. The plaza is flanked by two circular pools set with fountains in bowls. The bowls are each supported by four spheres engraved with an eagle with spread wings holding olive branches and arrows and a shield across its chest. <br />A water-filled moat surrounds the entire memorial. Two cobblestone lined arched bridges carry over the moat at either side of the Roosevelt statue at its north end. Four areas set with manicured bushes sit in the corners of the plaza.<br />Lush forest surrounds the entire area and a two by three-foot wayside stands at the right side of the memorial entrance. Titled Making the Memorial, it features a picture of Roosevelt speaking to a crowd from a platform, and a background image of the construction of the memorial. Text above reads:<br />Construction on the memorial progressed from 1964 to 1967. The 18-foot-high-bronze state sculpted by Paul Manship shows President Roosevelt with one arm raised in his familiar pose.<br />Text on the left side describes the development of the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial:<br />In 1931 the Roosevelt Memorial Association purchased this island to create a living tribute to the former president. Congress designated funds for the project in 1960, and architectural designs were approved in 1961. President Lyndon B. Johnson dedicated the memorial on Roosevelt's birthday in October 1967. <br />Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Plaza features the only monument in Washington, DC, dedicated to the 26th president of the United States. Flanked by four 20-foot-high monoliths inscribed with quotations from Roosevelt, the oversized centerpiece captures the larger-than-life spirit of the conservationist leader.<br />\"It is true of the Nation, as of the individual, that the greatest doer must also be a great dreamer.\"<br />- Theodore Roosevelt, 1905<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

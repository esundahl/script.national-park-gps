Often, emigrants would spend several days here, waiting for the swollen waters of the river to drop to levels that were safe for fording. They found the area picturesque, with the spring originating in an unusual rock formation and falling over a rock ledge into a pool below.<br /> <br /> Emigrants carved their names in the rocks surrounding the spring, and many of these carvings are still visible. The ill-fated Donner Party camped here in 1846 and gave the spring its name. It was also the location of the Donner Party's first recorded death, Sarah H. Keyes, who died from consumption.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>Edwin Bryant, traveling with the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party, wrote a detailed description of the spring on May 27, 1846:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We found a large spring of water, as cold and pure as if it had just been melted from ice. It gushed from a ledge of rocks, which composes the bank of the stream, and falling some ten feet, its waters are received into a basin. . . . A shelving rock projects over this basin, from which falls a beautiful cascade of water, some ten or twelve feet. The whole is buried in a variety of shrubbery of the richest verdure. . . . Altogether it is one of the most romantic spots I ever saw. . . . We named this the 'Alcove Spring' and future travelers will find the name graven on the rocks, and on the trunks of the trees surrounding it.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(6 miles South of Marysville on the East River Road)</p> <p>Today, the spring is part of a 300 acre park. To reach it, follow the quarter mile, easy trail that starts at the parking lot. The park also contains several other hiking trails. </p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.visitmarysvilleks.org/attraction/alcove-spring/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/alcove-spring-exhibits-audio-description.htm\">Exhibit Audio Description available</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Alcove Spring. 367 words<br /><br />As you enter this gravel parking area from the road, a brown sign to the left reads, \"Alcove Spring Park, Independence Crossing, Oregon and California National Historic Trails.\" On the right side of the parking area is a lean-to structure with stone foundations and wood-shingle siding. Past the lean-to, a foot trail leads down the wooded slope. A sign tells us the path leads to Alcove Spring. To the left of the path a stone marker reads, \"Oregon Trail Memorial Garden dedicated to Gregory M. Franzwa, 1926 to 2009. Friend of Alcove Spring.\"<br /><br />Inside the lean-to are several informational panels, a map of the area showing the various hiking trails, a register for guests to sign and a donation box. One sign tells us, \"Alcove Spring Park consists of more than 200 acres of native prairie and timber land maintained for the preservation of this historic camping ground on the Oregon-California trail and for the enjoyment of our visitors. The park is owned and maintained by the Alcove Spring Preservation Society. Visitors are encouraged to take the short walk up to Alcove Spring and Naomi Pike Falls, and to follow the walking trails across the rest of the park area.\"<br /><br />Another sign discusses well-known travelers believed to have camped here, including the Bidwell-Bartelson party, the missionaries Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, John Charles Fremont and Kit Carson, and the Donner-Reed party.<br /><br />Another sign tells us that this area was part of the tall-grass prairie with Big Bluestem, Indiangrass and Switchgrass which grow up to 7 feet tall. Also, the Alcove Spring property was privately owned until 1993 when it was purchased by the Alcove Spring Historical Trust. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and a certified Historic Site on the Oregon National Historic Trail.<br /><br />Another sign discusses the hiking trails and tells us that across the road is a marker to honor Sarah Keynes, who died here. Just past the marker in the meadow are wagon swales. A few hundred south of the parking lot and across the road is an overlook of a field where a faint trace of the old river channel of the Big Blue River is visible.",

    "audioDescription": "Alcove Spring Swales. 337 words<br /><br />On the other side of the road from the parking lot at Alcove Spring, a path leads through an opening in a split rail fence and veers slightly to the right across a grassy area dotted with trees. The path crosses several noticeable swales then up a short bank with irregular stone steps. At the top of the slope is a large stone marked placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution to honor Sarah Handley Keyes who died at this campground.<br /><br />The path leads past the marker to a stone bench and two wayside signs. A few yards to the left of the signs are two more, clearly visible swales, going down the slope to the left to be lost to sight in the trees. A small brown sign in between the swales reads, \"National Historic Trails, Original Route.\" Arrows pointing to the left read, \"Oregon City, Oregon, 1853 and Sacramento, California, 1821 miles.\" An arrow pointing to the right reads, \"Independence Missouri, 179 miles.\" In that direction, up the slope is a grassy meadow.<br /><br />The left-hand wayside is titled \"The 1840s American Dream.\" It tells us that 100 members of the Donner and Reed wagon train waited here for several days for the heavily flooded Big Blue River to subside. While they camped, Sarah Keyes, James Reed's mother-in-law, whose health had been failing, died on May 29, 1846. She was buried and a large gray stone fashioned into a tombstone.<br /><br />The other wayside sign is titled \"A Quiet and Restful Place.\" It tells us that many wagon trains left Missouri in mid-April to mid-May in order to cross the high western mountains before snow arrived. This meant dealing with rivers and streams flooded from heavy spring thunderstorms. Nearly a hundred emigrant wagons crowded this meadow for several days in May 1846 waiting to ford. Emigrants found Alcove Spring a place with good drinking water, timber for building fires, forage for livestock and wild game to subsidize their food supply.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Situated on the border between Missouri and Kansas, the Alexander Majors house was home to both the Majors family and one of his freighting companies called Russell, Majors, and Waddell.<a href=\"#1\">[1]</a> The company was a venture with merchants William H. Russell and William B. Waddell who joined Majors in an attempt to gain a government contract to supply western forts.<a href=\"#2\">[2]</a> Already an experienced Santa Fe Trail dealer, Majors had the knowledge and equipment, while Russell and Waddell had the capital, to secure the government contract. For a short time, the company had a “virtual monopoly of the army freighting business in the west and southwest.”<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a> <br /> <br /> The 300-acre farmstead was dissected by the westernmost US border, making part of the property outside US jurisdiction and, thus, untaxable. The company’s barns, mule sheds, grazing lands, wagon and blacksmith shops, and other business-related entities were located on the portion of property located in the Kansas Territory.<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a> A caravan camp was used to load the heavy freight wagons which would travel the trails.<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a> <br /> <br /> The home was built in 1856, most likely using the labor of enslaved people.<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>  The “T” shaped floorplan with recessed front porch makes it a unique iteration of the Greek revival style in Kansas City.<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>  Today, it is one of the oldest buildings in Kansas City, as one of only 4 pre-Civil War buildings left standing.<a href=\"#8\">[8]</a> Though the house remains, many of the other original structures are gone and the land has been divided into distinct plots. Among the lost structures were living quarters for the 16-17 people enslaved by the Majors’.<a href=\"#9\">[9] </a><br /> <br /> In 1930 Louisa P. Johnston, Majors’s great grand-daughter, travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the house abandoned. She bought the house in 1932 and, for the next forty years, worked to preserve the property. In 1984 the Alexanders Majors House Museum was opened to the public for tours and events. In 2010 the house partnered with the John Wornall House and Museum to create one nonprofit dedicated to preserving both properties.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(8201 State Line Road (east side of road near 85th Street), Kansas City)<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.wornallmajors.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <br /> <br />   <div> <p id=\"ftn1\"><em><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Marc Simmons, Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers (Santa Fe, NM: Ancient City Press, 1984), p. 61.</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Martha Kusiak, “Alexander Majors House,” National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form.

From here you can look out over the surrounding rolling terrain. The countryside is covered primarily with low vegetation - grasses and meadow plants. Dark green conifers are scattered across the landscape with an occasional grove of deciduous trees.<br /><br />A median sits in the middle of the parking lot with a Nebraska Historical Marker. The sign reads, \"Ash Hollow was famous on the Oregon Trail. A branch of the trail ran northwestward from the Lower California Crossing of the South Platte River a few miles west of Brule and descended here into the North Platte Valley. The hollow, named for a growth of ash trees, was entered by Windlass Hill to the south. Wagons had to eased down its steep slope by ropes.<br /><br />\"Ash Hollow with its water, wood and grass was a welcome relief after the arduous trip from the South Platte and the travelers usually stopped for a period of rest and refitting. An abandoned trappers cabin served as an unofficial post office where letters were deposited to be carried to the â€˜States' by eastbound travelers. The graves of Rachel Pattison and other emigrants are in the nearby cemetery.<br /><br />\"In 1855 a significant fight, commonly called the Battle of Ash Hollow, occurred at Blue Water Creek northwest of here. General Harney's forces sent out to chastise the Indians after the Grattan Massacre of 1854 here attacked Little Thunder's band of Brule Sioux while the Indians were attempting to parley, killed a large number and captured the rest of the band.\"<br /><br />The visitor center is a one-story building set lower than the level of the parking lot. The sidewalk slopes down to the door. The building has vertical, beige-colored siding with tan accents. Restrooms are located along the outside wall to the right of the entrance.",

    "audioDescription": "Ash Hollow State Park- Windlass Hill Area. 400 words<br /><br />Where the entrance road to Windlass Hill turns off the highway is a turnout with access to a reconstructed sod house. From the road, a pass through the fence leads across a small pasture and through a gate shaped like a wheel to the house itself. The house, although open to visitors, is deteriorating and there is loose debris on the floor. To the left of the house is a Nebraska Historical Marker in the middle of a group of large, roughly shaped stones. The sign tells us that the stones are the remains of the homestead dwelling of Reverend Dennis B. Clary. Using a horse-drawn cart, he hauled stone to this site for a two-room house. For years, it marked the location of Windlass Hill. The area around the house was used by early travelers to repair damages caused by the hazardous trip down Windlass Hill.<br /><br />From the parking lot a sidewalk leads around to the left along the base of the hill through tall bushy junipers. Standing where it curves to the left, several rutted trails can easily be seen coming down the hill to the west. From that point, just behind you another sidewalk leads to a stylized wagon made of two parallel stone walls topped with metal arches. There may be a lip at the top of the concrete ramp leading up into the structure. On one side are two large information signs. The one on the left is titled \"Rough Going.\" It tells us that many stories are built around the idea that wagons were let down this hill using a windlass or, perhaps, a snubbing post. No historical or archeological evidence has been found for the use of such a device. At the lower left corner of this sign is a model of a rough-lock wagon brake. Feel free to touch. By hooking this through the spokes, it slowed the wagon by making the wheels drag on the ground.<br /><br />The other sign is called \"Wagons in the West.\" It has line drawings of several wagon styles. The Conestoga was a heavy freight wagon, not much used on the Oregon Trail. Another style was the six-mule Army wagon. Another drawing shows a smaller covered wagon pulled by a team of 6 oxen commonly used by the emigrants. The wagons all have similar shapes.",

Cave Spring, on the National Register of Historic Places, was a noted midday rest area for travelers heading west. Imagine that much of the Jackson County countryside, even in the early trail days, was owned by private landowners who had substantial estates. <br /> <br /> At least two 1846 first-hand accounts mention the Barnes Enclosure-Cave Spring. Susan Shelby Magoffin, one of the first women to travel along the Santa Fe Trail to Mexico, wrote in her diary of “traveling with her husband, Captain Magoffin, a trader, and spending the night in the Barnes home. Also, in a letter to his sister, William Glasgow, a Santa Fe trader, stayed overnight with the Barnes in 1846. A few days later a Susan Magoffin and her maid also stayed overnight with the Barnes Family. Magoffin’s diary also mentions meeting these brothers on the trail.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(8701 E Gregory Blvd., Kansas City, MO)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://cavespring.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "audioDescription": "Bedlam Ruts. 363 words<br /><br />From the parking lot, a path leads up a slight slope through scrubby pastureland. The path is fairly smooth, although it is dirt with fine gravel mixed in. Along with mixed grasses and yucca plants, there are tiny prickly pear cacti with flat, rounded pads covered with spines. The path ends at the top of the rise where a small fenced enclosure protects a small sign. Large logs on either side of the path here serve as benches. On the far side of the fenced enclosure, a swale crosses from right to left, about 10 feet wide and perhaps 3 feet deep. Feel free to move past the fence on the left side and into the swale.<br /><br />The sign is titled, \"The Journey West Continues.\" Text reads, \"'We proceeded westward from Fort Laramie and encamped outside the boundaries of Uncle Sam.' So wrote Dr. J.S. Shepard in 1851 as he began the second leg of his journey west. â€˜To leave Fort Laramie was to cast off all ties with civilization. It was an alien land,' he noted.<br /><br />\"The emigrants' elation at reaching the civilization of the fort after 650 miles of monotonous, difficult overland travel was soon tempered by the realization that even more troublesome trail conditions lay ahead over the final two-thirds of the journey. â€˜Here comes the ascent to the Rocky Mountains,' wrote an apprehensive Cornelius Conway at mid-century.<br /><br />\"To lighten their loads many travelers cast off thousands of dollars worth of food and equipment. This was especially true of the â€˜49ers' who, in their haste to reach the gold fields often invested little effort in planning their trip. Joseph Berrien reached Fort Laramie early, May 30, 1849, yet still referred to it as â€˜Camp Sacrifice' because of the large quantities of abandoned gear and foodstuffs he saw nearby.<br /><br />\"Between 1849 and 1854 an annual average of some 31,000 overlanders passed through or near the fort on their journey to Oregon, California, or Utah. Most passed on a trail marked by the ruts before you. Wagon travel near the Platte River, just to the north, was difficult due to seasonal high water and progressively more difficult terrain.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>It is likely that the first European Americans to encounter the Black Rock were the Bryant Russell party in 1846, the first travelers of the infamous Hastings Cutoff. While they do not specifically mention the Black Rock itself, they do describe crystalline springs just to the east, and the natural landscape would have forced them to travel within a few hundred yards of the geologic feature on their way westward (Madsen/Fuller 1983: 87).<br /> <br /> It is more noteworthy however, that the English name of “Black Rock” has two points of origin, but both are connected to prominent patterns of American Western history. According to James F. Reed in 1871, the ill-fated Donner Party named “Black Rock” as they passed that location during their journey along the Hastings Cutoff in August of 1846. From the Pacific Rural Press (1871:188), Reed notes “We then followed [Hasting’s] road around the Lake without incident worthy of notice until reaching a swampy section of the country west of Black Rock, the name we gave it. Here we lost a few days on the score of humanity.” </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(13698 W Ieightywest Fwy, Salt Lake City, UT 84116. 1.4 miles southwest of the Great Salt Lake State Park Visitor Center (40.7254 N, -112.2276 W))<br /> <br /> <strong>Amenities </strong>include a designated parking area and gravel walking path.

    "audioDescription": "The Black Rock Site consists of a monolithic geological feature rising from the shores of Great Salt Lake, and the remains of concrete foundations from the historic “Black Rock Resort”. Today, however, Great Salt Lake has receded so far that the rock is no longer under any water. Walking past the gate to Black Rock from the parking area is along a gravel access road and is about 1/4 mile flat path that is along the Great Salt Lake Shoreline. Black Rock itself is on a small spit of land that extends into Great Salt Lake, and is surrounded by tall reed plants along the shore. Salt flats, with a strong scent of the ocean, surround the Black Rock on three sites. From the rock itself, which is over 20' tall, you can see four of Great Salt Lake's islands to the west, north, and east, with the brown and rocky Oquirrh (ochre) mountains rising to the south. Interstate 80 and an active railroad line are between the Black Rock and the Mountains. Shorebirds by the thousands play and eat in the salt flats and marshes around the Black Rock. Black Rock itself is about 20' tall, and over 100' long and just rises from the flat ground. It is not really black, but more of a mottled gray limestone that is very craggy.",

The salt flats are about 12 miles long and 5 miles wide with total area coverage of just over 46 square miles.<br /> <br /> <strong>From the BLM: </strong>Trapper and frontiersman Jedediah Smith crossed the Salt Flats while returning to Utah from an expedition to California in 1827. John C. Fremont and his U.S. government-sponsored expedition crossed the heart of the Salt Flats in 1845 while trying to find a shorter overland route to the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <br /> The next year Fremont’s route across the Salt Flats would become known as the Hastings Cutoff as part of the California Trail. Promoted by Lansford Hastings as a faster, easier route to California, Hastings Cutoff proved to be just the opposite for the Donner- Reed Party of 1846. What contributed to the party’s infamous winter survival in the Sierra Mountains was the delay the emigrants<br /> experienced while crossing the Salt Flats. Their wagons became mired in mud just below the thin salt crust. Artifacts from the Donner-Reed Party, and other<br /> emigrants that crossed the trail, are on display in the Donner-Reed Museum.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Interstate 80, mile 4, Utah)</p> <p>Motor vehicle use is limited by seasonal closure during the spring when the salt is moist or has standing water on the surface.

    "bodyText": "<p>Before Broad Hollow, wagons followed Dixie Hollow, the ravine to the right side of today’s paved road. The hollow bristled with brush and its boulder-choked bottom was too narrow for wagons to pass. The Donner-Reed wagon party grubbed a dangerous sideling trail along the sloping bank before dropping, exhausted, into their first camp beyond the Weber River. Mormon pioneers improved the rough track, but despite their efforts, many wagons over the years tumbled sideways off the trail. Dixie Hollow narrows and becomes impassable to wagons.<br /> <br /> Broad Hollow, which drains into Dixie Hollow near the Donner-Reed campsite of August 11, provided a detour around the Dixie Hollow chokepoint. The pioneers veered northwest up Broad Hollow, turned west across a wide bench, and then dropped south again to East Canyon Creek and through today’s East Canyon State Park.<br /> <br /> A monument marks the location where pioneers turned west. Some researchers think the two-track to the right of the monument may be the original trail alignment, but it might be a more recent ranch road. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Southwest of Henefer, Utah)</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Burnt Ranch, known historically as South Pass Station and Last or Ninth Crossing of the Sweetwater River, is located at the center of the South Pass landscape of Wyoming on the shared corridor of the Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historic Trails. The Lander Cutoff, a government wagon road explored and developed in 1857-1860 by topographical engineer Frederick W. Lander, diverged from the primary route of the California Trail at present-day Burnt Ranch, following older paths used by American Indians and trappers of the fur trade. Western historian Will Bagley estimates that more than 100,000 overland emigrants crossed this region by way of the Lander Cutoff. The graves of two known overland emigrants (Joseph Barnett, d. 1844, and Charles H. Miller, d. 1859) and as many as six unidentified burials of the trails era are located on the ranch. Many more emigrant graves are believed to exist at and around the site.<br /> <br /> During the 1800s, this location was the site of extensive Shoshone Indian villages; trading post, stagecoach, mail, and telegraph operations; a military outpost; emigrant and military encampments; and armed conflicts between the US Army and the Sioux and Cheyenne. In fact, Burnt Ranch takes its name from the burning of a stage station at Ninth Crossing during the Utah War in 1857, and by Sioux warriors in 1866 and 1868. It has been the headquarters of cattle ranching operations since the 1880s and remains so today.<br /> <br /> Trail remnants and historical remains of the developments and activities at Burnt Ranch have been determined to be nationally significant and eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Located approximately 8 miles SE South Pass City, Wyoming)<br /> <strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> No cell service.  Poor roads.  Prior Planning with an organized group is a must.<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "audioDescription": "California Hill. 304 words<br /><br />Along the side of the road is a Nebraska Historical Marker metal sign. It reads, \"California Hill. The large hill to the north, which became known as 'California Hill,' was climbed by thousands of covered wagon emigrants heading west between 1841 and 1860. Many were bound for Oregon. California became the destination of a majority of travelers after gold was discovered there in 1848.<br /><br />\"The most important crossing of the South Platte River during this period was south and a little east of here. After fording the river and ascending California Hill, the emigrants traveled northwesterly to the North Platte River via Ash Hollow. The terrain restricted the route wagons could take up the hill, causing deep ruts still visible about two-thirds of a mile north-northwest of this marker.<br /><br />\"Before 1867 as many as half a million emigrants passed through what became Keith County. The natural migration corridor from Fort Kearny to Fort Laramie became known as 'The Great Platte River Road.' California Hill was donated to the Oregon-California Trails Association by Malcolm E. Smith, Jr., in memory of trail historian Irene D. Paden, and by the association to the Nebraska State Historical Society.\"<br /><br />Just past the marker a narrow dirt road leads to the right up a hill, pastures spreading on the rolling hills as far as the eye can see. The road is marked as \"Minimum Maintenance\" and may be too rough for most cars. Hiking up the road, it is possible to see gentle troughs leading up along the right side. Up near the top of the hill, a fence walk-through on the left side with attached logos for the Oregon Trail and the California Trail leads into the pasture. Please note, livestock and equipment may be present. Swales in the pasture are very difficult to discern.",

    "bodyText": "<p>During the 1820s and 1830s, California was a province of Mexico, largely ignored by Americans, and virtually all travel to and from the province was by sea. In May 1841, however, the first group of emigrants, the Bidwell-Bartleson party, met near Independence, Missouri and blazed their way west. At Fort Hall, in present-day Idaho, about half of the party opted to take the Oregon Trail, but the rest vowed to reach California. They abandoned their wagons in eastern Nevada. On horseback and on foot, the party staggered across the Fortymile Desert and entered California via the Walker River. Starving and nearly naked, they finally reached the Central Valley in November. Three years later, the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy party followed suit; they also crossed Nevada along the Humboldt River to the Fortymile Desert but decided to ascend the Truckee River. Eventually they ascended the Sierras via Emigrant Gap and stumbled down to Sutter’s Fort. Soon afterward, in 1846, came the infamous <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/learn/historyculture/donner-reed-party.htm\">Donner-Reed party</a>, which crossed western Nevada on route similar to the one traveled by the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy party. The Sierra snows, however, forced the party to halt near present-day Truckee, California where they endured several months of suffering, starvation, death, and some cannibalism until rescuers could reach the survivors.</p> <p>Throughout this period, only a trickle of emigrants made their way to California by going overland. The January 1848 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/learn/historyculture/california-gold-rush.htm\">discovery of gold</a>, however, turned all eyes toward California. Soon afterward, tens of thousands of “Forty-Niners” and other emigrants rushed hastily toward the gold fields, many of them over Carson Pass. (Thousands of others, meanwhile, headed there by sailing either around Cape Horn or by taking a ship to Panama, negotiating a trail across the narrow isthmus, and waiting for a Pacific coast sailing ship heading north.) At the same time, California was making abrupt political changes. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed in February 1848, brought California under U.S. control, and in 1850, Congress made it the 31st state as part of the Compromise of 1850. Westbound traffic over the California Trail was heavy for the next several years, gradually shifting over to the Donner Pass route; meanwhile, other routes to California – over the Lassen, Nobles, and Beckwourth trails along with the Walker River-Sonora Route – opened up. After 1852, traffic over the California trail subsided, and the number of people heading east often equaled the ones going west, with many of those going to Oregon instead. Various California Trail routes remained active, however until the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869.</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2>Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

Two wings stair-step off the right side and a longer, flatter wing extends to the left. The entrance is reached by moving under an open wooden-truss supported by six sandstone pillars, three on each side. A small sign at the edge of the sidewalk warns of rattlesnakes in the area. Please stay on sidewalks.<br /><br />Entering through the double doors you will be in an open hallway that extends to the rear of the building where another set of doors exits to a patio with seating. The information desk is about halfway down the 40-foot hallway on your left. The gift shop may be found by turning to the left just before you reach the desk. An exhibit area is found on the right side of the hallway.<br /><br />Chimney Rock itself is behind on the far side of fenced pasture land where cattle may be grazing. Towering over the surrounding landscape, it may be easily seen both from the parking lot and from the patio behind the visitor center. The formation is shaped like a large cone, wide at its base, and topped with a narrow finger of rock projecting upwards like a steeple.",

    "audioDescription": "Courthouse and Jail Rocks. 273 words<br /><br />Although called \"rocks,\" these are two striking landmarks, visible at great distances. At the edge of the gravel pullout is a Nebraska Historical Marker that reads, \"Courthouse and Jail Rocks are two of the most famous landmarks of westward migration. Nearby passed the Oregon-California Trail, the Mormon Trail, the Pony Express Trail, and the Sidney-Deadwood Trail. The rocks were vanguards of unforgettable scenic wonders that travelers would encounter farther west, including Chimney Rock's curious spire and the rugged heights of Scott's Bluffs.<br /><br />\"Hundreds of overland emigrants mentioned Courthouse Rock in their diaries. Often called a 'castle' or 'solitary tower,' the name Courthouse was first used in 1837. One 1845 traveler described the rock as â€˜resembling the ruins of an old castle [which] rises abruptly from the plain... It is difficult to look upon it and not believe that art had something to do with its construction. The voyagers have called it the Courthouse; but it looks infinitely more like the Capitol.'<br /><br />\"Courthouse and Jail Rocks, rising some 400 feet above the North Platte Valley, are erosional remnants composed of clay, sandstone, and volcanic ash. The rocks are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and in the Nebraska Natural Areas Register.\"<br /><br />Looking westward, past the sign, the two formations can be seen rising out of the surrounding pasture land. Courthouse Rock, on the right, is larger, looming over the prairie like a squat cylinder with a smaller circular layer sitting on top. Jail Rock, on the left, is the same height but only about one-third as wide. It is also cylindrical, but has more sloping sides.",

For the Mormon militia, this seemed a strategic location to stop or delay approaching federal troops. Defensive Breastworks (Echo Canyon) positioned along the rim of the cliff to the right are barely visible in several places from the canyon floor. Mormon militiamen, fearing an attack on Salt Lake City by the U.S. Army, built the low rubble walls above the emigrant road in 1857. The breastworks would protect the defenders as they fired down on approaching federal troops. Because they are made of local sandstone from the cliffs and were meant to be unobtrusive, the structures can be difficult to see.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Echo Canyon, Utah)</p> <p>Pull into a turnout on the right side of the road to view a large wooden sign that describes the Mormon defense preparations in Echo Canyon. Continue to the next turnout, 1/4 mile beyond, and pause at Summit County’s brown tour sign No. 7 for Billboard Bluff. From the turnout, look up at the base of the cliff face to see 19th century roadside advertisements painted directly onto the rock. (These are unassociated with the Utah War.)<br /> <br /> Travel 1/10 mile, watching for brown Summit County tour sign No. 6 on the left. From the tour-stop sign, face the cliff to the right of the road and look along the rim to see a low stone wall. Then turn and look east across the freeway to the bluffs on the opposite side of the canyon. Just below the alignment of telephone poles that crosses the slope, a faint horizontal line in the earth is sometimes visible, depending on the quality of the light and vegetation. The line is what remains of a defensive trench dug by the Mormon militia. Approaching federal troops were to be caught in crossfire from between the cliff-top breastworks and the entrenchment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

On your right a granite ridge extends across the view. Near the right end a deep, broken-V-shaped notch can be seen, slightly wider than it is deep. The left side of the notch slants steeply toward the unseen river below. The right side of the notch descends vertically about halfway through the ridge, then slopes to the left. Text on a wayside sign tells us that the notch is called Devil's Gate, a 370-foot high, 1,500 feet-long fissure carved over the centuries by the Sweetwater River.<br /><br />To the right of the notch, the granite slopes down gradually to a pass where a small road winds its way.<br /><br />A half dozen wayside signs are spaced along the paved walkway. They cover topics such as the trails that passed this way, and local landmarks such as Martin's Cove, where Mormon emigrants sheltered from a winter storm, and Sun Ranch. One sign, titled \"A Tribute to Hardship,\" discusses the deaths along the trail, many caused by cholera. It mentions that up on this ridge, safe from the wagon trails below, are over 20 known American Indian and emigrant graves.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Donner HIll hammered yet another nail into the Donner-Reed coffin. For 12 days the emigrants had gnawed a track through the rugged Wasatch wilderness, and now, at the very edge of the Salt Lake Valley, limestone outcrops and dense willows blocked their exit from the mouth of Emigration Canyon. The discouraged travelers pulled to the left out of the creek bottom and up the 200-foot-high ridge that thereafter would bear their name. The effort nearly used up the strength of their oxen. The next year Brigham Young’s vanguard pioneer party, having more men for the labor, opened a road through the blockage, avoiding the hill climb, in just 4 hours’ time. The current roadbed approximates their route.<br /> <br /> Today, Emigration Canyon is widened and the top of Donner Hill has been leveled to make room for residential development. But the hill is still impressive and Emigration Creek, edged by willow and scrub oak, still runs along the south side of Emigration Canyon Road. Visitors can easily envision how this spot looked in 1846-47.<br /> <br /> The evening of their arrival on July 22, the Donner-Reed Party encamped a short distance beyond the hilltop with the broad Salt Lake Valley stretched at their feet. A grassy park along the ridge, adjacent to Crestview Drive, is named Donner Park in commemoration of that campsite. The next day the emigrants descended the ridge and traveled across the valley to the Jordan River. From there, the Donner Reed Party continued along the south shore of the Great Salt Lake.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Emigration Canyon, near Rotary Glen Park)</p> <p>On the right at odometer mile 20 is another small sign for Donner Hill. A stone monument commemorating Donner Hill is on the left where the road curves to the south. At that location the hill is in front of you, easy to see, with a condominium at the top. Use caution when crossing the oncoming lane to enter or leave the widened road shoulder at the monument. Then continue down Emigration Canyon Road around the S-curve. If traffic permits, turn left at odometer mile 20.6 into an unmarked entrance for Rotary Glen Park. If you miss the entrance, turn left onto the next paved road, Crestview Drive, and turn around at a safe location to return to the intersection. Turn right and make an immediate right turn into Rotary Glen Park. Now go left across the parking lot and follow the dirt access road to the east. End at a gravel parking lot.<br /> <br /> Look across the small reservoir toward Donner Hill, the ridge to the northeast. The emigrants ascended the ridge on the north side of the condominiums. From this vantage, the steepness of the climb is evident. Take the opportunity here or at the picnic area to the west to explore Emigration Creek.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>For several years, emigrants on their way to California corralled their cattle and camped here during their stay in Salt Lake City. Later, the livestock pens were moved outside of the city. The 1894 City and County Building occupies the site today, and a monument commemorating the Mormon pioneers is located at the northwest corner of the square. (The monument is erroneous in stating that the vanguard Mormon pioneers camped at this location — the 1847 vanguard pioneer company camped on the banks of City Creek, southwest of what is now Exchange Place, the nights of July 23-25, 1847. The area is now occupied by buildings and the creek is channeled through an underground conduit.)<br /> <br /> As the Mormon pioneers approached the Salt Lake Valley, they split into four groups: a party of scouts at the front; a party of roadbuilders; the main camp of pioneers; and then Brigham Young, who was sick with Mountain Fever, with a caretaker, two days later. The scouts, roadbuilders, and main camp merged at the mouth of Emigration Canyon, where they had to break through the limestone ledge that had forced the Donner Party to crawl up out of the canyon. They entered the valley together the following day, July 22, and then moved to City Creek (downtown) on July 23. Brigham Young didn’t reach the valley until July 24.<br /> <br /> Curbside parking is available on the streets bordering Washington Square.<br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Site Information</span></p> <p><b>Location</b> (400 South Street and State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah).</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/mormon-pioneer-trail-salt-lake-city-itinerary.htm\">Mormon Pioneer Trail: Salt Lake City Itinerary</a></h2> <p>This site is on the Salt Lake City Itinerary.

    "audioDescription": "Fort Kearny State Historical Park. 402 words<br /><br />The park is an area of mowed lawns dotted with tall trees surrounded by flat crop land. A wide sidewalk leads from the parking lot to the visitor center, a low building with two wings extending back at a 30-degree angle on either side of the central lobby area. The walls are made of tan bricks with red-brown wood trim. Medium gray shingles cover the gently sloped roof. A short ramp with railings leads up to the front door.<br /><br />Restrooms are housed in a separate building to the right of the visitor center, at the end of the parking lot.<br /><br />As you enter the visitor center, the six-sided information desk lies directly in front of you, in the middle of the room. To the left is a small gift shop area with doorways that leading into exhibit areas in the adjoining room. Another door at the rear of the lobby, behind the information desk, leads out into the grounds.<br /><br />Behind the visitor center, the sidewalk passes a wagon with a canvas cover off to the right, then curves to the left and enters a reconstructed blacksmith and carpenter shop. The building is long and low, its walls made of rectangular blocks of grayish-tan sod. The roof is formed by wooden poles laid on crossbeams and covered with soil where grasses and other plants grow.<br /><br />Behind the blacksmith/carpenter shop the sidewalk leads to a grassy area where short cement posts mark the locations of buildings that have not been reconstructed. Faded wayside signs identify the various structures.<br /><br />To the left of the blacksmith/carpenter shop is a reconstructed fort surrounded by a palisade made of upright logs set in the ground topped with sharpened ends. Just to the rear and slightly to the left of the blacksmith/carpenter shop is another wagon, this one without any covering. A sidewalk to the left of the shop leads back towards the parking lot. Along this sidewalk is a tall metal sign which is a Nebraska Historical Marker. The sign outlines the history of Fort Kearny from the first post established in 1848, through its service as a waystation along the Oregon and California Trails and home station for the Pony Express, until it was discontinued as a military post in 1871, two years after the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The site is on the National Register of Historic Places.",

    "audioDescription": "Fort Laramie National Historic Site. 394 words<br /><br />From the parking lot, a long sidewalk winds north towards the middle of the fort area to the visitor. On either side are some buildings that have been restored and others that exist only as foundations or ruins. Most of the structures are of concrete or adobe and tan in color with gray shingle roofs. Other buildings are wood frame and painted white.<br /><br />Along the sidewalk are a couple of wayside signs with information about the park and the surrounding area. About halfway to the visitor center is a tall stone monument with multiple plaques on its sides commemorating the Pony Express and Transcontinental Telegraph and identifying Fort Laramie as being on the National Register of Historic Places. On front a stone marker reads, \"Fort Laramie, a military post on the Oregon Trail, June 16, 1849 to March 2, 1890. This monument is erected by the state of Wyoming and a few interested residents, 1913.\"<br /><br />The walkway then crosses a dirt road and continues on over the lawn, crossing a shallow ditch over a short wooded bridge. A small sign in front of the visitor center building reads, \"Commissary Storehouse. This building was completed in 1884. It was built as a commissary storage facility. As such, it would have been primarily divided into two large storerooms: one for meat and one for flour, rice and beans. Three or four smaller rooms would have been used as offices, an â€˜issue room' and a storage room for canned goods. This building also had a partial cellar with a trap door for use with a hand-operated elevator. Rations and other official army food items were issued from this building. A commissary officer and sergeant ran the operation.\"<br /><br />The entrance is located about 30 feet from the right end of the building. The small wooden porch in front of the door may be reached by a set of 5 stairs on the right side or by a ramp that zig-zags up on the left side. At the right end of the building a small sign indicates that restrooms are located in the rear of the building.<br /><br />As you enter the building, the information desk is straight ahead of you against the opposite wall. Bookcases and shelving to your left form the gift shop. On the right side is an exhibit area.",

    "bodyText": "A grouping of historical markers commemorate Fort Mitchell, which was constructed in 1864 to protect emigrants traveling along the Oregon/California Trails from attacks by Native American groups. The actual fort was located south of the markers on private property along the North Platte River. Please respect private property by viewing the site from the pullout.   <h3>Forgotten Outpost</h3> <p>During America’s westward expansion, the United States Army established hundreds of small outposts throughout the frontier to protect settlers, maintain communication with the West Coast, and serve as staging areas for military campaigns. Some of these posts have become an integral part of American history, such as Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley in Kansas and Fort Laramie in Wyoming. Most served less conspicuously and then faded into obscurity. One such outpost was Nebraska Territory’s Fort Mitchell.</p> <h3>Protecting the West</h3> <p>The American Civil War brought a new significance to the western territories. The great overland roads such as Santa Fe, Oregon and California Trails continued to carry vast numbers of emigrants and tons of freight. Western gold fields were producing ore that helped finance the Federal government’s war effort, and the newly erected transcontinental telegraph lines helped bind westerners to the Union. But eastern battlefields drained regular Army soldiers from the frontier and left vital western territories unprotected.To provide a military presence in the West, the Federal government sent a few state raised volunteer cavalry regiments to garrison forts that had been vacated by the regulars. Among these volunteers were the 11th Ohio Cavalry, under the command of Colonel William O. Collins, who arrived in Nebraska territory in 1862. After marching west to Fort Laramie, they were immediately assigned the task of patrolling, escorting freight wagons and stage coaches, and maintaining the telegraph lines along the Oregon Trail in central Wyoming. Eventually, other units from Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas joined the Ohioans on the frontier.</p> <h3>Fight to Control the Plains</h3> <p>Traffic over the roads continued unabated until early August 1864, when the plains erupted in an Indian war that pitted the volunteer soldiers against Sioux, Arapaho, and Southern Cheyenne warriors. Determined to drive the Americans from their lands, plains warriors swept out of Kansas and attacked homesteaders, stage stations and freight caravans all along the Platte River. For several weeks, all traffic and communications over the Oregon Trail came to a halt. In response to these depredations, several military expeditions sought out the warring tribes, but failed to bring them into battle. This led Brigadier General Robert Mitchell to work to assure that the overland roads would never again be at the mercy of a hostile enemy.</p> <h3>A New Strategy</h3> <p>The general planned to fortify each stage station along the Oregon Trail and detail troops to protect them. He also decided to build two new forts at strategic sites along the Platte River. To help defend the road that branched off the Oregon Trail and followed the South Platte to Denver, the first post was built near Julesburg, Colorado. For the first year of its existence, this post was known as Fort Rankin, and had a garrison of soldiers from the 7th Iowa Cavalry. It proved its value by withstanding two Indian assaults in the early weeks of 1865, and later served to protect workers during the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. The second post was placed along the North Platte River near Scotts Bluff. Official records documenting Fort Mitchell’s history are meager, but construction had begun by September 1, 1864, the date General Mitchell visited the site. The general’s aide-de-camp noted that the men of the 11th Ohio’s Company F were hard at work building the sod structure. Captain Jacob Shuman, the first commander of the as yet unnamed post, gave General Mitchell a tour of the site and described his plans for a sod stockade he hoped to have finished before winter set in. By the end of October, most of the work had been completed and the post was named for the general who had ordered its construction.</p> <h3>Conflict Grows</h3> <p>Hostilities on the plains intensified after November 29, 1864, when Colorado volunteer soldiers killed several hundred Cheyenne and Arapahos at Sand Creek, Colorado. Rather than bringing an end to the conflict, the massacre at Sand Creek resulted in renewed warfare and bloodshed. Convinced that the southern plains were no longer safe, several Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho bands began to move north to spend the winter in the remote Powder River region of Wyoming. However, enroute they encountered military forces stationed along the overland roads. First, they crossed paths with the 7th Iowa Cavalry at Fort Rankin. On February 2, 1865, the Indians stripped the post of anything useful. Two days later, they attacked a fortified telegraph station at Mud Springs, Nebraska. The Indians failed to cut the telegraph wires, allowing the 11 desperate soldiers at the tiny outpost to signal Fort Laramie for help. The first cavalrymen to respond came from Fort Mitchell. The siege continued until February 5th, when additional support arrived from Fort Laramie. After some additional skirmishing, the Indian bands crossed the frozen North Platte River and continued northwest.</p> <h3>Seeking Peace</h3> <p>The spring of 1865 saw a short-lived attempt at peace on the frontier. Tired of warfare, the Brule Sioux came in to Fort Laramie and asked to be allowed to live in peace near that post. The Army welcomed the gesture, but was unwilling to support the Indians with rations this far west, and decided to move the band to Fort Kearny in central Nebraska. The wary Sioux were allowed to keep their weapons for the journey, while the cavalry escort was not issued ammunition in hopes of avoiding confrontation. Distrust and fear of being moved near their enemies, the Pawnee, led the Brules to flee just three days into the journey. While trying to prompt the Indians into striking camp, the commander of the escort was shot. A skirmish ensued, and reinforcements were sent for from Fort Mitchell. Before relief arrived, the Sioux escaped by crossing the North Platte River and the outnumbered soldiers did not pursue.</p> <h3>Life at the Fort</h3> <p>For the next two years, Fort Mitchell continued to serve as a reassuring force to travelers on the Oregon Trail. Hundreds of freight wagons, emigrant trains and stage coaches passed Fort Mitchell. Detachments from the fort safely escorted them all, despite the fact that the post’s garrison never exceeded 100 men. Conditions at Fort Mitchell were crude and demanding. Endless hours of patrol and escort duty were interrupted only by the constant maintenance of the fort’s sod walls and corrals. Poor sanitary conditions and a monotonous diet of hardtack and salt pork added to the soldier’s hardships. Despite the poor living conditions, only one man is known to have died at Fort Mitchell. Following the end of the Civil War, regular army soldiers returned to the West, and one company of the 18th Infantry was stationed at Fort Mitchell. These foot soldiers were helpless against highly mobile Indian warriors, and once suffered the indignity of having 112 mules stolen from a freight train camped within sight of the fort.</p> <h3>Fading into Obscurity</h3> <p>No official record of the post’s abandonment exists, but Margaret Carrington, wife of Col Henry Carrington, made one of the last accounts of Fort Mitchell as an active military post. The Carringtons stopped at the site in June 1866, and described it as follows: “This is a sub-post of Fort Laramie of peculiar style and compactness. The walls of the quarters are also the outlines of the fort itself, and the four sides of the rectangle are respectively the quarters of offices, soldiers, horses and the warehouse of supplies”. Soon after, Fort Mitchell faded into obscurity. The sod walls quickly deteriorated, and wind and rain removed all signs that the post ever existed. Today, plows turn up occasional reminders of Fort Mitchell in the form of rusted metal artifacts. Although no physical indications of the post remain, nearby Mitchell Pass preserves the name and serves as a reminder that for three years, Fort Mitchell stood guard along the Oregon Trail during an important period in American history.</p>",

Each spring, west-bound travelers in Kansas would rush towards this junction and then take their \"exit.\" Those heading to Santa Fe would continue southwest, while those heading to Oregon or California would turn and head northwest. The travelers going to Oregon were primarily emigrants- people relocating from their homelands to new territories in the West.

    "audioDescription": "Gardner Junction Park. 354 words<br /><br />In front of the paved pullout and parking area is a brown sign the reads, \"Gardner Junction, Santa Fe, California and Oregon Trails.\" Beside the parking area is a cement patio, lined by a low stone wall on the left and back sides. In the middle is a pavilion with a metal roof supported by four posts, covering three large signs. Behind the pavilion, against the wall is a metal bench. At the right side of the paved area a sidewalk makes a looping path about 100 yards long in total through meadow-like vegetation. At the far end of the loop are 4 more signs, two at each corner, and another metal bench.<br /><br />The signs under the pavilion discuss nearby trail sites to the east, north-east and west, some of which are included in this app for the Oregon Trail.<br /><br />The signs along the looping sidewalk cover other topics. One titled \"Eye of the Needle\" reads in part, \"The historic junction of three great western frontier trails - the Santa Fe Trail, the Oregon Trail and the California Trail - is located approximately one-half mile to the north. To the southwest lay the Santa Fe Trail and to the northwest was the road to Oregon and California...Between the late 1830s and the early 1850s, as many as 200,000 emigrants may have passed through this gateway in order to start a new life in the Oregon Territory or to take a chance seeking their fortune in the gold fields of California. During this same period, thousands of freighters loaded with commodities were also rumbling through this junction heading to and from the markets at Santa Fe.\"<br /><br />Another sign titled \"Following Their Dreams\" discusses the various types of travelers who followed these trails. A third sign, titled \"Apprehension and Conflict,\" discusses the impact the large numbers of travelers had on the Indian Nations who lived in the Great Plains Region west of the Missouri River. The final sign is titled \"From Prairie Schooners to Locomotives\" and covers the decline of the trails as railroad lines spread and the transcontinental railroad was completed.",

    "audioDescription": "Geyser Park. 449 words<br /><br />The geyser area is surrounded by a low stone wall, about 3 feet high. On the other side is a long, low mound of pumpkin orange rock. On the left side of the mound, a grey and tan rocky ridge rises to form a small hill. About half way up the slope is a wooden viewing platform. Near the edge of the parking lot past the left end of the wall is a tall, three panel sign which discusses the National Byways in Idaho, the springs of Soda Springs and the geyser itself. Even further to the left is a wayside sign that talks about the Oregon Trail in Caribou County.<br /><br />Starting from either sign, a paved trail zigzags up the low hill on the left and ends at the viewing platform above. Although paved for most of the way, as you approach the platform, it becomes narrow and turns into a rock and dirt path. There is a bench on the viewing platform along with another wayside sign. The platform looks over the geyser area itself, an expanse of barren gray and orange rock.<br /><br />Text on the sign reads, \"Many Oregon and California bound emigrants mention seeing ten to twelve foot high white mounds and cones in their diaries and journals while passing through the Soda Springs area in the mid-1800s. Often, one of the first natural curiosities that they encountered was Pyramid Spring.<br /><br />\"In 1937, several businessmen attempted to find and divert hot water from Pyramid Spring to develop a commercial bathhouse and health resort. On November 28th, at a depth of 35 feet, their hopes and dreams seemed within reach. The drilling rig struck a gas chamber, and shortly after drilling ceased for the day, hot water began gushing upward more than forty feet. The next day, after the 3500 pound bit was removed, the ground shook as if it were about to split open and a roaring gusher of more than 70 feet streamed upward from the valve. After several days, the hissing hot water began to cool and become laden with mineral content (hard water), rendering it undesirable for use as a bathhouse. Two weeks later, the drilling riggers were able to finally cap the gusher.<br /><br />\"The hordes of tourists that businessmen anticipated never came. But the geyser did attract attention. Within weeks, the Secretary of the Interior sent a telegram to Soda Springs asking the City to turn off the geyser because â€˜it is throwing the world famous Old Faithful Geyser off schedule.' Today, Soda Springs' Captive Geyser has a timer on the valve that permits it to erupt every hour on the hour throughout the year.\"",

In the mid-1920s, Truman was tasked with determining the official route of the National Old Trails Road, which included the Santa Fe Trail. Between 1926 and 1927, he traveled the Santa Fe Trail many times for this purpose.<br /> <br /> Eventually, the road ran coast to coast and was developed for car travel.<br /> During this time, Truman also traveled the route several times to select the locations for the 12 DAR Madonna of the Trail Statues. This series of statues was dedicated to the spirit of pioneer women in the United States and were commissioned by the National Society of Daughters of the American Revolution (NSDAR). Many of these statues still stand today along the Santa Fe Trail.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Harry S Truman National Historic Site includes the Truman Home in Independence, Missouri, and the Truman Farm Home in Grandview, Missouri.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Pony Express Utah No. 2 Contract Station</strong><br /> Echo Canyon is a natural conduit through the Wasatch Mountains, used for thousands of years by wildlife and native people migrating between the Rockies and the Great Basin. Once discovered by mountain men in the early 1800s, the 24-mile passage eventually became a thoroughfare for pack trains, commercial and emigrant wagons, Forty-niner brigades, military columns, handcart processions, the Pony Express, the Overland Stage, and the transcontinental telegraph. The Donner-Reed Party was the third emigrant wagon party to pass through the canyon.<br /> <br /> Today Echo Canyon is still a busy transportation corridor, occupied by I-80, the Union Pacific Railroad, a segment of the Old Lincoln Highway (the nation’s first coast-to-coast automobile highway), and modern communications and utility lines. More than 160 years of development have altered the canyon, but fascinating traces of 19th century uses still are visible.<br /> <br /> As you enter I-80, look ahead and to the right toward the bare rampart of Castle Rock, an emigrant landmark near the head of Echo Canyon. The Mormon pioneer company headed by Brigham Young, who had taken ill with a tickborne infection, camped near here on July 14, 1847. The combined California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express Trail ran between the two modern railroad grades, and a Pony Express and stage station once stood on the grounds of the “old automobile graveyard” that is visible from the freeway. <strong>The site is on private property, not open to the public.</strong></p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (between Wahsatch and Echo, UT; Westbound I-80 enters Echo Canyon between mileposts 188 and 187 southwest of Wahsatch.)</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

On a knoll a short distance from the river, Marshall built his base of operations. He then constructed a rope ferry across the river and charged up to $5.00 per wagon to use it. The ferry was very popular- at times, thousands of emigrants would be camped here, waiting for days for their turn to cross.

    "audioDescription": "Historic Trails Park (Marshall's Ferry). 390 words<br /><br />This small park has a dirt road that runs in a loop around a central grassy area with several large trees. At the front of this area is a large stone sign that reads, \"Historic Trails Park.\" On the left end of the sign is a metal plaque with \"Marshall Ferry\" in raised lettering and a relief carving of a ferry boat. On the other end of the sign is another plaque recognizing donors to the park. At the far end of the loop, on the right side of the road are more stone markers and a replica ferry boat. All of the stone markers have metal plaques with raised lettering. The first one, which is on the right side of the ferry replica, tells us the history of the site.<br /><br />The ferry boat is a low platform built of wood with short, hinged ramps leading up either end. The other sides are edged with a simple wood railing. On the far side is mounted a large wheel which controls a heavy rope. The rope loops from the wheel to either end of the ferry then out to a sliding pully which runs on a rope running parallel to the ferry and tied to trees on either end.<br /><br />To the left of the ferry is another stone marker which discusses the rope ferry and how it worked. Travelers paid up to $5 per wagon and 25 cents per head of livestock. The original ferry was located 1200 feet northwest of here from 1851 until 1864 when a bridge was built.<br /><br />Further to the left is a semi-circular pavement edged with 7 large stone markers. The plaque on the largest one in the center has a map of the western United States with the routes of a variety of trails fanning out from the Kansas-Missouri border, listed as California NHT, Oregon NHT, St. Joe Road, Military Road, Mormon NHT, Pony Express NHT, Overland Stage and Otoe-Missouria.<br /><br />The three markers to the right of center have plaques that discuss the Founders - Frank Marshall who established a trading post and ferry here - and the Otoe-Missouria Trail, the California trail, the Overland Stage and the Oregon Trail. On the left of center the markers cover the Pony Express, the Military Road, the Mormon Trail, St. Joe Road and Alcove Spring.",

Imagine those emigrants' despair upon reaching this spot and seeing the jagged, blue-gray peaks of the Wasatch Mountains on the horizon ahead. From here, both wagon companies had to grub a rough track over divides and mountains and down a series of willow-packed canyons and creek bottoms in order to reach the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. The effort cost the Donner-Reed party 13 days, one of a series of troubles that caused the group to be trapped by blizzards in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Utah Highway 65, about 5.5 miles southwest of Henefer, Utah)<br /> Hastings Cutoff and Mormon Trail Wagon Ruts at Hogsback Summit (southwest of Henefer), marked by white fiberglass trail posts, are clearly visible along the right side of the road beyond the fence line at the Summit and Morgan County boundary. Just ahead at Hogsback Summit, the pioneers looked west and saw a discouraging jumble of mountains. An interpretive sign at the turnout tells the story.<br /> <br /> Look for the swales on the right near the Morgan County sign at odometer reading 5.7 miles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit</strong></p> <p>\"40 Miles to Fort Bridger\"</p> <p>\"The country west looks rough and mountainous,\" wrote William Clayton, describing this panorama of the Wasatch Mountains. Modern historians have dubbed this summit \"Heartbreak Ridge\" to describe the feelings of many early Mormon Pioneers who crested this ridge. After months on the trail, traveling over 1,200 weary miles, it was heart- wrenching to discover that the most difficult part of the journey still lay ahead. Some people must have broken down and wept. Others gritted their teeth with determination and moved southwest down off Hogsback Summit to challenge the mountains and canyons that lay ahead.</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“...arrived [July 19] on the suummit of the dividing ridge and put a guide hard up, \"80 miles to Fort Bridger\"... The descent is not very steep but exceedingly dangerous to wagons being mostly on the side hill over large cobble stones, causing the wagons to slide very badly.” -William Clayton</i></p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Hollenberg ranch house was built on Cottonwood Creek about 1857 by Gerat H. Hollenberg to capitalize on the Oregon-California emigrant trade that passed his door. In addition to living quarters for the Hollenberg family, the building served as a neighborhood grocery store, a tavern, and an unofficial post-office. Emigrants were able to obtain provisions at the ranch. Three years later, it became a Pony Express home station and later a stage station.<br /> <br /> Dr. C.M. Clark reached Cottonwood Creek in 1860 and found \"a small stream which is dry during the summer months. The approach to it is winding and steep, and as the bed of the stream contains several large stones at the ford, some care is necessary in driving. There are two good springs here, but no wood.

    "audioDescription": "Homestead National Historical Park. 418 words<br /><br />The visitor center here at Homestead is reached by a broad sidewalk that runs parallel to the right side of the parking lot. Looking down the sidewalk we see the one-story, red-brick building. The front of the lobby area on the right is all glass. The flat roof slants up gradually to the right side, then slopes up steeply to a point at the right rear of the building. White lettering on the wall to the left of the entrance reads, \"Homestead National Historical Park, Heritage Center.\"<br /><br />To the right of the entrance, a textured cement wall stained an earthen-tan color extends towards us along the sidewalk. On the other side of the sidewalk are several benches. <br /><br />To the left of the building a sidewalk winds out to a one-room log cabin and displays of old farm equipment.<br /><br />Before reaching the end of the wall are several signs. One covers park regulations. Another tells us that a cell phone audio tour is available by dialing 402-715-9527. A third sign is titled \"Walk in Their Shoes\" and shows a black white photograph of a man following a plow pulled by a team of mules. It reads, \"What was it like to be a homesteader? To get an idea, take a walk. The flags around the parking lot enclose an acre. It may not seem huge. But plowing an acre meant walking about 10 miles. Over uneven soil. Driving a team of oxen. In sun or rain. Walk that acre. Then multiply it by 160, the size of a typical homestead.\"<br /><br />As you reach the end of the wall, another wayside sign shows a map of the United States with all the homestead states identified. The only states without homesteading were those on the eastern seaboard, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas and Hawaii. Text on the sign tells us that the Homestead Act of 1862 offered people 160 acres of free land if they were willing to live on it, farm it and build a home. The map shows the 30 homesteading states in which the government gave away 270 million acres.<br /><br />Metal cutouts of the 30 homestead states are mounted on the wall, each with a square cutout that represents the proportion of homestead land in that state. Feel free to touch.<br /><br />As you enter the center, there is a sign-in book at the right side of the foyer. Inside, the information desk is to your left and the gift shop is to your right.",

    "audioDescription": "Hooper Springs Park. 336 words<br /><br />This park is nicely groomed with mown grassy lawns, dark green fir trees and groupings of aspen and other deciduous trees. A low hill rises in the background. Near the edge of the paved parking lot is a log roof, painted dark red and supported by square stone pillars which covers the spring itself. An arch on top of the structure has letters made of small wood logs which read, \"Hooper Spring.\"<br /><br />A wayside sign at the edge of the parking lot reads, in part, \"Hooper Springs echoes the legend and lore of the Oregon Trail with numerous diary entries about the site. The springs have long been a tourist attraction and a popular destination. Soda water from these springs was marketed after rail service reached this resort area in 1882. In 1936, the original Hooper Springs was surrounded with a concrete and stone walkway. It was soon covered with a stone and log pavilion. The Works Progress Administration assisted with the beautification of the springs and adjacent park. Although not a favorite to some tastes, the water is palatable. Many visitors consume it straight, or make punch or lemonade from this effervescent sparkling spring water.\"<br /><br />The spring may be reached by a set of four, uneven stone steps on either side of the pavilion which leads down to the level of the water. The oval pool is surrounded by a cement walk and a stone bench along the walls, except at the left end where the water exits in a stream. The water itself is clear so that the stones at the bottom are visible. The water bubbles, putting ripples all across the surface. Feel free to touch and even taste the water.<br /><br />On the far side of the pavilion an arched wooden footbridge crosses the small stream leading to a grassy picnic area beyond. Further back is a children's playground and some outbuildings. Restrooms are housed in a separate building to the far right of the property.",

Two large springs come together to form a horseshoe shape, giving the site it's name.<br /> <br /> Horseshoe Springs was utilized extensively by local Goshute tribes and first visited by a white man in 1827 by the legendary trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith while returning to Utah from California. In 1846, Horseshoe Springs became a stop on the Hastings Cutoff emigrant trail and was visited by the infamous Donner Reed party.<br /> <br /> Today, Horseshoe Springs is managed for its important riparian, fisheries, and widlife habitat. There is a visitor kiosk and boardwalk providing access for fishing and other recreation. There also is an interpretive display for the California National Historic Trail.

The rock derived its name from a party of fur trappers who camped and celebrated Independence Day near the rock on July 4, 1830.

In 1961, it was designated a national historic landmark managed by the State of Wyoming.<br /> <br /> Today, the site contains a footpath that goes around the base of the rock, interpretive exhibits that tell the trail story, visible trail ruts (a deep wagon swale passes beneath the path's footbridge), and emigrant inscriptions.

    "audioDescription": "Independence Rock State Historic Site. 408 words<br /><br />Parking for Independence Rock is at a rest area on the side of the highway. The large gray granite mound can be seen across the rangeland surrounding it. Cement sidewalks lead past the restroom and other buildings to a large stone marker with a metal relief sculpture of a wagon and ox team. Feel free to stop and touch. From there, the entrance to the fields around Independence Rock is just across a paved access drive.<br /><br />The covered entrance is made of tan brickwork, with metal fencing on the back side. There are a couple of wayside signs here that show a map of the trails that encircle the rock and that ask visitors to be respectful of the area. There is also a warning that rattlesnakes live in this area.<br /><br />To reach the rock itself, proceed through the pass-through in the fence and follow the cement side walk across the grassy prairieland. Other signs along the walk describe the Sweetwater River Valley, discuss the geology of the granite outcrops in the valley, and provide information on the historic trails that passed this way, naming the rock, hardships along the trail, history of the area in the last 150 years, and the signatures that were carved in the rock. From the signs, we learn that this mass of granite is 700 feet wide, 1,900 feet long and 136 feet high.<br /><br />Swales from the wagon ruts can also be seen through the pasture, the most prominent one being crossed by a wooden foot bridge.<br /><br />The sidewalk ends at a metal gate close to the base of the rock. Once through the gate there are benches along the fence to the left. The sidewalk continues up to the base of the rock itself then continues in either direction around the base. The cement will change to gravel and then to dirt if you continue to follow the trail. From the path around the rock it is easy to feel the rock or even to climb the steep slope; however there are no fixed paths to the top of the rock. At the end of the rock to the left there is one section that is protected by a metal fence. Here there are carvings in the stone and a group of metal memorial plaques and other markers, including one that identifies the rock as being \"Wyoming Place number 1 on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",

The Indians were then informed...the presents that they were to receive were given them because they had been friendly to the white men, and recommended that their friendship should continue. Col Landers then addressed the emigrants, telling them to treat the Indians kindly, and live in peace together.\"<br /> -Albert Bierstadt, July 5, 1859</p> </blockquote> <p> <br /> The end of the Lander Road's construction between Burnt Ranch, Wyoming, and Fort Hall, Idaho did not mean the end of the project. One item still had to be done- negotiate with the Native American Tribes whose land it was built on for the right of way. In 1859, Lander brought wagon loads of goods to give to the Shoshone, Bannock, and other Tribes in exchange for the privilege of crossing their land peacefully. On July 3, at the Green River crossing in what is today Wyoming, a celebration was held to disperse gifts to the Shoshone and to celebrate the 4th of July. The peaceful, festive celebration was attended by about 800 Shoshone, 300 emigrants (who happened to be in the area), and the soldiers and cavalrymen of Lander's command that were traveling with him.<br />  <br /> A feast was had, gifts were handed out, and speeches were made. Lander spoke directly to the Shoshone and then to the emigrants (partially quoted above). Contrary to the expected views at that time, Lander instructed the emigrants to have their interactions with the local Native Americans be cautious. They should treat the Native Americans kindly and to live in peace with them. The celebration extended into the night and concluded the following day.<br />  <br /> Several Additional celebrations and gatherings were held throughout the year with the same purpose of distributing gifts to Native Americans and negotiating with them to cross their land peacefully. In terms of Lander obtaining the needed right-of-way agreements, the negotiations were successful, concluding the first US government-sponsored trail section for the Oregon and the California Trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image Credit</strong><br /> 1.

    "bodyText": "<p>In the mid-1800s, over 250,000 people followed the California Trail to California's gold mines and croplands. Most had to walk the entire 2,000-mile trip. Would you do this? More than once? Travelers in the 1800s said “yes” to both! The California Trail was their version of today's interstate highway -- a route that could be traveled repeatedly and in both directions.<br />  <br /> Similar to interstate highways, new parts of the California Trail were created to help travelers. The first US government sponsored section was the Lander Road in 1858. John Lane used this road for the first time in 1859, during his fifth(!) trip on the Oregon and the California Trails. He was the captain of a wagon train that departed Iowa for Oregon. Sadly, he did not complete the trip. On July 18, on a nearby ridge off of the Lander Road, Lane died from a cholera-like illness.<br />  <br /> With limited supplies, and limited time before winter's arrival, most trailside burials were quick- simply prayers said over a hastily dug grave. However, the beloved Lane received a unique honor -- a funeral! There was a customary viewing of the body, hymns, prayers, and a funeral procession. Finally, a headstone made by a wagon train member was placed at the grave. After the day-long event was over, the wagon train returned to the Trail and its journey to Oregon.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Lane's Grave, Caribou County, Idaho, 17 miles west of Freedom, Wyoming)</p> <p> Today, little has changed at the grave of John Lane since he was buried. The headstone and footstone still remain, it is only accessible by a dirt and gravel road, there are no public services, and very few structures or homes are visible from the grave. The site is a rare opportunity to experience, as close a possible, what traveling the California Trail in the 1850s was like.<br /> <br /> <strong>NOTE:</strong> if you go, it is important to know that, currently, there are no directional signs to the site, nor are there any signs marking/ identifying the parking area for the site.<br /> <br /> <strong>The grave itself is on private land.</strong> Visitors are welcome to view it; however, it does require calling the land owner when you arrive as there is a locked gate across the road to Lane's Grave.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Right now, the view is of ranch land, cattle, sagebrush covered hills, and mountains in a very remote setting. Sounds are all natural; even hearing vehicles is rare.",

He was a tireless advocate of Lone Elm and its location on his farm. He also was instrumental in the placement of the Daughters of the American Revolution Santa Fe Trail marker in 1906. This marker still graces the same spot today on the northwest corner of Lone Elm Park.\"<br /><br />Past the sign, the entrance road curves to the left past a large relief sculpture of a covered wagon and team of 4 oxen set well back from the left side of the road. A stone marker in front tells us that the sculpture is \"Trails West\" by Eldon Tefft originally commissioned in 1994 and placed at the Kansas Visitor Center. In 2003 it was restored and erected here.<br /><br />The road then proceeds around to a parking area in front of a large covered picnic pavilion. The pavilion is made of large wood posts and beams set on stone foundations and has a large stone fireplace and chimney.<br /><br />To the left of the pavilion is a paved patio with 4 wayside signs on the edge and, in the middle, a metal grill covering a hand-dug well. A small sign reads, \"Kansas Heritage Feature - Hand-dug well. This well supported early agriculture by providing water for livestock, crops and people. The well was likely constructed in the late 1800s and remained in use throughout the 1900s. The well is 15 feet in total depth.\" Water may be seen below through the grill.<br /><br />The wayside signs discuss the Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon and California Trails, all three of which passed this way; the use of the land here as a campground along this branch of Cedar Creek; the travelers that passed through, both famous and infamous; and the history of the campground as it turned into a farm and then to a park.",

    "audioDescription": "Massacre Rocks State Park. 313 words<br /><br />The parking lot here is perched near the top of a low bluff facing a low ridge across the highway with higher peaks visible in the distance. The land is covered with sagebrush prairie as far as the eye can see, dotted here and there with junipers and other small trees. Large black boulders top the ridge next to the parking lot. A large sign at the edge of the parking lot is titled \"Sagebrush, symbol of the West.\" It reads, \"Of all the habitats in the West, the sagebrush high desert has fared the worst! The shrub-steppe is home to over 200 kinds of birds and 30 kinds of mammals. Big sagebrush is a highly nutritious and digestible food source containing four times the protein of other range vegetation in the winter for big game animals such as mule deer, elk and antelope. Sagebrush also provides cover for mule deer and pronghorn fawns, elk calves, nesting birds, grouse broods, and pygmy rabbits. Over 90% of the sagebrush sea that once covered much of the American West has been converted to cropland, grassland, or urban development. Several wildlife species use sagebrush for critical food, nest, rest, escape. Some species, such as sage grouse, are wholly dependent on sagebrush habitat for survival.\"<br /><br />From the end of the parking lot, a paved walkway leads down a slight slope to the visitor center, a flat, one-story building, with rough stone work on the right and vertical tan-colored siding on the left. An opening leads to a covered patio that runs along the left side of the building. The entrance is directly ahead of you. As you enter the information desk is ahead and slightly to the left.<br /><br />Outside on the wood-floored patio, there is a series of signs along the railing that forms a long map of the Oregon Trail.",

    "audioDescription": "Minor Park. 459 words<br /><br />If you stand at the rear of the small parking lot with your back to the street, a sidewalk leads 25 yards to the left, gently curving to the right around a large tree. A wayside sign sits at the end of the sidewalk. Ahead of you is a broad, grassy lawn dotted with scattered trees ending at an overgrown meadow. Several swales can be seen crossing that lawn from right to left, coming up the gentle slope to the river about a quarter of a mile to the left. Feel free to walk across the lawn and over the swales. The first one is about 12 yards from the end of the sidewalk. The largest one is 100 yards away at the edge of the meadow. That one is 20 yards wide and five feet deep. Standing in that swale is a granite marker commemorating the Santa Fe Trail, erected by the Daughters of the American Revolution.<br /><br />The wayside sign is titled, \"Trail Hazards.\" An illustration shows a large covered wagon with a team of six oxen stopped on a muddy trail, a river visible in the distance behind them. The wagon sits tilted toward the rear right corner, where one wheel has been removed as two men work on repairs. The caption reads, \"Crossing the Big Blue river before a bridge was built in 1859 was hard on people, animals and equipment. Before crossing, wagon travelers might camp while waiting for others to cross or for swollen waters to recede. Once across, they had to stop to dry out and rearrange their loads. And with the jostling and wrenching by swift currents their wagons often needed repairs.\"<br /><br />Main text on the panel reads, \"From the late 1830s and into the 1860s, thousands of traders, emigrants and gold prospectors passed this way. After crossing the Big Blue River, covered wagons struggled up this hill due to the mud left behind from torrential spring downpours. Over the years, thousands of wagon wheels and hooves churned the earth and rain washed away the loose soil, creating the swales before you.<br /><br />Lumbering freight wagons heading for Santa Fe carried tons of trade goods, such as bolts of fabric and boxes of tools and cookware. On a return trip a trader might transport wool, mules, coins, silver bars or gold dust as payment for goods. Emigrants and gold prospectors also passed by here on their way to Oregon or California. Pulled by oxen or mules, their wagons carried enough food and other necessities to last several months.\"<br /><br />A small map on the right side shows the three trails that passed this way: the Oregon and California trails heading northwest and the Santa Fe Trail heading southwest.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Mitchell Pass is a gap between Scotts Bluff and South Bluff. In 1850, a wagon road was built through what was then called \"Devil's Gap\", and it became the primary route for emigrants (pioneers heading west), soldiers, Pony Express riders and the Transcontinental telegraph. Prior to 1851, emigrants would have used <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/robidoux-pass.htm\">Robidoux Pass</a> to bypass Scotts Bluff. <br /> <br /> In 1851, William Lobenstine wrote in his journal:</p> <p><em>\"The rock itself is separated nearly at it's middle, having a pass here fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending at both sides perpendicular to a height of three to four hundred feet.</em></p> <p><em>The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is now preferred by nearly all emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight miles from the old road.\"</em></p> <p>Mitchell Pass was named for nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-mitchell-site.htm\">Fort Mitchell</a>, which was named after United States Brigadier General Robert B. Mitchell. <br /> <br /> Today, visitors to Scotts Bluff National Monument can walk through Mitchell Pass on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/oregon-trail-pathway.htm\">Oregon Trail Pathway</a>, a half-mile long hiking trail. </p>",

His wagons became the best known on the western trails. <br /> <br /> Murphy’s wagons consisted of wheels, running gear, a box and a cover. They were usually nine feet high with a twelve foot long bed. The bed of a Murphy wagon had a straight box, unlike its more famous counterpart, the Conestoga, which had a curved box. A Murphy could comfortably haul between 1,800 to 2,200 pounds. Straying too far from these specifications risked serious problems.<br /> <br /> Oxen were most often used for pulling this type of wagon. It required two yoke of oxen, a yoke consisting of two oxen. A spare yoke often trailed behind so the livestock could be rotated and rested. <br /> <br /> For those who preferred mules, an equivalent number of yoke could have been used in place of oxen.  Horses were rarely if ever used. They lacked the strength and endurance needed to pull a wagon 2,000 miles. They also required costly supplemental feed. <br /> <br /> The Murphy wagon at Scotts Bluff was purchased from the Dewitts Buggy Works Company in 1979 and donated to the Monument by the Oregon Trail Museum Association.",

A newer section covered with grey siding extends towards the front on the left, forming one side of a cement courtyard, 35 feet wide and 70 feet long. The right side and front of the courtyard are framed by broad wooden columns with a thick header. Banners hang from the right side of the header. The courtyard is reached by five cement steps on the front and right. To avoid the steps, follow the sloping sidewalk along the right side to the rear of the courtyard.<br /><br />At the far left of the building front is a bronze statue of Jim Bridger, 1804-1881. He stands, a horse's head drooping to his right, with right hand raised to shade his eyes as he gazes into the distance.<br /><br />The main entrance is at the rear of the courtyard through double doors in the older, brick part of the building. The welcome desk is directly in front of you as you enter.",

    "audioDescription": "National Historic Trails Interpretive Center. 322 words<br /><br />Seen from the parking lot, the building is a low, one-story, circular structure, almost blending in with the prairie vegetation surrounding it. A series of shiny, royal-blue wall segments stair-step out from the center of the building and extend to the left. The sidewalk leads to the left, then curves back to the right, around the blue wall to reach the front of the building. Along the left edge of the sidewalk are four tall panels, one for each of the trails commemorated here: the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, the Pony Express Trail and the Mormon Trail, each associated with a different color, which is then echoed in bricks placed in the sidewalk along with flat stones engraved with quotes from emigrants.<br /><br />At the front of the building, a large triangular patio extends to the left, dotted with stone benches. To reach the entrance, follow the rough stone wall on the right side of the walkway. This wall then becomes a tunnel, with a dark green wall on the left and topped with a covering supported by semi-circular metal beams, echoing the shape of a covered wagon. Spaced randomly in the stone wall are larger stones with images of prominent geographical features along the trails, such as Chimney Rock, Natural Bridge, Laramie Peak and Fort Laramie.<br /><br />Entering the front doors brings you into a large, open lobby space. In the middle of this space is a welcome kiosk with a map of the facility. The exhibit space may be reached through an opening in the wall beyond the kiosk or by following the curving hallway to the right. Restrooms are also along the right-hand hallway.<br /><br />The information desk is off to the left of the kiosk. From the desk, the gift shop will be to your left. To your right at that point is stone wall with names of donors carved into the blocks.",

    "bodyText": "<p>When William Becknell and his party made their consequential first trip on the Santa Fe Trail, it is likely that they passed through the New Santa Fe area, and perhaps crossed the ruts that are still visible in the New Santa Fe Cemetery. Located at the westernmost border of the US, New Santa Fe (now part of Kansas City, MO) was a gateway to the adventure and challenges of trail travel.Thus, the area was a significant transition point on the trail. It was a place for outfitting and loading for travel west. It was also a place where goods and silver from Santa Fe could be unloaded and distributed. <br /> <br /> When emigrant traffic began to grow in the 1840’s, trails to Oregon and California shared this path with the Santa Fe Trail. Thus, these trail swales saw not only heavy commercial traffic, but significant emigration traffic. Because it was, for several years, the last stop in the US, it was an important milestone for those leaving behind what they knew for a chance at a new life. After the discovery of gold in 1848, many “49ers” also used this path on their way to find wealth in the gold fields. <br /> <br /> By the late 1840’s, a stage stop on this route called “New Santa Fe” offered several amenities: a post office, two general stores, an inn, a shoe shop, drugstore, blacksmith, and saloon. Seeing the success of the area, Dabney Lipscomb platted the town of New Santa Fe in 1851. Conflict on the Missouri-Kansas border in 1860 prior to the Civil War disrupted traffic on the trail and led to a decline in the town. <br /> <br /> By the time the New Santa Fe Cemetery was designated as a burial ground in 1880, trail traffic had dissipated, but the ruts may have still served as a road for cemetery visitors. Though the cemetery post-dates significant trail traffic, it helped protect the ruts from the fate faced by most in the area. As Kansas City grew, the town of New Santa Fe was dismantled and replaced by modern development. The swales in the cemetery are a unique historical remnant amongst the surrounding urban environment.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (122nd Street and State Line Road, Kansas City, MO)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> The New Santa Fe Cemetery now sits in the heart of a residential neighborhood developed in the 1980’s. Spanning the cemetery’s entrance is a delicate metal sign that reads “New Santa Fe.” A historical marker and an informational exhibit sit on either side of the entrance and explain the history and importance of New Santa Fe and the trail ruts. The ruts are met on both sides by burial plots intentionally spaced to leave the ruts undisturbed. The ruts are visible as depressions in the grassy land. The cemetery also features mature trees, and weathered gravestones from the late 1800’s.  </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.newsantafe.org/\">More site information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail </a></h2> <p> </p>",

    "audioDescription": "North Platte River Crossing. 431 words<br /><br />This historic bridge lies just east of the modern highway bridge. This one-lane bridge has three spans, each a low arch about 15 feet high, made of iron, now rusty-brown in color. There are \"I\" beam piers at the beginning and end of each arch. The flooring is formed by broad planking, now a weathered gray. The bridge is much longer than the current width of the river. Only the northern span still has water underneath.<br /><br />At the southern end of the bridge, at the edge of the dirt parking lot, is a wayside sign titled, \"Spanning a Century: End of an Era.\" A historic photograph on the sign shows the bridge in 1877 when the water stretched from end to end of the bridge. Text reads in part, \"Once broad and turbulent, the North Platte River posed a formidable obstacle to 19th century travelers. High water made it nearly impossible to cross the river for several month each year. The crossing became less dangerous by 1850 when ferry service was established to meet the growing volume of military and emigrant traffic.\" It goes on to tell us that after the Great Sioux Reservation was established in 1868, huge amount of supplies were needed to be transported to supply the Indian agencies, leading Congress to fund construction of a bridge. Text at the bottom of the sign reads, \"The King Iron Bridge Company built bridges with speed and efficiency by standardizing the manufacturing process and maintaining stockpiles of prefabricated parts. The triple-span Fort Laramie Bridge was constructed between August 1875 and February 1876 for $15,000. Rubble-filled log ice breakers protect the unique I-beam piers supporting the bridge. Spanning 400 feet, this bridge is the best-preserved King paten tubular bowstring iron bridge still in existence.\"<br /><br />To the right of the bridge, a trail leads down to the water's edge, then proceeds eastward along the bank. Another wayside sign by the river tells of initial skirmishes between the military and the Lakota Sioux, the beginnings of the Northern Plains Indian wars, which finally ended in 1890 at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.<br /><br />At the northern end of the bridge are 2 markers. One identifies the bridge as a Wyoming Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The other marker, protected by a metal rail fence, reads, \"Old Army Bridge over the Platte River, erected in 1875. This bridge was a vital link between Cheyenne, Fort Laramie and the military outposts, Indian agencies and gold fields of the Black Hills Dakota Regions. Placed by the Historical Landmark Commission of Wyoming, July 1951.\"",

The bluffs close proximity to the river forced the emigrant trails onto a narrow path that went up and over the bluffs.

    "audioDescription": "O'Fallon's Bluff at Sutherland Rest Area. 365 words<br /><br />From the parking area at this rest stop, a sidewalk leads around the rest room building on the right side, loops behind it, then turns right, away from the building, out to where swales can be seen running roughly parallel to the highway. About halfway out a small loop to the left passes a low brick wall with a sign on top. The metal sign, which has raised lettering, is titled \"The Great Platte River Road.\" It reads in part, \"This is the Platte River Valley, Americas great road west. It provided a natural pathway for westward expansion across the continent during the nineteenth century. Here passed the Oregon Trail, following the South Platte River along much the same route as the highway over which you now travel. Beginning in 1841, nearly 250,000 travelers crossed the plains to Oregon and California over this important overland route. Here at O'Fallon's Bluffs, the wagon trains faced one of the most difficult and dangerous spots on the trail. The Platte River cut directly against the bluff, making it necessary to travel the narrow roadway over O'Fallon's Bluffs.\"<br /><br /> A stone bench is on a low wall at the right side of this loop. <br /><br />At the far end of the sidewalk is another sign with raised lettering. This one is titled, \"Crossing the Overland Trail.\" It reads in part, \"Beneath this platform, evidence of the great westward migration still remains. These shallow depressions were once deep ruts created by thousands of hooves, shoes and wheels. The Overland Trail is often visualized as a single, well-defined roadway. However, except in narrow spots such as this, the actual route through the Platte Valley during any given year varied considerably, depending upon such factors as soil conditions and the availability of grass for the animals.\"<br /><br />Looking both right and left from this sign you can see shallow swales coming up the slope from the left. Large iron wagon-wheel shapes have been mounted in several places to clearly mark the shallow depressions in the grassy slope. Two sets of four wheels are off to your left and two more sets are off to the right.",

    "audioDescription": "At the side of the entrance road is a wayside sign titled \"Ruts, Swales and Traces.\" A shallow depression can be seen extending away on either side of the road at this point. Narrow white posts, labeled \"California Trail\" and \"Oregon Trail\" are widely spaced along the swale.<br /><br />Text on the sign reads, \"As many as 350,000 people and tens of thousands of covered wagons traveled the Oregon Trail between 1840 and 1870. Countless feet, hooves, and iron-rimmed wheels cut and compacted the ground, leaving lasting traces still visible on many western landscapes.<br /><br />Migrants preferred sturdy farm wagons, roughly half the size of a Conestoga to carry what possessions and supplies would fit. The wagon box was about four feet wide, three feet deep and 10 to 12 feet long. The covered box sat over two pairs of wheels of different sizes: front wheels about 44 inches in diameter, and rear wheels about 50 inches in diameter.<br /><br />The narrow iron rims on the wheels, pressed into the earth by the weight of the wagon and its 1600 to 1800 pound load, left a visible legacy across the landscape. In places, faint two-track depressions provide evidence where wagons once rolled across mostly level ground.<br /><br />Elsewhere are deeper depression with sloping sides, called swales. Swales are often found on slopes and at the crests of hills, where the oxen dug in their hooves and strained to pull their heavy load. In wide open places, visitors to the old Oregon Trail might see two, three or more side-by-side lines of depressions, swales, ruts, tracks or scars. These multiple traces were created wherever wagons could spread out across the landscape to pass other parties or just to escape the choking dust kicked up by those ahead.\"<br /><br />More text on the right reads, \"The best wheels were made of well-seasoned, durable hardwoods such as white oak or Osage orange. The wooden rim, or â€˜felloes,' could be made by steaming and bending wood to form a circle. The wheelwright selected an iron hoop somewhat smaller than the wooden wheel and heated it at a forge. As it heated, the hoop expanded. The hot band of iron was hammered snugly around the rim and set aside to cool and shrink. The powerful grip of the finished iron tire held the wheel securely together and protected it from rocks, grinding sand, and other hazards of the road.\"<br /><br />Past the sign and the swale, the road leads to a parking lot at the edge of the river. There is a small boat launch, picnic tables and pavilions, a restroom and children's playground. The river here is smooth and broad with low hills rising on the far side behind grassy rangeland.",

    "audioDescription": "The sandy dirt parking area sits in the middle of this grassy park. Between the parking lot and the highway is a berm topped by a covered wagon with a pair of replica oxen, slightly smaller than life size. A short sidewalk leads from the parking area to the base of the berm where there are four wayside signs and a metal box on a post which holds a sign-in register. As you face the berm from the parking area, the dirt road makes a small loop to your right around a flagpole. To the right of the loop is a small picnic pavilion. Past the lop, near the edge of a wooded area in a white building with restrooms, women to the left and men to the right.<br /><br />Behind you is another wayside sign in front of small plots of vegetation. The sign is almost illegible, but it tells us that the plantings represent native prairie vegetation including wild flowers, western wheat grass, side oats gama little blue stem, switch grass, big blue stem and indian grass.<br /><br />Near the entrance from the highway is a large wagon wheel with letters that read Oregon Trail Park. On the right as you enter is a small sign that reads, \"Scott Spring. The reservoir before you taps into the famous Scott Spring. The original outlet emanates from the base of a steep rock hill to the east. The refreshing water of Scott Spring offered abundant drinking water to many travelers on the Oregon Trail and became an inviting camp site on their long journey. The spring currently waters livestock and feeds Rock Creek just as it did so many years ago.\"<br /><br />The first two waysides near the left end of the berm are titled The Long Journey and One Step at a Time. The next one is titled, \"The Wagon and Team - Supplies Needed.\" It tells us that a typical wagon and cover would cost $185. It also tells us that oxen were often preferred over mules because they were much gentler, steadier and in case of dire need could be eaten. Supplies included 1060 pounds of flour, 700 pounds of bacon, 150 pounds of sugar and 75 pounds of rice. One wagon could hold up to 2400 pounds.<br /><br />The last sign, titled Route of the Oregon Trail, tells us that of the 300,000 or so emigrants who followed the trails, about 30,000 died along the way. A nearby monument marks the grave of a child at the Scott Spring campsite and other graves have been found in the woods.",

Before 1851, pioneers used Robidoux Pass since the badlands between the river and the bluff made travel impossible. Nine miles south of Scotts Bluff, the pass offered a spring and a trading post operated by the Robidoux brothers.</p>   <p>In 1851, Mitchell Pass was opened and became the main route for the emigrants (pioneers heading west).<br /> <br /> In 1851, William Lobenstine wrote in his journal:</p> <p><em>\"The rock itself is separated nearly at it's middle, having a pass here fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending at both sides perpendicular to a height of three to four hundred feet.</em></p> <p><em>The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is now preferred by nearly all emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight miles from the old road.\"</em></p> <p>Mitchell Pass, known during the 1850's as \"Devil's Gap\" became the principle route of the military, pony express and the telegraph. Mitchell Pass was named after United States Brigadier General Robert B. Mitchell.</p> <p>The covered wagons in front of the Scotts Bluff National Monument administrative building mark the start of the Oregon Trail Pathway. The smaller Studebaker and Murphy wagons were the mode of transportation for families. The larger Conestoga wagon was not often used on the Oregon Trail, but was used to haul freight. Living history demonstrations occur at the Murphy wagon during the summer.</p> <p>When the trail surface changes from asphalt to dirt, you are walking \"on\" the actual Oregon Trail. Today, after over 150 years of erosion of the soft rocks, individual wheel ruts are not visible. What is visible is called a \"swale,\" which is a deep roadbed that was created by wagons traveling single file through Mitchell Pass.</p> <p>After crossing Mitchell Pass, the trail becomes paved again, and the Oregon Trail's path is marked by wooden posts in the trail's center. Near the end of the hiking trail is the site where William Henry Jackson camped and sketched while working as a bullwhacker on a wagon train in 1866.</p>",

Going left, it leads to a semicircular area bounded by a low stone wall with a wayside sign, titled \"Prairie Highway.\" An illustration shows a large covered wagon pulled by oxen. The sign reads in part, \"Over 100 years ago, the gentle grassy depression in front of you was one of the most important highways in North America. Here, you'd see wagon trains on the Santa Fe Trail winding through a rolling landscape covered with thick, waist-high prairie grasses. Imagine thousands of trade wagons rumbling and creaking back and forth between Missouri and New Mexico. Wagons - and the hooves of the oxen and mules that pulled them - wore this road into the earth. By the 1840s, emigrants bound for Oregon and California Trails wore it even deeper. Here, the prairie is gone. Wind and rain have smoothed the rough dirt road into a gentle swale - a subtle reminder of a once-great highway.\"<br /><br />By moving around the stone wall and walking out onto the grassy lawn you may be able to feel the swale that crosses from left to right, although it is very shallow. About 40 feet out, on the other side of the swale, is a cement post with a small marker for the Santa Fe Trail.",

While crossing the Platte River, he became chilled and exhausted when he swam the river in an effort to keep the families stock animals from being carried downstream.

    "audioDescription": "Rattlesnake Pass. 250 words<br /><br />A narrow, abandoned, broken paved road goes through the pass here south of Devil's Gate, curving around the end of a granite ridge on the north side. Some of the boulders are close to the edge of the road and emigrant inscriptions can be seen carved in the rock. On the south side of the road is a pioneer grave enclosed by a metal fence. One large stone sits at the end with carvings on it and the grave itself is piled with stones. At the west end of the enclosure is a wooden post with a crosspiece, forming a rough cross. At the other end a sign tells us that the grave of Frederick Richard Fulkerson was noted by forty-niner J.G. Bluff on July 26, 1849, as he traveled through what he termed \"Pass of the Rattlesnake Mountain to the left of Devil's Gate.\" The survival of the large granite boulder used as the Fulkerson headstone and the sketch made by Bluff allows us to locate this grave precisely. It goes on to tell us that the current carving on the boulder, which reads, T.P. Baker, 1864, is believed to be the graffiti of a passing traveler. Baker, whoever he was, left another, nearly identical, inscription on a rock face a half-mile farther on at the bank of the river.<br /><br />Looking both ways through the pass from the graveside, you can see the narrow, white post markers indicating the historic trace of the Oregon Trail.",

The vertical cliff face has clear horizontal layers, some thick and a couple in pinkish tan very thin. In places the mud nests of cliff swallows are clustered. <br /><br />A gravel path runs along the foot of the cliff. Going right, it leads past a pioneer cemetery surround by a stone wall topped with the palings. Old broken gravestones can be seen through the fence. At the far end of the cemetery is a small building housing restrooms. <br /><br />To the left, the path extends to the end of the cliff and then follows as it curves away from us. At the point where the path reaches the far end of the parking lot, there is a large brown sign discussing the cliff markings on the left. It tells us that, although now eroded, dates as early as 1829 and even one from 1797, were once visible and judged to be authentic. At one time Indian pictographs and petroglyphs were also visible.<br /><br />A few yards farther on the right side of the path is a covered kiosk with three large signs. They are titled \"Trail Register,\" \"Register Cliff State Historic Site,\" and \"Homesteaders.\" The last sign explains that a short tunnel blasted out of the base of the cliff, visible to the right of the sign with its entrance protected by a fence, was used as a root cellar by local settlers.<br /><br />Close by is a stone slab monument with two metal plaques on its face. The one on top, about 3 feet up, is circular with a relief carving of a covered wagon and a team of oxen and reads, \"Oregon Trail Memorial.\" Feel free to touch. Below that is another plaque which reads, \"Dedicated to the pioneers of Wyoming. Register Cliff, acquired by the State of Wyoming through gift of the Henry Frederick family, 1932.\"<br /><br />Farther down the path, where the cliff face begins to curve away from you, a side path leads closer to the base of the cliff to a chain-link fence which protects this section of the cliff. Here are some of the oldest carvings, both large and small. Dates easily seen range from 1852 and 1859 to 1928. From this area, a narrow rock trail leads back closer to the cliff base up a small rise to a small lookout with a bench.<br /><br />The main path continues around the end of the cliff where additional carvings, still protected by the metal fencing, can be seen.",

    "bodyText": "<h2>History of Robidoux Pass</h2> <p>The earliest travelers to use Robidoux Pass were probably trappers, traders and missionaries who took their pack trains up the North Platte River to the Rocky Mountains in the 1820’s. In 1830, wagons of fur trading cavavans were the first to use the pass and reach the Rocky Mountains, showing the way for the thousands of emigrant wagons to follow. The first wagon train through the pass was the Bidwell-Bartleson Party in 1841. Despite its water and wood, overland travelers were never satisfied with Robidoux Pass because it took them so far away from the North Platte River. A second gap in the bluffs, today called “Mitchell Pass”, skirted the base of the highest promontory and lay closer to the river. Historian Merrill Mathes noted, <em>“Up to and including 1850, the Robidoux Pass route was used almost exclusively by the successive waves of fur traders, missionary parties, soldiers and emigrants. In the year 1851, travel was about equally divided between the two routes. From 1852 onward, Mitchell Pass was heavily favored, although Robidoux Pass was occasionally used.”</em></p> <h3>Who was Robidoux?</h3> <p>Although all the facts are not fully established, it appears that he was Joseph E. Robidoux, oldest son of the Joseph Robidoux who founded St. Joseph, MO. The other “Frenchman” seen there was his uncle, Antoine Robidoux, who earlier achieved pioneering fame in Utah and California. The younger Joseph may well have been the Robidoux who led the first American Fur Company contingent by Scotts Bluff in 1830.</p> <h3>Old Robidoux Pass</h3> <p>Robidoux Pass is a gap passing through the Wildcat Hills about 9 miles west of Gering, Nebraska. The Pass was the route of the Oregon/California Trail from 1841 through 1850. After 1850, the route passed through Mitchell Pass at Scotts Bluff National Monument. Robidoux Pass has an elevation of 4,554 feet.To use Robidoux Pass, travelers had to swing south away from the North Platte River and proceed nearly 30 miles before they rejoined the river near Horse Creek. Fortunately, springs and nearby cedar trees in the pass provided water and wood for their journey.</p> <h3>Robidoux Trading Posts</h3> <p>The trading post at Robidoux Pass was established by either Joseph or Antoine Robidoux. Traders at this post exchanged goods with Indians for beaver skins and buffalo hides. The post also held a temporary monopoly in providing provisions and services to overland travelers and had a blacksmith shop on site that offered emigrants an opportunity to make repairs to trail-damaged wagons and tend footsore oxen and mules. <br /> <br /> There was a second Robidoux Trading Post located in Carter Canyon. It was inhabited by Antonie Robidoux, his Native American wife, and their 5 children. Other trading posts are known to have existed near the pass at the same time as the Robidoux Trading Post. One such trading post was owned by the American Fur Company. Following the opening of Mitchell Pass in 1851, which provided a shorter trail, Robidoux Pass and the trading posts fell into disuse.</p> <h3>What became of Joseph Robidoux?</h3> <p>Joseph E. Robidoux was reported to have died accidentally at Scotts Bluff, but no grave has been identified. There is evidence that he returned to the Great Nemaha Indian Agency in northern Kansas in the late 1850’s and died in obscurity. It is also thought that Antoine Robidoux died in 1860 in St. Louis, Missouri.</p> <h3>Robidoux Pass Today</h3> <p>Today, none of the historic buildings remain at Robidoux Pass. White posts mark the original route of the emigrant trail. Early accounts of the trip through this area note several burials at the site, two of which can still be seen today, including the “Dunn” grave, one of only 7 marked burial sites along the Oregon Trail. Tools, wagon implements, bullets, and other materials have also been found in this area. After the Mitchell Pass route was improved, the Robidoux Pass route faded into obscurity; it was too far out of the way and too far from the water source of the North Platte River.</p> <h3>How To Get There</h3> <p>Today, Robidoux Pass lies on private property, but is still accessible by the general public who are encouraged to respect the wishes and rights of the owners. A gravel road one mile south of the intersection of Five Rocks Road and Old Oregon Trail leads to the site of the old trading post described by a historical marker.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Schumacher Park. 386 words<br /><br />From the parking area along the side of the street you face a large, pink granite marker enclosed by a black metal fence. The marker reads, \"Santa Fe Trail, 1821 - 1872, Marker by the Daughters of the American Revolution and the State of Missouri, 1909.\"<br /><br />Slightly to the right of that, a large stone sign, place perpendicular to the street reads, \"Santa Fe National Historic Trail, Schumacher Park.\" Below that are the three logos for the trails, each shaped like a rounded, equilateral triangle. The one for the Santa Fe Trail shows a covered wagon pulled by a team of 6 oxen. The one for the Oregon Trail shows just a covered wagon. The one for the California Trail shows a yoke for oxen with the curved top bar and two \"U\"-shaped extensions below.<br /><br />To the left of the fenced area a broad, cement sidewalk leads into the park, then curves behind the fencing. Behind the marker, another walkway leads back to a large covered pavilion, about 20 feet wide and 35 feet deep. The front half of this area has picnic tables, two on either side. Along the sides at the rear of the pavilion are 4 waysides signs. One titled \"The Capitalists\" discusses trade and merchantmen. The next is titled \"Los Capitalistas\" and discusses the traders and merchants at the New Mexico end of the Santa Fe Trail. Another is titled \"Bias and Business\" and covers the role of women, American Indians and slaves in trade. The last panel is titled \"Cultures in Collision\" and discusses the impact of the many trail travelers on native populations.<br /><br />The rear of the park property is covered with native prairie plantings -- tall and medium grasses and a variety of wildflowers.<br /><br />On either side of the sidewalk behind the stone marker are two more waysides, one discussing the three trails that passed through this region and the other discussing the role of the Daughters of the American Revolution or DAR in locating and marking the original route of the Santa Fe Trail.<br /><br />From the fenced area, the sidewalk leads another 50 yards to the right to one final wayside sign which discusses the disappearance of trail remnants due to modern development and the use of maps and aerial photographs to identify the routes.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The bluffs of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/scbl/index.htm\">Scotts Bluff National Monument</a> rise directly from the North Platte River, blocking wagon travel along the river's south bank. At first, emigrants had to take a detour south and use Robidoux Pass, a natural gateway, to get through the bluffs. This mostly stopped in 1850 when a new route was opened at Mitchell Pass. Located close to the North Platte River, this route saved emigrants nearly 15 miles of travel. The route, though, was narrow, due to the land's geography. As such, more than 300,000 emigrants, and their wagons and livestock, had to travel on the same strip of land. Eventually, deep ruts formed as a result of this traffic. These ruts are still visible today and are now a part of Scotts Bluff National Monument. A section of them has been developed into a walking trail with interpretive waysides.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>In 1845, General Philip St. George Cooke marveled at the strange formation that rose before him.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Looming afar over river and plain was 'Scott's Bluff,' a Nebraska Gibralter; surmounted by a colossal fortress and a royal castle, it jutted on the water. . . . This morning marched three miles still nearer to that mysterious mountain . . . without being disenchanted of its colossal ruins and phantom occupants.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Three miles west of Gering, Nebraska on Old Oregon Trail (Highway 92 West))</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/oregon-trail-pathway.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",
    "audioDescription": "To reach the walking trail, cross the access road at the left of the visitor center. The sidewalk on the other side leads back to the left towards the highway and then turns right to parallel the highway. Once past the curve, there are four reproductions of different style emigrant vehicles along the right side of the sidewalk as well as several wayside signs. Please feel free to touch any of the vehicles. To the left, on the other side of the road are more bluffs, layered in tan and brown. A cylindrical feature sits on top of the bluff nearest to the road.<br /><br />The first emigrant vehicle along the sidewalk, located about where the surface changes from smooth cement to a rougher aggregate, is a handcart. It has a small, square structure sitting directly over the two large wagon wheels with simple poles and a crosspiece extending in front for pulling it.<br /><br />A wayside sign near the handcart asks which route would you take? Before 1851, many emigrants took a long detour to the south through Robidoux Pass. Later a one-wagon wide trail was created through the ravines of these bluffs here at Mitchell Pass.<br /><br />Next is a common wagon, green in color with off-white canvas stretched on the overhead hoops. The rear wheels are larger than those in the front. The next wagon is very similar, this one painted white.<br /><br />The final wagon is larger, painted pale blue. The wagon bottom is slightly curved to the middle and the front and rear ends are angled outward. This one has a team of model oxen in front, wearing wooden yokes with chains running back to the tongue of the wagon.<br /><br />Past the last wagon, the sidewalk changes to a dirt and gravel path. A wayside sign here tells us that traffic went both ways through the pass. Fur traders traveled both directions, but some of the emigrants gave up and turned back eastward. Others returned to bring other family members out west. Traders drove massive freight wagons in both directions and Army units rode both ways as they patrolled the route.<br /><br />The trail continues around the base of Scotts Bluff, the flat end rising high above you on the right. Meadow vegetation lines the path along with earthen and rocky outcroppings. The path may be rough and uneven in places. More waysides at the end of the trail talk about how emigrants might get assistance along the trail and one shows a painting by William Henry Jackson that depicts the view of the trail looking back eastward through the pass, matching the current location of the sign.",

    "audioDescription": "Shawnee Indian Mission State Historic Site. 411 words<br /><br />This site has three historic, red-brick buildings and several smaller structures on both sides of the street. A stone sign near the entrance to the parking lot reads \"Shawnee Indian Mission\" and directly across the street is a stone marker proclaiming this as a state historic site. Another marker identifies this as a Registered National Historic Landmark. The buildings sit on grassy lawns with scattered trees. Some of the tree are black walnuts with their large round fruits on the ground underneath.<br /><br />One building is right next to the parking lot. A sign on the far side tells us that this is the East Building, erected in 1840-41, which \"provided a chapel and classrooms, and living quarters for the teachers. Indian boys slept in the attic. The first territorial legislature met here in 1855 and enacted the so-called Bogus Laws in an attempt to perpetuate slavery in Kansas.\" To the left of the building at the far end of the parking lot is a plot of land enclosed by split-rail fencing with several historic wooden buildings. Also at that end of the building, out in the middle of the lawn sits a covered wagon. Feel free to touch this exhibit.<br /><br />A sidewalk leads from the end of the East Building nearest the street which crosses a stream via a small wooden bridge and leads to the West Building. This building also has two stories and has a wing extending towards the rear. The wing has a second story porch enclosed by white railings and reached by an outside stairway next to the main building. A sign in front of this building tells us that \"This is the oldest of the three mission buildings now standing. Built in 1839 it was used for classrooms and living quarters for superintendents and teachers. Territorial officials had offices and rooms here in 1854-1856.\"<br /><br />At the front left corner of this building is a garden of native plants. Behind it is a small vegetable garden enclosed by a 4-foot-high wooden fence. <br /><br />The other building sits on the other side of the street. Also two stories, it has a two-story porch along the front with outside stairways leading up from either end. A sign tells us that \"This building, erected in 1845, was the dormitory and school for Indian girls. Here they were taught spinning, weaving, and other domestic arts. Andrew H. Reeder, first territorial governor of Kansas, had executive offices here.\"",

Cement posts, one to the east along the dirt road and one to the west, mark the path of the Oregon Trail. To the north a distant mountain range can be seen. To the west is the slanted end of a butte, which extends away to the south. Another butte is visible in the distant south.<br /><br />The sign at the intersection reads, \"To the south stand the Oregon Buttes, a major trail landmark. The name is significant because the buttes were roughly the beginning of the Oregon Territory and also helped keep emigrants encouraged, even though there were still hundreds of miles of rough going ahead. Today the Oregon Buttes are an Area of Critical Environmental Concern because of their cultural significance and important wildlife values. <br /><br />\"About twelve miles to the southwest of Oregon Buttes is the Tri-Territory site. This site is the location where the Oregon Territory, Mexican Territory and Louisiana Purchase had a common border. The large landmark, just to the south of where you are standing, is Pacific Butte. The great height and mass of the butte, combined with a ridge to the north paralleling the emigrant trails, helps to create a visual channel through which travelers migrated on their way through South Pass.\"<br /><br />Following the dirt road to the west leads to another wayside sign and a fenced area with two stone markers. Parallel wagon swales are barely discernable through the sagebrush on both sides of the road. The sign tells us the South Pass was first discovered in 1812. Bonneville took the first wagons over the pass in 1832 and Fremont widely publicized the route after his expedition in 1842. Thousands of Mormons, future Oregonians and Californians would use the trail in the following twenty years.<br /><br />The two stone markers are on the north side of the dirt road. The larger one is a five-foot tall rock slab, reddish-tan in color, roughly rectangular with carved lettering that reads, \"Old Oregon Trail, 1843-57.\" The other stone slab marker is about 3 feet tall and is charcoal gray. It reads, \"Narcissa Prentiss Whitman, Eliza Hart Spalding, First white women to cross this pass, July 4, 1836.\"",

Wayside signs are spaced along the walkway. To the southeast lies the long flat ridgetop of Pacific Butte, as identified by a map on one of the signs. Directly south are the more distant peaks of Oregon Buttes. Turning back to the northeast, the southern end of the Wind River mountain range is visible in the distance. In all directions, as far as the eye can see, the land is covered with short sagebrush, prairie vegetation.<br /><br />The wayside signs cover such topics as the path of the trails west of this point, the role of South Pass as a corridor westward, and the fur trade.<br /><br />One sign has a drawing of the landscape, labeling the prominent features. It reads, \"South Pass, on top of the world. From where you're standing South Pass doesn't look all that remarkable. But compared to the rugged Wind River Mountains, it can easily be recognized as a type of gateway. Nevertheless, crossing the Continental Divide into 'Oregon Country' was a task for all westward-bound travelers and many described their feelings about the event. In 1852 Lucy Rutledge Cooke, a young woman with 'California Fever' wrote, 'This morn we arrived at the South Pass after which all rivers we see will be running to the Pacific.'\"",

Several wayside signs are located along the path. <br /><br />One tells us that Split Rock was a well-known trail landmark and navigation aid. Emigrants were guided by the rock for an entire day's travel from the east and it remained in view behind them for another two days. Travel time from here to South Pass was about 6 days. The granite rocks seen in front of you are the side view of Split Rock. Photographs on the sign show the view of the notch from the trail, which passes east of this location. One picture shows a pair of ruts running away from you into the distance. At the upper right is a flat-topped granite hill. On the left side of the flat ridge, is a notch, almost a perfect \"V\" shape.<br /><br />Other signs discuss the Pony Express, wild horses in the west, and the westward trails.

Twenty-four miles of the 300-mile-long wagon route skirt through the northern edge of the park. Most of the original route in the park remains intact, with about 19 miles established as hiking trails. Nature has narrowed much of the trail, but faint wagon ruts are still visible in some locations. A cut through the forest across the road from this spot is one section of the route in the park.<br /> <br /> William H. Nobles created the Nobles Trail in 1852 when he joined the Gold Rush to California. The route was generally considered the easiest route into California. Pioneers traveled the route up until 1869 when the completion of the Central Pacific Railroad offered a new and easier method of travel.</p>",

Emigrants who used the Oregon Trail settled in numerous places, including throughout Nebraska. This amount grew as land was increasingly claimed in Oregon. Soon, towns formed along the Trail in several locations and they used the Oregon Trail for local transportation.<br /> <br /> As time passed in this part of Nebraska, trains replaced wagons and parts of the Oregon Trail became a railroad. Later still, automobiles replaced trains and the Oregon Trail became a road. First, it was the rugged Lincoln Highway and then it was further developed and turned into today's Interstate 80.<br /> <br /> The Archway tells this story of 170 years of westward movement with detailed displays, family activities, education programs, and more.

    "audioDescription": "The Archway. 382 words<br /><br />From the parking lot the arched building can be seen extending over the Interstate highway with squat, square towers at either end. The entrance building extends out in front of the tower, with wings on either side. The building is made of large, horizontal logs with light-colored caulking. Broad stone pillars anchor the corners of the lobby and of the wings. The structure is covered with a green metal roof. On top of each of the towers is a gleaming metal sculpture of a leaping horse with huge, fan-shaped wings. <br /><br />Between the building and the parking lot is a fort structure containing a maze. Continuing past that is a large sculpture of a bison by Nebraska artist Gary Ginther. Feel free to touch. In front of the entrance is another sculpture, this one surrounded by a chain fence. The sculpture is of two boys on horseback in full gallop, their bodies pinned together by an arrow. A nearby sign tells us that this work was commissioned by Fred A. Bosselman and sculpted by David L. Biehl in 2011. Titled \"A Narrow Escape,\" it depicts the Martin brothers running from an Indian attack. Both boys survived.<br /><br />In front of the sculpture a circular garden surrounds a flagpole. There are benches along the sidewalk around the garden area. Beyond that, on the other side of the entrance road, is an iron foot bridge over a narrow lake. There are more exhibits and a walking path on the other side.<br /><br />At the right end of the building is an old sign for the Hammer Motel. A wayside sign along the sidewalk there tells us about the Lincoln Highway, an ambitious project to create a highway from coast to coast in the early 1900s. The Hammer Motel was one of the motels that grew up along the highway.<br /><br />The building entrance leads into a large two-story lobby paved with flagstones. To the left is a dining area. Directly ahead is an escalator leading up to the exhibits in the arch itself. Costumed docents are stationed there to take tickets and provide information. To the right is a large gift shop where tickets may be purchased. There are benches along the wall on either side of the entrance doors.",

Two steps lead up to the large pavilion covered with a green metal roof. Three rows of picnic tables fill the area.<br /><br />To your left, a paved trail wanders long the lake. A nearby sign has a map that shows how this trail connects with a network of trails through and around the City of Kearny. There are several wayside signs and exhibits as well as benches along this section near the Archway.<br /><br />First along the right side of the trail are flat metal sculptures of an adult bison with a calf. Feel free to touch. The wayside sign, titled \"Fate of the American Bison,\" tells of the intense hunting that reduced the number of bison from as many as 60 million to only 541 animals in 1887. Today, living on preserves and ranches, the bison numbers have increased to about 200,000. On the left side of the sidewalk are more bison statues. These are made of open metal mesh.<br /><br />Farther down the trail on the right is a path that leads to a Pawnee Earth Lodge. A sign on the far side of the bridge tells us that the lodge was built in 2010 by members of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nations from North Dakota and the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma. About the size of a small house, the lodge is a circular mound of earth, now covered with vegetation. Here and there an underlying wood beam can be seen. The entrance tunnel is made of vertical poles topped with a log roof. The entrance is closed with a metal gate.<br /><br />Past the lodge on the tail is a wayside sign titled \"The Never-Ending Line.\" It describes the conflicts between settlers and Indians did not end until the Sioux, Cheyenne and Pawnee peoples were forced onto reservations in the 1870s. <br /><br />The last exhibit along this trail section is a reproduction of a one-room sod house. The sign on the other end of the bridge tells us that the 224 blocks for the house were made from nine parts dirt and one part Portland Cement. The roof includes 37 saplings, 8 split Nebraska Red Cedar logs and 10 inches of soil. One sign at the right side of the path leading to the house discusses life in a sod house. On the other side, another sign explains how a sod house was made. <br /><br />The entrance to the house is closed with a metal gate.

Mormon tradition holds that when Brigham Young first gazed on the valley from this vicinity on July 24, 1847, he experienced a heavenly vision that led him to declare, “It is enough. This is the right place.” Inside the 450-acre park is the National Pony Express Monument with a replica Pony Express station, a dramatic Avard Fairbanks sculpture of a relay rider changing horses, and several interpretive wayside exhibits. Statuary Walk east of the Pony Express monument includes other sculptures and the 60-foot high This Is the Place Monument, with bronze figures of Brigham Young and other early church leaders.<br /> <br /> Around the monument base are <em>bas relief </em>depictions of significant figures in Utah history. Beyond the nearby visitor center is Heritage Village, a reconstructed village of original pioneer-era buildings where costumed docents and historical interpreters share history and demonstrate early crafts and trades. Young visitors can ride ponies and trains, make crafts, and pet farm animals here.<br /> <br /> This Is the Place Heritage Park, near the location where Brigham Young first surveyed the valley in July 1847, represents the Mormon arrival. But as the City of the Saints grew from a rustic frontier village to a bustling territorial capital, many California-bound travelers paused here for a layover to rest, re-supply, or spend the winter — or, as in the case of English adventurer Sir Richard Burton, to satisfy their curiosity about Brigham Young and the Mormons.

The building itself was designed and built by the National Parks Service as a center of exploration in 1997. Here, visitors have the opportunity to retrace the steps of pioneers who came after Lewis and Clark, walking not only the trail blazed by the two intrepid explorers but also the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Mormon Trail.<br /> <br /> Exhibits include sculptures by Timothy Woodman, photos, maps, and quotes pertaining to the trails and America's history of Westward Expansion. Outdoor picnic areas offer a tranquil place to enjoy the sunshine and scenery. Walking and biking paths wind through 400 acres of prairie along the scenic Missouri River, offering a glimpse into what the two explorers and the Corps of Discovery observed more than 200 years ago. <br /> <br /> Admission is free. School and group tours are available, but require advance scheduling by calling the center at (712) 366-4900. Visitors are also encouraged to check the center's website and calendar for upcoming events at https://iowaculture.gov/history/sites/western-historic-trails-center. ",

    "audioDescription": "Wieduwilt Swales (85th and Manchester \"Three Trails\" Trail Segment). 481 words<br /><br />This site is located at the intersection of two quiet city streets. The corner plot of land is grass covered with scattered trees, including black walnut trees with their large fruits under foot. Under the shade of a large oak tree a brown sign reads, \"Wieduwilt Swales, Santa Fe, Oregon, California National Historic Trails.\" To the left of that is a wayside sign and still further to the left a concrete marker post. A small green sign on the post reads, \"This site contains the original swales created during the 19th century by the many wagons, pack animals and travelers on the Santa Fe, Oregon and California National Historic Trails.\"<br /><br />About 35 feet beyond the cement post is a broad, grassy swale or trough, about 3 feet deep and 40 feet wide. It winds its way up the gentle slope to your right and crosses in front of you, disappearing to your left.<br /><br />The wayside sign has an image of a covered wagon being pulled by a team of six oxen, its wheels moving in two ruts on a trail through tall grasses. Text tells us that \"thousands of wagon wheels, animal hooves and human feet once passed this way, creating the deep depression in front of you. This swale, now worn by erosion, is grassed-over evidence of three trails once connecting frontier Missouri to distant lands. In the mid-1800s, caravans moving through here hauled freight between Missouri and Santa Fe. Overland emigrants followed, headed for Oregon's farmlands or California's gold fields. This swale, evidence of past trail use, is one of the few known in the greater Kansas City area. During some years, wet and muddy conditions on the trails led to frustrating delays, yet memorable experiences.\"<br /><br />At the bottom of the sign are two contemporary accounts. The first reads, \"Amid the fiercest storm I have yet witnessed on the trip, I encamped last night with a party of â€˜our folks'; and though I was literally soaked through when I arose in the morning from my grassy couch, I never slept more profoundly, nor experienced healthier feeling. Favored with pleasanter weather, we continued, after breakfast, our ride to the plains. - George L. Curry, May 1846, writing near this spot.\"<br /><br />The second reads, \"The first day we got but 3 miles from town with half our wagons, the other half we left mired in devious and sundry mudholes strung along for a mile behind. On Sunday morning we started and got on pretty well until dark overtook us at Mr. Barne's place 8 miles from town where we encamped and placed our animals all in his pasture. It commenced pouring down rain soon after dark and the next morning the roads were so slippery and muddy that we could not stir until about 12 o'clock. - William H. Glasgow, June 1846, writing near this site.\"",

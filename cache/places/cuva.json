The railway opened in 1880 to connect the coal fields of central Ohio to the industrial centers of Canton, Akron, and Cleveland. Building the Valley Railway was a test of local perseverance. By the 1880s, railroads were some of the largest corporations in America. Yet, despite financial troubles and construction difficulties, the Valley Railway emerged independent of other railroads. Shaped by the influence of David L. King, an Akron attorney and businessman, the Valley Railway became a partnership among the three cities it served.<br /> <br /> Riders on the scenic railroad see a pastoral landscape similar to what passengers saw along the same route a century ago.

    "audioDescription": "Akron Northside Station. 450 words The rail station is a long, rectangular covered platform with a wall at each end and a small office in the middle. Posts along each side support the shingled roof. Back-to-back, wooden benches extend on either side of the office. The 20-foot-wide floor is made of wood boards and the structure is painted a creamy yellow. There is a parking lot at both ends of the station. The train tracks lie on one side of the station. On the other side, a concrete drive connects with the street. Multi-story buildings are on the other side of the street with hotels, restaurants, and shopping areas. Graphic panels are hung on the inside of the end walls. At one end is a panel titled “Ride the Rails” which explains that the first steam engine in the valley began running in 1880 connecting the mineral fields in the south to the factories in the north. Today the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad follows much of the same route. Yellow paint on a station signifies a modern building. Historical depots are painted red. The panel shows a map of the rail line through the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The railroad and the Towpath Trail both follow the Cuyahoga River through the park. At the same end of the station is a panel titled “Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.” Text on the panel lists nearby activities and attractions such as Mustill Store (a canal-era grocery store now the focal point of Cascade Locks Park) and the Akron Art Museum. Photographs of these places extend down the right side of the panel. The wall at the other end has two graphic panels. One is titled “Creating the Valley Railway.” Text on the panel explains that the Valley Railway was a test of local perseverance. A partnership among Cleveland, Akron, and Canton, each community pledged to raise funds. Difficulties with contractors delayed the project which finally made its inaugural ride on January 28, 1880. Despite financial and construction difficulties, the railway remained independent at a time when railroads were some of the largest corporations in America. The other panel is titled “Consolidation and New Beginnings.” It explains that the Valley Railway’s independence did not last. In 1890, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad acquired controlling interest in the railway. By 1895, after reorganization, the Valley Railway no longer existed. Just as railroads signaled a decline in the use of canals for transportation, automobiles and trucks posed a similar challenge to railroads, ending commercial use of the railway by the 1980s. The Cuyahoga Valley Preservation and Scenic Railway Association began offering excursions in 1975. Today the scenic railroad continues in partnership with the National Park Service.

If you can capture that energy with a waterwheel, you can use it to grind grain and make a living. About 1853, the Alexander family built a grist mill here. In time, they replaced the waterwheel with more efficient turbines. Around 1900, the Alexanders sold the business to the Wilsons. After 70 years of using waterpower, the Wilsons switched to electric motors. Today, the family sells pre-bagged feed and fertilizer. Crank the handle on the audio player to hear “Skip” Wilson talk about the mill’s history.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Alexander/Wilson Mill. 453 words. Across the canal from this wayside graphic panel is a group of white, frame buildings. A long, low building with a metal roof lies alongside the canal. Beyond that are two taller buildings, both with green metal roofs. The one at the left lies parallel to the canal and has a small cupola with a flag on top; the other sits perpendicular to it. On the other side of the buildings is the scenic byway. A gravel parking lot lies to the right of the group of buildings with palettes of sacks stacked along the edge. Behind the buildings, to the left, a shallow spillway diverts excess water around Lock 37. Text on the panel reads, “Adapting with the Times. For generations, two families have made their livelihoods in the gristmill at Lock 37. The Alexander family built the mill about 1853 to grind wheat into flour. Water from Lock 37’s spillway turned the mill’s wooden waterwheel and grindstones. In the late 1800s the family replaced the waterwheel with smaller and more efficient turbines. The Wilson family bought the mill about 1900 and focused on milling feed for farm animals. They used water power until 1970, when they switched to electric machinery. Now their business consists mostly of animal food and fertilizer already bagged by suppliers.” The background of the panel features an 1890 colorized image of boat crew families stopping at Alexander Mill during a Sunday excursion. The image shows a long boat in the canal with the white mill building behind. The boat has cabins at the front and rear, with a flat deck in the middle. A woman, three men and three girls stand or sit on the boat. At the lower left is a black and white photograph of a man wearing work clothes and a billed cap lifting a cloth bag over a large, square funnel. The caption reads, “Thomas G. Wilson at work in the mill in 1940. Listen to his grandson “Skip” on the nearby audio station.” To the left of the graphic panel is a metal post with four push buttons on top. A small panel reads, “Life Along the Canal. “Skip” Wilson grew up in his family’s feed mill across the canal. Listen to him describe his experience, buttons 1-3. While traveling by canal boat in 1838, William Case wrote a funny journal entry. Was the incident here at Lock 37? Button 4.” The buttons are labeled: 1, The Finest Bread Flour, 50 seconds; 2, Swimming in Kernels of Corn, 25 seconds; 3, The Legger Elevator, 40 seconds; and 4, A Hubbub All Night, 60 seconds. The audio is powered by a hand crank on the front of the post. End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Local wildlife watchers eagerly await Valentine’s Day in Cuyahoga Valley. About this time, the first male great blue herons return to Bath Road Heronry, a nesting colony. The females follow. These birds are impressive: four feet tall with seven-foot wingspans. During the breeding season, which lasts through June, they are in peak plumage. Visitors can easily observe the herons performing courtship displays, repairing nests, and raising young high above the passing cars. There is a paved pullout with a wayside exhibit along Bath Road, just east of the Cuyahoga River. The heronry is behind a fence on the south side of the road, on the property of the Akron Water Reclamation Facility. Other heronries in the valley are away from roads and trails. Over time, this heronry has lost some of its nesting trees. Volunteer citizen scientists have been <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/great-blue-herons-in-cuyahoga-valley.htm\">observing our valley heronries</a> for many years.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Bath Road Heronry. 373 words This wayside graphic panel sits at the side of Bath Road. As you face the graphic panel, you are looking over the road to a floodplain forest with scattered tall trees on the other side. Near the tops of many of the trees are large nests in places where the branches fork. Behind you is a thinly forested area. Text on the panel reads, “Treetop Territory. A heronry, like the one across the street, is a nesting area created high in the treetops by great blue herons, ‘Ardea herodias.’ This migratory bird is an impressive and common sight in the Cuyahoga Valley. Males typically return to the heronry in early February to select a nesting site. Females arrive a few weeks later to find a mate. Courtship establishes a season-long bond. Females lay 3 – 7 eggs, which hatch late April or early May. Young birds can be seen in the nests from late May until they fledge in July. “Nests are constructed of twigs and lined with soft material like moss and leaves. As nesting trees have fallen, some herons have built nests along the Cuyahoga River north of Bath Road. The success of nesting colonies in the valley reflects favorable habitat protected by the National Park Service, City of Akron, and other organizations and privative individuals.” The middle of the panel has a photograph of a heron perched on top of a nest. The large mass of twigs is balanced on top of bare, vertical branches. Down the right side of the panel are three drawings of herons: a courting couple exchanging a twig, one perched on a branch, and an adult offering food to a young bird. Captions read, “Courtship displays are important for attracting a mate and maintaining the pair bond. Male herons present sticks to females, reinforcing bonding and territory acceptance. Watch for these displays February through April. “Great blue herons feed primarily on fish and small aquatic animals. They hunt by stealth, standing motionless until stabbing or grabbing prey with their long bill. “The blue heron is call GREAT for good reason. These wading birds stand four feet tall, have a wingspan of nearly seven feet, and weigh between five and eight pounds.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Arrive in the heart of the park by train. Boston Mill Station is a <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a> flag stop. Get off the train to visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Boston Mill Visitor Center</a>, the village of Boston, and nearby trails. Then get back on the train to return to where you started. Alternatively, use the train’s <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/explorer/\">shuttle service</a> to create a combination trail-train adventure.<br /> <br /> As the main visitor center for Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Boston Mill Visitor Center is a great place to get information and learn more about the park. Boston is a pedestrian-friendly community that grew up on both sides of the Cuyahoga River. From Boston, steep and sometimes muddy trails lead to Blue Hen Falls (1.2 miles one-way) and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/brandywine-falls-trailhead.htm\">Brandywine Falls</a> (2.2 miles one-way).<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buckeyetrail.org/\">Buckeye</a>, and <a href=\"https://cuyahogariverwatertrail.org/\">Cuyahoga River Water</a> trails all pass through the village and connect to other train stations in the valley. Bicyclists, runners, hikers, and paddlers can access the train’s one-way shuttle service. Train staff will load your bicycle or kayak in a baggage car.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a> operates on a historic rail line that opened in 1880 as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a>. Before then, Boston had been a canal town. The Valley Railway ushered in a new period of growth. Around 1900, the Cleveland-Akron Bag Company located its factory next to the railroad tracks, shifting the orientation of the community. The company added a store and workers’ residences. Boston Mill Visitor Center now operates in the company store.<br /> <br /> The Valley Railway had a depot in every community along its route through the Cuyahoga Valley, including here in Boston. In 1968, Robert Hunker, a local designer and historic preservationist, purchased the depot. He moved it to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/peninsula-depot.htm\">Peninsula</a> to replace one that had burned.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service built the current boarding station near the site of the original depot. Its architecture is reminiscent of the historic design.<br /> <br /> To reach the visitor center, accessible restrooms, and most locations within Boston, passengers will need to cross the railroad tracks. Walkways from the boarding station lead to the pedestrian crossing.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Boston Mill Station. 458 words This rail station is a rectangular covered platform with a wall at each end. Posts along each side support the shingled roof. Wooden benches sit on either side of the office. The 20-foot-wide floor is made of wood boards and the structure is painted a creamy yellow. The railroad tracks are on the backside of the station. On the far side of the depot is the Cuyahoga River with the village of Boston beyond that. On the near side of the station is the Boston Mill parking lot and beyond that, the scenic byway. Graphic panels are hung on the inside of the end walls. At one end is a panel titled “Ride the Rails” which explains that the first steam engine in the valley began running in 1880 connecting the mineral fields in the south to the factories in the north. Today the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad follows much of the same route. Yellow paint on a station signifies a modern building. Historical depots are painted red. The panel shows a map of the rail line through Cuyahoga Valley National Park, stretching from Rockside Station at the northern end to the Akron Northside Station at the southern end. The Boston Mill Station is near the middle of the park. The railroad and the Towpath Trail both follow the Cuyahoga River through the park. Near that panel is a glass-covered bulletin board with current information about the train and the park. The wall at the other end has two graphic panels. One is titled “Industry Shapes the Valley.” It features a 1915 photograph of the Boston Mill Depot, which was moved to Peninsula in 1968 and now serves as the Peninsula Depot. Text on the panel explains that industry changed the physical appearance and social composition of the valley. In 1900, the Cleveland Akron Bag Company located its factory next to the railroad tracks with a company store and workers houses nearby, changing the orientation of the village to the tracks and the factory. To the north, no village existed at Jaite until the Jaite Paper Mill began operations and erected a general store, boarding house, post office, and homes for some of its workers. The other panel is titled “The Development of Valley Industry.” Text on the panel reads in part, “In 1900, the Cleveland Akron Bag Company began operations in Boston, producing flour sacks and roofing paper until going out of business in 1923. A former employee of that company, Charles Jaite, was responsible for the second paper producer, the Jaite Paper Mill, which opened in 1905 about two miles north of Boston. It remained in business under various owners until 1984.” Photographs on the panel show views of the bag factory and of machinery inside the paper mill. End of description.",

Today, Boston is the heart of Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Stop at the visitor center to plan your adventure. Hike a short distance north on the towpath and follow connecting trails about 2.5 miles to the 60-foot Brandywine Falls, a favorite park attraction. Walk or bike 2.3 miles south to historic Peninsula for dining and shopping.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines.

    "bodyText": "<p>A wayside exhibit shows an early 1900s view of Boston Mills Road looking west from Boston Store. By this time, Boston was a paper mill town. Boston had first boomed in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-ohio-erie-canal.htm\">canal era</a> by making canal boats. Boston quieted down as canal traffic slowed with the expansion of railroads in the 1850s. It boomed again after a railroad came directly through town with the 1880 opening of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a>.<br /> <br /> First, Samuel Dyke bought an existing mill on the west side of the Cuyahoga River adjacent to the tracks. He converted it into a toy marble factory. This business was short lived. Then the Cleveland Akron Bag Company opened in 1902, making roofing paper and paper bag liners. As the paper mill expanded, more workers were needed. Polish and other immigrants moved here from Cleveland to fill the need. Boston had become a mill company town. It stayed that way even after the bag company closed in 1923. Some workers drove the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">towpath</a> to work at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jaite-a-paper-mill-and-company-town.htm\">Jaite Paper Mill</a> to the north.<br /> <br /> The 1900s image shows the Commercial Hotel, which stood where the M.D. Garage is now located. Norman Wise’s grocery store was across the street. A covered bridge crossed the river. Cleveland-Akron Bag Company and its smokestack are visible next to the railroad tracks.<br /> <br /> Visitors can further explore the company town history by crossing the river to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Boston Mill Visitor Center</a>.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Boston Street View. 460 words This wayside graphic panel sits at the corner of the towpath and Boston Mills Road, just in front of the Boston Store. As you face the sign, the towpath to the left runs along the wide covered porch on the side of the two-story, white frame building. The porch wraps around this corner to run along the front of the building as well, with rocking chairs spaced all along it. From the path, the porch is one step up. In front of the building, it is higher, with a set of five steps in front of the door at the far end. The upper floor is lined with windows with dark green shutters. Behind you is the wide, dry bed of the canal. The street lies to your right. Past the Boston Store on this side of the street is the old M.D. Garage with vintage gas pumps in front. Across the street from that is a small white building which houses the Trail Mix Boston store. From there the street continues over the Cuyahoga River and the train tracks beyond. The graphic panel is titled “Early 1900s Boston, Bag Industry Town.” The bottom has a black and white photograph showing the view down this street in the early 1900s. A two-story building housing the Commercial Hotel stands where the M.D. Garage is now located. The Trail Mix building with the covered porch across the street was Norman Wise’s grocery store. A covered bridge went over the river. On the far side was a long factory building with a tall smoke stack which was the paper bag factory. In the upper right is a 1910 aerial view from the other side of the river. The factory complex fills the lower left corner. The covered bridge is visible toward the right side of the image next to a two-story white building on that side of the river, which was the company store. The caption reads in part, “The factory workers were paid in scrip, which they could redeem only by shopping there.” Text at upper left reads, “Boston’s economy boomed building canal boats. Later it shifted to making toy marbles and then paper. If you had been standing here in the early 1900s, the photo below shows what you would have seen. Across the Cuyahoga River stood the Cleveland Akron Bag Company. The factory employed nearly 200 people, many of them Polish immigrants. The workers made paper flour sacks and roofing paper, which were shipped on the valley’s railroad. The factory survived the Great Flood of 1913 that swept through Boston and devastated communities in several states. When the factory closed in 1923, some employees drove the canal towpath to work at the Jaite Paper Mill.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The village of Boston grew up alongside a canal on the east side of the Cuyahoga River and a railroad on the west side of the river. Today, it is a crossroads for hikers, cyclists, runners, paddlers, horse riders, and train passengers. Boston Trailhead provides parking on the east side of the river for access to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath</a>, Valley, and Buckeye trails. Paddlers may park their vehicles at the trailhead after unloading equipment at the Cuyahoga River Water Trail <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-store-trailhead-river-access.htm\">drop-off</a>.<br /> <br /> When the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> opened in 1827, it pushed Boston from a small frontier hamlet to a busy canal town. Boston became a place where people lived, but also passed through on their travels. Starting in 1880, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a> brought people and commerce through the community. By that time, people from nearby cities started coming here to relax. Today, the tradition continues. People pass through the community as they recreate in the park. People also live here, calling Boston home.<br /> <br /> From this trailhead, visitors can head north or south on the Towpath, Valley, and Buckeye trails. The towpath follows the historic route of the Ohio & Erie Canal and is open to bicycles. A 2.2-mile (each way) walk from here will take you to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/brandywine-falls-trailhead.htm\">Brandywine Falls</a>. Head north 0.5 miles on the towpath to the Stanford Connector to find Stanford Trail, which leads to the falls. This route is not open to bicycles.<br /> <br /> The Valley and Buckeye trails provide more secluded options. The Valley Trail accommodates horses and connects bridle trail networks in the south end of the park with Brecksville Reservation to the north. Horse trailers are permitted at Boston Trailhead. However, the parking lot was not designed to accommodate them, and it can be a challenge to navigate.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.buckeyetrail.org/\">Buckeye Trail</a> circles the state of Ohio. Here, it heads up and down the wooded ravines created by tributaries of the Cuyahoga River. Follow blue blazes to find the Buckeye Trail.<br /> <br /> Heading west over the river, visitors can explore the park at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Boston Mill Visitor Center</a>. Take a moment to explore the history of the Ohio & Erie Canal, the history of Boston, or the history of the changing transportation that brought people here.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Boston Trailhead. 235 words A covered kiosk with a bulletin board and a graphic panel sits at the side of this unpaved parking lot. On the far side of the kiosk is the dry bed of the canal. The Towpath Trail runs along the opposite bank. Behind you on the other side of the parking lot is a paved trail that leads to your left and connects with the towpath. The graphic panel is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the middle of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place of retreat from urban life. Building on this tradition, citizens worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked Earth Day and the Clean Water Act. “Boston Trailhead. The village around you was once a busy community of nearly 1,000 people. Boston has seen a number of industries throughout the years, including canal boatyards, hotels, and mills. Although smaller today, the community of Boston is still vibrant. Local residents go about their daily lives alongside visitors who come to hike and bike the Towpath Trail, get park information, buy refreshments, or rest a minute.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Boston boomed after the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> opened in 1827. A cluster of outdoor exhibits features Boston’s canal era businesses, including its role in boat building. Boatyards produced the long, barge-like boats that carried passengers and freight. A play structure in the exhibit cluster lets people experience a scale model of a partial canal boat.<br /> <br /> This exhibit cluster is also a good location to see some basic features of the canal. The exhibits are adjacent to the towpath. Today, it is a popular <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">recreational trail</a>. Historically, mules and horses walked the towpath to pull canal boats. These sure-footed animals powered the boats, which did not have motors. The now-dry canal ditch is on the other side of the towpath from the exhibits. Workers dug it by hand to be 40 feet wide and four feet deep.<br /> <br /> During the canal heyday, about half of the boats on the canal were built in Boston and Peninsula. Boston had three boatyards in 1856, the year featured in a bird’s eye drawing of the village in the exhibits. The drawing shows a bustling boatyard on the far side of the canal from the exhibits, a blacksmith shop, and a lumberyard.<br /> <br /> Canal boats included passenger packets and cargo boats. The latter are featured in the exhibits. The size and shape of a canal boat was determined by the smallest lock, which on the Ohio & Erie Canal is 75 feet long by 15 feet wide. The wide, flat-bottomed hull of the boats provided maximum space for cargo while allowing the boat to operate in the canal’s shallow water. Crew and passenger cabins were located at the bow and stern of the boat, while a structure in the middle served as stables for the mules.<br /> <br /> Other businesses took advantage of the canal boom. Julian Edson had a sawmill and gristmill. Jim and Lucy Brown owned the Commercial Hotel, which stood in the location of MD Garage, as well as a small store.<br /> <br /> The Boston Land and Manufacturing Company opened across the street along the towpath in 1835. Notice how the building is not square. Its side façade parallels the canal. Its front façade parallels the road. As a result, it has a rhomboid shape. Today, it houses a store with food and gifts operated by the <a href=\"https://www.conservancyforcvnp.org/\">Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a>.<br /> <br /> Bring yourself into the past by imagining how the sensory experience of Boston would have been different from today. Imagine the banging hammer of a blacksmith; the smell of wet, steamed wood coming from a boatyard; and the sight of work men loading a canal boat and well-dressed passengers hurrying into Commercial Hotel.<br /> <br /> Fortune is fickle. While the town boomed in the 1830s, competition from trains had made an impact by the 1850s. By 1860, the Browns’ business ventures were over and a decade later, Edson’s had crashed as well. Boston would boom again. To learn more about that boom, cross the street to the exhibit adjacent to Boston Store or follow Boston Mills Road west over the Cuyahoga River to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Boston Mill Visitor Center</a>.<br /> <br /> To explore more canal era history, walk the towpath north less than 0.1 mile to Lock 32. An exhibit describes the role of locks in the canal system. Stumpy Basin, where boats could turn around or park, is one mile south along the towpath. Find comprehensive, family-friendly exhibits about the canal at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/historyculture/canal-exploration-center.htm\">Canal Exploration Center</a>, located nine miles north along the Towpath Trail. It is open seasonally.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Boston Village. 439 words At this location the towpath crosses Boston Mills Road which runs through the village. As you face the street, to the right are three wayside graphic panels next to a half-size canal boat play structure. To the left is the wide, dry canal bed. The historic Boston Store is across the street on the right side of the towpath. The canal boat structure lies parallel to the path with its stern to the right. It has a single cabin at its left end and features a wheelchair-accessible cement deck. The panel at the side of the path closest to the structure is titled “Bustling Boat-Building Village.” It features a drawing of a bird’s-eye view of the village in 1856 showing a bustling boatyard on the far side of the canal from your current location, a blacksmith shop next to the road on that side, and a lumberyard across the canal from the Boston Store. Boston has three boatyards at that time. During the canal’s heyday, about half of the boats on the canal were built in Boston and Peninsula. The panel to the left of that one is titled “Building a Canal Boat” and has two touchable models of canal boats along its bottom edge. The model at left has only the hull, so you can feel the keel and ribs on the inside of the boat. The model at the right is a completed cargo boat with three cabins spaced along its deck. Text on the panel explains that the size and shape of a canal boat was determined by the smallest lock, which on the Ohio and Erie Canal is 75 feet long by 15 feet wide. The wide, flat-bottomed hull of the boats provided maximum space for cargo while allowing the boat to operate in as little as 36 inches of water. Crew and passenger cabins were located at the bow and stern of the boat, while a structure in the middle served as stables for the mules that powered the boat. The final panel is titled “Fortunes Rise and Fall” which discusses booms and busts of Boston and its citizens. Julian Edson built a business empire here that included a sawmill, a gristmill, and major land parcels. Across the street, next to Boston Store where the current-day M.D. Garage is, was the Commercial Hotel and tavern owned by Lucy and Jim Brown, who also owned a small store on this side of the street. By 1860, their business ventures were over and a decade later, Edson’s had crashed as well. By 1880 he was a saloonkeeper in Boston without any property. End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Botzum Station is a popular starting point for Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad’s <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/explorer/\">shuttle service</a> for bicyclists, runners, and hikers. The station is along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail</a> just north of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/botzum-trailhead.htm\">Botzum Trailhead</a>, a large parking lot.<br /> <br /> Botzum Station is the southern-most station within Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Head north on the Towpath to explore the park. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-beaver-marsh.htm\">Beaver Marsh</a>, a large wetland for viewing wildlife, is 2.5 miles from the station. The towpath and train also continue south into Akron as part of the <a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/\">Ohio & Erie Canalway</a>. Two miles south is the commercial district of Merriman Valley with restaurants and services. In 2.5 miles, the trail intersects with <a href=\"https://www.summitmetroparks.org/Sand-Run-Metro-Park.aspx\">Sand Run</a> and <a href=\"https://www.summitmetroparks.org/cascade-valley-metro-park.aspx\">Cascade Valley</a> metroparks. The train ends at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/akron-northside-station.htm\">Akron Northside Station</a>, 6.5 miles to the south, with uphill grades, some steep, along the way.<br /> <br /> Botzum Station gets its name from a former nearby hamlet named after the most prosperous family in the area. It was one of three small crossroads communities in what is now the southern section of Cuyahoga Valley National Park.<br /> <br /> Crossroads communities were once very common in the United States. They grew up at transportation nodes and served as places that provided goods and services to people in outlying areas. They typically had a cluster of homes and farm buildings, a school, church, post office, and at least one commercial enterprise such as a store, tavern, or blacksmith shop. The communities of Botzum, Ira, and Everett emerged during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-ohio-erie-canal.htm\">canal era</a> in the 1800s, becoming shipping and supply points. That service continued with the arrival of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a>, the forerunner of <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a>. Each community had a train depot. Today, nothing remains of Botzum and Ira. Everett is 3.5 miles to the north.<br /> <br /> While not a historic building, the design of Botzum Station evokes the community’s historic depot. Exhibit panels inside tell the history of the train, its impact on the valley, and its communities. An exhibit panel also features images from the former village found to the north, Botzum.<br /> <br /> Today, the station serves recreational visitors. Its historic forerunner would have been a hub of small-town life. Businesses, often dependent on train transportation, developed near depots. Telegraph service and mail delivery passed through them. Travelers to and from the community also congregated there. In many ways, the depot functioned as a gateway to the larger world.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Botzum Station. 473 words The station is a rectangular covered platform with a wall at each end. Posts along each side support the shingled roof. Wooden benches sit down the middle. The 20-foot-wide floor is made of wood boards and the structure is painted a creamy yellow. The tracks are on one side of the station. On the other side a path leads back to the parking lot. Graphic panels are hung on the inside of the end walls. At one end is a panel titled “Ride the Rails” which explains that the first steam engine in the valley began running in 1880 connecting the mineral fields in the south to the factories in the north. Today the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad follows much of the same route. Yellow paint on a station signifies a modern building. Historical depots are painted red. The panel shows a map of the rail line through the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, stretching from Rockside Station at the northern end to the Akron Northside Station at the southern end. You are currently at the southern-most station within the park boundaries. The railroad and the Towpath Trail both follow the Cuyahoga River through the park. At the same end of the station is a glass-covered bulletin board with current information about the train and the park. The wall at the other end has two graphic panels. One is titled “Changes in the Countryside.” The panel explains that with the coming of the railroad residents saw their environment changing. The physical presence of the railroad was matched by the ability to move freight and passengers quickly, improving access to markets. A single engine pulling numerous rail cars could make the run from Cleveland to Canton and back again in a single day. At upper right is a black and white photograph of a steel railroad bridge at Independence sitting to the right of an older, wooden covered bridge designed for foot and wagon traffic. At bottom is a 1920s aerial photograph showing the train tracks following the Great Curve beside the river near Boston. The other panel, titled “Down at the Depot,” discusses the fact that railroad depots became hubs of activity for the towns that they served with businesses developing nearby. Depots also represent the enormous influence railroad companies wielded over community life with standardized architecture and timekeeping. In 1883, the railroads were responsible for creating four separate time zones in the United States. The panel has an 1896 photograph of people waiting outside Botzum Station and an 1880 photo of Botzum General Store, people lining the wooden sidewalk. Another photograph from the 1930s shows a woman standing on top of a metal ladder preparing to hang a mail bag from a metal arm, called a mail crane, for the rail crew to pick up as the train passed.

Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines.

Along the way, it connected the hamlets of the Cuyahoga Valley to the outside world. The town of Brecksville had its depot here. Today, Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad travels the historic rail line. While the original depot is gone, the National Park Service built Brecksville Station to link the train with recreational experiences in the valley.<br /> <br /> As transportation routes like the Valley Railway fed Cleveland’s industries, the city grew and changed. Cleveland became the 11th largest U.S. city by 1880. Many inhabitants resided in crowded neighborhoods near the billowing smokestacks. As in many of America’s cities, people began to seek a break from modern life through rail travel into the countryside.<br /> <br /> Along the Valley Railway, riders could enjoy long stretches of rural scenery between the cities of Cleveland, Akron, and Canton. The 1880 <em>Guidebook for the Tourist and Traveler over the Valley Railway!</em> described sights along the way. The tradition of coming to the valley for recreation had begun.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Brecksville Station. 487 words The rail station is a rectangular covered platform with restrooms at one end and a wall at the other. Posts along each side support the shingled roof. Wooden benches fill the space between the restrooms and the wall. The 20-foot-wide floor is made of wood boards and the structure is painted a creamy yellow. The railroad tracks run in front of the station with no guardrail. On the far side of the tracks is a parking lot. Graphic panels are hung on the inside. Between the restrooms is a panel titled “Ride the Rails” which explains that the first steam engine in the valley began running in 1880 connecting the mineral fields in the south to the factories in the north. Today the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad follows much of the same route. Yellow paint on a station signifies a modern building. Historical depots are painted red. The panel shows a map of the rail line through Cuyahoga Valley National Park, stretching from Rockside Station at the northern end to the Akron Northside Station at the southern end. The railroad and the Towpath Trail both follow the Cuyahoga River through the park. At the same end of the station is a glass-covered bulletin board with current information about the train and the park. A water station is also on the wall here. The wall at the other end has two graphic panels. One is titled “The Lure of the Countryside.” At upper right it has a black and white photograph of houses and buildings with the Cleveland Rolling Mills factory in the background. Smoke rises from a forest of chimneys. Beneath that is another photograph, this one showing a group of over a dozen people standing in front of the Boston train station, the men in suits and the women wearing long dresses, all wearing hats. Text on the panel reads in part, “Clutter, noise, and grime. America’s cities in the late 19th century were less than ideal living spaces. Many inhabitants resided in crowded neighborhoods near the billowing smokestacks of giant industries. The pace of life seemed increasingly frenetic in a metropolis like Cleveland, the 11th largest U.S. city in 1880. In many of America’s urban areas, a natural respite from modern life materialized with rail travel through pastoral lands… Along the Valley Railway, riders could enjoy long stretches of rural scenes between the cities of Cleveland, Akron, and Canton.” The other panel is titled “A Travel Guide for the Valley” with a 1920s photograph of the Brecksville Depot and an image of the first page of the ‘Guidebook for the Tourist and Traveler over the Valley Railway!’ Text on the panel explains that John Reese of Canton published the 1880 paperback guide with a ‘complete description of the scenery and objects of interest along the road.’ The guide sold for 25 cents. Today’s Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad follows the same route. End of description.",

By then it was the shortest route between the coalfields of Tuscarawas County to the south and Cleveland’s ports to the north. For the valley, the historic stations were a lifeline to the outside world. From train stations like these, milk, cheese, grain, and lumber were shipped to the outside world.<br /> <br /> From this point, visitors can get on the <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a> or follow the paved path east to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/historyculture/canal-exploration-center.htm\">Canal Exploration Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a>. Exhibits at the station explore the relationship between the Valley Railway and its rival, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a>. The two forms of transportation coexisted for decades because each found its own niche. The railroad carried passengers and heavy freight, like coal and stone. Flour, grain, and other agricultural goods were often shipped on the canal.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Canal Exploration Center Station. 465 words The rail station is a long, rectangular covered platform with a wall at each end. Posts along each side support the shingled roof. Wooden benches are in the middle. The 20-foot-wide floor is made of wood boards and the structure is painted a creamy yellow. A grassy area surrounds the structure. On one side an asphalt pathway leads to the parking lot next to the Canal Exploration Center. The tracks are on the other side with a separate wooden platform. Graphic panels are hung on the inside of the end walls. At one end is a panel titled “Ride the Rails” which explains that the first steam engine in the valley began running in 1880. Yellow paint on a station signifies a modern building. Historical depots are painted red. The panel shows a map of the rail line through Cuyahoga Valley National Park, stretching from Rockside Station at the northern end to the Akron Northside Station at the southern end. The railroad and the Towpath Trail both follow the Cuyahoga River through the park. Your current location is at the second-most northern station. Nearby is a bulletin board case with current news. The wall at the other end has two graphic panels. One is titled “Evolving Transportation Systems.” It has black-and-white photographs of a steam locomotive and of a canal boat. Text on the panel explains that the evolution of transportation systems in the 1800s is evident here at the Canal Exploration Center Station. As you walk between this station and the Canal Exploration Center, you will see both the river and a watered-filled section of the canal with a working lock and a towpath. Railroads were slow to reach the valley because of the steep valley walls. Not until the 1870s and the need to reach new sources of coal farther south did people see the value in constructing a railroad. Canal operations continued until the Great Flood of 1913 caused damage too expensive to repair. The other panel is titled “Canal versus Railroad.” Text on the panel states that the Valley Railway made its inaugural trip on January 28, 1880 to an enthusiastic response. It explains that in other areas of the country the arrival of a railroad often produced tensions as one mode of transportation replaced another. However, in the valley, both modes found a niche that only ended when the 1913 flood ended canal operations. At top right is a black and white photograph of a canal boat being pulled by a three-mule team. The boats could only travel as fast as the mules pulling them. Below that is a 1910 photograph of a passenger train steaming over the Cuyahoga River between Boston and Peninsula. Travel time greatly decreased with the arrival of the railroad.

    "audioDescription": "Canal Exploration Center kiosk. 434 words A three-sided, covered kiosk with a bulletin board and two graphic panels sits at the edge of the parking lot. A paved path at the right side of the parking lot leads over the river to a rail station. Behind the kiosk as you face the parking lot other paths lead to the canal and the Canal Exploration Center. Restrooms are in a small structure to the left of the parking lot. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the northern end of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Canal Exploration Center Trailhead. Enjoy visitor center exhibits about Ohio’s canal system and its impact on America. This area includes one of the few watered sections of the canal. See a lock demonstration on summer weekends. Walk south on the towpath to see more of this national historic landmark. Take a three-mile round-trip past Gleason Farm and Tinkers Creek Aqueduct. Turn around at Wilson/Alexander Mill or go a little farther to Frazee House.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines. Discover how culture, recreation and natural scenic beauty are being revitalized by this national heritage area.” End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Carved in Stone. 297 words This wayside graphic panel faces the bottom of a set of stairs that has been built and carved into a cleft in the rocky cliffs on this side of the trail. To either side the trail continues to wind along the base of the rock, which have been eroded into a variety of shapes. Some areas are undercut, with ledges looming up above. Other places look like stacks of flat plates. As you face the panel, behind you the ground falls away in a gentle slope covered with mixed hemlock and deciduous trees. If you climb the stairs, the trail continues on to the Ledges Shelter. At the top of the panel is a quote from a 1910 annual report of the Department of the Interior which reads, “In their construction of roads, trails, buildings and other improvements, particular attention must be devoted always to harmonizing of these improvements with the landscape.” To the right text reads, “Whenever possible, park designers used native materials and surroundings to maintain the natural character of the park landscape. Here at Ritchie Ledges, the stairs in front of you illustrate the Civilian Conservation Corps’ efforts to implement these landscape principles. Stair stones were quarried from these same ledges and fitted into a natural break in this massive formation. Walking up these sandstone stairs can give one the sensation of rock climbing rather than simply walking up a flight of stairs.” The bottom of the panel is filled with a black and white photograph of men working at the base of these cliff formations.

Rivers provided water and abundant food sources, from mussels and fish to ducks and muskrats. Prehistoric people left their \"dinner trash,\" such as bone and shell fragments. These dinner discards give archeologists insights into ancient diets. Remnants of net weights, bone fishhooks, and broken spears are clues about how people during various periods captured dinner.<br /> <br /> Rivers were also transportation routes. The scope of prehistoric trade networks varied dramatically over time.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Cuyahoga River. 379 words At this point on the towpath, the Cuyahoga River, the canal, and the scenic byway are close together. A graphic panel is on one side of the path with the wide, shallow river beyond, down a low, vegetation-covered bank. On the other side of the path is the water-filled canal. Beyond it is the byway with the sounds of passing traffic. A few yards to the right of the graphic is a cement post marking historic mile 12 on the towpath. The upper right of the panel has an illustration of the river in winter, its banks covered in snow, and a white, bark canoe paddled by an American Indian. Text on the panel reads, “Vital Resources for Indians. American Indians of the Cuyahoga Valley depended greatly on the river’s natural resources for food and transportation. This is evident in pieces of shell and bones of fish, aquatic mammals, and waterfowl found by archeologists. Prehistoric people paddled the river and streams to trap or spear muskrats and beavers. They caught yellow perch, walleye, northern pike, and catfish with nets and weirs. They collected freshwater mussels. The scope of prehistoric trade networks varied dramatically over time. Some people ventured north-south along the Cuyahoga and beyond. Some followed steams east and west.” Along the bottom of the panel are small photographs. At left is a muskrat. The caption reads, “The diet of early valley inhabitants included muskrats as well as deer and other forest mammals.” The next picture shows a merganser, a duck with brown sides, a black head and back, and a bright yellow eye with a white triangle stretching from its eye to the back of its head. The caption reads, “The people used nets and bows and arrows to catch mergansers, mallards, Canada geese and other waterfowl.” The third picture shows a hand holding a large, ribbed, gray shell. The caption reads, “As we do today, prehistoric Americans probably opened freshwater mussels by steaming them.” At bottom right are pictures of a muskrat jawbone with teeth and two types of fish bones, one round and one triangular. The caption reads, “Bones are among prehistoric artifacts found along the Cuyahoga River in the national park. The people used some bones as scrapers and other tools.” End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Everett Covered Bridge. 302 words As you face this wayside graphic panel, the covered bridge is directly ahead of you. It is painted red with a white interior and white fence on either side of the entrance. Trails lead off to the right of the entrance. Behind you is the paved path back to the parking lot, passing a picnic table and restrooms along the way. Directly to the left of the panel a small unpaved path leads around a clump of trees to more exhibits. Text on the panel reads, “The reconstructed Everett Covered Bridge stands as a reminder of a common 1800s Ohio scene. While its original date of construction is uncertain, it is patterned on the 1869 Smith Truss design. In the 19th century, Ohio led the nation with over 2,000 covered bridges, the first built in 1809. The roof and sides protected hard-to-replace wooden floors. Their popularity began to fade in the 1880s with the appearance of more durable iron bridges. Everett Covered Bridge is the only remaining covered bridge in Summit County.” The bottom of the panel has a photograph of the bridge after the great flood of 1913, which closed the Ohio and Erie Canal. The picture shows the bridge leaning at a slight angle as a man stands at its entrance. A few boards are missing from the side of the bridge and the access leading up to it is gone. The caption reads, “While the canal provided transportation to and from the valley, it took improvements like the covered bridge to make travel within the valley more feasible. The 1913 damage was repaired, but a spring storm destroyed the bridge in 1975. School children, local citizens, private organizations, and government agencies joined hands to secure funds for the historically accurate reconstruction, completed in 1986.” End of description.",

This covered bridge is a reminder of Ohio’s transportation history. The original was built in the late 1870s to carry horses and wagons, and later automobiles, over Furnace Run.

They dug the foundation, made the bricks, and framed in the building using local materials. The design was inspired by illustrations in Asher Benjamin’s popular 1806 stylebook, <em>The American Builder’s Companion</em>. The Frazees chose elements of the Federal style, something that was familiar to them. This style emphasizes balance and symmetry. For the Frazees, the house symbolized success. Although they initially had financial losses when the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> cut through their property, this new transportation route ultimately was a benefit. They went from living in a wilderness outpost to being established farmers. They may have used part of their settlement from suing the state of Ohio to purchase the hardware and glass used inside.<br /> <br /> Minor changes have been made to the house during the past two centuries. The second owner, John Hynton, added a kitchen “ell” in the back, with a woodburning stove. The Frazees had most likely cooked on the hearth. Later residents added electricity and a toilet. However, the room layout has changed very little, a testimony to the timeless Federal style.<br /> <br /> More recently, the building has shown signs of shifting. In 2011 the National Park Service closed the Frazee House to monitor cracks in the foundation and assess damages. The building remains closed pending funding to stabilize and re-open the historic building.<br /> <br /> To learn more, cross Canal Road to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a> where there is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/frazee-house-towpath-panel.htm\">second graphic panel</a> about the Frazee family. A short distance north, additional exhibits explore life at the nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/alexander-wilson-mill.htm\">Alexander-Wilson Mill</a>. For a more rugged hike, pick up the Sagamore Bridle Trail at the base of the driveway and turn left to follow it northward. To head south, go straight across the wooden bridge and beyond before veering off to the left.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Frazee House. 392 words A wayside graphic panel sits at the back, right corner of this red brick house. The house is in the shape of an “L” with the longer front being two stories and the smaller rear wing being one story. The front part has a pair of chimneys at either end. The rear wing has a single chimney at the back. A granite slab forms a step at the door into the back wing. Paved paths lead from the panel to the door and around the back of the house to doors on the other side of the rear wing and into the main house. A parking lot is to the left of the panel. At the back of the parking lot is a small restroom. The graphic panel shows a picture of the house from the front, showing the central door with windows on either side and along the upper story. Text on the panel reads, \"Symbol of Success. This house reflects Stephen and Mahitable Frazee’s transition from being subsistence pioneers to successful farmers. They may have come to the Cuyahoga Valley as tenant farmers as early as 1811. Within 10 years they were able to buy more than 600 acres. The Frazees built this substantial brick house in 1825-27 on a prominent hillside site. Both were signs of success – this family was here to stay. The Frazees based many of the house’s Federal-style features on Asher Benjamin’s book ‘The American Builder’s Companion.’ A popular 1806 style guide, the book did not include how-to-do-it instructions. Ultimately the Frazees built their home with bricks they made themselves using local materials and local knowledge.” A quote from the book reads, “Strength, convenience, and beauty, are the principal things to be attended to.” At bottom right is a façade and floorplan from the book, showing a plain, rectangular house with small wings at either end. The caption reads, “The Frazees were inspired by Asher Benjamin’s plan for a country house. What similarities do you see? Notice the boxy shape and how the windows, chimneys, and roofline are balanced and symmetrical.” At top right are images of two fragments from dishes, both covered in decorations including flowers and classical-shaped vases. The caption reads, “Fragments discovered by archeologists indicate the dishware was imported, probably on the canal, and typical of the middle class.” End of description.",

Here they raised their family, farming to put food on the table. Initially they probably lived in a log-style cabin further up the hill along the former road. Early tax records indicate that the Frazee family had horses and a cow. After the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> was built here in 1825, we see a shift in the Frazees’ practices. Tax records after 1827 show Stephen Frazee had up to 8 “milch” (milk) cows—about 7 more than a subsistence family. They probably shipped out excess milk and dairy products on the canal, getting paid in cash. In time they became respected members of their community, raising children who would become teachers, ministers, and farmers.<br /> <br /> The house has been a home to a farming family for most of its existence. Stephen Frazee sold it to John and Elizabeth Hynton. After John’s passing in 1865, Elizabeth and a son-in-law nurtured and grew one of the more profitable farms in the area. After Elizabeth Hynton passed, the house only changed hands a couple of times before being purchased by the National Park Service. In the 1980s, preservationists and historical carpenters stabilized the house. Time is beginning to take its toll though, resulting in the temporary closure of the house in 2012. It waits again, for more work, as it stands guard over the valley.<br /> <br /> Cross Canal Road to get a closer look at the architecture, use the vault toilet, and read a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/frazee-house-panel.htm\">second graphic panel</a>.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Audio Description: Frazee Family. 307 words Across the canal and scenic byway from this wayside graphic panel is a plain, red-brick, two-story house. It has a brown shingled roof with a pair of brick chimneys at each end. A white door sits in the middle of the front with a pair of white-trimmed windows on either side. The upper story has five windows. The canal in front of the panel has water in the bottom and is crossed by a flat wooden bridge at the right. Trees surround a field on the other side of the towpath with a horse trail along the edge of the field. The panel has an illustration of the house from the right side, revealing a one-story wing at the rear with another chimney at the back. The winter scene features snow and bare trees. A man in a jacket and hat carries a bucket at the rear of the house. Text on the panel reads, “Impact of the Canal. Stephen and Mehitable Frazee experienced both the challenges and benefits of the Ohio and Erie Canal. They arrived in this area in the early 1800s, when it was sparsely settled. They lived in a log cabin, cleared forests for farmland, and were mostly self-sufficient. Canal construction in 1825 flooded their fields and destroyed their crops. The family had to buy feed, flour, and seeds for several years. Stephen sued the State of Ohio and won a settlement of $130. The Frazees built the brick farmhouse across the road about the same time the canal opened. The canal provided the Frazees and all the local farmers with an effective means to send their products to market. “Both the house and canal symbolized greater prosperity. What are positive and negative consequences of public works where you live? “Cross the road and explore the Frazee House’s exterior.” End of description.",

This idea of a fort makes sense, with these earth walls, ringing around this high plateau with steep slopes below. Yet in 1983, archeologists discovered a stone ramp that led from within the earth walls to the surrounding plateau. And archeologists have found no evidence of dwellings within these walls, only a few briefly used fire hearths. Why build a fort if you were not going to live inside it? Archeologists now think these walls may have had a different purpose – more ceremonial. Ceremonial use would have no long term occupation within the walls. Perhaps the walls, now badly worn by plowing and time, did serve as a sort of protection – on the spiritual plane. What do you think?</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Fort or Sacred Site? 409 words This wayside graphic panel along this path in a mixed, hardwood forest. As you face the panel, the path to the right passes along a narrow ridge with steep slopes on either side. To the left, the ridge widens to form a small plateau, the path following along the left edge. The woods are open with little underbrush. Text on the panel reads, “In 1850, Charles Whittlesey, working as Ohio’s Surveyor General, mapped prehistoric earthworks on this plateau. Because steep slopes and embankments ringed the plateau, Whittlesey called it an American Indian fort. Archeologists now question his view. To your right, the trail follows a narrow ridge that allows access to the plateau. Whittlesey’s map shows earthworks blocking the ridge as expected for a fort. Yet, archeologists have uncovered a stone ramp that led easily onto the plateau from the inner earthwork. Archeologists have not found evidence of dwellings on this plateau, only fire hearths used for short periods of time. Why build earthworks at a place used only briefly if not for defense? Perhaps people came here for social gatherings or rituals. The earthworks could have been signposts that marked the importance, even sacredness, of the plateau. The bottom right of the panel has a photograph of a steep-sided ditch with small rock in the bottom along with an archeologist’s trowel and a small chalkboard dated 23 June 83. The caption reads, “Archeologists from Cleveland Museum of Natural History uncovered the stone ramp leading onto the site in 1983.” The left side of the panel has an image of Whittlesey’s 1850 map of the site. It features a loop of the Cuyahoga River at the top with the canal running just below. The plateau is in the lower half of the map, shaped like a hatchet, with the blade facing to the right and the handle extending off the bottom of the map. Narrow, closely-spaced lines mark the steep slopes surrounding the plateau. A small red arrow indicates the position of this sign near two sets of earthworks where the handle meets the hatchet blade. One embankment extends down the middle of the plateau. Two small mounds along the bottom of the blade which no longer exist are marked with an “m.” The caption indicates that the knob on the earthwork to your left is where archeologists found the stone ramp. All of the earthworks are worn down and hard to identify. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Prehistoric Earthwork. 338 words This wayside graphic panel sits at a turn in the path along the edge of this small plateau covered with a mixed hardwood forest. The sides of the plateau fall off steeply, particularly to the left as you face the sign. On the other side of the sign, slightly to the right, there are a couple of undulations before the ground falls steeply. Text on the panel reads, “Before you is a low, linear embankment with a shallow ditch behind it. When Colonel Charles Whittlesey recorded it in 1850, a person standing in the ditch could just see over the embankment. When he revisited the site in 1867, Whittlesey noted that farmers’ plows had erased much of what he had seen earlier. You can help protect what remains by staying on the trail. “Archeologists believe that American Indians built this earth work between 500 and 1100 AD during the Early Late Woodland period, a time of major cultural change. The complex burial practices and long-distance trade networks of the Hopewell era had ended. Populations increased, agriculture grew in importance, and people settled into larger, more permanent villages. The people who used this site may have lived and gardened on the fertile lands of the valley floor.” The left side of the panel has an image of Whittlesey’s 1850 map of the site. It features a loop of the Cuyahoga River at the top with the canal running just below. The plateau is in the lower half of the map, shaped like a hatchet, with the blade facing to the right and the handle extending off the bottom of the map. Narrow, closely-spaced lines mark the steep slopes surrounding the plateau. A small red arrow indicates the position of this sign in the upper left corner of the hatchet blade where there are two sets of markings for the embankment and ditch formations.

As you face the sign, a paved path runs to the left and into a tunnel under the road, heading to Happy Days Lodge 200 yards away. To the left of the path is a grassy lawn with a picnic table. Behind you, at the far end of the parking lot, is a covered kiosk with trailhead information. This historic sign is 17 feet wide. The left end is a 6-foot-wide, 7-foot-high stone wall. The right side is a frame made of wooden beams mounted on a stone base, which holds a bulletin board and two graphic panels. Feel free to touch the irregular stonework. The middle panel on the sign is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the eastern edge of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Happy Days Lodge. Happy Days Lodge is a legacy from the difficult years of the Great Depression. Civilian Conservation Corps workers built it as a summer camp for Akron children in 1938-1939. Today it continues to provide recreational opportunities. People can enjoy concerts, participate in programs, or rent the facility for special occasions. The panel at the right end of the sign is titled “Places to Go.” The background of the panel is filled with a photograph of a wide waterfall cascading down a layered rock face. The caption reads, “Brandywine Falls, with its spectacular 60-foot drop, is the park’s most popular destination. It is located northwest of Happy Days Lodge.” Along the bottom of the panel are five smaller photographs. From left to right they show the front of a locomotive from the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad which provides a relaxing way to tour the valley. Next, a woman bicycles on the Towpath Trail which follows the route of the Ohio and Erie Canal. Next is a three people looking over a railing at the lily pad-covered Beaver Marsh. Next is a picture of the white Canal Exploration Center with exhibits about how the Ohio & Erie Canal shaped the nation. The last photo shows a trail through moss-covered cliffs along the nearby Ledges Trail. Text on the panel recommends stopping by the Boston Mill Visitor Center at 6947 Riverview Road, just north of downtown Peninsula, for assistance in planning your visit. End of description.",

Out of that vision came the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/legacy-of-the-ccc-at-cuyahoga-valley.htm\">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC).<br /> <br /> At that time, Akron Metropolitan Park District (now <a href=\"https://www.summitmetroparks.org/\">Summit Metro Parks</a>) managed Virginia Kendall Park as a state park. The district recruited CCC Company 576 to develop the park. During a December 1933 snowstorm, the first group of young men arrived at their camp, located near this spot. For nearly a decade, Company 576 used manual labor to build trails, roads, and facilities.<br /> <br /> One of their last efforts was construction of the 11-room Happy Days Camp for children, completed in 1938. They used local Berea Sandstone and wormy American chestnut as their building materials. You can see the “worm” holes in the wood caused by chestnut blight. This fungal disease killed most American chestnut trees during the first half of the 1900s.<br /> <br /> The camp’s name came from the ‘Happy Days Are Here Again’ theme song of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/franklin-d-roosevelt.htm\">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>’s New Deal political platform. The song’s title was given as a symbol of hope for Depression-era youth.<br /> <br /> For years the building served as a dormitory for a summer playground program sponsored by the Akron Board of Education and Recreation Commission. Today, the building is an event space called Happy Days Lodge. It is managed by the <a href=\"https://www.conservancyforcvnp.org/\">Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a>. Visitors come to hear concerts, attend programs, or rent the facility for special occasions. Across time, many have spent happy days here.<br /> <br /> Parking for events and special occasions is across State Route 303, accessible by a pedestrian tunnel. Parking on this side of State Route 303 is for disabled parking and drop-off.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Happy Days Lodge. 378 words This wayside graphic sits on the right side of the paved driveway that leads up and behind the large, brown building with vertical siding. As you face the graphic panel, the lodge sits in front of you with a wide grassy lawn stretching in front of it. The building is a long rectangle stretching across the back of the lawn. A smaller wing forms a screened porch that extends towards you about a third of the way in from the left end. The walls of the wing are covered in large window panels during the colder months. The main building to the right of the wing has a raised roof over the central portion with additional windows under the roof line. There is a flag pole in front of the building. Text at the top of the panel reads, “In December of 1933, Company 576 of the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, took up residence here at Virginia Kendall Park and began an improvement program that lasted nearly 10 years. One of their last efforts was construction of the 11-room Happy Days Camp for children, completed in 1938. The camp’s name came from the ‘Happy Days Are Here Again’ theme song of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal political platform. The song’s title was given to the children’s day camp as a symbol of hope for Depression-era youth. Now an events facility, Happy Days first served as a dormitory for the summer playground program sponsored by the Akron Board of Education and Recreation Commission.” The lower left of the panel has a large photograph of a building site with piles of dirt and gravel in the foreground and a few men working on foundations in the middle. At upper left triangular roof trusses are set in a line, ready to be lifted into place. The caption reads, “CCC workers built the Happy Days structure with local Berea sandstone and wormy American chestnut. It remains one of the largest wormy chestnut structures in the world.” At the right side of the panel is a smaller photograph of young men sitting and eating at long tables outdoors. The caption reads, “Hundreds of young men lived and worked in the Virginia Kendall barracks from 1933 to 1942.” End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Hunt House Trailhead. 437 words A three-sided, covered kiosk with a bulletin board and two graphic panels sits between the Towpath Trail and a paved parking lot. With your back toward the parking lot, the path and the canal bed are in front of you. To the right is Bolanz Road. From here, the towpath crosses the road to go north or you may turn left to continue south. Across the road is the Hunt House where more exhibits are located. To the left of the kiosk is a wooden bench. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location at the southern end of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Hunt House. Everett is a type of rural crossroads community that was once common across America. Cross the road to Hunt House. Family-friendly exhibits explore village life and the lives of wild plants and animals. Continue a quarter-mile north on the towpath to Lock 27 for another peek into the past. Beaver Marsh, popular for wildlife watching, is three-quarters of a mile south.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines. Discover how culture, recreation, and natural scenic beauty are being revitalized by this national heritage area.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Archeology tells us that Hunt House may not have been the first home at this site. At one time, a larger building stood in front of the one you see today. The property here changed hands a few times in the 1800s. Martha and Norman Hunt bought it in 1867. Sometime during their ownership, the larger house was lost, perhaps to fire. The Hunts quickly converted their backyard outbuilding into living space. During the Hunt years, this was mostly a grain farm, producing winter wheat, Indian corn, and oats.<br /> <br /> William and Nelle Fiedler purchased the property in 1919. Although William held many jobs through the years, farming was his love. He ran a “truck” farm, selling produce from a stand along the road. In 1920, the Fiedlers welcomed a new baby girl, Helyn. Throughout her life, Helyn cherished the memories and friendships of her <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/kidsyouth/helyn-fiedler-toth.htm\">Everett childhood</a>.<br /> <br /> The exhibits outside Hunt House were developed from family photos and oral and written histories shared by Helyn and her school friends. Imagine being a young girl growing up in Cuyahoga Valley. Flip through her album, listen to their stories, and take your photo with her calf and chickens.<br /> <br /> Hunt House has <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">seasonal hours</a>. When it is open, you can explore the hands-on nature exhibits inside and pick up park information. The restrooms are open all year. That barn between the restrooms and the house is a former schoolhouse that the Fiedlers relocated from Botzum.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Hunt House. 449 words. As you face this wayside graphic panel to the left is a small, white farm house. A ground-level covered porch extends across the front of the house with a bench next to the front door. At this end, under the peak of the roof is a window. Below an extension has been added to the house with a shed-style roof and a chimney at this end. The Towpath Trail runs past the house on the far side. Between the house and the graphic panel are touchable exhibits of farm animals. Nearest the panel is a life-size brown and white calf lying down, head up and alert. To the left of that is a hay bale where you can sit beside the two hens perched on the left end. One is brown and the other is speckled black and white. To the right of the panel is an audio station, a metal post with four push buttons on top to select the short programs. Farther to the right are two white buildings. The closer one is a two-story barn. The other one is smaller and has public restrooms. Behind you is a wide grassy lawn next to a street with a parking lot on the far side. Text on the panel reads in part, “Growing Up in Everett. […] Helyn was born in 1920 in the house to your left. She lived here through the 1940s with her parents and brother. Her father, William, held various jobs to support the family, but he loved farming. The Fiedlers raised vegetables in the fields behind the house. They had ‘a little roadside stand.’ Often vegetables and fruit were picked on demand as the customers waited. Helyn kept up friendships with her Everett classmates and neighbors until her death in 2013. Is there a place where you feel a strong sense of community?” At the bottom left is a photograph of Helyn’s father, William Fiedler, at the farm in the late 1940s, a cornfield in the background. The calf grazing to the left of him is the model for the touchable calf exhibit. At the middle top of the panel is a 1938 photograph of two 18-year-old girls, Helyn on the right with her friend Irene. Below them is a photograph of the farmhouse, looking much as it does today. At bottom right of the panel is a flipbook with more pictures and information about Helyn. The audio station to the right has childhood memories of Helyn and her friends. From left to right the audio segments are: Working Our Land, 60 seconds; One-room School, 40 seconds; Szalay’s Farm Next Door, 70 seconds; and Time for Fun, 70 seconds. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Indigo Lake Station. 447 words The rail station is on the right side of the path that leads from the parking lot. The tracks are just behind you. Be aware there are no barriers along the tracks. The station is a rectangular covered platform with a wall at each end. Posts along each side support the shingled roof. Wooden benches sit down the middle. The 20-foot-wide floor is made of wood boards and the structure is painted a creamy yellow. Standing with your backs to the tracks, a paved trail runs past the station on the left. On the other side of the trail is Indigo Lake with benches available on the grassy lawn near the lake. Graphic panels are hung on the inside of the end walls. At one end is a panel titled “Ride the Rails” which explains that the first steam engine in the valley began running in 1880 connecting the mineral fields in the south to the factories in the north. Today the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad follows much of the same route. Yellow paint on a station signifies a modern building. Historical depots are painted red. The panel shows a map of the rail line through the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, stretching from Rockside Station at the northern end to the Akron Northside Station at the southern end. The railroad and the Towpath Trail both follow the Cuyahoga River through the park. At the same end of the station is a glass-covered bulletin board with current information about the train and the park. The wall at the other end has two graphic panels. One is titled “Moving Farm Goods to Market.” Text on the panel explains that farming in the valley dates back to American Indian use of the land. Later settlers established hundreds of scattered farms raising wheat, corn, potatoes, sheep, and cows among other products. In the 1860s a new demand arose as Ferdinand Schumacker, founder of the Quaker Oats Company in Akron, sold his rolled oats to the Union Army during the Civil War. The canal made shipping farm goods quicker and more cost effective. The railroad improved transportation even more. Photographs on the panel include a picture of Schumacher’s Cascade Mills in Akron and bins of fresh farm goods in front of C.W. Bonstedt’s grocery in Akron. The other panel is titled “Crossroads Communities” which describes the nearby communities of Everett, Ira, and Botzum which emerged as trading centers in the 1800s due to their proximity to canal locks. The villages continued to be shipping and supply points with the arrival of the railway as each became home to a depot. Today Botzum and Ira are gone. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Ira Trailhead Exhibits. 461 words At the left side of the path that leads from the parking lot to the towpath is a tall graphic panel flanked on both sides by touchable models of animals common in the marsh. Two models are on the left of the panel – a beaver at left and an otter at right. The beaver is 18” long, faces to the right, and sits three feet high on a model of a beaver dam made of logs. Notice its wide, flat tail hanging down behind. To the right is an otter sitting on a two-foot-high boulder, facing left. Its thin body is 19 inches long with a long tail hanging down the back of the boulder. A fish lies on the rock by the otter’s front feet. To the right of the panel is another boulder, 2-foot high. There is a hollow cavity on the front of the boulder where a muskrat sits, facing left. His nine-inch-long body has an equally long, hairless tail. Near his left front paw is a cattail head. Flat cattail leaves lie on top of the boulder. The bottom of the graphic panel has a photograph of Beaver’s Marsh, the flat, still water broken by patches of marsh grasses. A low ridge shrouded in mist lies behind the marsh. Text at the top left reads, “From Salvage Yard to Beaver Marsh. Follow the Towpath Trail ahead to Beaver Marsh – one of the best places to view wildlife in Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Only a quarter-mile north, a boardwalk crosses this 70-acre wetland, transformed from an old salvage yard. Humans and beavers turned this site back into a marsh in the 1980s. Volunteers organized by a local Sierra Club removed cars and materials from the old business site. About the same time beavers flooded the area by building a dam across the Ohio and Erie Canal. The waters awakened long-dormant seeds of wetland plants -- a stunning example of nature recovering an area if given a chance. You may see a beaver nibbling on a willow branch, turtles sunning themselves on logs, and, if you are fortunate, otters at play. In spring and summer, frogs and songbirds sing in an exuberant chorus.” To the right of the text is a photograph of a small garage surrounded by rows of junk cars. The caption reads, “Burrell Tonkin’s auto repair shop and salvage yard were full of car bumpers, tires, and other auto parts.” Across the middle of the panel are four smaller photographs. From left to right they show a great blue heron surrounded by lily pads, a beaver crouched near reeds, a pair of otters side-by-side on a wetland stump, and two park volunteers making notes as they observe wildlife in the marsh.

One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location at the southern end of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Ira Trailhead.

Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines.

    "audioDescription": "Kendall Lake Pier and Shelter. 365 words This wayside graphic panel sits at the end of a wide pier that extends out into the small lake. As you face the panel the earthen pier stretches away from you back to the shore. All three sides of the pier are edged with wooden boardwalks. Several benches sit on the boardwalks and a picnic table sits in the middle of the grass-covered pier itself. At the end of the pier is a two-story stone building with open doorways leading to the lower floor and cement steps on either side leading to the second floor with its wide covered porch along the front. The lake stretches in the other three directions, an earthen dam located over your right shoulder. The edges of the lake are marshy with large stands of cattails. The entire area is wooded. Text at the top of the graphic panel reads, “Engineering Nature. Many of America’s parks were designed using naturalistic landscape principles developed in the early 1900s. The Kendall Lake area is an example of this design approach. Its idyllic setting was no accident. Once logged and farmed, the Kendall Lake landscape was molded by the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, into the park you see today. CCC crews built a dam to create the lake, planted thousands of trees throughout the area, and built a bathhouse which seemed to grow out of the hillside.” At bottom left of the panel is a photograph looking down the pier from roughly your current position. Instead of a building backed by trees, there is a bare hillside with a couple of trucks at the left. The caption reads, “Kendall Lake beach area before bathhouse construction, circa 1935. Park architects designed the bathhouse to fit into this landscape.” On the right side is a smaller photograph with an aerial view of the Kendall Lake Bathhouse circa 1937. It shows the pier, small figures of people around its edges, and the two-story bathhouse set back from its end. Many more figures are in the water to the right and on a beach which lies to the right of the pier. Today the former beach area is covered in grass. End of description.",

This trail is popular with cross country skiers who have the skill to handle hills.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Kendall Lake Trailhead. 455 words Here at the corner of the parking lot is a covered kiosk with a bulletin board and a graphic panel. Along the right side of the kiosk a paved path leads through a grassy area towards a pier which extends out into the small lake. Opposite the pier is a stone building. Directly behind you as you face the kiosk is a wayside graphic panel titled, “Honest Work.” The parking lot stretches to your left and behind you. The parking lot is edged with stone posts, one-foot square and ranging in height from one to two feet. Past the left side of the kiosk, the pavement leads to an unpaved path that enters the woods. The graphic panel on the kiosk is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the middle of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place of retreat from urban life. Building on this tradition, citizens worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked Earth Day and the Clean Water Act. “Coal industrialist Hayward Kendall willed his private retreat, later named Virginia Kendall Park, to the people of Ohio following his death in 1927. The Civilian Conservation Corps built Kendall Lake in 1934-35 for recreational use. For years, people flocked here for the swimming beach, toboggan run, and ice skating. Today’s visitors come to fish, rent snowshoes and cross-country skis, and enjoy nearby trails.” Text at the top of the wayside graphic reads, “The guard posts circling the parking lot are a result of the ‘honest work’ President Franklin D. Roosevelt believed the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, would provide young unemployed Americans. Conceived under Roosevelt’s New Deal, the CCC put 250,000 young men to work rebuilding the country during the Great Depression. For the guard post project, corpsmen were taught how to quarry local Berea Sandstone and shape it into 3-foot by 1-foot by 1-foot posts. These posts were then ‘planted’ around most area parking lots. Over 1,000 guard posts were paced around the roads and parking lots of Virginia Kendall Park. The project achieved three major CCC goals: developing the nation’s park areas; teaching vocational skills; and providing work for young men.” At the bottom of the panel is a photograph of the young men at work installing the guard posts. Next to the photo is an engineer’s drawing showing that most of the 3-foot height of the posts was buried in the ground. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Ledges Shelter. 438 words This wayside graphic panel faces a flagstone-paved patio sheltered by a long roof extending out towards us. A small stone building is at the far end of the shelter with another graphic panel on the wall there between sets of French doors. Under the shelter are two lines of picnic tables. Restrooms are located at the back of the building. As you face the panel to your right is a paved path leading from the parking lot behind you to the shelter. To the left is a wide, grassy lawn. At the top of the wayside panel is a quote from Franklin Delano Roosevelt which reads, “The overwhelming majority of unemployed Americans, who are now walking the streets and receiving private or public relief, would infinitely prefer to work. We can take a vast army of these unemployed out into healthful surroundings. We can eliminate to some extent at least the threat that enforced idleness brings to spiritual and moral stability.” Text to the right reads, “The Great Depression had left millions unemployed and desperate. In response to the crisis, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC. The Ledges Shelter, before you, is a product of this back-to-work program.” The bottom of the panel has photographs of young men working, positioning heavy wooden beams on top of posts and pouring concrete. One photo shows a large group posing in front of a bare work site. Alongside the photographs are several quotes on the CCC building program in the Virginia Kendall area from the shelter’s architect, a CCC supervisor, and the Director-Secretary of the Akron Metropolitan Park District in 1934. The graphic panel on the wall of the shelter is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the eastern edge of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature.

The connector trail behind the bulletin board leads to the 1.8-mile Ledges Trail. It circles the plateau and provides stunning views of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/learn-about-geology-rocks-ice-river.htm\">Sharon Sandstone and Conglomerate</a> rock formation.<br /> <br /> This area was part of the Ritchie Farm in the 1800s. Cleveland industrialist Hayward Kendall purchased the farm for a private retreat. Upon his death in 1927, he willed it to the people as a place for outdoor recreation. It became a state park named for Hayward’s mother, Virginia Kendall.<br /> <br /> Akron Metropolitan Park District (now Summit Metro Parks) took over operation of the park during the Great Depression. The park district recruited the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/legacy-of-the-ccc-at-cuyahoga-valley.htm\">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> to develop the park. Crews built the parking, trails, shelters, and large grassy playfield. It became part of Cuyahoga Valley National Park after 1974.<br /> <br /> Today, visitors can walk the trails and then linger at the many wooded picnic sites. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/ledges-shelter.htm\">Ledges Shelter</a> is <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/plan-your-event-at-cuyahoga-valley.htm\">available to rent</a> for family reunions and other events.

    "audioDescription": "Ledges Trailhead. 275 words This covered kiosk with a bulletin board and a graphic panel sits along a wide, paved path which is a continuation of the Ledges Road which provides automobile access to this area. The path then passes the Ledges Shelter on the left and heads into the woods. As you face the kiosk the parking lot lies over your left shoulder. The shelter with its restrooms may be reached by a path at the left end of the parking lot or by passing the kiosk and turning left to cross the grassy lawn. The graphic panel on the kiosk is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the eastern edge of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Coal industrialist Hayward Kendall willed his private retreat, later named Virginia Kendall Park, to the people of Ohio following his death in 1927. Managed by different agencies over the years, the park gave area residents more space for recreation and play. Most of the Virginia Kendall structures were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.” The bulletin board to the right of the panel has maps showing the network of looping trails available near this point.

Trees line either side of the path. To the left of the panel is a backless bench. Along the bottom of the panel is a touchable profile with braille labels of the lock system. The edges of the profile can be sharp. Lake Erie at 573 feet is at the right end. Forty-four locks form stair steps up to the 968-foot-high Portage Summit at the left end.

Their son Darwin lived next door and helped run the family dairy farm.” At upper right is an image of a receipt from Hawkins Cheese Factory dated July 1901. “Farmers were paid every month for the milk they sold to the cheese factory.” Below that is a photograph of a man wearing a vest and hat. He stands on a depot platform, holding a bicycle next to him. Stacks of round boxes sit at the left side of the depot. The caption reads, “In this self-portrait, photographer Edwin Bell Howe stands at the railroad depot with stacks of cheese wheels. The depot was across from the cheese factory at the intersection of Ira and Riverview roads. The depot was named for Ira Hawkins, whose land was crossed by the tracks.” End of description.",

It also provides parking for <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a> and the <a href=\"https://cuyahogariverwatertrail.org/\">Cuyahoga River Water Trail</a>.<br /> <br /> The trailhead is named for canal Lock 29. The path beyond the kiosk lets you walk into the lock. Exhibits explain the lock and an aqueduct that once carried the canal over the Cuyahoga River. On the towpath, travel 2.3 miles north to the historic village of Boston. About a mile south is Deep Lock and connecting trails to old stone quarries.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">railroad arrived</a> in 1880. Its construction removed one of the curves of the Cuyahoga River to reduce the need for bridges. Peninsula Depot now serves Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad passengers. The walkway near the trailhead entrance drive leads to the depot.<br /> <br /> The walkway also leads to Peninsula’s restaurants and shops. The area was settled originally as Connecticut’s Western Reserve. Stroll the village to enjoy New England-style architecture. As you browse, you might find yourself in a former bar, hotel, or immersed in a story of times past.<br /> <br /> At the trailhead, paddlers can use a put-in for the Cuyahoga River Water Trail. The <a href=\"https://www.buckeyetrail.org/\">Buckeye Trail</a>, a long-distance trail that circles Ohio, passes through the trailhead. Follow the blue blazes through town to go north or head south using the Towpath Trail.<br /> <br /> Late in the late 1800s, residents of the cities of Cleveland and Akron discovered the valley as a place for respite and relaxation. Today, Peninsula is a haven for cyclists, hikers, runners, paddlers, birders, and history buffs.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Lock 29 Trailhead. 428 words A three-sided, covered kiosk with a bulletin board and two graphic panels sits at the edge of the parking lot to the left of a sidewalk that leads to the Towpath Trail and more exhibits at Lock 29. As you face the kiosk, the river bend is to the left. Restrooms are located in a small building on the other side of the parking lot near the train tracks. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location in the middle of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Lock 29 Trailhead. The Ohio and Erie Canal made Peninsula a busy industrial town and popular overnight stop for canal travelers. The village had boatyards, mills, hotels, taverns, and other businesses. Today visitors can stroll through the historic downtown and stop to shop and dine. Travel 2.3 miles north on the towpath to the historic village of Boston. About a mile south is Deep Lock and connecting trails to old stone quarries.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines. Discover how culture, recreation, and natural scenic beauty are being revitalized by this national heritage area.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Locks were the highway interchanges of the Canal Era. While locks and highway interchanges have different functions, both help travelers through key transitions. Interchanges allow cars to enter and exit a highway. Locks allow boats to move up and down through changes in elevation. Lock 32 was one of 44 locks on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> between Lake Erie in Cleveland and the Portage Summit in Akron.<br /> <br /> As with highway interchanges, locks became places where businesses concentrated. Locks forced travelers to pause for a minimum of 20 minutes while a boat locked through. This wait provided time to visit local businesses. McBride’s Grocery served canallers at Lock 32.<br /> <br /> With the opening of the canal, Boston boomed. It grew from a small frontier hamlet to a bustling canal town. In time, stores, a tavern, hotel, blacksmith shop, boatyard, brickyard, lumberyard, broom factory, and warehouses would grow in the village.<br /> <br /> Boston is still a lived-in village, as evidenced by the houses to the west.

    "audioDescription": "Lock 32. 309 words This wayside graphic panel is near the right end of the lock walls, which are all that remain. This end of the lock is partially filled allowing access to the inside where the walls can be felt. Inside, the ground slopes down to the other end of the lock where the ground is marshy and may have standing water and higher vegetation. The left end of the lock has a wooden bridge with railings spanning the width giving closer views of that end. Text on the panel reads, “Boston Booms. The opening of the Ohio and Erie Canal turned Boston, a modest frontier settlement, into a thriving village. Between 1828 and 1836, increasing canal traffic sparked the opening of businesses. They included a blacksmith shop, hotel, tavern, two general stores, boatyard, brickyard, lumber mill, broom factory, and warehouse. McBride’s Grocery served canallers waiting to pass through Lock 32.” The right side of the panel has a black and white photograph of McBride’s Grocery next to Lock 32 with the Boston Store in the distance as the view would have been looking right from your current location. The buildings are white wood-frame with two stories. The lock gate is closed, some water spilling underneath it into the bottom of the lock while the water beyond is at a higher level. An arrow highlights the bare sandstone blocks on the walls of the lock, indicating that the photo was taken before 1905. Along the bottom of the panel is a touchable profile of the stairstep locks from the 968-foot high Portage Summit at Lock 1 at the right end and Lake Erie at 573-foot-elevation at the left end. You are currently at Lock 32 at Boston, to the left of the mid-point. As you explore the lock profile be careful of sharp corners on the stair steps. End of description.",

To manage water flow, locks such as this one were built the length of the canal. They functioned like hydraulic elevators, raising and lowering canal boats.The Murphy family had a farm at Lock 35. For two centuries, farming was the main occupation throughout the valley. Small farms such as theirs shipped products out on the canal. Paul Murphy wrote <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/paul-murphy-remembers-the-1913-flood.htm\">several essays</a> describing the “laughter and tears” of growing up here. The graphic panel includes quotes and images shared by his descendants.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Lock 35. 288 words The towpath here runs through quiet woods. The canal bed is dry and the lock is mostly filled with dirt, leaving a grassy area inside and on either side of the remaining low, stone walls. The inside of the lock may be reached from either end. Touch the walls inside to feel the weathered blocks. Text on the small wayside graphic panel reads, “Laughter and Tears. ‘There was no electricity, no running water,’ Paul Murphy recalled about growing up on a farm just south of here in the early 1900s. ‘In winter our house was heated by a stove in the living room and a cook stove in the kitchen. Homemade bread, biscuits, and pies were made from the flour that we brought back from the Wilson mill. Many a joyful trip was made in the sleigh behind our faithful horse, with the music of bells to accompany the songs we sang. The canal was a favorite spot for skating parties of people of all ages. We had our full share of both pleasure and frustration, of laughter and tears.’” At bottom left is a small black and white photograph of Paul and his mother Emma. It shows a gray-haired woman with wire-rimmed glasses and a dark-haired man. The caption tells us that Paul wrote about his memories in a manuscript entitled “Treasures of the Valley, A True Experience.” The right side of the panel shows a 1939 painting of the Murphy farmhouse by Maude McKisson, Paul’s sister-in-law. The winter scene looks south with the canal running along the left and a small log house sitting at the right. The banks are snow covered and the scene is lit only by a full moon.

    "audioDescription": "Lock 36. 376 words This wayside graphic panel is located near a fork in the path where a side trail separates from the Towpath Trail and loops to the west along the river. As you face the panel, the fork is to the left. The river is behind you. The Towpath Trail crosses a footbridge in front of you which goes over a channel of water. The channel runs from the river at the right and connects with the canal downstream at the left. The canal runs along the base of a wooded slope on the far side of the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “Feeding the Canal. Soon after this canal section opened in 1827, engineers built the Pinery Dam and Brecksville Feeder. This channel carries water from the Cuyahoga River into the canal at Lock 36. Originally the additional water maintained a proper depth for canal boats. Today this feeder provides water to the longest intact section of the Ohio and Erie Canal, a national historic landmark.” At the lower left is a 1907 photograph taken from the large hill to your left. It shows three channels of water – the Cuyahoga River on the right, the Ohio and Erie Canal on the right and the Brecksville Feeder on an angle connecting the two. The caption reads, “On the far side of today’s trail bridge, notice the remnants of Lock 36. The lock chamber was filled when the Brecksville-Northfield High-Level Bridge was built in the 1930s.” The right side of the panel is filled with a 1900 photograph of a team of three horses waiting to resume towing a boat in Lock 36. They stand at the left with a man on the towpath. A boat sits in the canal which runs down the right side of the picture. A small building is on the right side of the canal and a hillside rises steeply in the background. The slope has far fewer trees compared to today. At the top of the panel is a quote from the Ohio Canal Division Reports, 1880, which reads, “The dam and feeder are said to be in good condition. This furnishes all the extra water needed between this point and Cleveland and has always been ample.” End of description.",

Businesses often sprang up at these spots, making use of the stopped traffic or the power of the falling water. Here at Lock 37, there was a tavern and a store. During the mid-1800s, the Alexanders built a mill across from this tavern. In time, that mill was sold to the Wilson family, who still own the business today. Regulating a constant four feet of water in the canal is a challenge. From the beginning, engineers struggled with too much or too little water. Near this busy lock is a flood gate that allows excess water to be released from the canal into the nearby Cuyahoga River. Even today this lock remains busy—being near the Towpath Trail, the Wilson Feed Mill, and the access road to the Fitzwater Trainyard. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Audio Description. Lock 37 and Water Control Gate. 432 words. At this point on the Towpath Trail near the concrete marker for mile 14 there are two small graphic wayside panels. On the canal side is one titled “Lock 37” which sits next to the old lock which has water at its bottom. The sides of the lock are weathered, worn concrete covering the upper part and the underlying blocks visible below. The gates are gone, but there is a stationary barrier, stone at the bottom, wooden beams above, which blocks the downstream end. There is no guardrail at the edge of the 10-foot-deep lock. The graphic panel features an artist’s illustration of a freight boat in the lock in 1863. A large white building beyond the lock on the left is the Alexander/Wilson Mill, still there today partially hidden by trees. The illustration shows several buildings on the right, now gone, which were the Vanoucek tavern, store, house and barn. Text on the panel reads, “Family Businesses. Canal locks attracted businesses to serve canal boat crews, locals, and farmers. Here at Lock 37 the Vanouceks ran a tavern and general store and the Alexander family operated a gristmill. A spillway allowed excess water to flow around the lock. The mill used the spillway’s waterpower to grind grain into flour and livestock feed.” The other wayside panel, titled “Floods and Repairs,” is down the path to the right as you face the lock. It sits on the other side of the path near the river which lies close to the canal at this point. Just past the panel is a wooden bridge without railings that crosses a small channel which carries water between the canal on the left and the river on the right. Four gear-like mechanisms line the right side of the bridge which control openings in a gate below. Text on the panel reads, “Regulating Water Level. Canal engineers did not foresee the intensity of valley floods and later added structures to control water levels. Here a National Park Service worker adjusts a floodgate built in the early 1900s. Look closely at the actual structure. Can you see the small gates below where the worker is standing? Gates are opened to drain off water so canal repairs can be made here or downstream. During floods, excess water is diverted to protect the canal from being damaged. A waste way takes the water to the Cuyahoga River.” The photograph on the panel shows a man in a National Park Service uniform using a long metal rod to turn one of the gear mechanisms.

On summer weekends when conditions allow, volunteers demonstrate how a lock operates. Canals were designed as waterways without waterfalls or a current. Locks were built to raise or lower canal boats wherever there was a significant change in elevation. A lock works much like a toy in a bathtub. If a boat needs to go up, water is let in through butterfly valves in the upstream gate. The chamber is filled until it is level with the upstream water. If the boat needs to go down, water is let out through butterfly valves in the downstream gate. When the water is low enough to match the downstream level, the downstream gates can be opened. To fit inside the locks on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a>, boats could be no more than 75 feet long.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Lock 38. 470 words This wayside graphic panel sits at the downstream end of the lock. Behind the exhibit, a small wooden footbridge crosses to the other side. To the right of the bridge are the heavy wooden gates that close this end of the lock. Each gate has a long wooden beam attached along its top and extending out to the side. A similar pair of gates sit at the upper end of the lock to the right. On the other side of the towpath is a white-frame building that held a tavern and store. To the left of the lock is a road and bridge crossing the canal. That road ends at the scenic byway on the far side. The inside walls of the lock are made of concrete-covered stone blocks. The tops of the walls are even with the ground and there is no guardrail. At the left side of the panel, text reads, “Lock 38 is one of the few restored, working locks along the historic Ohio and Erie Canal. Locks are like elevators – they raise and lower boats between levels. State engineers designed 44 locks to deal with a 395-foot rise in elevation from Cleveland to Akron. Heavy wooden gates enclose the boat-sized stone chamber. Lock operators added water to the chamber to raise a boat headed upstream. They drained out water to lower a boat headed downstream.” The right side of the panel has a drawing of one of the wooden gates with its beam extending over the lock wall to the right, a man pushing on the end. Arrows indicate features of the diagram. The caption next to the end of the beam reads, “Balance beam. A long beam balances out each heavy gate. The beam makes it possible to open and close the gate by hand.” At the bottom of the gate is a small door called a wicket. The caption reads, “The gates cannot open unless the water level is the same on both sides. A valve at the bottom of each gate, called a wicket, lets water in or out.” At the top of the gate is a long shaft called a wicket stem connected to the wicket below. The caption reads, “Boatmen opened and closed the wicket using a large wrench to turn the wicket stem and pivot the wicket.” The gate itself is called a whaler gate. The caption reads, “Two gates at each end keep the water in the chamber.” At lower left is a photograph of the lock empty of water, showing the smooth vertical walls and a flooring made of wooden beams. The caption reads, “In the 1980s National Park Service workers restored Lock 38 to how it looked in 1907. This was just after the state lined locks with concrete. Notice the wooden floor.” End of description.",

Boats carried timber and farm products to Lake Erie and returned with manufactured goods and specialty foods.<br /> <br /> Unlike Ohio’s rivers, canals offered a consistent depth for boats to travel and no current. Yet the land they travel through is not flat. Water is travelling north from a high point near Portage Lakes in Akron, down 395 feet to the level of Lake Erie at Cleveland. Whenever the drop of water or land was significant, a lock was installed to move boats up or down. In effect, locks acted as elevators for boats. Water would be let in from the higher side to raise the water level, or let out on the lower side to lower the boats.<br /> <br /> Originally locks were made of carved sandstone, and often lined or “puddled” with clay to keep them from leaking. But water takes its toll. During 1905-1906 renovations, this sandstone lock was refaced with a new concrete surface, now also wearing away.<br /> <br /> Along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a>, a graphic panel describes the function of the locks.

    "audioDescription": "Here on the canal is an old lock structure. At the side of the towpath near the lock a graphic panel describes the function of the locks. At the bottom of the panel is a touchable profile of the 44 stair-step locks between Lake Erie in Cleveland and the portage summit in Akron. To the right of the panel is a bench made of wooden beams between two concrete bases. Across the path from the canal is an overgrown field backed by woods.  The canal and lock contain water. The sides of the lock are made of stone and concrete. At the left, or northern end, a small footbridge crosses the lock to a grassy area on the other side. The end of the lock closest to the graphic panel is closed with a thick, wooden barrier keeping the water level feet below ground level. On the northern side of the barrier gate, the water is ten feet below the ground level. Exercise caution near the lock as there is no guardrail. Water trickles under the barrier to fall into the deep lock.  The background of the graphic shows a black and white photograph of a functional lock. The view up the lock shows the block walls and water splashing through the partially open, heavy wooden gate at the end. A note tells us that “Canal managers covered the blocks with concrete during a 1905-1906 renovation.” Along the bottom of the panel is a touchable profile with braille labels of the lock system. The edges of the profile can be sharp. Lake Erie at 573 feet is at the left end. Forty-four locks form stair steps up to 968-foot-high Portage Summit at the right end. In between are Boston at Lock 32, Peninsula at Lock 29, and Mustill Store at Lock 15. Text on the panel reads,   “Stepping Up and Down. Locks act like elevators, raising and lowering boats. Most locks along the Ohio and Erie Canal had a lift of about nine feet. It took 44 locks to manage the 395-foot elevation rise between Cleveland and Akron. Canal engineers numbered locks in both directions from Akron’s Portage Summit. In operation from 1827 to 1913, the canal turned the sleepy village of Cleveland into a major port. Boats carried timber and farm products to Lake Erie and returned with manufactured goods and specialty foods.”  End of description. ",

    "audioDescription": "Lock 39 Trailhead. 470 words A three-sided, covered kiosk sits at the side of the smooth, unpaved Towpath Trail next to a small bench. One side has a bulletin board with current news, while the other two sides have graphic panels. On the other side of the path is the canal, water at its bottom and a steep, brush-covered bank on the other side. A wooden post next to the canal has a small sign that reads “Lock 39, Towpath Trail.” Going left on the path leads to Cleveland Metroparks. Going right leads to the Canal Exploration Center. Trees and bushes line the side of the path opposite the canal. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location at the northern end of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Lock 39 Trailhead. The Rockside name probably comes from the many small quarries that once dotted this area. Travel by foot, bicycle, or rail to learn about Ohio’s transportation history. Canal Exploration Center is 1.75 miles south on the Towpath Trail. The CanalWay Center of Cleveland Metroparks is about four miles north. From the nearby trailhead parking lot, cross the footbridge to reach Rockside Station. This is the northern starting point for the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines. Discover how culture, recreation, and natural scenic beauty are being revitalized by this national heritage area.” End of description.",

Local farmers came to the mill to have their grain ground and then shipped out to distant markets on canal boats. When the Valley Railway arrived in 1880, it competed with the canal.

    "audioDescription": "Moody and Thomas Mill Site. 277 words This wayside graphic panel is on the left side of the Towpath Trail as you cross the bridge over the Cuyahoga River. As you face the panel, the river makes a bend in front of you, turning to pass to your left then bending away from you to continue north. To the right is a backless bench alongside the towpath which continues to the south. On the other side of the path, directly behind you, are the remains of the aqueduct, which carried the canal over the river. All that is left are partial walls made of sandstone blocks. In front of you between the panel and the river are ruined walls from the old gristmill, half buried by trees and other vegetation. Text on the panel reads, “Gristmill, Reaching Distant Markets. In 1832 Hermon Bronson built a gristmill here to grind wheat into flour. He shipped the flour to market on the Ohio and Erie Canal. After the Valley Railway arrived, the mill built a bridge over the river. Wagons carried grain from the train and returned with loads of flour and livestock feed. Chandler Moody and Charles Thomas bought and enlarged the mill in 1902.” The panel is filled with a color-tinted photograph of the mill taken from the south, right of your current position. The large white frame building has three floors with an even taller section on the right topped by a cupola. The canal runs from the foreground past the mill on the left. A caption reads, “A fire destroyed the Moody and Thomas Mill in 1931. Fine dust from grain processing is highly combustible.” End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Mudcatcher. 241 words The towpath here winds between the canal and the river with woods on either side. On the canal side is a graphic wayside panel titled “Mudcatcher, Filtering the Flow.” On the far side of the canal, a stream runs down between two steep slopes towards the canal and river. Between the slopes is a dam-like structure made of large stone blocks. An opening in the middle allows the water to fall in a short waterfall into a pool below when the stream is running. Text on the panel reads, “Soil washing into the canal created an ongoing problem. Storms eroded upland fields and hillsides left treeless by farmers. Engineers usually built culverts under the canal to carry streams into the Cuyahoga River. Here the intermittent Galley Run flows directly into the canal. A mudcatcher – the stone structure in front of you – held back the soil in a basin. Crews dug out the mud and debris during the dry season. “With its basin full of muck, the mudcatcher no longer functions. Do you see sediment building up in the canal today? The National Park Service periodically needs to dredge this watered section.” The panel has a photograph of the scene in front of you with the parts labeled. Arrows indicate the steep sides of the ravine cut by the stream, the historic dam-like mudcatcher structure itself, and a pile of dirt and gravel between the mudcatcher and the canal.

    "audioDescription": "Mule Power. 430 words At the side of the wide towpath is a free-standing graphic panel with a touchable model of a mule. Five feet to the right of the graphic is a life-size model of a mule which is also touchable. As you face the graphic, the canal is behind you, water in its bottom. Down the path to the right is the Canal Exploration Center and a working lock. Text on the panel reads, “Towing Canal Boats. Hi, I’m Blossom. During the canal days, mules like me walked the towpath, pulling heavy boats behind us. We were strong engines, able to haul 60 tons or more of freight. Mules worked in teams of two or three. Cargo boats had a middle cabin to stable a second team. The two teams switched every six hours. “Some people say mules are stubborn, but I think we’re just smart. Horses can work themselves to an early grave. Mules have enough sense to stop when we’re tired. And we refuse to do anything dangerous. Over time horses will get mouth and harness sores. Not mules. We are also cheaper to feed. Now I’m not saying horses are bad. They are faster than mules. Early passenger boats used teams of horses when speed was more important than endurance. I got my intelligence from my father. He’s a donkey. I got my athletic ability from my mother. She’s a horse. What is the best trait that you inherited from each parent?” At bottom left of the panel is a black and white photograph of boy leading a team down a towpath. The caption reads, “After the Civil War, canal boats became family businesses. One of the captain’s children was often the muleskinner, leading the team along the towpath. Horses, like the ones in this photo, weren’t as strong as mules.” At upper right is a color photograph of a two-mule team hauling a boat. The caption reads, “Mules pull a boat on the Miami and Erie Canal near Toledo, Ohio. Notice the long tow rope and how the team is hitched nose-to-tail.” To explore the small touchable mule model, start at the head at the left. Notice the long ears and, moving down the neck, the short mane. The neck collar of the harness has two prongs at the top. Move back along the body to feel the strap around its girth and leading backward. At the mule’s rear, notice the tail is wrapped along half its length. The life-size model to the right is the same, although it is facing the other direction. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Octagon Shelter. 436 words This wayside graphic panel faces this dark brown, wooden structure. At right the building is shaped like an 8-sided octagon. One of two wide stone fireplace chimneys is on the side closest to us. At left, a wing extends out to the side. During the warmer months, several side panels are removed. Inside the floor is paved with flagstones and picnic tables are arranged around the walls. In the center is a central column surround by a built-in bench. On the far side of the left wing is a patio area with more picnic tables and access to the restrooms. A wide grassy lawn extends around the left side bordered by trees. Text on the wayside panel reads, “Parkitecture. The Octagon Shelter, like most Civilian Conservation Corps structures, used ‘rustic style’ architecture developed in the early 1900s by National Park Service planners. Coined ‘parkitecture,’ rustic style emphasizes low silhouettes, horizontal lines, and colors and materials found in local surroundings. The octagon shape is reminiscent of shelters found in the Adirondack Mountains, which provide sweeping views of the surrounding area.” The bottom of the panel has an architect’s drawing of this side of the building showing the octagon-shaped pavilion at right and the wing extending to the left. At left a quote reads, “The use of native materials in proper scale, and the thorough avoidance of rigid, straight lines, and over sophistication, gives the feeling of having been executed by pioneer craftsmen with limited hand tools. It achieves sympathy with natural surroundings and with the past. – A.H. Good, Akron architect and designer of Virginia Kendall facilities, defining rustic architecture.” On a wall inside the shelter is a graphic panel titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” which features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the eastern side of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park.

Coal industrialist Hayward Kendall willed his private retreat, later named Virginia Kendall Park, to the people of Ohio following his death in 1927. Managed by different agencies over the years, the park gave area residents more space for recreation and play.

The Canalway Partners and the Ohio & Erie Canalway Coalition both serve as the coordinating entity for the heritage area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{11}\" paraid=\"9\">When the Ohio and Erie Canal was built between 1825 and 1832, there were only 22 states at the time. Nineteenth-century Ohio was geographically isolated from the economic prosperity of the east by the Appalachian Mountains. A lack of transit routes made obtaining and exporting goods and services difficult. Upon its completion in 1832, the Canal connected Lake Erie and the Ohio River to the Erie Canal, creating a vital transportation route between the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, allowing resources to flow more freely across Ohio and the nation. It is known for providing “routes of prosperity.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{27}\" paraid=\"10\">The creation of this inland water transportation system was a key point in the nation’s journey to becoming self-reliant on resource development, rather than relying on European trade routes. The Ohio & Erie Canal attracted pioneers, immigrants, and entrepreneurs to the region, leading to interconnected and thriving communities blossoming with opportunity for new business and industry. As the rise of railroads led to decreased use of the canal for transportation, industrial development continued on the canal's banks to harness its hydroelectric power.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{33}\" paraid=\"11\">In March of 1913, Ohio experienced a great flood, considered to be the second deadliest flood in the United States and the most devastating natural disaster Ohio ever experienced. The Ohio and Erie Canal was damaged beyond repair and ultimately abandoned. While this hurt local communities, their tenacity was unwavering. Community members knew the vitality of this region would be long-lasting if they worked to connect people back to their shared history of the Canalway. Today, the canal is still used for transportation, but this time for hiking, running, and cycling along the Towpath Trail, a recreation path that follows the old Canalway route and continues to connect the region's communities.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{90}\" paraid=\"19\">Historic Sites and Points of Interest: </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{96}\" paraid=\"20\"><a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/the-towpath-trail/\">Towpath Trail and Greenway</a>   </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{106}\" paraid=\"21\"><a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/cuyahoga-valley-scenic-railroad/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"3\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{114}\" paraid=\"22\"><a href=\"https://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/explore/americas-byway/\">National Scenic Byway</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"4\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{122}\" paraid=\"23\"><a href=\"https://www.wrhs.org/\">Western Reserve Historical Society</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"5\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"5\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{130}\" paraid=\"24\"><a href=\"https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/parks/visit/parks/ohio-erie-canal-reservation\">Ohio & Erie Canal Reservation</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"6\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"6\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{138}\" paraid=\"25\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-cuyahoga-river-recovers.htm\">Industrial Valley & Cuyahoga River</a></p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"7\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"7\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{146}\" paraid=\"26\"><a href=\"http://www.ohioeriecanal.org/howehouse.html\">Richard Howe House</a>  </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"8\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"8\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{156}\" paraid=\"27\"><a href=\"https://www.visitcanton.com/directory/congressman-ralph-regula-canalway-center/\">Congressman Ralph Regula Canalway Center</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"9\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"9\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{164}\" paraid=\"28\"><a href=\"http://cityofcanalfulton-oh.gov/\">Canal Fulton</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"10\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"10\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{172}\" paraid=\"29\"><a href=\"https://historiczoarvillage.com/\">Historic Zoar Village</a> </p> </li> </ol> <h2 paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{184}\" paraid=\"31\">Notable People: </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"4\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{190}\" paraid=\"32\"><a href=\"https://www.summithistory.org/simon-perkins-family\">Simon Perkins</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"4\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{bab71845-eb61-4fc0-85b2-462792484711}{198}\" paraid=\"33\"><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-D-Rockefeller\">John D.

Directly behind you, on the other side of the path, the ground slopes away steeply. Text at the top of the panel reads, “While many Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, crews worked on projects involving flood control and soil erosion, Company 576 focused on building recreational facilities at Virginia Kendall Park. Projects were diverse and included: a lake for fishing, swimming, and skating; hiking trails; picnic shelters; and even toboggan chutes. The slope in front of you is a remnant of the most recent toboggan run, built in 1939. Many of the large evergreens lining the slope were planted at the same time to provide shelter and shade for the iced toboggan runs. The tunnel to your right was constructed to allow visitors to hike the foot trail without having to cross the toboggan slide.’ At bottom left is a photograph of four people, broad smiles on their faces, seated on a toboggan with a curved-up front sliding down an icy trough through the woods, snow covering the ground.

The caption reads, “CCC projects like the toboggan chutes helped promote year-round recreation in the 1930s and 1940s.” End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Old Canal Bed. 386 words This wayside graphic panel sits on a wooden footbridge across the mostly dry canal bed, connecting the Towpath Trail with a hiking path through the woods to the east of the canal. There is a bench on the bridge to the right of the panel. The stream bed below may or may not have water, depending on the season and recent rainfall. The right side of the panel has a color illustration looking down the canal bed, towpath to the left. The back of the drawing shows the view as it would have been when the canal was in use, a boat floating on water in the canal with a team of mules on the towpath. The front part of the drawing shows the scene as the canal returns to nature, with vegetation growing in the dry canal bed and animals – a racoon and two deer – on the right. Text at the left reads, “Letting Nature Take its Course. Nature has been reclaiming the Ohio and Erie Canal since the Great Flood of 1913 ended operations of this artificial waterway. The national park maintains a watered section north of Station Road Bridge but otherwise manages the canal as a ruin. A more natural flow of water allows habitats to recover. “Look around. A headwater stream meanders down the valley wall behind you and across the canal bed. Shade trees and shrubs are returning, keeping the water cool to support more aquatic life. Leaves fall among the wet rocks and break down into food for small bottom-dwelling animals. Small streams like this one drain into the Cuyahoga River and are vital to its health.” At bottom left is a photograph of a woman in park uniform kneeling beside a small stream. She looks down at a small salamander in her palm. The caption reads, “Scientists look for salamanders and aquatic insects as living indicators of clean water. Cobblestones clean of silt are another sign.” At top right is an image of a salamander, looking similar to a lizard but without scaly skin. An inset photo shows a stonefly nymph (a long, thin insect with a yellow and black striped body and forked tail) floating underwater. The caption reads, “Northern dusky salamanders and some aquatic insects they eat are very sensitive to pollution.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Peninsula Depot is a ticketing office and boarding location for <a href=\"https://www.cvsr.org/\">Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad</a>. It is also the only historic depot remaining in the valley. However, even it has gone through change.<br /> <br /> When the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Valley Railway</a> opened in 1880, every community along its route through the Cuyahoga Valley had a depot. A fire destroyed the original Peninsula Depot in the 1960s. In 1968, local designer and historic preservationist Robert Hunker purchased the depot in the village of Boston and moved it two miles to this location. Thus, today’s Peninsula Depot started its life as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/boston-mill-station.htm\">Boston Mill Depot</a>.<br /> <br /> The Peninsula Depot is a typical combination station that served passengers and freight. Railroads were among the first companies to standardize business practices, including building architecture. A station agent operated the depot from the middle office, selling tickets, planning travel itineraries, and reporting freight and express movements.<br /> <br /> Shops, restaurants, and trails are a short walk from the depot. To reach restrooms and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a>, cross the tracks at the designated crossing and walk the path along the river to the right. Follow the blue blazes to the east and up an old road to access the Valley and <a href=\"https://www.buckeyetrail.org/\">Buckeye</a> trails.

    "audioDescription": "Peninsula Depot. 271 words The train station is a red building with white trim and a red roof. Four steps with handrails on either side lead up to the main platform. The platform has a red door straight ahead with a wall mounted sign to the right. It reads “Peninsula Depot” and has sections for train, arriving, departing, from, to, and remarks. To the right is a red bench on the edge of the platform. To the left of the door is a bay window. A sign with the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad winged logo hangs from the center section. Directly behind you are the train tracks. A paved path over the tracks connects to a path on the other side. To the right of the main steps is a ramp with rails on both sides that leads to the back of the depot. Behind the depot to the right is the Trail Mix Peninsula store. There are several picnic tables, one wheelchair accessible, in the paved area out front. A black floor mat leads from the foot of the step to the picnic area. A paved trail runs parallel to the tracks, leading past Trail Mix to a parking lot for a local restaurant. Across the tracks to the right is the parking area for Century Cycles. To the left of the main steps, beside the depot, is an open shelter with white posts and a red roof. It has seating to wait for the train. Down the path on the other side of the tracks is a red building with a black roof. It is an accessible public restroom. End of description.",

The background of the panel features an artist’s sketch of a settlement of small, rectangular log buildings. Text on the panel reads, “Escaping Conflict. Fleeing intolerance, 95 Christian Lenape and six Moravian-German missionaries spent ten months nearby in 1786-87. Their temporary village was later called Pilgerruh, or Pilgrim’s Rest. After a harvest of corn and other vegetables, the group overwintered and then continued on. When the American Revolution began, all sides distrusted these pacifists. Traditional American Indian were suspicious of their Anglo ways. The British had removed the group from the Gnadenhutten settlement in Tuscarawas County south of here. In the following year, 1782, some returned to harvest corn, and were massacred by a Pennsylvania militia. Pause to consider how the Cuyahoga Valley was a short-lived refuge during violent times.” To the right of the text is a small portrait of Pilgerruh missionary David Zeisberger, dressed in a plain brown jacket with his wavy brown hair reaching below his collar. In the upper right is a drawing of several men dressed in fringed leather clothing standing over a pile of bodies as they attack with guns, knives and clubs. The caption reads, “In 1782 Pennsylvania militia attacked Christian Lenape at the Moravian Mission in Gnadenhutten, Ohio. They massacred over 90, a third of whom were children. Among the few young survivors, Jacob and Thomas rejoined David Zeisberger and others.” End of description.",

Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place of retreat from urban life. Building on this tradition, citizens worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked Earth Day and the Clean Water Act. “Pine Grove Trailhead. Coal industrialist Hayward Kendall willed his private retreat, later named Virginia Kendall Park, to the people of Ohio following his death in 1927.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Pine Hollow Trailhead is a large parking area and outdoor recreation hub that sits at the top of the Kendall Hills. It is a place where you can set your own pace. Race down the hills on a sled on a snowy day. Slow down to enjoy the scenery and nearby trails.<br /> <br /> In the 1800s, the Ritchie family farmed this area. As Cleveland and Akron became major industrial cities after the Civil War, business leaders began buying farmland for valley retreats. Cleveland industrialist Hayward Kendall purchased much of the area. He willed his property to the state for a park and asked that it be named for his mother, Virginia Kendall.<br /> <br /> Kendall Hills was not part of the original Virginia Kendall Park. In 1936 the Akron Metropolitan Park District wrote to neighbor A.A. Stambaugh, vice-president of Standard Oil, offering to lease the property. Winter sports enthusiasts were spilling over from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/kendall-lake-through-the-years.htm\">Kendall Lake area</a> for coasting and skiing whenever the toboggan chutes were crowded. Stambaugh said that wasn’t necessary, he was happy to see the land used.<br /> <br /> Today, the scenery is dominated by oak, hickory, and beech woodlands that have reclaimed the former farmland surrounding the hills. Dark green of stands of white and red pines dot the woodlands. They were planted by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/legacy-of-the-ccc-at-cuyahoga-valley.htm\">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> in the 1930s to hurry forest regeneration. The hills themselves are a mix of mowed grass and meadow. In late summer, meadow flowers attract butterflies and other pollinators.<br /> <br /> Pine Hollow provides access to the park’s interconnected trail system. The 3.3-mile Salt Run Trail starts to the left of the parking when facing the hills. The 4.5-mile Wetmore Trail is across Quick Road. Connector trails lead downhill to the 1-mile Lake and 2.3-mile Cross Country trails.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Pine Hollow. 303 words At the side of this parking lot there is a covered kiosk with a bulletin board and a graphic panel. As you face the kiosk to your left is a paved walk leading to a building with rest rooms. On your right, the narrow parking lot stretches out in front of you and behind you. Over your left shoulder is a wide grassy slope falling away from the parking lot and edged with thick woods. Along the side of the parking lot is a row of picnic tables. On the far side of the kiosk is a board fence with signs that read, “Warming Area.” The graphic panel on the kiosk is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location in the southern part of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act.” “Pine Hollow.

    "bodyText": "<p>Pine Lane Trailhead is an access point for two of the longest trails in the national park. It is located at a high spot in the middle of Cuyahoga Valley, off State Route 303. This is a good choice for hikers and runners who prefer solitude, scenic views, and the physical challenge of hills. See our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/hiking.htm\">hiking page</a> for trip planning information.<br /> <br /> The Buckeye Trail makes a 1,400-mile circle across Ohio. It is managed by the <a href=\"https://www.buckeyetrail.org/\">Buckeye Trail Association</a> which divides the trail into 26 sections and offers detailed maps. The route is marked by blue blazes, often painted on the trees. Hikers can enjoy day trips or plan for through-hiking. The section north from Pine Lane wanders 2.5 miles through upland forest along the east rim before crossing the valley’s floodplain in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/village-of-boston.htm\">Boston</a>. There it heads up the western valley wall to Blue Hen Falls and beyond. The south section quickly joins the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a> in Peninsula and explores the lowlands along the historic <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a>. Access it by following the parking lot west to the old Pine Lane and turning right, down the old brick road.<br /> <br /> The Valley Trail is shared by hikers and horseback riders. It goes the length of the park, connecting with other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/horse-trails.htm\">horse trails</a> to the north and south. The Pine Lane parking lot is small and does not have designated trailer spaces. It is not an ideal starting place for riders, but some may travel through. Remember that horses always have the right of way. If hikers encounter a horse, stay visible and greet the rider. Stand off the trail and keep any <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">pets</a> on a short leash. Allow plenty of space to pass and avoid sudden movements. Horse trails can be muddy, so plan your footwear wisely. The section north goes through Boston in 2.4 miles, crosses the floodplain at Jaite, and continues into Brecksville Reservation. The section south connects with the Wetmore trail system in 3.8 miles and the Everett area trails beyond.<br /> <br /> The land around this trailhead was once owned by Fred C. Kelly. Kelly was a nationally known newspaper columnist, humorist, and Wright Brothers biographer. He had a passion for conservation, helping form the first Cuyahoga Valley Association. In the 1940s, he infamously carried an axe on his walks to chop up tacky billboards along State Route 303. Pine Lane was named for all the trees he planted on his property.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Pine Lane Trailhead. 236 words Here at the side of the small parking lot is a covered kiosk with a bulletin board and a graphic panel. Along the right side of the kiosk an unpaved trail that a small sign identifies as Buckeye Trail leads off through the overgrown fields towards the woods at the right. On the other side of the trail is a small building with a toilet. The graphic panel on the kiosk is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location near the middle of the park indicated.

The first is a horse trail that connects the horse trails to the south with those of Cleveland Metroparks to the north. The Buckeye Trail, part of a 1,200-mile loop around Ohio, is a favorite among local hikers and runners. It provides backcountry views, solitude, and physical challenge.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/damming-the-cuyahoga-in-brecksville.htm\">Pinery Feeder Dam</a> was built in 1827 during the construction of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a>. It consisted of a wooden crib dam, a gate, and a feeder channel. This system diverted Cuyahoga River water to “feed” the canal from Brecksville to Cuyahoga Heights. The concrete Brecksville Diversion Dam was added in 1951-52. About 120 feet north, the newer dam created a dam pool that hid the old wooden structure underwater.<br /> <br /> Dams harm fish habitat, change water temperatures, and alter the natural flow of water and sediment through our waterways. In 2020, the National Park Service and its partners <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/dam-removal.htm\">removed these dams</a> to help wildlife recover and to make our water cleaner. After almost 200 years, the Cuyahoga once again flows freely here. A modern screw pump will help maintain the proper water level in the nearby section of canal that is designated a national historic landmark. This was the best solution for protecting both natural and cultural resources.<br /> <br /> From here, visitors can go north or south on the Towpath Trail. To the north are the remains of Lock 36, one of many water-filled “elevators” that raised or lowered canal boats. Beyond is the Mudcatcher and a view of a bald eagle nest across the river. To the south is a connector trail to Station Road Bridge with restrooms and more exhibits.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Restoring the River. 474 words This wayside graphic panel at the side of a path that heads west from the Towpath Trail towards the river, crosses a feeder channel which takes water from the river to the canal, and rejoins the main trail farther south, to the right as you face the sign. Ahead of you, past the sign, is a concrete structure containing a gate which controls the flow of water through the channel into the canal. Rail tracks run along the river on the far side. A highway crosses the valley here over a multi-arched bridge which towers above you. The graphic panel has photographs of two dams which were built at this location on the river. In upper right is a black and white photograph of water spilling over the 1827 wooden Pinery Dam, located just downstream of the gate into the feeder channel. The larger photograph at the left shows the 1952 Brecksville Canal Diversion Dam, which was built slightly downstream from the older dam, and partially destroyed it, hiding its ruins under water. In both pictures the river flows smoothly over the barriers, with drops of only a few feet. Text on the panel reads, “Removing Barriers. Restoring the Cuyahoga River as a healthy, free-flowing river has many challenges. A major goal is removing dams that block fish migrations and degrade natural wildlife habitats. Here two dams diverted water into this section of the Ohio and Erie Canal, a designated national historic landmark. Park managers must balance protecting natural and cultural resources. Could engineers design a new way to water the canal without a barrier? The 1827 dam fed a canal that grew the national economy. The 1952 one provided water to downstream steel mills. What role will a healthier river play in Ohio’s economy?” In the bottom right is a map of this area, with north pointing to the right. Along the top of the map is the railroad with the river running just below it. The Brecksville-Northfield bridge runs east to west up through the middle of the map, with your current position to the left of it, just east of the river. The gate across the feeder channel is near your position, with the channel itself running to the right to meet the canal, which runs closer to the bottom of the map. The position of the two dams are indicated between the gate and the bridge. The caption reads, “After the dams are removed in 2019, a pump system will keep the most intact portions of the historic canal watered.” At the bottom of the panel are images of a rainbow darter, brightly marked with orange and turquoise, and a smallmouth bass. The caption tells us that these fish are among the species whose populations are expected to improve with the removal of the dams. End of description.",

The small trailhead has fifteen parking spaces and does not accommodate over-sized vehicles. It serves several trails in the park’s interconnected trail system. Its name comes from a nearby lock on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail</a>.<br /> <br /> Head out on the Towpath Trail to observe how nature is reclaiming old industrial sites and canal ruins. As you bike, walk, or jog north, look for wildlife. The area is a hotspot for birding, especially during spring migration. In 0.7 miles is the first of two intersections with the Old Carriage Trail. Turn right up a steep hill to explore the Greenwood Village site. This section is also a connector to the <a href=\"https://www.summitmetroparks.org/bike-and-hike-trail.aspx\">Bike & Hike Trail</a> at Holzhauer Road. About a half-mile south is the site of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jaite-a-paper-mill-and-company-town.htm\">Jaite Paper Mill</a>, once a large employer in Cuyahoga Valley. The mill made paper, provided jobs, and shaped local communities.

This hiking and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/horse-trails.htm\">horse trail</a> follows the Towpath south before veering to the left beyond the former paper mill. To head north on the trail, cross the Cuyahoga River on Vaughn Road. The entrance to the trail is on your right.<br /> <br /> Walk further along Vaughn Road to reach a 0.7-mile connector hiking trail. It leads to Jaite, once the company town for the paper mill and now National Park Service headquarters. From the connector, cross Riverview Road and walk briefly along Snowville Road to find the Buckeye Trail, a long-distance hiking trail that heads both north and south from Snowville.<br /> <br /> Red Lock Trailhead also serves the <a href=\"https://cuyahogariverwatertrail.org/\">Cuyahoga River Water Trail</a>.

    "audioDescription": "Red Lock Trailhead. 436 words A three-sided, covered kiosk with a bulletin board and two graphic panels sits at the side a paved path which leads from a small parking lot to the Towpath Trail. If you stand with your back to the parking lot, there is a small building with restrooms on the left side of the path in front of you and a bench next to the kiosk on the right side. There are woods on both sides of the path and the parking lot. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Red Lock Trailhead. The Red Lock area is a place to observe how nature is reclaiming old industrial sites and canal ruins. As you bike, walk, or jog north, look for wildlife. The area is a hotspot for birding, especially during spring migration. About a half-mile south is the site of the Jaite Paper Mill, once a large employer in Cuyahoga Valley. The buildings are gone and the land is being restored through contaminant removal and native plantings.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines. Discover how culture, recreation, and natural scenic beauty are being revitalized by this national heritage area.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/cuyahoga-national-heritage-river.htm\">Cuyahoga River story</a> is one of redemption, change, recovery, and contrast. The 100-mile river’s headwaters are only 30 miles from its mouth. It travels southwest before turning north. It flows through farmlands, woodlands, suburbs, and cities. The Cuyahoga was once so polluted that it caught fire many times, downstream in Cleveland’s shipping channel. The infamous <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/story-of-the-fire.htm\">1969 blaze</a> helped spark the Clean Water Act, the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, and other milestones in the environmental movement. Established soon after in 1974, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/how-a-national-park-helps-a-river-recover.htm\">our national park plays an important role</a> in restoring and protecting the Cuyahoga.<br /> <br /> As water quality has improved, fish and the native wildlife that eat fish have come back. Just north of Station Road Bridge is a former heronry where Cuyahoga Valley’s <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bald-eagles-return.htm\">first baby bald eagle fledged</a> in 2007. As you explore the area, look for other signs of recovery: river otters, great blue herons, prothonotary warblers, aquatic turtles, hikers, cyclists, and paddlers. The metal sculpture by Michael Maras is called <em>Return to the River (Cuyahoga Valley National Park)</em>. It was dedicated during the Xtinguish Torch Fest in 2019 to celebrate the river’s amazing progress 50 years after the 1969 fire. It reminds us that we can make a difference when we work together.<br /> <br /> This exhibit cluster also includes several panels, an audio player with an attached script, a tactile model of a sport fish called muskellunge (or “muskie”), and a tactile model of a bald eagle eating a carp.<br /> <br /> From here, you can further explore the river as well as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> by crossing east over the bridge to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Towpath Trail</a>.

    "audioDescription": "Restoring the Cuyahoga River. 494 words Here there is a 6-foot-tall, two-sided graphic panel standing next to a touchable model of an eagle perched on a log eating a large carp. On the other side of the log display is a slanted, wayside graphic panel and a metal post with audio. At the end is a 7-foot metal sculpture of a heron on a branch with fish and mayflies below. As you face the tall panel with the log model to the right, the parking lot is behind you and the Brecksville Station is to the left on the far side of the train tracks. Ahead of you on the far side of the panel is the historic Station Road Bridge over the Cuyahoga River. Text on the tall panel reads, “The 100-mile Cuyahoga River is modest in length by mighty in its impact on the environmental movement. Like many others, the river became badly polluted by industrial waste and sewage. Floating debris and chemicals caught fire near its mouth in Cleveland many times starting in 1868. The fire on June 22, 1969, finally caught the nation’s attention. The outcry stimulated new environmental laws and enforcement agencies. Because of the resulting Clean Water Act 1972, rivers throughout the nation are better protected. More funding allows communities to provide residents with safe, clean water. Ironically, local pride in the Cuyahoga’s comeback is often celebrated with ‘burning river’ event and products.” To the left of the text is a photograph of a river fire in 1952, huge clouds of black smoke billowing upwards. At the bottom of the panel is a photograph of kayakers floating down today’s river through tree-lined banks. The eagle on the log to the right of the panel sits with its tail towards the left. It leans over to eat a large fish lying at the right. The wayside panel farther to the right is titled “Fish Reveal River’s Health.” At the bottom of this panel is a touchable 19-inch-long model of a muskie, a long narrow sport fish, mounted with its mouth at the left. Text on the panel reads in part, “Fish tell us the Cuyahoga River is getting healthier. They are coming back due to improved water quality and removal of dams that block migration. Restoring natural flow improves the river bottom habitat for insects and other small animals. That means more food for fish – and more fish for hungry eagles, herons, otters, and people.” The panel also has a picture of two river otters and a bald eagle on its nest. The audio station to the right of the wayside has four buttons that play audio segments on the River Restoration. From left to right they are Oily Waste in the River, 55 seconds; Making a Comeback, 60 seconds; Paddling the River, 50 seconds; and Bald Eagle Success Story, 40 seconds. The sign on the heron statue says “Return to the River by Michael Marras, 2019 Xtinguish Celebration.” End of description.",

It describes how water and weathering shaped the rock.<br /> <br /> About 315-320 million years ago, the area was steamy swamp. Periodically fast-moving streams dropped sand and pebbles here. Over time, this material was compacted into rock called Sharon Sandstone and Conglomerate.

Look for evergreen eastern hemlock trees and listen for the cheery, buzzy song of black-throated green warblers. Take a moment to enjoy the coolness and beauty of this microclimate.<br /> <br /> Life on the Ledges is fragile. Mosses and ferns cling to sand and pebble crevices. Please help us protect this fragile life by enjoying the Ledges from the trail.

    "audioDescription": "The Ritchie Ledges. 372 words This wayside graphic panel sits at an intersection where two trails on top of the Ledges plateau cross each other. All around are thick woods, deciduous trees mixed with evergreen hemlocks. A sign post tells us that the Ledges Shelter is one-quarter mile to the left as you face the graphic panel, the Octagon is one-third mile straight ahead, while going in the other direction leads to the Ledges Trail, a long loop which circles this entire geologic formation. At the opposite side of the crossroads is a bench. The panel has a map of the entire Ledges, an oval shaped area with your current location a third of the way from the right end. The Ledges Shelter lies to the left with the Overlook and a trail to Kendall Lake at the far left. At top of the map is the trail to the Octagon. At bottom, a trail passes the Ice Box Cave and skirts the rocky cliffs along that edge. At far right, a side trail leads to the Happy Days Lodge. Text on the panel reads, “As you wander through the unusual environment of the Ritchie Ledges, you will encounter evidence of an ancient landscape, one that has witnessed great changes in climate and terrain. You will be exploring the remnants of primeval stream beds deposited when the area was a steamy swamp 320 million years ago. Over time, these sand and pebble sediments were compacted into rock, now called Sharon Conglomerate. Erosion has carved the rock into the form you see today. Life on the Ritchie Ledges is fragile. Soil on the rocks is thin and root systems are very shallow. Please enjoy the beauty of the Ledges from the trail. A moment of thoughtless rock climbing can erase years of growth.” At upper right is a drawing of small hemlock branches with seed cones at the tips. The caption reads, “The Ledges are cooler and moister than the surrounding area, attracting plants and animals adapted to this microenvironment. Evergreen eastern hemlocks, shown here, are perhaps the most striking of these. They hint of a time when their kind thrived in the cooler, moister climate that followed glacial retreat 14,000 years ago.” End of description.",

The station has ample parking and is a primary starting point for train excursions and events.<br /> <br /> Historically, Thornburg Station once stood nearby and served Independence, Ohio. Small train depots were found all along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/history-of-the-valley-railway.htm\">Cuyahoga Valley Line</a> at every little hamlet of any size. In the early 2000s, the National Park Service built the modern Rockside Station for passengers waiting for the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.<br /> <br /> Visions for a train line through the valley began in the 1850s. Competition and economic slumps delayed its completion until 1880. This became the shortest route between Akron and the coalfields of Tuscarawas County to the south and Cleveland’s ports in the north. For the valley, these train stations were a lifeline to the outside world. They provided passenger service and allowed farmers to ship out their milk, cheese, grain, and lumber. Exhibits inside the station describe the area’s railroad history in more depth.<br /> <br /> From this point, visitors can get on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad or head east over the river to access the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/ohio-and-erie-canal-towpath-trail.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail</a> and <a href=\"https://cuyahogariverwatertrail.org/\">Cuyahoga River Water Trail</a> at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/lock-39-trailhead-information.htm\">Lock 39 Trailhead</a>.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Rockside Station. 470 words The rail station is a long rectangular covered platform with a wall at each end and a small office in the middle. Posts along each side support the shingled roof. Wooden benches sit on either side of the office. The floor is made of wood boards and the structure is painted a creamy yellow. On one side of the station is an asphalt parking lot. On the other side of the parking lot a bridge crosses the river and leads to the towpath. The railroad tracks are on the other side of the station past a wide grassy ditch. Wooden walkways over the ditch at either end of the station provide access to the train platform. If you stand with your back to the parking lot, restrooms are in a separate building at the left end of the station. Graphic panels are hung on the inside of the end walls. At one end is a panel titled “Ride the Rails” which explains that the first steam engine in the valley began running in 1880 connecting the mineral fields in the south to the factories in the north. Today the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad follows much of the same route. Yellow paint on a station signifies a modern building. Historical depots are painted red. The panel shows a map of the rail line through Cuyahoga Valley National Park, stretching from Rockside Station at the northern end (your current location) to the Akron Northside Station at the southern end. The railroad and the Towpath Trail both follow the Cuyahoga River through the park. At the same end of the station is a glass-covered bulletin board with current information about the train and the park. The wall at the other end has two graphic panels. One is titled “Industrial Cleveland.” It has a black and white photograph of Cleveland from 1895 and one of the Standard Oil refinery. Text on the panel explains that by the late 1800s, petroleum refining, steel making, chemical processing, and machine-tool production made the city a thriving economic center. Prominent businessmen served on the Valley Railway’s board of directors. A photograph of Stillman Witt, a partner in a railroad construction company, is to the right of the text. The other panel is titled “Route to the Coalfields” with a photograph of a group of almost 50 miners at the entrance of a mine operated by the Marchesi Coal Company in Tuscarawas County. A railroad map of Ohio from 1873 with a band down the eastern side shows the location of an iron ore belt. Text on the panel explains that the developers of the railway capitalized on the need for a direct rail line between the new fields in Tuscarawas and Stark counties to the south and the industrial centers of Cleveland and Akron.

    "audioDescription": "South Park Exhibits. 412 words At the side of the towpath are two panels. One is a small, free-standing graphic panel titled “Late-Prehistoric Period.” The other is a 2-sided, metal Ohio Historical Marker mounted on a post. The historical marker has raised lettering. Both sides have the same text. On the other side of the signs is a field with trees covering a low ridge along the river at the far end. As you face the signs, the canal is behind you with the scenic byway on the other side. Text on the historical marker reads, “South Park Village and the Whittlesey Tradition. Directly across the Cuyahoga River from this spot is the South Park Village. Here, archeologists uncovered the remains of a four-acre Native American settlement populated by people of the Whittlesey Tradition. The people of South Park lived in communal structures and grew maize, beans, and squash in the floodplain fields that surround you. Food remains found in the village excavations reveal that they hunted deer, elk, black bear, and other game and gathered clams and fish from the Cuyahoga River. South Park was abandoned and reoccupied several times between A.D. 1000 and 1600. Numerous seasonal campsites have been found on the floodplains and terraces on both side of the river. The first localized cultural development unique to this area, Whittlesey sites have been identified upriver from here in Summit County and in the Chagrin and Grand River valleys to the east. The Ohio Bicentennial Commission, The Ohio Historical Society, 2004.” The graphic panel features an artist’s drawing of the South Park village. A circular fence made of vertical logs surrounds seven Quonset-hut-like houses, long structures with a semi-circular cross section. At upper right is a picture of a pot found at South Park, a deep vessel with a rounded bottom. Text on the panel reads, “Whittlesey Villagers. Beginning around 1000, American Indians in northeastern Ohio developed a distinctive culture known archeologically as the Whittlesey Tradition. They started building walls around their small villages. Their pottery and agriculture changed, too. Instead of having a complex trade network, they relied on the local landscape. Imagine what it was like to live in the long, multi-family homes made of wooden poles. What kinds of vegetables did they raise on the floodplain? By the time European explorers arrived in the early 1700s, these Whittlesey Tradition people had disappeared from the Cuyahoga Valley. This late-prehistoric culture is named for the archeologist Charles Whittlesey, 1808-1886.” End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Stanford House. 313 words This white frame house is in the shape of an “L.” The section at left is two stories with two rows of three windows with green shutters. A smaller window is under the peak of the gable at top. The section of the house that stretches to the right is lower, the peak of its roof just fitting under the eaves of the other section. There are half-height windows on the upper floor just under the roofline. In the corner of the “L” is a covered porch leading to the door. A wayside graphic panel is located at the right end of the sidewalk which leads from the driveway to the porch. To the right of the house is a small garage building with a parking area in front. To the left, the driveway runs down a slight slope to the road. Behind you as you face the panel is a large grassy lawn with a very large barn at the side away from the road. The background of the panel shows a drawing of the Stanford farm circa 1870s. The house is shown at an angle, paralleling the road. A plain, white rail fence surrounds the house and barn. A man and a woman play croquet on the lawn.

Building on this tradition, citizens worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked Earth Day and the Clean Water Act. “Stanford Trailhead. Named for James Stanford who came here in 1805 to farm on Ohio’s frontier, the relatively short Stanford Trail is steep in places and provides a moderate challenge to hiking enthusiasts.

Concrete was a relatively new construction material when it was built in 1931.<br /> <br /> The river that re-carved these narrows has an unusual shape. It flows south from its headwaters in Geauga County until it hits Akron’s bedrock. There it turns sharply north, burrowing into a pre-glacial riverbed. This U-turn gives the river its name: Cuyahoga, after an Iroquoian word for curve or jawbone. The ridge it hits at Akron forms a continental divide, with water south of it flowing toward the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and the water north flowing into Lake Erie at Cleveland. Cuyahoga Valley lies between the cities. The river and its terraces form the bottomlands. Steep ravines and rock ledges define the uplands on either side.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Station Road Bridge. 486 words This narrow bridge over the Cuyahoga River has a superstructure made of iron truss with a roadway made of wood. A path from one end of the bridge leads east through woods to the Towpath Trail alongside the canal. From the other end of the bridge, paths lead to the Brecksville train station. Railroad tracks parallel the river on that side. There are two wayside graphic panels along the north side of the bridge, which faces downstream, giving a view of the elevated, multi-arched bridge over the entire valley. The left graphic panel is titled “Pinery Narrows, Bridging the Valley.” Text on the panel tells us that you are on the 1881 wrought-iron Station Road Bridge facing the Pinery Narrows, the Cuyahoga Valley’s thinnest point. Here the river is confined by hard, deeply cut bedrock. Ahead of you is the 1931 Brecksville-Northfield High-Level Bridge, built to replace the bridge on which you are standing. At the lower left of the panel is an early 1900s photograph of the view looking north from here before the newer bridge was built. The main photograph on the panel shows a view of the concrete arches of the new bridge, one filled with wooden scaffolding. On a dirt road below is an old model car. The caption reads, “In 1931 area residents took day trips to admire the Brecksville-Northfield Bridge as it was nearing completion.” The other panel is titled “Cuyahoga River, Carving a Crooked Path.” The right side of the panel has an aerial photograph showing the river making several sharp “S” bends as it flows through green fields and woods. On the left side is a touchable map with braille labels of the “U” shaped route of the Cuyahoga River. Start in the upper left corner to feel the recessed area of Lake Erie. The river flows into the lake at Cleveland marked with a raised square. Follow the river down, past a major tributary on the right, to a raised star, marking your current location. Continue down to find the curve to the right and upwards. Just below that is a small raised circle at Akron. The depressed area on both sides of the river marks the watershed. The caption tells us the Cuyahoga River collects the waters of 37 tributaries and many unnamed streams providing water for nearly 15 percent of Ohio’s population. Text on the panel reads in part, “The Cuyahoga River changes direction in its 100-mile course. It flows southwest until it meets a north-south ridge – a continental divide – at Akron. There it turns north and empties into Lake Erie, about 30 miles west of where it began. … The national park’s terrain consists of river terraces, steep valleys, ravines, and rock ledges. Bedrock includes several layers of shale … and Berea sandstone.” Below the text are touchable rock samples. Clockwise from the top is granite, sandstone, and shale. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Station Road Bridge River Access. 244 words The Cuyahoga River Water Trail access at Station Road Bridge is located on the west bank of the river. The mowed path to the river access starts in the southeast corner of the parking lot at Station Road Bridge Trailhead. There is a sign at the beginning that states vehicles are prohibited. Closer to the river access is another sign that provides directions on “River Use and Hazards.” The access point is to the left of the sign. There are large rocks to use as stepping stones down to the riverbank. The terrain is flat through the field and becomes uneven as you approach the river access. The path does get muddy after wet weather. When you reach the access point, the river will be in front of you. The ground is dirt with different sized rocks along the bank. The area to the direct right and left of the access point is steep and has grass and trees. The Towpath Trail is visible directly across the river. Station Road Bridge is visible downriver to your left. To your right is an open flat area with loose rocks and dirt with Chippewa Creek beyond. To the right and behind you is a dark blue sign that has the Cuyahoga River Water Trail logo with “Station Road Bridge.” Underneath the text on the sign is a lighter blue shaded area with the number “21.0” indicating the river mile.

    "audioDescription": "Station Road Bridge Trailhead. 446 words A three-sided, covered kiosk with a bulletin board and two graphic panels sits at the side of the parking lot. If you face the kiosk with your back to the parking lot, the Brecksville Station is to the left on the far side of the train tracks and, in front of you, a path leads to a historic bridge over the river and connects to the Towpath Trail along the canal. One of the graphic panels is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location at the northern end of the park marked. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Station Road Bridge Trailhead.

Follow the towpath north about a half-mile to Lock 36’s ruins and the Mudcatcher beyond. Loop back via the trail along the river.” The third side has a panel titled “Ohio and Erie Canalway” with a large black and white photograph of three mules pulling a canal boat on the canal. Smaller photographs show the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, a group of children riding bicycles on the towpath, and the scenic byway that winds through the valley. A long map down the right side shows mileage between trailheads on the Towpath Trail. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canalway celebrates the first 110 miles of a waterway that helped the nation grow. Dug by hand from 1825 to 1832, the Ohio and Erie Canal was the first canal west of the Appalachian Mountains. It connected Lake Erie to the Ohio River, providing a key link in an interstate shipping route. People and products flowed across America. Canal towns became major commercial centers. Ohio grew in population and wealth. Today you can explore the lasting impact of this historic public works project. Travel along the Canalway’s three spines.

Documents reveal that Ma Parker had her tavern on or near this location by the time of canal construction. Artifacts uncovered here also suggest this was a pre-canal tavern. The original building was the southern half of the structure. By 1841, Moses Gleason bought the property and sold it to his son. Isaac Gleason added the southern part of the building, turning it into a store serving travelers waiting at Lock 38. The Gleason family continued to live here until the early 1900s. After that, the building became a residence and later housed a blacksmith shop. As the building wore down, it became a multi-resident structure.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service purchased the property and began historic reconstruction in the early 1990s. In 1996 it opened as Canal Visitor Center. Today it operates as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/historyculture/canal-exploration-center.htm\">Canal Exploration Center</a>, where visitors can explore <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> history through hands-on exhibits.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Tavern and Store. 390 words At the side of the wide towpath, to the right of a graphic panel, is a two-story, white-frame building that looks like two houses stuck together. Each side has a peaked gable over its front and dark green shutters at the windows. The left section of the building had a covered porch along its front with a double door in the middle and a window on either side. On the left side of the porch is a bench. A barrel sits to the right of the doors. The ground slopes down along the left side of the building, revealing a stone basement. In front of the left end of the building is a lifesaver ring hanging from a post. The right section of the building has a single door at its left side and two windows to the right. A water-filled lock is on the other side of the towpath with large, functioning wooden gates. Exercise caution near the lock as there is no guardrail. Text on the graphic panel reads, “Canal Rest Stop. In the mid-1800s, the Gleason family ran a tavern and store in this building. Here boat crews and passengers could get something to eat and drink. They also could buy supplies such as tea, sugar, tobacco, needles, and thread. Tour the exhibits in the old tavern-store. Decide for yourself whether building the Ohio and Erie Canal was worth the tax dollars.” The lower right of the panel shows a color illustration of a canal boat approaching the tavern and store on the left. The lock gates stand open to receive the boat. At the rear of the boat is a dark-skinned man in a top hat and long black coat. The caption reads, “John Malvin, a free black from Virginia, became a businessman and civic leader in Cleveland. This scene shows Malvin in about 1853 as the captain of the ‘Auburn.’ His crew included both blacks and whites.” At the bottom left is a photograph from around 1910 of the tavern and store building, looking much as it does today except for a smaller building at the back-left corner. The caption reads, “After the canal era, the building became a residence and later housed a blacksmith shop. Notice that the building on the left – probably a barn – is no longer there.” End of description.",

The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/the-ohio-and-erie-canal.htm\">Ohio & Erie Canal</a> was maintained at a depth of four feet. Here the canal must cross the Cuyahoga River’s largest tributary, <a href=\"https://www.tinkerscreek.org/about-us/\">Tinkers Creek</a>. Using technology first developed by the Romans, canal engineers made an aqueduct to carry the built waterway over the natural stream. Originally it was a bit farther north. However, shortly after the canal was constructed, Tinkers Creek flooded the aqueduct, proving how unpredictable it can be. The aqueduct was re-built at its present location, but in time suffered more flooding, debris, and leakage. The previous aqueduct was built by the King Iron Bridge Company, but even iron cannot stand against floodwaters. In 2011 the national park replaced it with this concrete one.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Tinkers Creek Aqueduct. 319 words This wayside graphic faces Tinkers Creek which flows through woods and fields to the right to reach the Cuyahoga River. To the left of the panel is a wooden footbridge with metal railings that carries the Towpath Trail over the creek. Farther to the left is a concrete aqueduct which allows the canal to pass over the creek. The aqueduct and the canal have water at this location. To the left of the aqueduct is a modern concrete bridge with guardrails on the scenic byway. Near the graphic on the left is a bench alongside the path. The right side of the panel features a black and white photograph of a worker using a long pole to measure water depth in the creek next to the aqueduct after a flood in 1916. At that time the aqueduct was made of steel truss. The man stands on the outside of the aqueduct balancing on two steel girders. To the right of where he is standing a stream of water is leaking from the aqueduct. The creek bed below has broken logs and smaller debris in it. The caption notes that the steel span lasted nearly 90 years. At lower left is an aerial photograph from 1980 showing the former steel aqueduct. At that time the Canal Road bridge was also made of steel truss. In 1993 the Towpath Trail was built and the Canal Road truss bridge was replaced. Text on the panel reads, “Bridge over Flooding Waters. Aqueducts solve a problem but create other problems. An aqueduct – a water-filled bridge – was built here to carry the canal over Tinkers Creek, the Cuyahoga River’s largest tributary. But the aqueduct leaked and was vulnerable to flood damage. It needed constant repairs. It had to be moved or replaced four times. The present concrete span, built in 2011, replaced the steel aqueduct shown in the two photographs.” End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "Waste Weir. 300 words Here on the canal is a graphic panel titled “Mud and Muskrats.” To the left of the panel is a concrete spillway, called a weir, along the edge of the canal. A concrete slab along the top passes over openings. During floods, water can flow through the openings, down the spillway and through a culvert that passes under the towpath. The scenic byway passes close to the canal on the far side, so you may hear vehicles passing. Text on the panel reads, “The Ohio and Erie Canal needed never-ending maintenance. To keep a four-foot depth of water, crews had to patch leaks. Floods and burrowing muskrats were common problems. Crews also had to remove mud from the bottom with shovels and wheelbarrows. Later they used steam-shovel-like dredges. After the canal was built, State of Ohio engineers added special water-control features to handle problems with floodwaters. Here excess water spilled over a dam-like waste weir. A waste way carried the water to the Cuyahoga River. More complex weirs in other locations had gates, but this one did not.” The background of the panel shows a late 1800s photograph of a work crew after dredging mud from the canal bottom. They sit and stand on a canal boat with a steam-shovel extending from its front. At the lower left of the panel is a map showing the log weir and waste way as they appeared in the late 1800s. The current concrete weir was built in the 1906. Originally an open waste channel snaked from the canal to the nearby Cuyahoga River in the lower left of the map. In the upper right of the panel is a photograph of a common muskrat. It has fur in shades of brown with silver tips and a hairless tail. End of description.",

Peggy was nationally known for breeding Morgans and Thoroughbreds and for writing books about raising horses. Today’s trails in the Wetmore area follow old horse paths and logging roads established by past owners.<br /> <br /> As you explore the area, you’ll see fields of white tubes. Volunteers and staff have planted <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?pg=6717817&id=093AFD68-469D-4B86-B470-6759CDFC42FC\">thousands of young trees here</a>.

The trail surface is unpaved and the landscape is hilly. Trail conditions can be muddy in spring or after a heavy rain. For everyone’s safety, hikers should always yield to horseback riders.<br /> <br /> From the bulletin board information panels, you can head in two directions.

The Valley Trail continues south to another shared trail network near <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cuva/learn/historyculture/everett-covered-bridge.htm\">Everett Covered Bridge</a>. If you turn left at the information board, the downhill path leads to the Wetmore, Valley, and Tabletop trails.

    "audioDescription": "Wetmore Trailhead. 260 words At the side of the entrance driveway into this parking lot there is a covered kiosk with a bulletin board and a graphic panel. As you face the kiosk, behind you across the driveway is a small building with a rest room. Over your left shoulder is the parking lot. To the left of the kiosk is an unpaved trail that heads down a slope. There is a wooden rail fence enclosing a meadow on the right side of the trail. The other side has overgrown fields and woods. The graphic panel on the kiosk is titled “Welcome to Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and features a map of the park stretching along the Cuyahoga River with your current location in the southern part of the park indicated. Text on the panel reads, “Since the 1800s, the Cuyahoga Valley has been a place where people from nearby cities relax in nature. Building on this tradition, locals worked tirelessly to preserve what is now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Created in 1974, the park protects open countryside, a canal that helped build the nation, and the river that sparked the Clean Water Act. “Wetmore Trailhead. Named after early landowners Frederick and Emila Wetmore, this is the starting point for a trail network shared by hikers and horse-back riders. As you cross through old farm fields, look for signs that the forest is returning. Park volunteers and staff have replanted acres of native trees at Wetmore. This improves wildlife habitat and naturally filters storm water flowing into the Cuyahoga River.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>This large circular, domed mausoleum is the final resting place of President William McKinley.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">McKinley was born in Niles, Ohio but he called Canton home throughout his adult life. <span>In 1861, McKinley enlisted as a private in an Ohio infantry regiment and participated in several Civil War battles. After the war h</span>e began his career in this city, met his beloved wife, and ran for the highest office of the nation here. He was the last Civil War veteran elected president. His election in 1896 launched an era of Republican dominance that continued until 1910. McKinley governed during a period of intense American expansionism. Domestically, he supported policies that benefitted American business, including high protective tariffs and deflationary fiscal policies.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">On September 6, 1901, an anarchist shot McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He died eight days later. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">After lying in state at the United States Capitol, McKinley’s body returned to Canton.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Mark Hanna, McKinley's <span>lifelong friend, political mentor, and manager,</span> and some of McKinley’s friends immediately began planning a suitable memorial. They chose this site in Canton’s Westlawn Cemetery that McKinley once suggested would be an appropriate location for a soldiers’ and sailors’ memorial. The McKinley National Memorial Association, organized in 1901, purchased the site, and appealed to the public for the $600,000 needed to create the memorial. Construction began in 1905. Nine different States donated materials used in the memorial, completed in 1907. Ida McKinley died that year; she lies next to her husband in the memorial chamber. William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum, a private nonprofit organization under the umbrella of the Stark County Historical Society, administers the memorial and its grounds.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The McKinley Memorial that contains the tomb stands on a grass-covered hill overlooking the city of Canton. Designed by architect H. Van Buren Magonigle, the circular, domed pink granite building rises 96 feet above ground and measures 79 feet in diameter. The double bronze doors of the entrance were the largest in the nation at the time of installation. Originally a long, narrow reflecting pool stretched out from the base of the hill in front of the memorial. This feature, together with the 108 stone steps that lead up to the mausoleum, symbolized the President's sword in time of war. In 1951, a depressed lawn replaced the pool, but the sword effect remains. Midway up the steps is a large bronze statue by Charles Henry Niehaus of President McKinley delivering his last speech in Buffalo.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Colored marble laid in a cross pattern forms the floor of the mausoleum. The bodies of McKinley and his wife lie side by side in two polished, dark-green, granite sarcophagi, resting atop a ten-foot-square of polished dark maroon granite in the center of the space. Their two young daughters are also laid to rest here. Three semi-circular arched bays encircle the central chamber. The entablature and frieze extending around the bottom of the dome contain words from McKinley's last speech.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the </em></span><em><a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a></em><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><em>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded preservation work at the McKinley Memorial in 2000. </em></span></p>",

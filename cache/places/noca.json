The trail gently rolls up and down through varied forest terrain with occasional gorge views and features a wide selection of wildflowers in early and mid-summer. The trail begins in the national park and continues into the Glacier Peak Wilderness in Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br /> <br /> At the end of the trail, Agnes Creek cascades 200 feet (60 m) through a narrow gorge. There was once a suspension bridge over the gorge and there are a few remnant metal components on the forest floor, as well as the concrete abutments that anchored the bridge. Parts of the trail can be wet and muddy in spring and early summer. Look for waterfalls across the gorge in spring and early summer.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy to Moderate</li> <li><strong>Distance and elevation:</strong> 2.5 miles (4.0 km) one way with 500 feet (150 m) elevation gain.</li> <li><strong>Access: </strong>Trailhead is near High Bridge, 11 miles from Stehekin Landing.

It was homesteaded by Bill Buzzard in 1889 and then by the Buckner Family who lived there from 1910 until 1970. Now a historic district as part of Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, there are over 50 acres of apples trees and 15 buildings, representing the 1880s to the 1950s. Explore historic structures and farm equipment, views of McGregor Mountain and surrounding peaks, and the Stehekin River. Some buildings are closed to visitors for preservation. To learn the story of the Buckner Family, borrow a self-guided tour booklet found at two locations in the orchard (near the entrance next to a large concrete foundation and near the Buzzard Cabin).<br /> <br /> The National Park Service maintains Buckner Orchard as a working apple orchard today. If visiting during late summer or early fall, pick ripe apples to enjoy a taste of the orchard.<br /> <br /> Access the orchard by walking the 0.3 mile Buckner Lane immediately on the left (south) after crossing Rainbow Creek from Stehekin Landing. The trail follows the century-old hand-dug irrigation ditch that is still essential to the life of the orchard. Bicycle and vehicle access is via a dirt road found one-quarter mile beyond Rainbow Creek.</p>",

Almost all bridges of this type were built out of steel for railroads, however, the Harlequin Bridge was made of timber for vehicle use, which was unique. At its time of replacement in 2000, the Harlequin Bridge was one of only a few existing timber through truss bridges in the Pacific Northwest. This bridge here today is the 5th to be built at this location. It was designed specifically to pay respect to its predecessor.<br /> <br /> The bridge provides access to Company Creek Road, the only other major road in Stehekin Valley, and to Harlequin Campground, the Stehekin State Airport, Company Creek Trail, the Stehekin Powerhouse, and many private homes.",

Conditions are best in spring (April and May) and fall (October and November) as there is little shade on this southwest-facing trail. In summer, consider it for an early morning or evening walk.<br /> <br /> The entire trail connects Stehekin with Prince Creek, a distance of 17.2 miles (27.7 km), but shorter sections make for a nice day hike. The trail leaves North Cascades National Park Service Complex and enters Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest just past Flick Creek Camp, around mile 3.5 (5.7 km). Pre-arrange with the ferry companies if you would like to be dropped off or picked up at certain points along the trail.<br /> <br /> The trail provides little access to the lake itself and can be hot from late spring to early fall. Vault toilets and picnic tables available at Flick Creek, Moore Point, and Prince Creek.<br /> <br /> Respect private property along the trail.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Easy to moderate.</li> <li><strong>Distance and elevation:</strong> Trail gradually climbs and drops along the lakeshore with minimal to moderate elevation gain. Hazard Creek at 0.5 miles (0.8 km) and approximately 100 feet (30 m) gain/loss, Flick Creek Camp at 3.5 miles (5.6 km) and approximately 500 feet (150 m) gain/loss, Hunts Bluff at 5 miles (8 km) and approximately 1,100 feet (335 m) gain/loss, or Moore Point at 7 miles (11.4 km) and approximately 1,100 feet (335 m) gain/loss one way are good day hike destinations.</li> <li><strong>Access:</strong> From Stehekin Landing, continue up past the Golden West Visitor Center to Lakeview Campgound. Signed trailhead is just south of the campground.</li> <li>Leashed dogs allowed.</li> <li>Backcountry camping is allowed at Flick Creek and on National Forest Service land. No backcountry permit required. Because of steep terrain and limited lake access, there are few areas outside of established camps where dispersed camping in the national forest is practical. Federal dock permit required for motorboats.</li> </ul>",

The hike is mostly forested in the beginning, with rocky outcrops offering occasional views. A good viewpoint lies approximately 2.9 miles (4.7 km) and a 2,100 foot climb (640 m) up on the trail from High Bridge, providing a great day-hiking destination.<br /> <br /> As you continue upward, the forest eventually begins to thin, giving way to talus slopes and more views. Seven miles (11.3 km) up the trail, Heaton Camp lies in a subalpine forest at 7,000 feet (2,130 m). Hikers who make it to this elevation can enjoy a bird's eye view of the Stehekin River Valley and the surrounding peaks, with all of the Glacier Peak Wilderness rising to the south. <br /> <br /> From Heaton Camp the trail continues for a short distance for continued great views, then the trail ends at an enormous talus slope. The summit looms 1,000 feet (330 m) above. Reaching the summit requires a hand-and-foot scramble up the talus slope and along exposed rocky ledges. Route-finding skills are essential. The most used route starts at the top of the talus field to the left of the summit. Look for faint, intermittent red arrows painted on the rocks marking the best way to proceed. A radio repeater is visible on the summit, providing a good landmark for those attempting to negotiate the summit route.<br /> <br /> <br /> To attempt the entire hike as a day trip, consider camping at High Bridge or Tumwater camps, backcountry permit required, before or after your trip. Shuttle layover times may not give most hikers time to complete the hike.<br /> <br /> The top 2 miles (3 km) may be under snow until August; check with rangers for current conditions. Late in the season, there is little water after around mile six.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/mcgregor-mountain-trail.htm#CP_JUMP_129923\">Detailed trail description.</a></p> <ul> <li> <p><b>Difficulty</b>: Strenuous</p> </li> <li> <p><b>Distance and elevation:</b> 7.5 miles (12.0 km) one way with 5,700 feet (1,740 m) elevation gain to end of trail.

    "bodyText": "The McKellar Cabin Trail is a relaxing 15-minute interpretive trail on a mostly shaded path. It begins next to the post office at Stehekin Landing.<br /> <br /> The 0.2 miles (0.3 km) trail is a beautiful stroll in the woods, starting and ending within the landing area at Stehekin. Along the trail are many interpretive signs about the history, culture, and resources of Stehekin, along with descriptions of native trees and plants.<br /> <br /> The McKellar cabin was built in the early 1930s by Jack Blankenship, a local craftsman who built many homes and buildings in Stehekin, including the Golden West Lodge (now the Golden West Visitor Center) and the “House that Jack Built.” The McKellar cabin is typical of Stehekin log homes that date back to the late 1800s, using logs cleared from the site of the house.<br /> <br /> On the trail, visitors can find examples of conservation practices that connect Stehekin’s past Native American plant use and homesteading methods to the present. Learn about how log cabins were built, how people got their water, and how they disposed of their waste. Visitors will see remains of past utility structures and can read how it compares to Stehekin life and operations today.<br /> <br /> The trail runs next to buildings that are still being used as private residences. Please respect private property. ",

Good patches of huckleberries in mid-to-late summer.<br /> <br /> From High Bridge, start the PCT north and continue past Howard Lake until the junction with the Old Wagon Trail, which leads right (north) to Bridge Creek. Return by the same trail or continue on the Old Wagon Trail until it ends at the Stehekin Valley Road. Turn left (south) and walk the lightly-used road two miles past Tumwater and High Bridge camps to return to High Bridge.<br /> <br /> Since the historic floods of 2003, which removed the Stehekin Valley Road in large sections between Car Wash Falls, this trail is the only maintained route to Bridge Creek from Stehekin. The trail generally follows the route of a haul road that was constructed in the 1890s.

Flowing year-round from its headwaters near McAlester Mountain and Dee Dee Lakes, the falls is largest during spring runoff, usually in May and June. Both a lower and upper viewpoint are a short walk from the parking lot. The lower viewpoint is wheelchair accessible.<br /> <br /> What had to happen for Rainbow Falls to roar down into Stehekin Valley? The answer lies in the different types of glaciers that carved these mountains and what was left behind.<br /> <br /> Taking turns during great ice ages during the past 2.6 million years, ice from both a massive continental glaciers stretching from an ice sheet in Canada and from smaller local valley glaciers shaped the mountains, valleys, and what became Lake Chelan. The ice from the continental ice sheet entered Stehekin Valley by flowing down through Rainbow Creek Valley above you. This massive ice sheet in Stehekin Valley cut more deeply than glaciers in smaller tributaries and as a result, tributaries like Rainbow Creek were left as hanging valleys.<br /> <br /> As the ice melted away, ancient Rainbow Creek became blocked by massive leftover boulders and gravel from the lobe of the continental ice sheet. The creek blindly cut through the rubble before it tumbled over the edge of a hanging valley to free fall to the Stehekin Valley floor, creating the waterfall we see today.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Stehekin River Trail is an easy hike on a trail that gradually rises and falls as it winds through the forest. Look for views to the east of Rainbow Falls in the first third of the trail. Along the river, watch for beaver ponds and a variety of birds. In the fall, red salmon can be spotted in the river and side pools. The trail ends at Weaver Point Campground, which has vault toilets and picnic tables and is also accessible by boat on Lake Chelan. There is limited shoreline access to the Stehekin River along the trail. Trail can be partially flooded during spring runoff, usually in May or June.<br /> <br /> About a half mile (0.7 km) before reaching Weaver Point, the Stehekin River Trail also connects to the Devore Creek Trail which leads into the Glacier Peak Wilderness of Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.<br />  </p> <ul> <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy to moderate</li> <li><strong>Distance and elevation:</strong> It is 3.2 miles (5.2 km) one way from the trailhead to Weaver Point with approximately 200 feet (60 m) of elevation gain.</li> <li><strong>Access:</strong> From Stehekin Landing, travel 4.5 miles north along the Stehekin Valley Road and turn left across Harlequin Bridge. Follow the road as it veers to the right at the fork and watch for a side road to the left after approximately 0.4 miles (0.7 km). Road is signposted for trailhead. Continue on road another approx 0.4 miles as it loops around the southwest side of the airstrip until you see the marked trailhead.</li> <li>Leashed dogs allowed.</li> <li><b>Camping</b> is allowed at Weaver Point Campground (vault toilets). No backcountry permit required. Federal dock permit required for motorboats.</li> </ul>",

    "listingDescription": "The blacksmith shop was one of the busiest and most important places in Hopewell. The skill of the blacksmith in making and repairing iron objects made him a necessary worker at Hopewell Furnace and nearly every other community in America during the 18th and 19th centuries. He shaped shoes for the horses and mules that were essential for the furnace operations. He made nails, hinges, hooks, wagon parts, tools, and repaired all the iron fixtures of the furnace's machinery.",

Little wonder why his work kept him busy 6 days a week and on call 24 hours to maintain the furnace's operation.<br /> <br /> The importance of the Blacksmith and other iron workers illustrate the influence of iron in early America. Iron and its derivative, steel, were the most commonly used metals for making man made objects. As the industrial revolution expanded, iron would play an ever-increasing roll in the nation's economic and industrial development.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "On the right side of the road, a squat 25-foot wide, by 20-foot deep, 2-story whitewashed stone building. The shingles of its red tile roof, have rounded front edges. In the center of the roof's peak, a small, square vent with red tiles. On the front face, just left of center, a red plank door swings out. To the right, a wide, red-trimmed window. Leaning against the right corner, a wooden-spoked wagon wheel and a short wooden barrel, bound with rusty, iron circular bands.<br /><br />There is a single, raised stone threshold, into the building. Inside, are displayed the forge, anvils, and tools. An audio program describes the role of Hopewell's resident blacksmith. As you enter, on the inside wall to the left, the audio start button is located, 2-feet from the door, 5-feet above the floor. During the summer there are often blacksmith demonstrations.<br />[End of Message]",

    "audioDescription": "In the interior of the front building, scattered on the gravel floor, are flasks from the molding process, a freight wagon, and a wheelbarrow. In the left rear corner, an opening to the massive furnace, and molding work area beyond. Also wooden benches, where workers made the molds for a variety of products, and the underside of a water wheel are located here.<br />Your listening device will alert you when you come in range of the 3 interpretive panels inside the Cast House with audio description: the art of flask casting panel, pig iron production panel, and the water wheel panel. There is also an interpretive audio program near the water wheel. On the stone wall, to the right of the water wheel, and 3-feet above the ground, just above where the picket fence meets the wall, is the start button. The voice of iron worker, Tom Care, shares his pride in the efficient operation of the water wheel and furnace.<br /><br />Wayside Panel: Pig Iron Production, Casting the pigs - Panel Description. 1 Â½ minutes.<br />In the upper left, black text on a tan background reads:<br />\"Pig Iron Production, Casting the pigs.\"<br /><br />\"Molten iron flowed from the furnace's tap hole, into channels compressed in sand in this floor. The cast iron form became known as â€˜pigs,' since their outline resembled a sow nursing a litter of piglets. Once cooled, pig iron was sold to forges and foundries for further processing.<br /><br />During the furnace's last 40 years of operation, ending in 1883, Hopewell mainly produced rough iron bars. Prior to this period, Hopewell profited from the sale of finished products-stove plates, hollowware, weights, and other molded items.\"<br />End of text.<br /><br />On the right side, a large black and white illustration. In the lower left of the sketch, an aproned \"gutterman,\" wearing a hat, leans forward. In front of him, his long handled tool, with a hoe-like edge, directs the flow of molten iron from a central channel in the ground, into branches on either side. The 5 rows of side-by-side depressions in the ground, would produce 10 pig iron bars.<br /><br />Today, directly in front of the massive stone blast furnace, is a 20-foot length of board, flush to the ground. Jutting off to the right, at 2-foot intervals, are ten, 4-foot boards. They represent the \"pigs\" similar to those shown on the panel illustration.<br /><br />[End of message]",

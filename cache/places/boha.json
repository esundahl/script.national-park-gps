Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring fibrous silicate minerals that have been mined for their thermal stability and high tensile strength. Asbestos can be grouped into two types: Friable and Non-Friable. Friable asbestos when dry can be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. Non-friable asbestos when dry cannot be crumbled, pulverized, etc. By hand pressure. </p> <p paraeid=\"{2ecbe878-b956-43bd-899c-7547298b63ff}{167}\" paraid=\"103716229\">Why is asbestos a hazard? Asbestos is made up of microscopic bundles of fibers that when disturbed may become airborne. Once in the air they may be inhaled into the lungs, and can cause significant health problems. Unconsolidated asbestos fibers have not been detected in the sand at Spectacle Island. </p> <p paraeid=\"{2ecbe878-b956-43bd-899c-7547298b63ff}{173}\" paraid=\"1386588013\">Beach Management. As required by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, during the recreational season the Island Caretaker conducts regular inspections of the beaches on Spectacle Island to identify and remove any suspected asbestos containing materials that may have washed ashore. </p> <p paraeid=\"{2ecbe878-b956-43bd-899c-7547298b63ff}{179}\" paraid=\"1260853954\">How do I report asbestos found on the island? Report suspected asbestos containing materials to any park employee. Please note the location of the suspect material but do not disturb it. </p>",

Georges Island has a small white question mark in a black box indicating a visitor’s center. “Boston Harbor” is labeled in dark blue in the center. Other water features going down the coastline are labeled in the same dark blue: “Inner Harbor,” “Pleasure Bay,” “Old Harbor,” “Dorchester Bay,” and “Quincy Bay.” Two beaches on the coastline are labeled in white, the first is above Old Harbor “L Street Beach” and the second is in Quincy Bay, “Wollaston Beach.” Out in the harbor, “President Roads,” between Deer Island and Long Island, is labeled in dark blue, along with “The Narrows” between Gallops Island and Lovells Island. Also labeled in dark blue is “Nantasket Roads” between Peddocks Island and Rainsford Island and Georges Island to the north, as well as “Hull Gut” between Peddocks and an outstretch of land that is presumably Hull. Beneath the harbor islands, at the bottom of the map “Quincy Bay” and Hingham Bay are labelled, with “Hull Gut” labeled on an outstretch of land that is presumably Hull. The top right of the map is labeled “Massachusetts Bay” in a light blue with an arrow pointing upwards in a grey circle that indicates “North.” Underneath the arrow is a small-scale image, depicting the scale of the map, on top it has 2 kilometers labeled in black, and 1 mile labeled in white. On Spectacle Island there is a yellow dot which has a triangulated yellow field showing the field of vision from that spot-on Spectacle Island.

A stretch of land lined with rocks separate the channel from another body of water, labeled as “Pleasure Bay” in white text. To the right of this stretch of land is a stone fort, with an industrial shipping area filled with cranes and containers just behind it; they are labeled “Castle Island and Fort Independence” and “Conley Terminal” respectively. Beyond this area is the city skyline, made up of an assortment of skyscrapers and other smaller buildings they are mainly, blue, white, grey, tan, and brick red. Different buildings and sites are labeled in black text, left to right: “Prudential Tower,” “200 Clarendon,” “Federal Reserve Building,” “Harbor Towers,” (two towers next to each other), “Long Wharf,” “Zakim Bridge,” and “Old North Church.” On the channel side of the landmass in the foreground the sites are labeled as well in white with small arrows, pointing to, left to right, “Pleasure Bay,” for the sandy strip in front, “Conley Terminal,” by the industrial cranes, and “Castle Island and Fort Independence” for the squat stone structure and grassy area.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{4f71e6a6-5e0c-4769-86d0-c3b56631c325}{193}\" paraid=\"590244063\">Image Credit</h2> <p paraeid=\"{4f71e6a6-5e0c-4769-86d0-c3b56631c325}{193}\" paraid=\"590244063\">Photo courtesy of Boston Harbor Now </p>",

A small difference can be seen in the edges of the island, the former shape stretched out further on the beaches.  A white line points from the east side of the present-day island with small white text that reads “Current island shape.” And on the northwest side of the North drumlin is a small black box indicating the site of the plant pictured on this panel. A white line points from here to white text that reads “Location of plant pictured below.” </p> <h3 paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{75}\" paraid=\"479623567\">Image Caption</h3> <p paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{75}\" paraid=\"479623567\">Above, the shape of the island in 1857 is superimposed on an aerial photo of the island during the reclamation process. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{83}\" paraid=\"129227527\">Image Credit</h2> <p paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{83}\" paraid=\"129227527\">Courtesy of The Central Artery Tunnel Project </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{91}\" paraid=\"1098642749\">Image (background)</h2> <p paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{91}\" paraid=\"1098642749\">A dark and grainy black and white photo of the 1912 refuse station on Spectacle Island. Looking at the station from the sandbar that connected the North and South Drumlins, the refuse station is on the drumlin. The sandbar has scatterings of lumber and logs strewn across it and in the water on the left is the remains of a structure or pier. On the left is a big building, with a smokestack reaching up to the middle of the panel. It is connected to a much bigger building, part of the refuse station, with many layers that reach out into the harbor. On the right side of the drumlin is barren with one small building standing alone, across the middle of it is random pieces of scrap and scaffolding standing up, in the middle is another small white building.  </p> <h3 paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{133}\" paraid=\"1953079777\">Image Caption (background)</h3> <p paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{133}\" paraid=\"1953079777\">In 1912, a new refuse station was completed on the narrow sandbar that connected the north and south drumlins.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{141}\" paraid=\"1711424183\">Image Credit (background)</h2> <p paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{141}\" paraid=\"1711424183\">Photo courtesy of Historic New England/SPNEA </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{149}\" paraid=\"1502146163\">Main Text</h2> <p paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{149}\" paraid=\"1502146163\">During the glacial period 95,000 to 11,700 years ago, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered this area. When the ice melted and receded, it left glacial debris in teardrop-shaped mounds called drumlins. Most islands in Boston Harbor are drumlins. Together, they are the only partially drowned drumlin field in North America. </p> <p paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{159}\" paraid=\"983059692\">When Europeans colonized the land in the 1600s, they named this island for its resemblance to a pair of spectacles (eyeglasses). As depicted in the inset image, the “Island” was in fact two drumlins linked by a narrow sandbar or tombolo. </p> <p paraeid=\"{972dcbda-3ca1-49ac-a682-fa2b7e3756dd}{165}\" paraid=\"435760490\">People have dramatically altered the shape of the island over time. From 1903-1959 deposits of factor and landfill waste between the north and south drumlins added width and height to the landform. In the 1990s, capping the landfill and reclaiming the landscape further changed the shape of the island. </p>",

Georges Island has a small white question mark in a black box indicating a visitor center. “Boston Harbor” is labeled in dark blue in the center. Other water features going down the coastline are labeled in the same dark blue: “Inner Harbor,” “Pleasure Bay,” “Old Harbor,” “Dorchester Bay,” and “Quincy Bay.” Two beaches on the coastline are labeled in white, the first is above Old Harbor “L Street Beach” and the second is in Quincy Bay, “Wollaston Beach.” Out in the harbor, “President Roads,” between Deer Island and Long Island, is labeled in dark blue, along with “The Narrows” between Gallops Island and Lovells Island. Also labeled in dark blue is “Nantasket Roads” between Peddocks Island and Rainsford Island and Georges Island to the north, as well as “Hull Gut” between Peddocks and an outstretch of land that is presumably Hull. Beneath the harbor islands, at the bottom of the map “Quincy Bay” and Hingham Bay are labelled, with “Hull Gut” labeled on an outstretch of land that is presumably Hull. The top right of the map is labeled “Massachusetts Bay” in a light blue with an arrow pointing upwards in a red circle that indicates “North.” Underneath the arrow is a graphic depicting the scale of the map. On top it has 2 kilometers labeled in a black line, and 1 mile labeled in a white line. On Spectacle Island there is a yellow dot which has a triangulated yellow field showing the field of vision from that spot on Spectacle Island.

A pier stood close to where ferries dock today. Here, the City of Boston delivered barges filled with garbage. Island factories compressed and cooked the garbage to extra grease to make soap and glycerin. The remains were converted into fertilizer or burned and dumped on the island. These and other factories closed by 1935 and the island became the city dump – processing 350 tons of waste daily until 1959. </p> <p paraeid=\"{1dcc47a5-1cb5-49c4-a3cd-4a06bdfae274}{170}\" paraid=\"336247991\">While these industrial plants offered jobs and provided for the comforts of city living, they also contributed to the destruction of Spectacle Island’s natural landscape during the 1800s and 1900s.  </p>",

Georges Island has a small white question mark in a black box indicating a visitor’s center. “Boston Harbor” is labeled in dark blue in the center. On land “Boston Logan International Airport” is labeled and in lighter gray has the runways outline. On the landmass just across the inner harbor, the bridges from Boston to Charlestown are highlighted in a light grey, but remain unlabeled. Other water features going down the coastline are labeled in the same dark blue: “Inner Harbor,” “Pleasure Bay,” “Old Harbor,” “Dorchester Bay,” and “Quincy Bay.” Two beaches on the coastline are labeled in white, the first is above Old Harbor “L Street Beach” and the second is in Quincy Bay, “Wollaston Beach.” Out in the harbor, “President Roads,” between Deer Island and Long Island, is labeled in dark blue, along with “The Narrows” between Gallops Island and Lovells Island. Also labeled in dark blue is “Nantasket Roads” between Peddocks Island and Rainsford Island and Georges Island to the north, as well as “Hull Gut” between Peddocks and an outstretch of land that is presumably Hull. Beneath the harbor islands, at the bottom of the map “Quincy Bay” and Hingham Bay are labelled, with “Hull Gut” labeled on an outstretch of land that is presumably Hull. The top right of the map is labeled “Massachusetts Bay” in a light blue with an arrow pointing upwards in a grey circle that indicates “North.” Underneath the arrow is a graphic depicting the scale of the map. Underneath the arrow is a small-scale image, depicting the scale of the map, on top it has 2 kilometers labeled in black, and 1 mile labeled in white. On Spectacle Island there is a yellow dot which has a triangulated yellow field showing the field of vision from that spot on Spectacle Island. Within this yellow field it includes Deer Island, President Roads passage, Nixes Mate, and the edge of Long Island.

The panel is made up of a background photo looking out from the North Drumlin looking towards Quincy Bay, with part of the South Drumlin in the right midground. Long Island is in the immediate foreground, with Peddocks and Nut Islands in the distance. The text is in a column with three paragraphs on the left with a map in the upper right corner.

The Harbor Islands are all depicted in green with their names in white text. Islands included (from approximately north to south): Snake Island, Deer Island, Long Island (with Long Island Head Light labeled on the north edge of the island), Nixes Mate, Lovells Island, Spectacle Island, Gallops Island, Georges Island, Thompson Island, Rainsford Island, Moon Island, Peddocks Island, Hangman Island, Nut Island, and Sheep Island. Georges Island has a small white question mark in a black box indicating a visitor’s center. “Boston Harbor” is labeled in dark blue in the center. On land “Boston Logan International Airport” is labeled and in lighter gray has the runways outline. On the landmass just across the inner harbor, the bridges from Boston to Charlestown are highlighted in a light grey, but remain unlabeled. Other water features going down the coastline are labeled in the same dark blue: “Inner Harbor,” “Pleasure Bay,” “Old Harbor,” “Dorchester Bay,” and “Quincy Bay.” Two beaches on the coastline are labeled in white, the first is above Old Harbor “L Street Beach” and the second is in Quincy Bay, “Wollaston Beach.” Out in the harbor, “President Roads,” between Deer Island and Long Island, is labeled in dark blue, along with “The Narrows” between Gallops Island and Lovells Island. Also labeled in dark blue is “Nantasket Roads” between Peddocks Island and Rainsford Island and Georges Island to the north, as well as “Hull Gut” between Peddocks and an outstretch of land that is presumably Hull. Beneath the harbor islands, at the bottom of the map “Quincy Bay” and Hingham Bay are labelled, with “Hull Gut” labeled on an outstretch of land that is presumably Hull. The top right of the map is labeled “Massachusetts Bay” in a light blue with an arrow pointing upwards in a red circle that indicates “North.” Underneath the arrow is a small-scale image, depicting the scale of the map, on top it has 2 kilometers labeled in black, and 1 mile labeled in white. On Spectacle Island there is a yellow dot which has a triangulated yellow field showing the field of vision from that spot on Spectacle Island. Within this yellow field it looks out towards Hingham Bay, including Long Island, Nut Island, Peddocks Island, Nantasket Roads, Sheep Island, and Hull Gut. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{3b8b15a6-5cbd-411a-ae9b-02a271b176df}{117}\" paraid=\"402197282\">Image Description (background)</h2> <p paraeid=\"{3b8b15a6-5cbd-411a-ae9b-02a271b176df}{117}\" paraid=\"402197282\">A photo looking out towards Quincy Bay. In the foreground is the slope of the North Drumlin covered in trees and small brush. To the right stretching into the midground is part of the South Drumlin. The rest of the photo captures Boston Harbor, islands, and the coastline against a clear blue sky. The land mass at the furthest distance is labeled in black text and indicated with arrows, left to right: “Hull,” “Hingham,” “Quincy Bay,” “Weymouth,” “Nut Island,” and “Houghs Neck.” Before the furthest landmass is Peddocks Island, composed of several drumlins that are labeled in white. The island closest to Spectacle is Long island, with its drumlins labeled in white. To the right of the island are the remains of pillars labeled “Former Bridge to Long Island.” Next to it is Nut Island and Houghs Neck labeled in white text. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{3b8b15a6-5cbd-411a-ae9b-02a271b176df}{179}\" paraid=\"947897931\">Image Credit</h2> <p paraeid=\"{3b8b15a6-5cbd-411a-ae9b-02a271b176df}{179}\" paraid=\"947897931\">Photo courtesy of Boston Harbor Now  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{3b8b15a6-5cbd-411a-ae9b-02a271b176df}{191}\" paraid=\"1649822128\">Main Text</h2> <p paraeid=\"{3b8b15a6-5cbd-411a-ae9b-02a271b176df}{191}\" paraid=\"1649822128\">This overlook features views of several other Boston Harbor Islands set against long vistas of coastal towns Hull, Hingham, Weymouth, and Quincy. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3b8b15a6-5cbd-411a-ae9b-02a271b176df}{201}\" paraid=\"1233971291\">The islands closet to Spectacle, Long and Moon Islands, were once connected to each other via a bridge. Both are owned by the City of Boston. Long Island has hosted a variety of social services and camps for Boston city youth, while Moon Island houses police and firefighter training facilities.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3b8b15a6-5cbd-411a-ae9b-02a271b176df}{207}\" paraid=\"119564989\">Peddocks Island lies just beyond Long Island. Notice that each of these islands is actually a chain of prominent hills connected by shallow spits of land. It is interesting to think how these two islands might serve as points of reference for the original height and shape of Spectacle Island. </p>",

Some fragments, including pottery sherds and horse bones, may be remnants of Spectacle’s past industries and inhabitants. These artifacts are all significant objects that contribute to our understanding of the history and use of Spectacle Island and the harbor. </p> <p paraeid=\"{804109c6-a7fa-40c9-9a27-b18ff715ae73}{191}\" paraid=\"1115180174\">Unique among these is “sea glass.” You may think sea glass comes from the sea, but it actually ends up there through human activity. Broken shards of glass discarded in the sea become cloudy and worn smooth as they are tumbled by waves and exposed to the abrasive ocean floor. Eventually, the glass washes up on Spectacle’s beaches through storms, currents, and tidal action. </p> <p paraeid=\"{804109c6-a7fa-40c9-9a27-b18ff715ae73}{197}\" paraid=\"414500910\">We encourage you to examine the sea glass on the beaches, but please leave these important artifacts where you find them for future generations to learn from and appreciate.  </p>",

Known as the “Big Dig,” this project reconnected Boston with its waterfront by replacing a six-lane overpass with an underground expressway. Workers used 3.7 million cubic yards of excavated earth from the Big Dig to shape and ca Spectacle’s landfill. The projected added 60 feet to the north and south drumlins, creating opportunities for incredible views of neighboring islands and the Boston Skyline. </p>",

After European colonization, the town of Boston owned the island and used it for pasturage.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{23}\" paraid=\"791927536\">Thomas Hutchinson, the father of the governor Hutchinson, became the first \"prominent owner\" of the island. Likely attracted to the island because of its rich soil and well protected location, he sold the island for $1,000 dollars in 1724. James Mortimer purchased the island in 1760, and continued to use the island for farmland. According to Edward Rowe Snow, a storyteller and historian, Mortimer’s death 13 years later, led to a complicated ordeal. Mortimer’s will stated that when he died, his wife Sarah would receive half of the island’s income, and his brother, Peter would get the other half. A provision in the will stated that should Mortimer’s brother die before his wife, then the island would go to a Peter Mortimer of Connecticut. James Mortimer had not planned for both his wife and his brother to die within the week of his own death. Though confusion ensued, Peter’s widow, Mary Mortimer, took ownership of the island by default. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{59}\" paraid=\"1473153888\">Snow suspects that during the American Revolution, Continental troops raided the island for sheep and cattle, as they did others in the harbor. William Marsh took control of the island in 1814, eventually purchasing the island from a faraway owner in 1830. Marsh died on the island in 1833.<sup>3</sup> The city of Boston purchased the island in 1867. After the Civil War, Colonel Jarvis Dwight Braman established a free Black school in the harbor either on Apple or <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-rain.htm\">Rainsford Islands</a>, though it is unknown which island.<sup>4</sup> </p> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{83}\" paraid=\"67107747\">The late 1800s and early 1900s history of Apple Island indicates that a variety of communities used the island. Edward Rowe Snow asserts that a few of the Portuguese fishermen who had been removed from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-island-boston.htm\">Long Island</a> relocated to Apple Island in the late nineteenth century. Around the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, illegal boxing matches also occurred on the islands, which caused quite the uproar in nearby areas. Police eventually stopped the matches. <em>King’s Handbook</em> mentions that in the late nineteenth century, people burned vessels on the island for their metals.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{123}\" paraid=\"1144423359\">The last couple who lived on the island, the Obers, built a small house and spent the summer there in 1932. A gale in November of that year blew the house away and the Obers chose not to rebuild. Not long after, the city flattened the island, and it became a part of Boston Logan Airport.<sup>5</sup> <br />  </p> <hr /> <h2 paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{143}\" paraid=\"1436476681\">Footnotes  </h2> <ol> <li> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{153}\" paraid=\"1482869337\">Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 15. </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{171}\" paraid=\"1393788911\">Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 159-160. </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{178}\" paraid=\"444570054\">Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em>, 225-26; Edward Snow,<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=0\"> <em>The Islands of Boston Harbor</em></a> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 121-126. </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{194}\" paraid=\"1818594366\">Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em>, 160; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 136. </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{214}\" paraid=\"638072336\">Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 118. </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{e6a50795-1a1e-41c4-b150-39a19f47ed65}{221}\" paraid=\"1882860326\">Snow,<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=0\"> The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em>, 121-126; Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em>, 159-160. </p> </li> </ol>",

Breaton renamed the island Susana Island for his daughter, although many continued to refer to the island as Hog Island. In 1687, Judge Samuel Sewall took possession of the island. Sewall established an orchard, and kept a flock of sheep on the island. In May 1775, colonial forces raided both <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/noddle-s-island.htm\">Noddle's Island</a> and Hog Island. They engaged British Marines on Noddles, after taking 500 sheep from Hog Island. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0aab47e8-c6f5-46c2-a54a-a022d274f3a2}{65}\" paraid=\"2142196051\">John Breed purchased the island in 1813 and built a small one-story mansion on its south side. Breed maintained a hay farm, which employed an overseer and workmen. Breed called the island \"Breed’s Island.\" The island remained known as Breed’s Island until the late 1800s when a new owner charged the name to Belle Isle.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p paraeid=\"{0aab47e8-c6f5-46c2-a54a-a022d274f3a2}{81}\" paraid=\"1455730598\">Around 1930, Belle Isle served as a site for dredged material disposal. From 1952 to 1971, the former island hosted drive-in movies. The Belle Isle Fishing Company used a 1.6- acre property for fishing and seafood distribution from 1978 to the early 1990s. Once closed, the property became a dump site for contaminants, which included hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead. Deemed unsafe, the City of Boston took control of the property in 1991 and began remediation efforts.<sup>3</sup></p> <p paraeid=\"{0aab47e8-c6f5-46c2-a54a-a022d274f3a2}{99}\" paraid=\"806613216\"> In 1961, Massport took control of Boston Logan airport and its expansion. The Commonwealth began construction plans for turning Belle Isle into an oil tanker terminal. Many objected to this, on account of nature still present on the former island. In 1975, the Metropolitan District Commission, now the Department of Conservation and Recreation, acquired Belle Isle Marsh. Belle Isle Marsh Reservation opened in 1986.<sup>4</sup> </p> <hr /> <h2 paraeid=\"{0aab47e8-c6f5-46c2-a54a-a022d274f3a2}{131}\" paraid=\"1596606357\">Footnotes </h2> <ol> <li> <p paraeid=\"{0aab47e8-c6f5-46c2-a54a-a022d274f3a2}{141}\" paraid=\"2048684704\">Sean Riley, \"Belle Isle Marsh: The Last Remaining Salt Marsh In Boston,\" last modified May 14,2020, accessed April 17, 2023, <a href=\"https://onewaterfront.thetrustees.org/blog-posts/2020/5/14/belle-isle-marsh-the-last-remaining-salt-marsh-in-boston\">Belle Isle Marsh: The last remaining salt marsh in Boston — One Waterfront</a>; Commonwealth of Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, <em><a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/doc/rumney-marshes-acec-salt-marsh-restoration-plan/download\">Rumney Marshes Areas of Critical Environmental Concern: Salt Marsh Restoration Plan</a></em> (Boston, 2002), 52. </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{0aab47e8-c6f5-46c2-a54a-a022d274f3a2}{164}\" paraid=\"1144855685\">Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 29–30, 87; Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883).  </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{0aab47e8-c6f5-46c2-a54a-a022d274f3a2}{182}\" paraid=\"774571507\">Edward Snow, <em>The Islands of Boston Harbor</em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002),149. </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{0aab47e8-c6f5-46c2-a54a-a022d274f3a2}{191}\" paraid=\"337574124\">\"R1 Success Story: Belle Isle Salt Marsh, Boston, Mass,\" Environmental Protection Agency, last modified July 22,2022, accessed April 17, 2023, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/brownfields/r1-success-story-belle-isle-salt-marsh-boston-mass\">R1 Success Story: Belle Isle Salt Marsh, Boston, Mass. | US EPA</a>; Sean Riley, \"Belle Isle Marsh: The Last Remaining Salt Marsh In Boston,\" The Trustees, last modified May 14,2020, accessed April 17, 2023, <a href=\"https://onewaterfront.thetrustees.org/blog-posts/2020/5/14/belle-isle-marsh-the-last-remaining-salt-marsh-in-boston\">Belle Isle Marsh: The last remaining salt marsh in Boston — One Waterfront</a>; Commonwealth of Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, <em><a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/doc/rumney-marshes-acec-salt-marsh-restoration-plan/download\">Rumney Marshes Areas of Critical Environmental Concern: Salt Marsh Restoration Plan</a></em>, 25, 83; Friends of Belle Isle Marsh, \"History,\" accessed April 17, 2023, <a href=\"https://www.friendsofbelleislemarsh.com/about/\">About – Friends of Belle Isle Marsh</a>. </p> </li> </ol>",

In 1658, the town leased the island to James Euerill and Rich Woody for a period of sixty years.  </p> <p>During the early colonial period, the island saw a great deal of tragedy. Like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/nixes-mate.htm\">Nixes Mate</a>, the city placed the bones of pirates, or those convicted of similar crimes, on display on Bird Island. According to Edward Rowe Snow, more than 15 \"notorious pirates\" had been buried on the island. In 1724, the crew of pirate John Philips killed him and then took the vessel into Boston. Captured, and placed on gibbets (gallows like structure to display dead bodies), the crew served as a warning sign to others.  </p> <p>In 1726, the town executed John Battis and his son, along with three Indigenous people in Charlestown. After their deaths, the town moved them and buried them on Bird Island.  </p> <p>In some cases, executions even occurred on the island. Around 1704, pirate John Quelch and fifteen of his crew faced piracy charges in Boston. Sentenced to death, the men had an escort of forty musketeers and two ministers. Executed on Bird Island, a newsletter described their death rather harshly, saying: \"So to appearance they dyed very obdurately and impenitently, hardened in their sin.\" </p> <p>As late as 1790, Bird Island remained a grassy islet, though heavy materials removed from the island almost leveled it completely.<sup>1</sup> The former island became known as the Bird Island Flats. In the 1930s, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved dredging to take place near and on the Bird Island Flats. By 1981, the former island had been vacant for seven years when Massport released a $125 million dollar development plan for the Bird Island Flats. Though shrouded in controversy because of its location and cost, the Bird Island Flats eventually got absorbed into Boston Logan Airport.<sup>2</sup> </p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li> <p paraeid=\"{397d986e-6ce8-4115-a37f-421013c62754}{106}\" paraid=\"1880915877\">Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 152-176; Edward Snow,<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=0\"> The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 79-81. </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{397d986e-6ce8-4115-a37f-421013c62754}{123}\" paraid=\"1947753341\">Rushworth M.

Offering a diverse array of ecosystems as well as integral shelter, the Harbor and its islands have been a vital resource for inhabitants of the area for thousands of years.</p> <p>Boston Harbor served as a major trading port for the English colonies during the 1600s and 1700s, as ships carrying commodities often made their way through Boston before traveling down the coast. Boston and its harbor served as a significant stop in Atlantic trading routes, supporting an empire that trafficked enslaved individuals and traded goods consumed and produced by enslaved labor.</p> <p>Due to its strategic location, Boston Harbor became a center of conflict during the era of the American Revolution. As punishment for the 1773 Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the Boston Port Act in 1774, which closed Boston Harbor to all ships. The first of what became known as the Coercive (or Intolerable) Acts, the Boston Port Act contributed to the organizing of the First Continental Congress later that year. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a> in 1775 and 1776, skirmishes between British forces and colonial militia occurred across the islands as both sides battled for control of the Harbor and its resources.

Many enslaved individuals, especially those coming from states along the coast, utilized ships bound for northern ports to gain their freedom.

For much of the past four centuries the harbor has been indiscriminately used as a dumping spot for detritus (dead organic material) and human waste, leading to its reputation in the 1980s as the \"harbor of shame.\" That all changed in 1984 with a court–ordered cleanup and the establishment of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which oversaw the Boston Harbor Cleanup and the construction and operation of the Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant, which maintains clean harbor waters today.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Thomas Wentworth Higginson to Wilbur Sibert, July 24th 1896. <a href=\"https://ohiomemory.org/digital/collection/siebert/id/14422/\">Ohiomemory.org</a>, last accessed September 2020.</li> </ol>",

However, the natural geography of the harbor proved difficult to navigate, with shifting tides alternately revealing and hiding deadly rocks and shoals. This resulted in the loss of many a fortune and sailors to its waters. Finally, in 1715, fed up with continued loss of lives and property, townspeople petitioned the colonial government of Massachusetts to construct a lighthouse at the edge of the harbor, paid for with money raised by a tax on all ships that entered and left the port. One penny per ton were paid by larger vessels and an annual tax of five shillings for smaller and local vessels. This funded the initial construction and continued upkeep and operational costs of the lighthouse. </p> <p>Located on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/little-brewster-island.htm\">Little Brewster Island</a> at the entrance to the harbor, the stone tower lighthouse was completed in 1716 and stood roughly 60 feet tall, most likely lit by a combination of candle and oil lamps. Boston Light first illuminated the harbor on September 16, 1716. Harbor resident George Worthylake served as its first lighthouse keeper. He lived on Little Brewster with his wife, two of his children, two enslaved people, and a hired servant. </p> <p>Unfortunately, tragedy befell the first two keepers. In November of 1718, while returning from the mainland, Worthylake and five other people drowned off the edge of Little Brewster Island. The other victims included Worthylake's wife Anne, daughter Ruth, servant George Cutler, an enslaved man called Shadwell, and a friend named John Edge.<sup>3</sup> The event inspired a poem titled, <em>The Lighthouse Tragedy</em>, written by a 12-year-old aspiring printer named Benjamin Franklin. The second lighthouse keeper, Robert Saunders, also drowned only a few days into his appointment while on his way back to Little Brewster Island. John Hays served as the third lighthouse keeper for Boston Light in as many years and had more luck than the first two. He requested that a fog cannon be placed on the island and, in 1719, acquired one as such, which stayed on the island in service for the next 132 years.</p> <p>Boston Light became a point of conflict between British and colonial forces during the American Revolutionary War. Occupying the lighthouse in 1774, British forces maintained control until July 1775, when a small colonial force arrived on Brewster island via whale-boats and set fire to the lighthouse. An eyewitness account recorded: \"I ascended an eminence at a distance, and saw the flames of the lighthouse ascending up to heave like grateful incense.\"<sup>4</sup> Although British marines started to rebuild the lighthouse, another outfit of 300 colonial troops stopped their progress a few weeks later. British troops destroyed the original Boston Light by setting off a series of timed explosives as its last act of retribution upon leaving Boston in June of 1776.<sup>5</sup> So while Boston Light was the first lighthouse station to be built in the territory that eventually became the United States, the original structure's destruction during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a> means it cannot lay claim to the oldest standing lighthouse in the country.</p> <p>Boston Light remained ruined until 1783, when the new commonwealth of Massachusetts rebuilt Boston Light. Keeping a similar style and dimensions as the previous structure, it now stood at 75 feet, its current height today. </p> <p>In 1790, ownership of the lighthouse was transferred to the federal government. After serving faithfully for 215 years, Boston Light was the last lighthouse in the country to be automated in 1998. The current keeper of Boston Light is civilian Sally Snowman, the light’s first female keeper. Appointed in 2003, Snowman continues the time-honored tradition in one of the country’s most iconic lighthouses.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>This entry on Boston Light comes from a Boston Harbor Islands newsletter feature of Boston Harbor lighthouses.

It has one central drumlin with an elevation of 70 feet, and excellent views of the surrounding Hingham islands.</p> <p>Used seasonally by the Indigenous population prior to European settlement, Bumpkin became one of the eight islands that established farming communities in the early years of colonization. Samuel Ward purchased the island from the town of Weymouth in the late 1630s. Harvard College inherited the island after Ward’s death in 1661. The college leased the island to tenant farmers who grew fruits and vegetables. During this time, fish drying operations occurred on the island, followed by a fish smelting operation. </p> <p>Harvard continued to collect rent from island tenants until 1900, when a 500-year lease signed by the Burrage family went into effect.<sup>1</sup> Albert Burrage commissioned a children’s hospital to be built in the center of the island. Architect Charles Brigham, designed a three-story building that took advantage of both the summer wind and sunlight. The building included two open air play areas, and a pavilion. The Burrage Hospital opened its doors in 1902. It offered free treatment to children with non-contagious diseases and disabled children whose parents were not able to give adequate care.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>The hospital suspended operations and transferred the island to the federal government when World War I began. The Navy built barracks, which housed 1,300 soldiers from 1917-1918.<sup>3</sup> A training station also went into operation at this time.  </p> <p>The Navy did not continue use of the island after the war, and the hospital reopened in the summer of 1940 to serve polio patients.<sup>4</sup> This continued until 1946, when a fire burnt the hospital to the ground. </p> <p>In 1973, The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management designated Bumpkin Island, along with 15 other islands in the harbor, part of the Boston Harbor Islands State Park. Twenty years later, The Friends of the Boston Harbor Islands established 48 test plots with 1500 seedlings to restore the historic vegetation on the island.<sup>5</sup> Today, the island is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. Visitors can enjoy the ruins of the hospital and farming structures. Picnic tables, campsites, and walking trails are available for those who are looking to enjoy the serenity of nature.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-bump.htm\">Island Facts: Bumpkin Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 9-20; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 26.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 144-147.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 97, 144.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 10; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 145.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 37, 145.</li> </ol>",

Somewhere in the middle of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-light.htm\">Boston Light</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/graves-light.htm\">The Graves Light</a>, this 35-acre island is one of the most secluded in the harbor.  </p> <p>Prior to European colonization, Indigenous peoples likely used the resources on the island seasonally for thousands of years. First granted to Elder Brewster of Plimouth Colony in the 1600, Charles Apthorp later purchased the island. Both Brewster and Apthorp owned other properties in the harbor. The name \"Calf Island\" likely derives from Robert Calef, who purchased the island from the Apthrops sometime in 1713. </p> <p>The treacherous waters of the outer harbor have led to wrecks on and just offshore the island. The Massachusetts Humane Society constructed a \"hut of refuge\" on the island in 1789, In an effort to aid survivors of these wrecks. James Turner owned the island in 1845, and built his home from two deckhouses that washed ashore from the wrecked steamer Ontario.<sup>1</sup> During this time, a small community of lobster fishermen built small wooden shelters on the island.<sup>2</sup> It is said, a vessel named <em>Mollie Trim</em> crashed ashore the island in January 1886 after a gale \"blew up\" and took the vessel straight toward the island. The only survivor, the captain, found a fisherman’s home on the island and received help.<sup>3</sup> </p> <p>Calf Island also fostered a social scene. On summer Sundays in 1883, many rushed to the island hoping to catch illegal \"pugilism\" or boxing matches, only to scatter if the harbor police came too close.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In 1902, Benjamin P. Cheney and his wife, actress Julia Arthur, built a colonial style, two-story summer estate with roofs used to collect rainwater. The Federal Government purchased the island from Cheneys for $46,500 during World War I much to their dismay. They never returned to the island.  </p> <p>The last of the Cheney estate were burned down in 1971, and in the 1990s vandals toppled one of two chimneys. Today, the island is a sanctuary for birds and still supports wild cherry, beach plum, tall grasses, chives, and mock orange. </p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-calf.htm\">Island Facts: Calf Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>James Turner later became the keeper of Bug Light at the western end of Brewster Spit.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 26; Edward Snow, <em>The Islands of Boston Harbor</em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 209-210.</li> <li>Snow, <em>The Islands of Boston Harbor</em>, 209-210.</li> <li>Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 225-26.</li> <li>Snow, <em>The Islands of Boston Harbor</em>, 210.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>One of five peninsulas in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>, Castle Island boasts 22- acres of land, a little more than two miles of walking trails, and the oldest fortified site in what was considered British North America. The former island has been connected to the mainland since 1928.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Similar to many other islands in the harbor, Indigenous people have accessed Castle Island seasonally for thousands of years. When Europeans arrived and colonized the area, they saw this area (then a true island) as a strategic military location. In the 1630s, Governor John Winthrop ordered the construction of the first fortification on this site. Originally named for William II of England, the fortification became known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-independence-castle-william.htm\">Castle William</a>. The General Court of Massachusetts ordered the imprisonment of at least one Quaker, Indigenous people, and French prisoners starting on the island as early as 1661.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>Growing tensions between residents of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and England led to the withdrawal of the colony’s charter in 1684. The crown appointed Sir Edmund Andros as the governor. Tensions continued to mount, and when news of the Glorious Revolution in England (the shift from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy) reached Boston in 1689, colonists arrested Sir Edmund Andros and sent him to Castle William. Andros tried to escape by dressing in women’s clothing, making it past two guards before being caught by a third guard. This failed attempt did not stop Andros from trying again. In his second attempt, Andros made it all the way to Newport, Rhode Island, before being captured and returned to Castle William. Eventually sent to England, he regained his freedom overseas.</p> <p>The 1700s brought expanded uses of Castle Island. For example, in 1764, the island housed around 3,000 patients during a smallpox epidemic. Sometime later, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dr-joseph-warren.htm\">Dr. Joseph Warren</a> opened an inoculation site on the island.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/boston-massacre.htm\">Boston Massacre</a> in 1770, the Sons of Liberty requested the removal of British troops from Boston. Two regiments retreated to Castle William, and the island served as a refuge to loyalists for next six years. The British eventually deserted Castle Island as they evacuated Boston in spring 1776, leaving the fort and the island in flames.</p> <p>Beginning in 1785, the General Court of Massachusetts appointed the island as a place for thieves and other convicts who had been sentenced to hard labor. The federal government took control over the island in 1798, and the two agencies reached an agreement, where the state prison continued to operate on the island.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In 1799, President John Adams designated the fortification, formerly known as Castle William, to Fort Independence. That same year, a Marine Hospital dedicated to sick sailors also opened on the island. The hospital used existing barracks and welcomed all officers of the Navy, Marines, as well as all seamen. The first facility of its kind to be built with Marine Hospital funds, the money came from a 20-cent tax on sailor’s salaries. It is also said that the Commonwealth’s first prison opened on the island to house French prisoners in 1799, remaining open until 1801.</p> <p>In 1800, construction began on a new fort on the island engineered as part of the First System defenses, otherwise known as the first forts built by the new United States.<sup>5</sup> During the War of 1812, the island served as a training site for soldiers mostly from Dorchester and the surrounding area.</p> <p>In late 1816, engineer Simon Bernard and his board convened to select sites for a new and cohesive coastal defense network. Fort Independence became one of the earlier generations of fortifications selected to be reengineered into a Third System fortification. Meant to serve as a secondary line of defense to Fort Warren on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/georges-island.htm\">Georges Island</a>, construction on Fort Independence began in 1833 and took nearly twenty years to finish.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>In 1826, 18-year-old Edgar Allan Poe enlisted in the military under the name \"Edgar A. Perry.\" Poe spent five months on Castle Island. While at Fort Independence, Poe heard the story of a duel that had occurred in 1817. According to the story, two lieutenants argued over a card game on Christmas day. After agreeing to a duel, the less popular lieutenant killed the other. In retaliation, the dead lieutenant’s friends sealed the killer in a vault. This story is believed to have inspired Poe’s 1846 short story <em>The Cask of Amontillado</em>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-albion-andrew.htm\">Massachusetts Governor John Andrew</a> sent the Fourth Battalion Massachusetts Infantry to Castle Island in 1861, and by 1863, the remodeled Fort Independence had become the headquarters for new Massachusetts recruits. After the Civil War, those stationed at Fort Independence had been transferred to Fort Warren.</p> <p>In 1890, the government granted the land surrounding the fort to the city and allowed for a park to be built.<sup>7</sup> Frederick Law Olmsted served as the park designer. Following the construction of the wood pile bridge in 1892, the city welcomed visitors to the island.</p> <p>Castle Island has been connected to the mainland via a concrete causeway since 1928. In 1962, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts took ownership over both Fort Independence and Castle Island. Today, Castle Island is operated as a state park and remains open for year-round visitation.<sup>8</sup> </p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.masshist.org/database/418\">A plan of Fort Independence</a>,\" Collections Online, Massachusetts Historical Society (MHS), accessed February 8, 2022.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017) 83-85.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/mus/pdfs/Castle-Island.pdf\">A Beacon and a Fort</a>,\" Massachusetts State Archives, accessed April 2023; \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/smallpox-inoculation-revolutionary-war.htm\">Smallpox, Inoculation, and the Revolutionary War</a>,\" National Park Service, last modified January 13, 2023, accessed April 12, 2023; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 85.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-independence-castle-william.htm\">Fort Independence- Castle William</a>,\" National Park Service, modified January 16, 2023, accessed April 12, 2023; \"<a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/mus/pdfs/Castle-Island.pdf\">A Beacon and a Fort</a>,\" Massachusetts State Archives.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/mus/pdfs/Castle-Island.pdf\">A Beacon and a Fort</a>,\" Massachusetts State Archives; Nathaniel Shurtleff, <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UWkUAAAAYAAJ/page/n3/mode/2up?q=castle+island\">A Topographical and Historical Description of Boston</a> </em>(Boston: Printed at request of the city council, 1871), 484-49.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 88,106,123,141; Shurtleff, <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UWkUAAAAYAAJ/page/n3/mode/2up?q=castle+island\">A Topographical and Historical Description of Boston</a></em>, 484-49.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/mus/pdfs/Castle-Island.pdf\">A Beacon and a Fort</a>,\" Massachusetts State Archives; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 88,106,141.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 106.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/edgar-allan-poe-writes-a-story-based-on-a-boston-harbor-legend/\">Edgar Allan Poe Writes a Story Based on a Boston Harbor Legend</a>,\" New England Historical Society, accessed April 12, 2023; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 90-96.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 92-93,189-190.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>One of five peninsulas within the boundaries of the park, Deer Island became connected to the mainland after the famous hurricane of 1938. Beach erosion filled in the Shirley Gut, which had separated the island from the town of Winthrop.<sup>1</sup> The former island bears the name \"Deer Island\" because of the abundance of deer on the island during early days of European colonization. Many accounts exist of colonists hunting \"plentiful deer\" who they said swam to the island from Maine to escape wolves.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>Prior to European colonization, Indigenous communities accessed Deer Island seasonally for thousands of years. The colonists pressured Indigenous peoples to convert to Christianity, and those who did moved into separate ‘praying communities.’ As colonists continued to encroach on land in the region, tensions between colonists and the indigenous population grew and eventually led to Metacom’s Rebellion (also called King Philip’s War) in 1675. </p> <p> Just five months after the war began, colonists set up an internment camp on Deer Island to relocate \"Christianized\" Indigenous people whom they believed could turn against the English and join the rebellion. Those interned numbered about 500 to 1,100 people and began with Nipmuc people from what is today South Natick, though exact numbers of those interned are unknown.<sup>3</sup> Women and children made up the majority of those interned on Deer Island, as colonists pressured many men from these ‘praying communities, to join an English proxy militia and attack other local indigenous tribes. The English Council directed settlers to \"Kill and Destroy\" any Indigenous person who posed a threat of hostility or who aided the resistance.<sup>4</sup> </p> <p>Deer Island eventually became overcrowded, and a secondary incarceration site opened on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-island-boston.htm\">Long Island</a>. Due to starvation, freezing temperatures and lack of shelter, very few survived internment. Colonists released survivors in May 1676. An unknown number of victims were smuggled off the island and sold as enslaved people in the West Indies or Tangier.<sup>5</sup> </p> <p>In 1677, the first quarantine station in the harbor opened on Deer Island. It required all ships originating from the West Indies to stop on the island before entering Boston. During the Revolutionary War, Major Greaton captured a British man-of-war barge off the coast of Deer Island. Greaton and his soldiers captured sheep and horses from that island to be used by the continental army.</p> <p>A resort opened on the island in the 1780s, which remained in operation until the mid 1800s. From the 1800s onward Deer Island essentially became a penal colony, an exiled settlement of prisoners. The first reformatory opened in the early 1800s. The Boston Militia established a fortification on the island in 1810. After the War of 1812, inmates from the reformatory constructed batteries on the sides of the island.<sup>6</sup> </p> <p>In 1847, the city established a new quarantine hospital on the island in response to the rising numbers of ailing immigrants arriving in Boston. Of the almost 5,000 admitted to the hospital, around 750 people died on the island. By 1850, the city created a municipal immigration station on Deer Island, the quarantine operation eventually moved to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/gallops-island.htm\">Gallops Island</a>.</p> <p>Starting as early as 1849, the city reused some of the same facilities to house inmates from South Boston. Called the \"Department of the House of Industry,\" the new establishment housed those who could not care for themselves or had committed misdemeanors such as drunkenness or vagrancy. They even received approval to convert a portion of the buildings into cells. The city also established the \"House for the Employment and Reformation of Juvenile Offenders- Boys,\" which held boys responsible for idleness, and larceny. A similar reformatory for girls followed. In 1896, after many years of different types of people being housed on the island, and many name changes, the institutions which remained on the island formally became known as Suffolk County House of Corrections and The House of Industry. This officially designated them Suffolk County institutions. By 1902, the city had transferred all inmates from South Boston to this facility.<sup>7</sup> </p> <p>During World War II, the federal government added batteries and established Fort Dawes on the eastern tip of the island. Tasked with harbor entrance command, they also worked with those on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/georges-island.htm\">Georges Island</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/outer-brewster-island.htm\">Outer Brewster Island</a> to operate the underwater mines.  </p> <p>The city built a primary wastewater treatment plant in 1968. In 1991 the Suffolk County House of Correction relocated off the island to allow for construction on an expanded treatment facility. The city also demolished Fort Dawes, the correctional buildings, and much of the old treatment facility at this time.<sup>8</sup> </p> <p>In operation by 1996, The Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant is a state-of-the-art facility that continues to keep the harbor clean. Its 12 large digesters have become a highlight in the harbor landscape. Deer Islands also boasts a 2.6-mile-long perimeter trail that offers scenic views of the harbor.<sup>9</sup> Although Deer Island’s history of imprisonment and containment are no longer visible, communities continue recognize this painful past. Every year, descendants of the Tribal Nations involved in King Philip's War host a commemoration of their ancestors’ suffering on Deer Island to raise awareness of the inhumane treatment Indigenous people endured and to demonstrate their communities' longstanding resilience and resistance.<sup>10</sup> </p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-deer.htm\">Island Facts: Deer Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 34. </li> <li>Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 112. </li> <li>Julianne Jennings, \"<a href=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered\">Deer Island: A History of Human Tragedy Remembered</a>,\" <em>Indian Country Today</em>, last modified September 12, 2018; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>, </em>(Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 122-123. </li> <li>“At A Council Held in Boston August 13, 1675,” accessed April 7, 2023, <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/evans/N00148.0001.001?view=toc\">https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/evans/N00148.0001.001?view=toc</a>; <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/legacy-genocide-resurfaces-boston-construction-planned-burial-site-0\">\"Legacy of Genocide Resurfaces in Boston as Construction Planned on Burial Site</a>,\" <em>Cultural Survival,</em> last modified July 27, 2019.</li> <li>Jennings, \"<a href=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered\">Deer Island: A History of Human Tragedy Remembered</a>;\" Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor </em>(Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 193-197; Olmstead Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report: <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>,</em> 122-123. </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 75, 90, 140; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report:<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, 34. </li> <li> Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report: <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>, </em>126-142; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: </em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"><em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a>, 34. </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>,</em> 90-102; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report </em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"><em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em>,</a> 34. </li> <li>“<a href=\"MWRA - How the Deer Island Treatment Plant Works.\">The Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant</a>,” last modified Sept. 2, 2009, accessed March 31, 2023. </li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/ethnographic-sites.htm\">Ethnographic & Archeological Sites</a>,\" Boston Harbor Islands, National Park Service, last modified February 26, 2015.  </li> </ol>",

The island is composed of one drumlin that is 79 feet. The island offers wonderful views of the harbor and surrounding islands.</p> <p>Like other islands in the harbor, indigenous people accessed the island seasonally for thousands of years before colonization.  </p> <p>In 1635, Captain John Gallops took ownership of the island, becoming the island’s namesake. Captain Gallops served as one of the earliest harbor pilots in the area.<sup>i</sup> 1800s. During the Revolutionary War, French troops built earthen batteries and even mounted guns on the island.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>In 1819, Peter and Margaret Newcomb purchased the island to use as farmland. Eight years later, the federal government spent over $2,000 dollars to have a gravel cliff cut off the island to improve Fort Warren’s defensive abilities. Peter Newcomb passed away in 1833. Following his death, Margaret Newcomb opened a resort and inn on the island, which became successful. During this time, she referred to the island as \"Newcomb’s Island.\" Newcomb eventually sold the business to Joseph Snow, who continued to operate the inn and restaurant. In 1852, the city of Boston operated a pauper's home on the island. The city purchased the island in 1856 for $6,000 dollars and continued to use the island as a pauper's home.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>In the 1860s, Boston deeded the island to the federal government. During the Civil War, the island served as a facility for both quartering and training. The military built 20 barracks on the island to house 3,000 soldiers. Around this time, the Newcomb Inn also closed, due to lack of visitation.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Many local regiments also “mustered in” on Gallops Island, before finishing their service. Two of the most notable instances of this are the 54th and 55th Massachusetts regiments, two of the first all-Black regiments in the United States. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/54th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">54<sup>th</sup> Regiment</a> arrived on Gallops Island in late August of 1865, and stayed on the island until September 2 when they returned to Boston. Greeted by an enthusiastic crowd, and served a hearty meal, they disbanded at the end of the festivities. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/55th-massachusetts-regiment.htm\">55<sup>th</sup> Regiment</a> arrived on Gallops Island shortly after the 54th and stayed on the island until September 13. They received similar greetings and festivities upon their return to Boston.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>After the Civil War, the federal government returned the island to the City of Boston. The city established a quarantine facility, which allowed the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/deer-island.htm\">Deer Island</a> facility to close. Tasked with screening ships thought to have high disease rates, by 1886 hospital staff saw more than 33,000 people a year. In the first fifteen years of operation, staff treated more than 181,000 people.  </p> <p>In 1916, the Federal Government paid the City of Boston $150,000 dollars to allow the United States Public Health Service to assume control of the quarantine hospital, which remained in use until 1937. The government also built immigration services on the island. The hospital director, named Dr. Alvin Sweeney planted ornamental shrubs and fruit trees throughout the island. The Civilian Conservation Corps also planted trees on the island during this time.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>After the closure of the hospital, the US Coast Guard established a maritime radio school. The school held up to 325 students. Students spent the whole day learning morse code, radio theory, and construction. One former student later remembered: </p> <blockquote>Learning morse code was the most difficult thing I ever did.<sup>6</sup></blockquote> <p>The island also housed a cooking and baking school that supported 150 students. Both schools closed when the war ended, and the island went to auction. Privately owned, it is likely the new owners had a dump site on the island. Sold again in 1953, barges docked off the side of the island incinerated trash.  </p> <p>In 1970, the Commonwealth established Boston Harbor Islands State Park, and the Commonwealth purchased the island in 1973. For many years, Gallops served as a popular camping destination, until its closure in 2000 due to the presence of asbestos on the island.<sup>7</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-gall.htm\">Island Facts: Gallops Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 28; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017) 43-52.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 30, 186; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, 43-52.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 92; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, 43-52.</li> <li>\"The 54th and 55th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiments,\" Last modified December 20, 2023, accessed April 5, 2023, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/african-americans-and-the-boston-harbor-islands.htm\">African Americans and the Boston Harbor Islands</a>.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 142-150.</li> <li>Steven Turner, \"Elmer Cocke and the Sinking of William J.

    "bodyText": "<p>Located seven miles from downtown Boston, this 53-acre island is home to Fort Warren, a National Historic Landmark. Although now owned and operated by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Georges Island once provided a strategic location for defending the port of Boston.</p> <p>Georges Island, like other islands in the harbor, first served as a seasonal fishing site for the Indigenous people in the area. They lived on the islands in the summer and moved inland in the winter.</p> <p>The island's first use as a fortification came during the American Revolution, when the French fortified the island in support of the colonists. Here, they placed cannons upon the hill overlooking the harbor entrance.<sup>1</sup> Throughout the 1800s, all ships entering Boston had to pass by Georges Island because of its location along two major shipping channels, Nantasket Roads and The Narrows. Recommendations to properly fortify the island came as early as 1808 but went ignored until after the War of 1812.</p> <p>The federal government purchased the island in 1825 and started construction on the fortification in the 1830s as part of an improved system of U.S. Coastal fortifications called the Third System.<sup>2</sup> Named for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dr-joseph-warren.htm\">Dr. Joseph Warren</a>, Major General of the Massachusetts Militia and a casualty at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>, Fort Warren served primarily as a training camp for most of 1861. Some of the first soldiers sent to Fort Warren received orders to finish cleaning left-over construction debris. This included soldiers of the of Second Battalion of Infantry, later the Twelfth Massachusetts volunteers, who sang while they completed this monotonous task, and it is from them that the song \"John Brown’s Body\" originated.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Fort Warren later became a prison for Confederate soldiers, sailors, and political leaders during the U.S. Civil War. Allowed to walk the parade grounds, read newspapers, and receive goods from Boston, those imprisoned at Fort Warren received relatively good treatment. The treatment can in large part be contributed to Colonel Dimick, who commanded the Fort from October 1861 to 1863 and ensured the wellbeing of prisoners.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Around 2,300 prisoners entered Fort Warren during the Civil War. Most did not stay for very long due to the prisoner exchange system, especially in the early days of the war. Despite several escape attempts, no one successfully escaped Fort Warren. One group even made it as far as Maine, before being recaptured and taken back.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Fort Warren had several high-profile prisoners, including General Richard S. Ewell and Alexander Stephens, the Vice President of the Confederacy. Stephens, brought to Fort Warren in May of 1865, was first in solitary confinement in a basement casemate before being moved to an upper casemate. He wrote in his diary shortly after being released from solitary by saying,</p> <blockquote>I am allowed to go in out at pleasure, and walk the grounds when I choose, between sunrise and sunset; see any person in my family or any of my personal friends... in other words I am simply put on parole in the Fort.<sup>6</sup></blockquote> <p>Fort Warren underwent further modifications during the Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II. After the military decommissioned the fort in 1950, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts purchased the island in 1958.</p> <p>Construction of the fort reshaped the island’s original drumlin landform. Shade and fruit trees were planted over the years, and staghorn sumac and wildflowers spread naturally. Today, red-winged blackbirds and swallows inhabit the island year-round, while owls, hawks, and shore birds occasionally visit during their annual migrations.<sup>7</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-geor.htm\">Island Facts: Georges Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park, “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-geor.htm\">Island Facts: Georges Island,</a>\" <em>National Park Service</em>, accessed November 2022; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a> </em>(Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 83-86.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 89-93.</li> <li>Jay Schmidt, <em>Fort Warren: New England’s Most Historic Civil War Site</em> (Amherst: UBT Press, 2003), 17-30.</li> <li>Schmidt, 31-42.</li> <li>Schmidt, 63-71.</li> <li>Schmidt, 51-58.</li> <li>Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park, “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-geor.htm\">Island Facts: Georges Island</a>.\"</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Formerly 72 acres, Governors Island stood separated from the mainland at about 2 miles away from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-wharf-boston.htm\">Long Wharf</a>. Similar with many islands in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>, Indigenous people likely accessed Governors Island prior to European colonization.  </p> <p>In early colonial history, the island was named Conant’s Island, after Roger Conant, a citizen in Hull. In 1632, the island was granted to Governor John Winthrop where he planted some of the first apple and pear trees. He also made efforts to plant other fruits, such as grapes and plums.  </p> <p>Governors Island became a site for coastal defense after a bill passed in 1744 called for the installation of a block house and 2-gun batteries on the island. In 1808, the federal government purchased 7 acres on Governors Island from James Winthrop. On the summit, they constructed an enclosed eight-pointed star fort constructed of stone. A demilune (crescent shaped structure which served a first line of defense), and south point batteries were also added along the water’s edge. The fort on Governors Island was originally named Fort Warren, after Doctor and General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dr-joseph-warren.htm\">Joseph Warren</a>, who was killed in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>. However, the name was transferred to a new Fort Warren on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/georges-island.htm\">Georges Island</a> in 1833. The fort on Governors Island was later renamed Fort Winthrop. </p> <p>By 1846, the United States Government acquired the remaining acreage of Governor’s Island. Fort Winthrop underwent some modifications, including building brick and granite structures as well as adding a seawall to prevent further erosion. Batteries were also expanded, and 15-inch guns were added to the fort. </p> <p>In 1880, Fort Winthrop returned to caretaking status. Following a magazine explosion in 1902, the military abandoned the fort in 1905. By 1946, Fort Winthrop was destroyed, and Governors Island was absorbed into Logan Airport to make room for runway expansion. </p> <h2>Footnotes: </h2> <ol> <li> <p>Edward Snow, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 108. </p> </li> <li> <p>Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 165. </p> </li> <li> <p>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>,</em> 89-90; Snow, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em> , 111-12. </p> </li> <li> <p> Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 90-92. </p> </li> <li> <p> Snow,<em> </em><em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em>, 114-15; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 99. </p> </li> </ol>",

Grape Island is recognized as a wildlife haven, offering an abundance of wild berries for birds and other animals to enjoy. An island for the outdoor enthusiast, Grape Island features trails, beaches, picnic areas, and camp sites.</p> <p>Similar to many of the Boston Harbor Islands, Grape Island likely provided valuable resources for early inhabitants of the area. With the arrival of European settlers in the 1600s, several of the islands, including Grape, became converted into farmland. Throughout the 1600s and early 1700s, several farmers and farming families shared ownership of the island.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>At the time of the Revolutionary War, Elisha Leavitt, a Tory Loyalist, owned the island. As British forces searched for resources in the islands during the Siege of Boston, Leavitt gave British forces access his hay. In what became known as the Battle of Grape Island, townspeople of Weymouth and the local militia saw British soldiers taking hay on May 21, 1775. Sounding the alarm, local colonial forces initially fired upon the British before taking boats to the island and driving the British away.<sup>2</sup> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abigail-adams.htm\">Abigail Adams</a>, living in the area, recalled the event to her husband, John Adams:</p> <blockquote>You inquire of me who were at the engagement at Grape Island. I may say with truth all of Weymouth, Braintree, Hingham, who were able to bear arms, and hundreds from other towns within twenty, thirty, and forty miles of Weymouth. Both your brothers were there; your younger brother, with his company, who gained honor by their good order that day. He was one of the first to venture on board a schooner, to land upon the island.<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>Later caretakers of the small agricultural island include a Captain Smith in the late 1800s, Captain Billy McLeod and his wife from the early 1900s to the 1930s, and finally the Torresson family, who left the island around 1940.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>During the 1970s, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management designated 16 islands, including Grape Island, as part of the new Boston Harbor Islands State Park.<sup>5</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-grap.htm\">Island Facts: Grape Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Edward Snow, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=0\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 160.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 30; Snow, <em>The Islands of Boston Harbor</em>, 161; Richard Frothingham, <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/historyofsiegeof02frot/page/108/mode/2up \">History of the Siege of Boston</a></em> (Boston: C.

Rocky outcroppings surround the island. They sit at 15 feet above sea level at high tide, making them a dangerous peril to passing ships.  </p> <p>In 1843, IWP Lewis, Civil Engineer to the US Lighthouse Survey, expressed surprise that there was no navigational aid on The Graves. A series of signal buoys previously warned sailors of the danger, but when the area became a new major shipping lane for larger vessels in the early 1900s, a lighthouse on The Graves became more necessary.<sup>1</sup> </p> <p>Congress appropriated $188,000 for the construction of a new lighthouse. Construction began in 1903, with lighthouse builder Royal Luther in charge. Granite was cut from Cape Anne in Rockport to build the tower. The seven-ton interlocking stones forming the first 40 feet, are pinned to each other and the ledge with heavy wrought-iron spikes. Standing at 113 feet tall, Graves Light is the tallest light in the harbor. </p> <p>On September 1, 1905, Keeper Elliott C. Hadley lit the brightest light north of Cape Cod for the first time. The helical glass lantern at the top is cast from 44,000 lbs of bronze and originally housed a Fresnel lens of the first order, the pinnacle of illumination technology for much of the last two centuries. Created by French physicist Augustin Fresnel (Freh-nel), these lenses revolutionized maritime navigation. Using a series of cut and angled prisms to better refract and reflect light, what was once 60-80% of light lost in a beacon was lowered to less than 20%. A first-order lens is the largest in the series as it is used to indicate to mariners the entrance of the harbor. With a height of 12 feet, a diameter of 7 feet, and sitting atop a bed of liquid mercury, Graves Light ensured the safe navigation of vessels through the area surrounding The Graves.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Even with this technology, disaster still struck over the following decades. In 1938, the 419-foot steamer The City of Salisbury crashed into a reef due to inaccurate depth charts not far from The Graves. Aboard was a cargo of animals ranging from pythons and cobras to monkeys and 20 crates of rare birds. The ship eventually split in two, and while no human life was lost aboard the \"Zoo Ship,\" most of the animals were saved, (although decades later, a monkey skeleton was reportedly found on one of the other harbor islands.) The Salisbury eventually sank and parts of it were raised and sold as scrap.<sup>3</sup> </p> <p>Over the years, other changes occurred at Graves Light Station. The Fresnel lens and the mercury housing began to deteriorate over time. Automation eventually replaced the three-person crew at the lighthouse. The Fresnel lens and mercury housing deteriorated over time to warrant replacement. In 1976, this magnificent first-order Fresnel lens became replaced by a modern, VRB 25 lamp. The original lens was taken away to be placed in storage at the Smithsonian Institution.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In 2012, Graves Light Station was declared Federal Surplus and offered free to surrounding towns and nonprofits. Finding no takers, it was sold at a federal auction to a Boston businessman, Dave and Lynn Waller, for nearly $1 million dollars in September of 2013. Since then, the Wallers have been dedicated to the preservation and restoration of this historic lighthouse structure. The rusty iron pier and stairs were sandblasted and painted; floors, walls and ceilings were rebuilt; and a functional bathroom and kitchen were installed in the tower. Part of the extensive restoration includes the installment of a Fresnel lens constructed from scavenged pieces of Australian lenses built between 1880 and 1920.<sup>5</sup> </p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes </h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, 71-72; \"Graves Light Station,\" United States Coast Guard, August 27, 2019, <a href=\"https://www.history.uscg.mil/Browse-by-Topic/Assets/Land/All/Article/1944393/graves-light-station/\">https://www.history.uscg.mil/Browse-by-Topic/Assets/Land/All/Article/1944393/graves-light-station/</a>; Jeremy D'Entremont, \"History of Graves Light, Boston Harbor, Massachusetts,\" New England Lighthouses: A Virtual Guide, Accessed March 31, 2023, <a href=\"http://www.newenglandlighthouses.net/graves-light-history.html\">http://www.newenglandlighthouses.net/graves-light-history.html</a>.</li> <li>Edward Snow, <em>The Islands of the Boston Harbor</em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 195; D’Entremont, \"History of Graves Light, Boston Harbor, Massachusetts;\" Sally R.

Its intertidal land includes a sandspit and mussel beds.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Similar to several islands within the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>, Indigenous peoples accessed Great Brewster Island as a summer residence and used its natural resources. In the 1600s, Great Brewster Island was granted Elder William Brewster, the first preacher and teacher in the Plymouth Colony. After his death, the town of Hull acquired Great Brewster Island.<sup>2 </sup></p> <p>In 1856, the town of Hull built <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bug-light.htm\">Bug Light</a> on the edge of the Great Brewster spit to light the entrance of the Narrows Channel. In June 1929, during maintenance, Bug Light caught on fire and could not be saved. The lighthouse was replaced in 1930 by a gas operated lighted bell buoy. It remained in place until a small steel tower with an automatic light replaced it. The tower is still present today, near the original spot of Bug Light.<sup>3</sup> </p> <p>Around the late 1800s to early 1900s, a colony of summer cottages occupied Great Brewster, allowing locals and tourists to visit the island. Guests included a group of four upper-class women from Lowell, Massachusetts. Visiting Great Brewster Island in 1891, these women kept a 58-page journal where they documented what they did, ate, read, and discussed during their trip, dubbed \"Ye Square Partie of Ye Merry Trippers.\" Unfortunately, there are no traces of the Merry Trippers' beloved cottage, as all the cottages on this island were evicted and demolished at the outset of World War II.<sup>4</sup> </p> <p>During WWII, the US military constructed a bomb and chemical-proof bunker on Great Brewster Island to serve as a control post for a harbor minefield that spanned from Hull to the Broad Sound Channel north of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/deer-island.htm\">Deer Island</a>. Two 90-millimeter rapid fire guns were installed on the northern bluff. Temporary barracks housed the 120 soldiers of Battery C, 9th Coast Artillery stationed on the island. Additional elements, including two 37-millimeter guns, machine guns, searchlights, and observation stations, helped complete the control post.<sup>5</sup> </p> <p>In 1944, military operations on Great Brewster Island ceased. There are still remnants of a military bunker and observation station, and some stone wall foundations of summer cottages that were once there.<sup>6</sup> </p> <p>Joining Boston Harbor Islands State Park in the 1970s, Great Brewster continues to be owned and managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation today. </p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-grbr.htm\">Island Facts: Great Brewster Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes: </h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a>,</em> 77-79.</li> <li>National Park Service Boston Harbor Islands, \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-grbr.htm\">Great Brewster Island Facts</a>.\" Date last modified November 30, 2022; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a>, </em>77-79.</li> <li>Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King's Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 244; Jeremy D'Entremont, \"<a href=\"http://www.newenglandlighthouses.net/narrows-light-history.html\">Narrows Light History</a>,\" NEW ENGLAND LIGHTHOUSES: A VIRTUAL GUIDE.

However, the island was labeled as \"Hayman’s Island\" in a chart published in London in 1775. The island is 6 acres and is made up of low granite and slate outcroppings and a fine gravel beach. Rising only three feet in elevation, Hangman Island can be difficult to see from the mainland and neighboring islands.  </p> <p>In the 1600s, Hangman Island was used as a slate quarry and in the late 1800s fisherman huts occupied the island. The island was much larger and higher prior to the colonial period. However, quarrying that took place on Hangman Island likely accelerated erosion and as of 2016, there are no visible remnants of the fisherman huts. One flagpole is intact in the middle of the island. </p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-hang.htm\">Island Facts: Hangman Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a>,</em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 89-90; National Park Service Boston Harbor Islands, \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-hang.htm\">Hangman Island Facts</a>,\" date last modified November 30, 2022; Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 214.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>, </em>(Boston: National Park Service, 2017) 33-35; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, 89-90.</li> </ol>",

Similar to other islands in the harbor, local indigenous communities likely accessed the island seasonally before European settlers arrived.</p> <p>John Langlee purchased islands now known as Langlee, Sarah and Ragged in 1686. Langlee ran a tavern and small boat yard in Hingham. The primary residence of the Langlee family became Ragged Island. At the time of its purchase, the island now called Langlee Island had been called Ibrook's Island. Langlee's daughter Sarah, called \"Ragged Sarah Langlee,\" is said to be the namesake for Sarah and Ragged islands. Sarah Derby (Langlee), later went on to start the first coed school in New England, and one of the earliest in the country. </p> <p>In 1860 John R. Brewer, who already owned a large parcel of land on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/world-s-end.htm\">World's End</a>, purchased both Langlee and Sarah Islands.<sup>1</sup> Brewer hired <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-law-olmsted.htm\">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> in 1886 to create subdivision plan on World's End. Although they never separated, Olmsted had a variety of trees planted on World's End from 1891-1894. Dedicated to the reforestation of the islands, the tree planting efforts extended to both Sarah and Langlee.<sup>2</sup> In the 1893 publication,<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/historyoftownofh0203hing/page/n371/mode/2up?q=langlee+island\"> <em>The History of the Town of Hingham</em></a>, author Thomas T. Bouve described the island:</p> <blockquote>a beautiful spot. Steep ledges surround it, except for small intervals, where there are gravelly beaches, upon one of which stands a fine linden. Shrubs abound upon the uplands. It will be, in a few years, more beautiful than now, thanks to the enlightened taste of the gentleman who owns it. He has planted many small trees, which will eventually cover it with forest growth, as was originally the case when the country was settled, and restore it to the condition in which all the islands of Boston harbor should be. Had they been kept so for the past two centuries, the forces of erosion would not have succeeded in practically sweeping some of them from the face of the earth, and destroying the contour of all.<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>Today, the island is owned and operated by the town of Hingham. Primitive camping is available on the island, though a permit from the <a href=\"https://www.hpd.org/\">Hingham Police Department</a> is required. Visitors can enjoy foot trails, tall trees, and views of the surrounding islands.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-lang.htm\">Island Facts: Langlee Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Edward Snow, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=0\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 165-166; Olmstead Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, </em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"><em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 93-100.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 187-188.</li> <li>Thomas T.

    "bodyText": "<p>Little Brewster Island sits 9.3 miles from downtown Boston. The island is characterized by a large cliff on the northern side of the island, and mussel beds that connect the island to Great Brewster Island during low tide.<sup>1</sup> Perhaps best known as the home of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-light.htm\">Boston Light</a>, this 7-acre island is rich with history.</p> <p>Mariners first petitioned to erect a lighthouse in the outer mouth of the harbor as early as 1713. In response, a committee led by Lieutenant Governor William Tailer scouted several islands for the most suitable place for a light. In 1715, the General Court of Massachusetts passed the Boston Light Bill. This bill named the location for the light as the southern part of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/great-brewster-island.htm\">Great Brewster Island</a>, then called Beacon Island, and today known as Little Brewster Island. The town of Hull granted the island for use and construction began.<sup>2</sup> Built of rough-cut stone, and first lit in 1716, Boston Light, became the first lighthouse in the United States. Other structures built on the island during this period included a house, wharf, and a barn.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>The first keeper, Georges Worthylake, grazed sheep on Great Brewster Island. In November 1718 while on a trip back to Little Brewster, Worthylake drowned just off the edge of the island. Perhaps even more tragically, several others drowned with him, including his wife, daughters, an enslaved person named Shadwell, and a servant. The following year, the third lighthouse keeper, John Hayes, requested a fog gun be placed on the island to aid vessels in fog. The court approved his request and installed a cannon on the island in 1719. The cannon remained on the island for 132 years.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Following the passage of the Boston Port Bill, the British arrived in the harbor and took control of the island. In July 1775, a detachment of soldiers, under command of Major Vose, landed on the island and burnt the wooden parts of Boston Light. Although British Marines began repairs immediately, 300 soldiers sent by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">General Washington</a> descended upon the island two weeks later and rendered the light unserviceable. The British began repairs once more, but they had not finished by the time they evacuated Boston in June 1776. As they left, they destroyed Boston Light.</p> <p>Little Brewster Island remained dark until 1783 when the Massachusetts Legislature paid to erect a new lighthouse on the base of the original light.<sup>5</sup> The new light stood at 75 feet, raised to 89 feet in 1859. Built with rubble stone and lined with brick, its foundation is granite. The Commonwealth maintained control of the light, until 1790 when the federal government took control of both the light and by default the island as well.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>The rocks that surrounded Boston Light still proved themselves dangerous and wrecks continued into the 1800s. Keepers at Boston Light actively participated in lifesaving missions. In 1840, the keeper rescued 30 people from the Diana. which had filled with water during a storm. In 1860, a keeper housed the crew of the Ewan Crerar, who had rowed to Little Brewster Island after their brig had gotten caught on a ledge along <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-graves.htm\">the Graves</a>. In 1861, Hull Pilot Boat No 2 rescued 13 survivors off the coast of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/shag-rocks.htm\">Shag Rocks</a>; those who did not survive washed up on the shore of the island days later.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>To pass the time on the secluded island, different keepers had different strategies. Some, such as George Worthlake, had families living with them. Others supplemented their income by entertaining sailors. Tobias Cook, keeper from 1844 until 1849, enjoyed hosting visitors on the island. This included a short-lived \"Spanish\" cigar factory, which brought young girls in from Boston. Cook’s successor, William Long, kept an active social agenda as well. His daughter’s journal recounts trips to Great Brewster and around the Brewster Spit during low tide. She also highlights numerous visitors to the island, even saying:</p> <blockquote>As many as six pilots landing at once to enjoy a social hour or two at the light.<sup>8</sup></blockquote> <p>During World War I, Boston Light dimmed in response to U-boat alarms. In 1940, the U.S Coast Guard took control of the light and extinguished the light during World War II. In 1948, the Coast Guard electrified the light.</p> <p>Though electrified, Boston Light continues to be permanently staffed, as authorized by Congress in 1989. Current lighthouse keeper Dr. Sally Snowman has served since 2003. Snowman is both the first civilian keeper of the light and the first female keeper. The island is not accessible to visitors, due to a dock broken during a winter storm several years ago.<sup>9</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-libr.htm\">Island Facts: Little Brewster - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <h2>Footnotes </h2> <ol> <li><em>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,</em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 78, 101-110.</li> <li>Ralph Smith, \"<a href=\"BOSTON LIGHTHOUSE - The Mariners\">Photograph, Gelatin- Silver Print</a>\" Accessed April 11, 2023;  Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King's Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 216-218.</li> <li><em>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 101-110.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,</em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> <em>Volume 1: Historical Overview</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 60-62; National Park Service Boston Harbor Islands, \"Boston Light,\" Accessed April 11, 2023.</li> <li>Ralph Smith, \"<a href=\"BOSTON LIGHTHOUSE - The Mariners\">Photograph, Gelatin- Silver Print</a>\" Accessed April 11, 2023; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 60- 62.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 101-110; United States Coast Guard, \"<a href=\"Boston Light > United States Coast Guard > All.\"> United States Coast Guard > All.|\">Boston Light</a>,\" Accessed April 11, 2023.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> <em>Volume 1: Historical Overview</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 65-68.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> </em><em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,</em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> <em>Volume 1: Historical Overview</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 62, 65-67.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 101-102.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>During the late 1700s, Boston recognized the need for navigational aid to assist ships crossing the Broad Sound Channel. In response to this need, the first Long Island light station was installed on a northern hill in 1794. Soon after in 1819, Congress commissioned a new, larger, and sturdier tower. It cost $11,500 dollars for the lighthouse, and the Boston Marine Society picked the location on the north end of the island.<sup>1</sup> First lit in 1819, the light, then named \"Inner Harbor Light,\" stood at 20 feet tall.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>In the 1840s, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-island-boston.htm\">Long Island</a> Head Light underwent multiple inspections. Hard winters in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a> and poor upkeep had resulted in cracked and broken glass as well as rotting wood within the tower. These issues caused leaks and decreased stability of the entire structural foundation. The lighthouse needed a total overhaul. In 1844, the South Boston Iron Company completed construction of the first cast-iron lighthouse in the United States, which stood on the site of the original Long Island Head Light.  </p> <p>This light underwent reconstruction in 1881, and it relocated further west on the island around 1900 so that fire from nearby Fort Strong would not damage the light. </p> <p> In 1918, lighthouse keeper Edwin Tarr passed away on the island. The bureau of lighthouses never filled his position. Custodians continued to light the beacon until 1929, at which point the lighthouse became automated. Discontinued in 1982, the US Coast Guard revisited the decision, and in 1985, the US Coast Guard installed a solar-powered light, which still operates today. In 2011, the National Park Service acquired the lighthouse, making it the only property on the Boston Harbor Islands solely owned by the federal government.<sup>3</sup> Long Island Headlight remains recognizable by its white tower and black lantern, although trees frequently cover all but the very top.<sup>4</sup></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes  </h2> <ol> <li>\"Long Island Head Light,\" United States Coast Guard, United States Coast Guard Historian's Office, Accessed April 4, 2023, <a href=\"https://www.history.uscg.mil/Browse-by-Topic/Assets/Land/All/Article/1956355/long-island-head-light/\">Coast Guard Long Island Headlight Article</a>.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 61; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, </em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"><em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 116. </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 117; Nancy Seasholes, \"Long Island Head Light,\" Last updated February 26, 2015, Accessed April 4, 2023, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/long-island-head-light.htm\">Long Island Head Light - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service)</a>.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, </em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"><em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 117-118.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Just five miles out from Boston sits the biggest of the Boston Harbor Islands, aptly named Long Island. At 225 acres, the island is composed of three drumlins and a freshwater marsh on the west side of the island. Today, Long Island is owned by the City of Boston and is not accessible by public ferry or private boat.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Prior to European colonization, local Indigenous communities accessed Long Island seasonally. When European encroachment of the region led to Metacom's Rebellion (also known as King Philip's War) from 1675-1676, colonists used Long Island as an incarceration site for \"Christianized\" Indigenous peoples whom colonists feared might join the rebellion. Many of those incarcerated here had been moved from Deer Island, an internment camp that had become overcrowded. Hundreds perished due to extreme conditions and starvation. A burial site remains on the island today.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a> in 1775, about 500 continental soldiers boarded the island from whale-boats and took all the sheep and cattle on the island, along with 17 British prisoners. The following year, continental soldiers occupied Long Island and placed several batteries here and on other islands in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>. They destroyed a British cargo vessel carrying military supplies and reinforcements. The captain of the vessel and 36 others died with the ship. All were brought ashore and buried on Long Island.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In 1818, The Boston Marine Society recommended a light be placed on Long Island. The light went into service in 1819 and stood 20 feet tall, with a keeper's house connected to the light. By 1844, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-island-light.htm\">lighthouse </a>needed to be replaced in its entirety as a result of neglect. The new lighthouse became the first cast iron lighthouse in the country.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>By the 1800s, several mansions and hotels had been built on the island. The Long Island Company purchased the island in 1849, with plans to build hotels and summer residencies. The start of the Civil War brought troops to the island once again; it housed about 1,000 conscripts and several heavy artillery companies. The Long Island-House Hotel served as the headquarters for the island camp called Camp Wrightman.<sup>5</sup> The author of the regimental history for the Ninth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry remembered his time on Long Island fondly, saying,</p> <blockquote>The transference of the regiment from Faneuil Hall to Long Island was indeed, a great blessing to all parties interested. The freedom of the island, with its green fields, pure salt air and bright sky, infused new life in both officers and men...<sup>6</sup></blockquote> <p>Around 1882, the City of Boston evicted a Portuguese fishing village from Long Island, forcing them to move to nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/peddocks-island.htm\">Peddocks Island</a>.<sup>7</sup> The city then acquired the island’s biggest hotel and turned it into an almshouse.</p> <p>In 1899, Camp Wrightman formally received the name Fort Strong in honor of Major General George C. Strong, who died of wounds sustained at the Battle of Gettysburg. Replaced again in 1901, Long Island Head Light was moved further west on the island in order to avoid damage from gunfire at the expanding fort. Althought it had grown to eight batteries by 1906, Fort Strong saw minimal use during World War I and went into maintenance status in 1922.</p> <p>Returning to operation during World War II, Fort Strong controlled the northern minefields in the harbor. This lasted until 1943 when control was transferred to forts that had more modern equipment. Although operators at Fort Strong continued to perform maintenance on the mines, the fort went into standby status and all big guns on the island were removed.</p> <p>The military used Fort Strong in some capacity until 1948.<sup>8</sup> Construction on the bridge that connected Long Island to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/moon-island.htm\">Moon Island</a> concluded in 1951, successfully joining Long Island Hospital to the mainland. At the time, Long Island Hospital focused on chronically ill patients. Since the placement of the almshouse in the 1880s, Long Island has served as the home to various social services, including a hospital, nursing school, mental health facility, and homeless shelter.<sup>9</sup> The City of Boston removed the structurally unsound bridge in 2015, ending all programs on the island.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-long.htm\">Island Facts: Long Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-long.htm\">\"Island Facts: Long Island,\"</a> <em>National Park Service</em>, accessed November 2022.</li> <li>Julianne Jennings, \"Deer Island: A History of Human Tragedy Remembered,\" <em>Indian Country Today,</em> last modified September 12, 2018, <a href=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered\">https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered</a>; \"Legacy of Genocide Resurfaces in Boston as Construction Planned on Burial Site,\" <em>Cultural Survival,</em> last modified July 27, 2019, <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/legacy-genocide-resurfaces-boston-construction-planned-burial-site-0\">https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/legacy-genocide-resurfaces-boston-construction-planned-burial-site-0</a>.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a> </em>(Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 29-33, 76-86. </li> <li>Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/long-island-head-light.htm\">\"Long Island Head Light,\"</a> <em>National Park Service</em>, date last modified February 26, 2015.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>,</em> 61-64, 187. </li> <li>Daniel George Macnamara, <em>The History of Ninth Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, Second Brigade, First Division, Fifth Army Corps: Army of the Potomac</em> (Boston: E.B Stillings & Co.

At high tide, the island is 119 acres, counting intertidal acres. Lovells Island is composed of three forested drumlins connected by marshes. In the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps planted a variety of trees and plants in an attempted to return vegetation to the island. Although the expansion of Fort Standish in 1939 led to the clearing of this vegetation, many species are beginning to find their way here once more.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Prior to European contact, local Indigenous people accessed the island seasonally for fishing in the summer and moved inland in the winter. In the years after European settler colonization, the people of Charlestown used Lovells for timber, with half of the timber being saved for construction of a fort on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-cast.htm\">Castle Island</a>. The first \"hut of refuge\" in the United States was put on Lovells Island in by the Massachusetts Humane Society in 1787. The island also briefly served as a quarantine station for ships entering the harbor in the late 1600s. In 1782, a French Man-of-war ship called the <em>Magnifique </em>wrecked off Lovells Island.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>In December 1858, Lovells Island made Boston news when the headline \"Escape of a Fugitive Slave from a Vessel in Boston Harbor\" appeared in multiple Boston newspapers. A freedom seeker named Philip Smith had been discovered as a stowaway on a ship from Wilmington, North Carolina. Once discovered, he jumped overboard and swam to nearby Lovells Island. Frostbitten, he managed to hail a passing ship and make his way to abolitionists in Boston.<sup>3</sup></p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/bab22199-d6e9-4973-924a-dc7d87c07cc1\"><img alt=\"Newspaper clipping about a fugitive slave escaping through Boston Harbor.\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/bab22199-d6e9-4973-924a-dc7d87c07cc1/original.png?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An article regarding a freedom seeker, Phillip Smith, who stowed-away on a ship and swam to Lovells Island when discovered onboard. (Credit: The Liberator, December 31, 1858.)</em></p> <p>Garrisoned during the U.S. Civil War, Lovells island became the home of a training station called Lovells Island Military Reservation. In 1887, the Board of Engineers recommended that three-gun turrets be placed to fortify Lovells Island. By 1900, the Board of Engineers ordered seven concrete batteries to be constructed at the fortification, now named Fort Standish, and transferred to the Coast Artillery when finished.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In 1903, two range lights were constructed on the island. They stood 400 feet apart, connected by a 7-foot walkway that also connected to the keeper's quarters and the oil house.<sup>5</sup> Charles Jennings, former keeper of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-light.htm\">Boston Light</a> became the keeper of the Lovells range lights. Harold Jennings, son of Charles Jennings, remembers his childhood fondly in his book <em>A Lighthouse Family</em> and recounts the years following World War I:</p>   <blockquote>After World War I, they cut down on the complements and there were only caretakers. There were other families on the island besides us but they were up on the other end of the island. Their job was to keep the gun placements clean and make sure no one broke into them. Keep the different generators running on the island in case the guns had to be used; and general Maintenace...The disappearing gun emplacements had an archway to them which was as wide as a house... We would make echoes and climb the steel ladder. We would imagine we were part of the gun crew.<sup>6</sup></blockquote> <p>Harold Jennings, worked as the keeper of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lovells-island-range-lights.htm\">Lovells Range Lights</a> for more than twenty years before the lights were ordered to be extinguished in 1939 to make room for the expansion of Fort Standish.</p> <p>Fort Standish had all guns operational by 1940. The island offered a variety of training opportunities for soldiers, including a communication school, a gunnery, and a field school. Following World War II, the military declared Fort Standish excess. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts purchased the Island in 1958.<sup>7</sup> Lovells Island has since become a part of Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park. Today, visitors enjoy Lovells primarily as a camping island. </p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-love.htm\">Island Facts: Lovells Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>National Park Service Boston Harbor Islands, \"Lovells Island Facts,\" date accessed October 2022, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-love.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-love.htm</a> </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 132-134.</li> <li>\"Escape of a Fugitive Slave from a Vessel in Boston Harbor,\" <em>The Liberator</em>, December 31, 1858.</li> <li>Gerald W.

The Loring's of Hull purchased the island in 1719 and referred to the island as \"Bridges Island\" because the island appeared to span between the Great and Outer Brewster Islands. Then in 1759, owner John Gould called the island \"Gould Island.\"<sup>1</sup></p> <p>In the 1840s a fishing community lived on Middle Brewster. Three fishermen owned the island, and had it divided evenly. <em>The King's Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> describes red-roofed houses that lined the island at this time. In the 1870s, August Russ purchased the island from the fishermen, and built a summer villa on the southern cliff. Although the fishing community retained a small portion of land, Russ leased the rest and fostered a summer community on the island. The summer community used the fishermen's houses and turned them into summer cottages. Actress Julia Arthur, and her husband, businessman, Benjamin P. Cheney, had a summer home on the island before they built their home on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/calf-island.htm\">Calf Island</a> in 1902. Other notable guests of Middle Brewster Island included William Halsall, a marine painter who is said to have frequented the island, even in bad weather. Notman, a photographer, is also said to have spent two seasons on the island. From research, this \"Notman\" was likely either the famed Canadian photographer William Notman or his younger brother John Sloan Notman, who owned a studio in Boston.  </p> <p>By the 1880s, only one fisherman remained on the island.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>In 1892, Melvin O. Adams purchased the island and built a small villa, along with an arch and a bell. Adams' arch is one of the structures still visible on the island, although ruins can be seen.<sup>3</sup> By 1900 the island sold again, this time to Richard S. Whitney. Whitney built a home on the western part of the island.</p> <p>Middle Brewster Island joined Boston Harbor Islands State Park in the 1970s, and the island today serves as a nesting site for shorebirds, including gulls, and cormorants.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-mibr.htm\">Island Facts: Middle Brewster Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a><em>,</em> 141-150.</li> <li>M F Sweetster, 1882.<em> King’s Handbook of Boston Harbo</em>r (Cambridge: Moses King), 220-221; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> <em>Volume 1: Historical Overview</em></a>, 26, 188.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a>, 141-150.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Situated in the middle of Quincy Bay is the 54-acre peninsula Moon Island. One of the five peninsulas in the harbor, Moon Island has been connected to Squantum via a causeway since the 1870s. It boasts a single drumlin that has one of the highest elevations in the harbor at 98 feet above sea level. Sumac groves and meadow grasses can be found throughout the peninsula. Owned and managed by City of Boston, Moon Island serves as a training site for the Boston Fire Department and hosts a shooting range for the Boston Police Department. For these reasons, visitation to Moon Island is prohibited.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Similar to many of the other islands in the harbor, local Indigenous peoples likely accessed Moon Island seasonally.<sup>2</sup> After European colonization, settlers used the island as farmland. Colonial troops mustered in on the island during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a> in the early years of the American Revolution.</p> <p>In 1878, the City of Boston acquired the island and began work on a massive sewerage project that drastically changed the topography of the island. By its completion in 1884, the project cost 6 million dollars, over 180 million in today’s dollars.<sup>3</sup> The project focused on putting a drainage system at south end of the Charles River with an outlet that led to Moon Island. Moon Island had been selected after preliminary tests showed that the area had a \"favorable ebb current.\" Some sewers went directly to Moon Island, while other main sewers stopped first at pumping stations and then diverted to Moon Island.</p> <p>One of these pumping stations, called the Calf Pasture Pumping Station, began operating in 1884. It worked by screening wastewater and then pumping the sewage through a mile long tunnel under the Neponset River to Moon Island. On the island, a reservoir that stretched five acres held waste in four granite tanks until the tide got high enough for the waste to be released further out into the harbor. These efforts pushed the sewage far enough out into the harbor that the water quality in the inner harbor improved and made popular activities like swimming and yachting more enjoyable.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Construction of a garbage reclamation plant took place in 1892, but the plant relocated to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/spectacle-island.htm\">Spectacle Island</a> in 1912.<sup>5</sup> In 1951, the City of Boston completed the construction of a bridge that connected nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-island-boston.htm\">Long Island</a> to Moon Island. In the following years the Boston Fire Department installed their training facility on the island. The sewerage plant did not close until the 1970s. Since its closure, the main use of the island became the training facility that is still present on the island today.<sup>6</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-moon.htm\">Island Facts: Moon Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 151.</li> <li>Other names for the island have included Half-Moon Island, Manning Island and Mennen's Moon. </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, 151-153.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 171, 191.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 171, 191.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, 151-153; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 15.</li> </ol>",

This is why the light is sometimes called 'Bug Light.'<sup>1</sup> </p> <p>Completed in 1856, builders installed a sixth order Fresnel lens that same year. A sixth order Fresnel is the smallest of the Fresnel lenses, and frequently used to light channels and harbors. Its light is visible for or seven nautical miles. A fog bell, affixed to the side of the light, blew every twenty seconds in times of poor visibility.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>The first keeper, Nathaniel Hooper, served until 1871. Many others served over the years. Several vessels required assistance, when their boats either became aground or capsized. Sometimes island locals arrived faster, and successfully rescued stuck mariners. Brothers, Arthur and Tom Small both served as keepers of Bug Light. In the winter of 1923, a storm caused Tom's boat to capsize. After life savers of unsuccessfully searched for him, his brother refused to give up and eventually found him clinging onto his boat.</p> <p>Edward Rowe Snow, a historian and story teller, told a tale of a keeper who had fled from the Great Lakes, escaping a murder charge. In some versions of his tale, the keeper is a pirate who buried treasure on the islands in the harbor.<sup>3</sup> Another tale dates to the Civil War. Soldiers stationed on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/georges-island.htm\">Georges Island</a> heard gunshots across the water. On high alert due to a rumor of a Confederate ship in New England waters, several soldiers sailed over to investigate. To their relief they found no Confederate ship, rather the lighthouse keeper had been shooting at rats in the lighthouse. In jest, soldiers later dubbed the incident, the \"Battle of Bug Light.\"<sup>4</sup> </p> <p> In June of 1929, during maintenance which included removing exterior paint with a blow torch, the light caught fire and could not be saved. A gas-operated lighted bell buoy immediately replaced the lighthouse in 1930. Standing at the base of the former lighthouse, the buoy had an automatic light and fog bell. It remained in place until a small steel tower with an automatic light replaced it. That small steel tower is present in the harbor today, close to the original spot of \"Bug Light.\"<sup>5</sup></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Edward Rowe Snow, <em>The Lighthouses of New England, 1716-1973</em> (Carlisle: Commonwealth editions, 1945), 222-224; \"Non-Extant Navigational Aids\"(National Park Service). Accessed March 29, 2023. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/other-navigational-aids.htm\">Non-extant Navigational Aids - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service)</a>.</li> <li>Jeremy D'Entremont, \"Narrows Light History,\" New England Lighthouses: A Virtual Guide, Accessed April 29, 2021, <a href=\"http://www.newenglandlighthouses.net/narrows-light-history.html\">History of Narrows (\"Bug\") Light, Boston Harbor, Massachusetts</a>; \"The Fresnel Lens\" (National Park Service) Accessed March 30, 2023, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/caha/learn/historyculture/fresnellens.htm#:~:text=The%20sixth%20order%20is%20the,%2C%20distance%2C%20efficiency%20and%20recognition\">The Fresnel Lens - Cape Hatteras National Seashore (U.S. National Park Service)</a>.</li> <li>M F Sweetster, <em>King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge: Moses King, 1882), 217; D'Entremont, \"Narrows Light History.\"</li> <li>Jay Schmidt, <em>Fort Warren: New England's Most Historic Civil War Site</em>, (Amherst, NH: UBT Press, 2003), 106.</li> <li>D'Entremont, \"Narrows Light History.\" </li> </ol>",

Today the \"island\" is impossible to see at high tide and covers only an acre long at low tide.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The origin of the name Nix is unknown. One legend claims that Nix had been a pirate who arrived in Boston in the 1690s. He and a companion went ashore the island to bury treasure. After they finished, he shot his companion and buried him on the island with the treasure. Another legend that originated in the 1800s says a Captain Nix had been betrayed by one of his mates. Sent to the island as punishment, the mate continued to profess his innocence. Before his demise, the marooned man cursed the island. He said that the island would disappear beneath the waves to prove that he was not guilty.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>There are a couple, more likely reasons for the island’s disappearance. First granted to John Gallops for use as pastureland in 1636, colonists quarried rock from the island throughout the 1700s. It is plausible that this impacted the size of the island over time. Another likely reason is erosion. Located where the three channels converge, Nixes Mate faces incredibly rough water.  </p> <p> While the story behind the naming of Nixes is fiction, crime upon the high seas did leave its mark on the history of the island. Boston saw its fair share of buccaneers. One of these buccaneers, William Fly, led a mutiny against the captain of the Elizabeth. Fly and his coconspirators continued to sail the ship, until their capture. Found guilty, and Executed for their crimes, Bostonians took their corpses to Nixes Mate for public display.<sup>3</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-nima.htm\">Island Facts: Nixes Mate - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King's Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 173-175.</li> <li>Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King's Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 173-175.</li> <li>Ken Mallort, <em>Boston Harbor Islands: National Park Area</em>.

    "bodyText": "<p>One of the former Boston Harbor Islands that has disappeared into today’s East Boston, Noddle’s Island echoes Boston’s military and shipbuilding history.</p> <p>Noddle’s Island gained its name from William Noddle, one of the first European occupants of the island. William Noddle lived at Noddle’s Island sometime around 1630. Not much else is known of Noddle as he drowned in 1632.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The Island had an active presence during the Siege of Boston in the Revolutionary War. In May 1775, colonial forces of 300, led by General Stark, raided farms on Noddle’s Island and other surrounding islands. A conflict occurred with some British Marines, who drove colonists back to nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/chelsea-creek.htm\">Chelsea Creek</a>. More skirmishes occurred over the next day before British forces retreated to their post in the harbor. Colonial troops returned to several islands a few days later to finish dispersing livestock and destroying supplies.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>After the British evacuated in 1776, Noddle’s Island became heavily fortified with a fort that became known as Fort Strong. Noddle’s Island later became outfitted with barracks to serve as a hospital for the French in 1780. These barracks remained in place until 1833.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In the mid to late 1800s, Noddle’s Island became one of several islands that served as one of the locations of Boston’s growing shipbuilding industry in East Boston. As King’s <em>Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> noted:</p> <blockquote>Some of the finest ships that ever sailed were constructed here…between 1848 and 1858 more than 170 vessels were built at East Boston; of which 99 exceeded 1,000 tons each, and 9 were above 2,000 tons.<sup>4</sup></blockquote> <p>Sometime in the 1900s (likely mid-century), Noddle’s Island became absorbed into East Boston.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Edward Snow, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=0\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 146-147.</li> <li>Olmstead Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 76; Moses Foster Sweetser, <em><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=45EtAQAAMAAJ\">King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</a></em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 112; Richard Frothingham,  <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/historyofsiegeof02frot/page/108/mode/2up\">History of the Siege of Boston</a></em> (Boston: C.

The peninsula is just over eight miles away from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-wharf-boston.htm\">Long Wharf</a> and boasts 20.5 upland acres.  </p> <p>Indigenous people, including the Massachusett Tribe, likely accessed Nut Island seasonally for thousands of years before European colonizers took ownership of the land.  </p> <p>Colonists used the island for cattle, and in 1793, colonists constructed two driftways that anchored both Nut Island and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/world-s-end.htm\">World's End</a> to the mainland. Put in place to ease the movement of cattle to and from the mainland, the driftways permanently changed the topography of the harbor. </p> <p>The Alger Foundry, of South Boston established an ordnance testing site on Nut Island in 1876. They conducted tests with 15-inch guns, and projectiles that weighed as much as 500 pounds. The testing site used targets located across the way on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/peddocks-island.htm\">Peddocks Island</a>. In 1890, the Commonwealth acquired the peninsula to expand Boston's sewage system. Construction began on the facility three years later. The Metroplitan District Commission took control of the facility in 1919.  </p> <p>By 1952, The Nut Island Primary Wastewater Treatment Plant opened under commission from the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority and the MDC and replaced the original facility.<sup>1</sup> Designed to treat the sewage produced in the Southern half of the Boston area, it treated and released sewage a mile out into the harbor. The plant's design, considered \"modern\" at the time of its opening, left it vulnerable to strain. Though staff have fond memories of their time at the plant, they grew disenfranchised and did not inform higher ups of maintenance issues. Both the plant’s susceptibility to strain and a lack of maintenance contributed to four engines shutting down in 1976, and eventually led to disaster in1982 when staff inadvertently dumped 3.7 billion gallons of raw sewage into the harbor.<sup>2</sup> The town of Quincy, and several environmental organizations brought Civil Action suits against the MDC for the pollution. The court found MWRA liable as the successor to MDC and from there the parties focused on remediation efforts.<sup>3</sup> </p> <p> Construction of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-deer.htm\">Deer Island</a> Waste Water Treatment Plant began in 1989. Engineers created an interisland tunnel between Deer and Nut and built new facilities on the island. In 1998, the Commonwealth demolished the old Nut Island Plant and opened Nut Island headworks. Owned and operated by MWRA today, Nut Island serves as a preliminary treatment location for waste, before it is sent to Deer Island. The Nut Island outfalls, which can be used to drain the cleaned sewage into the water are no longer operational, but several outfalls remain in place, ready for use in case of emergency.<sup>4</sup> The area surrounding the facilities supports a public and a popular fishing spot.  </p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-nuti.htm\">Island Facts: Nut Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 13-16, 173,178; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 163-165. </li> <li>Paul F Levy, \"When Good Teams Go Wrong,\" <em>The Harvard Business Review</em>, March 2001, Retrieved from <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2001/03/when-good-teams-go-wrong\">https://hbr.org/2001/03/when-good-teams-go-wrong</a>. </li> <li>United States of America, Plaintiff, Appellee, v.

The owner at the time, Arthur W. Austin also quarried granite. The same granite, later faced a building in Charlestown and paved several streets in Boston.  </p> <p>The Federal Government purchased the island in 1913 for $2,500 and constructed Battery Jewell in 1941 to bolster defenses in the outer harbor. Battery Jewell, housed 125 soldiers, included 6-inch radar guns, searchlights, bunkers, and equipment to operate the underwater mining operation (in conjunction with Fort Warren and Fort Dawes). Deactivated in 1946, the island was sold as surplus and remained privately owned until acquired by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to become part of the Boston Harbor Islands State Park.<sup>1</sup> </p> <p>Today, the ruins of Battery Jewell remain, and coastal waterbirds nest and sometimes even harbor seals rest on the rocks of Outer Brewster Island.<sup>2</sup> </p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-oubr.htm\">Island Facts: Outer Brewster Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes  </h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 171-173; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 30, 90.</li> <li>\"Island Facts: Outer Brewster Island,\" Boston Harbor Islands, Accessed March 29 2023, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-oubr.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-oubr.htm</a>.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Peddocks Island is one of the largest of the Harbor Islands, sitting between Hull and Quincy. The size of the island varies between 288 acres at high tide and 184 acres at low tide.<sup>1</sup> Composed of five drumlin hills connected by low lying sand flats called tomblos, Peddocks is separated into four sections: East Head, Middle Head, West Head, and Prince Head. Peddocks also has the longest shoreline in the harbor, at about 35 miles long. It is an incredibly diverse island, with ponds, marshes, and forests.<sup>2</sup> Like other islands in the harbor, Peddocks first served as a seasonal home to the Indigenous people in the area, who stayed on the island and fished in the summer before moving inland in the winter. After European colonization, Peddocks served as a grazing area for cattle for many years.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Summer cottages were put on the island as early as 1876, some built by squatters, others built by residents of Boston and other neighboring areas. In the late 1880s, a Portuguese fishing village moved to Peddocks after being evicted from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-island-boston.htm\">Long Island</a>, floating their homes across the harbor. By 1900, at least one hotel stood on the West Head, and two more had been built on the island by 1907.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In 1887, the War Department purchased land on East Head for a military installation.<sup>5</sup> The fort was later named Fort Andrews. Completed in 1904, Fort Andrews served primarily as a training and staging area for soldiers going off to Europe during World War I.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Despite the military presence, many residents remained on the island either part-time or year-round. One resident, Matilda Silvia, was the daughter of a tailor who served at Fort Andrews and lived on the island after his retirement. Silvia remembered her upbringing fondly in her book <em>Once Upon an Island</em>, saying,</p> <blockquote>Peddock's Island had been at the center of our lives, and anyone else who had who had grown up there. As children we embraced the natural learning and survival, and as adults, we relied on community and simplicity. When you're raised on an island, it is difficult to know or want any other kind of life. From never giving up the catch of the day to trusting that a captain would make it through ice to pick you up after school. From watching cannons explode on the hillside behind your home to smelling the first batch of fresh bread in the Fort’s bakery. All of these experiences and memories brought you back to The Rock [Peddock's], that one place you could count on and where [the sound of the ocean] would lull you to bed, and the neighbors would welcome you with a game of cards or a warm meal. It was hard to imagine living for very long anywhere else... When all you could hear was the water lapping, and the waves crashing, that was when you knew you were home.<sup>7</sup></blockquote> <p>During World War II, the fort again became a training area for soldiers. In 1944, 1,300 Italian prisoners of war (POWs) were transferred from Fort Mckay in South Boston to Fort Andrews. These so-called prisoners were part of \"Italian Service Units.\" While at Fort Andrews, they worked in a supervised environment and were paid. These POWs were even allowed to have visitors at the Fort and could go into Boston on special permits.</p> <p>In 1951, the military declared Fort Andrews an excess installation, auctioning it off in 1957. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts acquired Peddocks in 1970 and the island has since become part of Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park.<sup>8</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-pedd.htm#:~:text=At%20184%20acres%2C%20Peddocks%20is%20one%20of%20the,tombolos.%20Total%20acreage%20at%20low%20tide%20is%20288.\">Island Facts: Peddocks Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>National Park Service Boston Harbor Islands \"Peddocks Island.\" Date last modified October 2022. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-pedd.htm#:~:text=At%20184%20acres%2C%20Peddocks%20is%20one%20of%20the,tombolos.%20Total%20acreage%20at%20low%20tide%20is%20288.\">Island Facts: Peddocks Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></li> <li>Kevin Damstra, <em>Peddocks Island Interpretive Guide for Rangers and Volunteers,</em> Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Conservation and Recreation (2005), 23-28.</li> <li>National Park Service, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/cli-peddocks-island.pdf\"><em>Cultural Resource Inventory: Peddocks Island</em></a>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2021), 27-28. </li> <li>Cathy Stanton, \"<a href=\"https://cathystanton.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Peddocks-cottage-report-FINAL.pdf\">A Place of Quiet Adventure: An Ethnographic Study of the Peddocks Island Cottages</a>,\" <em>Boston Harbor Islands National Park Area</em>, (2016), 37-39.</li> <li>Gerald W.

Langlee ran both a tavern and a boatyard in Hingham. Langlee's daughter, Sarah Derby, often called \"Ragged Sarah Langlee,\" is said to be the inspiration for the names of the three islands her family owned.

By 1880, a restaurant and observatory operated on the island. Sketches from the 1880s, depict a large pavilion, a beautiful pier, and a rustic gazebo on the island. Sources suggest, a footbridge connected these amenities to a lavish resort at Downer's Landing on the island.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>An account from the 1890s describes the island as: </p> <blockquote>a very picturesque mass of rock, and the scarlet and yellow of the sumacs, and other wild shrubs, form a fiery contrast to the deep olive green of the savins here and there among the ledges...very interesting from an artistic point of view.<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>All auxiliary structures are no longer present on the islands.

    "bodyText": "<p>Just six miles from Boston sits the 21- acre Rainsford Island. The island has two drumlins that reach 49 feet above sea level and provide excellent views of the surrounding islands in the harbor. Owned and managed by the City of Boston, access to the island is extremely limited. </p> <p>Similar to other islands in the harbor, Indigenous people in the area accessed the island seasonally for thousands of years before colonization. Purchased by Edward Raynsford in 1636, he used the island for farming and grazing. Raynsford lived on the island with his family until his death in 1680.  </p> <p>The City of Boston purchased the island in 1737, using it as a quarantine station. This meant any ship that entered <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a> from overseas had to stop at the island to be checked for any evidence of disease aboard. The city built two hospitals on the island: one for smallpox, and the other for fever.<sup>1</sup> Poor conditions meant that many of those brought to the island did not return home. During this time, the town government allowed the keepers of the island to run a summer resort, which opened on the eastern head of the island in 1819. It accepted boarders only when no infectious diseases were present on the island. </p> <p>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts purchased the island in 1852. They established three almshouses and a hospital for sick state members of the poor. Conditions on the island continued to decline, resulting in many deaths. A report in the 1860s revealed all Commonwealth-run houses had been poorly run and maintained. Soon after, the Commonwealth’s facilities moved to Long Island and, and the city purchased the island in 1872. The city opened a men’s almshouse and a hospital for Civil War veterans who sought medical treatment. The hospital remained operational until a facility in Chelsea opened.<sup>2 </sup>Those in the almshouse during this era faced severe overcrowding and mistreatment. Those capable of work, cut stone.  </p> <p>In 1889, the city began consigning women members of the poor and downcast to Rainsford. Like the others before them, these women faced terrible and unsanitary conditions. A <em>Boston Post</em> article called the facility \"A disgrace to the City of Boston.\" <sup><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">3</span></sup></p> <p>Appalled by the treatment of those on the island, activist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alice-north-lincoln.htm\">Alice North Towne Lincoln</a> filed a formal complaint to the City of Boston Board of Aldermen. It took nine months of testimony and 54 hearings, but the city closed the facility in 1894 and moved the women to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-island-boston.htm\">Long Island</a>.<sup> 4</sup></p> <p>As Boston considers its next chapter, Rainsford is moving in a new transformational direction. The shoreline erosion of Rainsford is currently being studied by the Stone Living Lab, and the results will benefit management decisions and greater understanding of climate change for future years. The island is still owned and operated by the City of Boston and is a part of Boston Harbor Island National and State Park. <sup>5</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-rain.htm\">Island Facts: Rainsford Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>, </em>(Boston: National Park Service, 2017) 28-29, 140-142; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 210. </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>,</em> 134-141; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report:<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em>, 210; Moses Foster Sweetser,<em> King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 182; William McEvoy and Robin Hazard Ray, <a href=\"https://www.mountauburn.org/wp-content/uploads/FOR-MAC-Revised-Rainsford-Island-12-13-2020.pdf.;\">Rainsford Island: A Boston Case Study in Public Neglect and Private Activism </a>(Independently Published, 2019), 33-35. </li> <li>McEvoy and Ray, <a href=\"https://www.mountauburn.org/wp-content/uploads/FOR-MAC-Revised-Rainsford-Island-12-13-2020.pdf.;\">Rainsford Island: A Boston Case Study in Public Neglect and Private Activism</a>, 31-36, 48. </li> <li>McEvoy and Ray, 49. </li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://stonelivinglab.org/research/island-sedimentation-sea-level-rise-and-coastal-resiliency/\">Island Sedimentation</a>\", accessed April 3, 2023.</li> </ol>",

In 1686, John Langlee purchased Sarah Island, along with Langlee and Ragged. Langlee worked as an innkeeper and ran a small boatyard in Hingham. The Langlee family set up their primary residence on what is today Langlee Island. It is said that both Sarah and Ragged Island are named in reference to Langlee's daughter, Sarah, who is referred to in local history books as \"Ragged Sarah Langlee.\" Sarah Derby (Langlee) married an affluent man, who left her a significant amount of money when he died. Later called \"Madam Derby,\" Sarah Derby used that money to start the Derby School in Hingham, which opened in 1791. It remains one of the oldest co-educational schools in the country—the oldest in New England.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>John R. Brewer purchased both Sarah and Langlee Islands in 1860.

In 1861, the square rigger, <em>Maritana</em>, sailed out of Liverpool with Captain Williams in command. The ship ran into some heavy seas coming into Massachusetts Bay. When <em>Maritana</em> reached Boston, the ship ran into a southeastern gale. Captain Williams saw a brief glimpse of Boston Light before dense snow came down, obscuring visibility of the light. <em>Maritana </em>crashed into Shag Rocks, a half a mile away from Boston Light. Sailors cut the masts, and many made attempts to reach Shag Rocks, however, the strong waves made it difficult to reach the ledges. Later that night, the ship broke in two. Five sailors successfully swam to Shag Rocks and seven were able to float on top of the pilot house. By the next day, the storm had quieted and the Pilot Boat, <em>William Starkey</em>, with Captain Samuel James on board, sent a dory to shore, rescuing the survivors. Unfortunately, twenty-six sailors on <em>Maritana </em>drowned, making this one of the most tragic shipwrecks in the history of Boston Harbor. </p> <p>Having been mostly uninhabited throughout history, Shag Rocks are considered dangerous and difficult to access.

    "bodyText": "<p>Located four miles from downtown Boston, Spectacle Island is a true example of trash turned into treasure. Spectacle Island features five miles worth of trails, panoramic views of the harbor, and a rich history.</p> <p>Throughout its lifetime, Spectacle Island has served many purposes for many different people. Local Indigenous communities have honored and stewarded the island for thousands of years. Prior to European colonization of the area, Indigenous Peoples primarily used the island seasonally from spring to fall. One piece of evidence of this early presence includes shell middens, which are large mounds of discarded shell pieces along with other scraps.</p> <p>With the arrival of European settlers in the 1600s, so too came smallpox. The town of Boston opened a smallpox quarantine hospital on Spectacle Island in 1717. Ships coming into Boston known to have smallpox were required to stop at Spectacle to quarantine. The hospital operated for 20 years before it was moved to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/rainsford-island.htm\">Rainsford Island</a>.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Spectacle Island also housed two hotels for about ten years, between around 1846 and 1857. These hotels were later shut down after a police raid due to illegal gambling.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>During the early years of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/boston-an-underground-railroad-hub.htm\">Underground Railroad</a>, Spectacle Island served an integral role in the story of freedom seeker George's escape from slavery.</p> <p>In September 1846, the crew of the <em>Ottoman</em>, a ship from New Orleans, discovered a stowaway named George within <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>. Following this discovery, the captain of the <em>Ottoman</em>, James Hannum, took George under guard to Spectacle Island. Captain Hannum stopped in one of the island's hotels for a \"drop of consolation.\" While the captain grabbed his drink, George escaped from the guard, stole Hannum's small boat, and took off for South Boston. Captain Hannum immediately realized what happened and grabbed another boat to give chase. Describing the pursuit first by boat, then on foot, Hannum wrote: \"we took off after him, through corn-fields and over fences till finally after a chase of two miles I secured him just as he reached the bridge.\"<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Word of George's story spread quickly among Boston's abolitionist community and they obtained a warrant for Hannum's arrest under the charges of kidnapping. Knowing he had to act quickly, Hannum located the <em>Niagara</em>, a ship bound for New Orleans that would take George back to enslavement. As he transferred George to the <em>Niagara</em>, Hannum realized that abolitionists had acquired a boat and were quickly gaining on his ship. Describing the scene Hannum wrote, \"No sooner had I left the bark than I discovered a steamer making directly for us. Knowing she could chase but one, I steered a course opposite to the Niagra…Bayonets glistened in all parts of the boat...\"<sup>4</sup> Unfortunately, the abolitionists followed Hannum's ship instead of the <em>Niagra </em>and were not able to secure George's freedom.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/45dbafda-8842-4e2f-be48-b21516d829a4\"><img alt=\"Newspaper clipping regarding a letter from Capt.

Hannum. (Credit: The Emancipator, New York, New York, Oct. 7, 1846.)</em></p> <p>In 1857, a man named Nahum Ward purchased the island in order to build a horse-rendering plant. This plant opened shortly after the Civil War; it processed thousands of deceased horses from the city and converted hair, hides, hooves, and bones into other products.<sup><font>5</font></sup></p> <p>In the 1880s and 1890s, a fertilizer company and glue factory joined Ward's plant on Spectacle Island, with the addition of a grease-reclamation facility in 1911.<sup>6</sup> At this time, many workers lived on the island. In 1889, 30 men worked on the island and 13 families lived on the island.<sup>7</sup> By the 1920s, the community grew to more than 100 people and even included a school.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>In the 1920s, most of the existing plants and factories closed. By this time, only the grease-reclamation factory remained. This factory processed garbage, removing grease for soap before using the remaining waste as fill on the island. By the 1930s, the need for grease dwindled and so the final factory on Spectacle Island shut down.</p> <p>Bostonians still needed a place for their waste. From 1935 to 1959, Spectacle Island became the city’s dump, bringing 350 tons of waste to the island daily.<sup>9</sup> In this time, the island grew by almost 36-acres.<sup>10</sup> The dump on Spectacle Island sat exposed, with trash seeping into the harbor, until 1992 when the \"Big Dig\" began in Boston. The Central Artery/Tunnel Project brought sediment to Spectacle Island to cap off the landfill and turn the island from an abandoned garbage dump to a park.</p> <p>In 2006, after years of work and the planting of thousands of trees and shrubs, Spectacle Island opened to the public. The island now serves as a great escape from the bustling city-life of Boston with a marina, visitor center, and swimming beach.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-spec.htm\">Island Facts: Spectacle Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Emily and David Kales, <em>All About the Boston Harbor Islands</em> (Cataumet, MA: Hewitts Cove Publishing Co., Inc., 1983), 22.</li> <li>David Kales, <em>The Boston Harbor Islands: A Story of Urban Wilderness</em> (Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2007), 73.</li> <li>\"Capt.

The almost ten-acre former island has been connected to the mainland via a causeway since the 1980s, when a private developer purchased the island and renamed it Spinnaker Island. Other former names of the island include \"Hogg Island\" and \"Little Hog Island.\" This island is not to be confused with the Hog Island of East Boston.<sup>1 </sup></p> <p paraeid=\"{742b99ee-ca16-457f-9033-6caa684b13b2}{247}\" paraid=\"1072720897\">Once a favorite camping site, the federal government acquired the island in 1917 for use as a military fortification. The Coast Defense Commander recommended that four 12-inch mortars be placed on the island in 1915.<sup>2</sup> Construction of Fort Duvall, finished in 1925, though instead of the recommended 12-inch rifles, two 16-inch rifles had been installed. The military originally planned to place the larger guns in the outer harbor but decided to assign the 16-inch guns to Hog Island because of the high cost of operating the guns in the outer harbor. As a result of this change, bases for both the 12-inch and the 16-inch were installed on the island. </p> <p paraeid=\"{7259bf6c-c463-4fab-a0a1-34626b5b9f50}{20}\" paraid=\"659447502\">Throughout the 1920s, and 1930s, only a caretaker lived on the island full time. Those who staffed the battery lived at Fort Revere at nearby Hull.<sup>3</sup> After World War II, the island served as a radar and fire control center for a local NIKE missile site. The military facilities closed in the 1970s. Today, remnants of the former fort can still be seen among the 1980s condominiums.<sup>4 </sup></p> <h2 paraeid=\"{7259bf6c-c463-4fab-a0a1-34626b5b9f50}{56}\" paraid=\"1551759977\">Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li> <p paraeid=\"{7259bf6c-c463-4fab-a0a1-34626b5b9f50}{62}\" paraid=\"853471978\">Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 22. </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{7259bf6c-c463-4fab-a0a1-34626b5b9f50}{85}\" paraid=\"1026297425\">Moses Foster Sweetser,<em> King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 47; Coast Defense, \"Fort Duvall,\" accessed April 14, 2023, <a href=\"https://coastdefense.com/fort_duvall.htm\">https://coastdefense.com/fort_duvall.htm</a>.  </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{7259bf6c-c463-4fab-a0a1-34626b5b9f50}{97}\" paraid=\"657229001\">Coast Defense, \"<a href=\"https://coastdefense.com/fort_duvall.htm\">Fort Duvall</a>;\"  \"<a href=\"https://www.bostonharborbeacon.com/2015/09/07/spinnaker-island/\">Spinnaker Island, Once Called Hog Island</a>,\" Boston Harbor Beacon, last modified September 7, 2015, accessed April 14, 2023.  </p> </li> <li> <p paraeid=\"{7259bf6c-c463-4fab-a0a1-34626b5b9f50}{120}\" paraid=\"1709566454\">Edward Snow, <em>The Islands of Boston Harbor</em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 167. </p> </li> </ol>",

Most of the island is submerged at high tide, making it a dangerous journey for ships passing by. In 1857, a series of signal buoys were used to warn sailors of the rocky ledges. However, the need for a lighthouse became dire in the 1900s as a new major shipping channel lane opened.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Construction on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/graves-light.htm\">Graves Light</a> began in 1903 with Royal Luther in charge. Granite was cut from Cape Anne in Rockport for the lighthouse tower. With its location in the outer corner of the Boston Harbor, Graves Light received a first order Fresnel lens.<sup>3 </sup>On September 1, 1905, Elliott C. Hadley lit Graves Light for the first time. Graves Light was automated in 1978 and sold in a federal auction in 2013 to Dave and Lynn Waller.

Accompanied by Masconomo, the sagamore of Agawam, a white settler named David Thompson searched for a suitable trading post site here in 1619. It is possible that Masconomo shared his knowledge of the natural landscape during this time. David Thompson established his trading post on the island and traded with the Neponset Band of the Massachusett.  </p> <p>Thompson then resettled the island in 1626, after William Trevour had claimed it on his behalf. The island, which had been called \"Island of Trevour,\" became \"Thompson Island.\" Thompson operated the trading post until his death in 1627.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>In the years that followed Thompson's death, settlers drained much of the marshland to improve the pasture area. In 1775, British forces occupied the Island during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a>. In May of 1775, colonial forces took control of the island and burned all buildings and crops. For much of the next two hundred years the island served as pastureland.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>In 1833, a group of philanthropists established the Boston Farm School on the island. The school provided a home and education for \"at risk boys.\" The first students lived on the South side of the island in an old farmhouse. The students helped build what they called the \"mansion house.\" Situated at the top of the hill, the \"mansion house\" had all facilities necessary to operate a school. Two years after the school's establishment, the Boston Asylum for Indignant Boys, merged with the Boston Farm School on the island.  </p> <p>In its early years, the Boston Farm School housed about 70 young boys. The school maintained agricultural and vocational programs for students and kept all sorts of farm animals. In addition, they grew their own food and sold surplus in the summer for funding.<sup>3 </sup>In 1842, a fishing expedition went wrong. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, highlights the tragedy of the 23 boys and instructor.<sup>4</sup></p> <p> By the 1930s, the farming program began to fade away. Renamed the Thompson Academy in 1956, the school shifted its focus and became a six-year secondary school program focused on providing a more conventional education. The school significantly reduced the farm and trade aspect of the school. Renamed again in 1988, <a href=\"https://thompsonisland.org/\">The Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center</a> continued to serve young people. The center continues to do so today by working in a partnership with public schools and providing unmatchable experiences. The island is owned and maintained by the Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center.<sup>5</sup> There is limited public access to the island in the summer. </p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-thom.htm\">Island Facts: Thompson Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation (OCLP), <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 254- 256; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 53.</li> <li>OCLP, <em>Cultural Landscape Report, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 14, 86-87; OCLP, <em>Cultural Landscape Report <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a>,</em> 254-256.</li> <li>\"Our History,\" <em>Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center</em>, accessed July 2023, <a href=\"https://thompsonisland.org/about/our-history\">https://thompsonisland.org/about/our-history</a>; OCLP, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em> <em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em>, 14; OCLP, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\">Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a>, 30.</li> <li>\"Terrible Disaster at Boston,\" <em>The Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, May 2, 1842, accessed March 28, 2023.</li> <li>\"Our History,\" <em>Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center</em>, <a href=\"https://thompsonisland.org/about/our-history\">https://thompsonisland.org/about/our-histor.</a></li> </ol>",

During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a>, British forces searched for resources in the islands, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/grape-island.htm\">Grape Island</a>. From this location, townspeople of Weymouth and the local militia saw British soldiers taking hay from Grape Island on May 21, 1775. Sounding the alarm, local colonial forces initially fired upon the British before taking boats to the island and driving the British away.<sup>1</sup> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abigail-adams.htm\">Abigail Adams</a>, living in the area, recalled the event to her husband, John Adams: </p> <blockquote>You inquire of me who were at the engagement at Grape Island. I may say with truth all of Weymouth, Braintree, Hingham, who were able to bear arms, and hundreds from other towns within twenty, thirty, and forty miles of Weymouth. Both your brothers were there; your younger brother, with his company, who gained honor by their good order that day. He was one of the first to venture on board a schooner, to land upon the island.<sup>2</sup></blockquote> <p>A memorial in Webb Memorial State Park commemorates this event, reading:</p> <blockquote>Grape Island Alarm: Sunday May 21, 1775<br /> From this Site Weymouth militiamen repulsed an attempt by the British to secure supplies from Grape Island for General Howe’s Beleaguered Army in Boston</blockquote> <p>The Bradley family owned most of the peninsula during the 1800s. In 1872, they converted a portion of their land into a manufacturing plant for the Bradley Fertilizer Company.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In the mid-1950s, the US Army temporarily installed NIKE-Ajax missiles at the tip of the peninsula.<sup>4</sup> The military then transferred land ownership to the State of Massachusetts in 1977. Webb Memorial State Park opened in 1980, named after former Weymouth police captain and selectman William K. Webb.<sup>5</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-webb.htm\">Island Facts: Webb Memorial State Park - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 30, 76; Snow, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em>, 161; Richard Frothingham, <em>History of the Siege of Boston</em> (Boston: C.

Brewer purchased a 10-acre parcel of land. Brewer began construction on the land immediately, erecting a caretaker's cottage the same year. The following year, construction on the main house began. In 1859, Brewer hired a \"landscape gardener\" who cut down many of the cedar trees and replaced them with ornamental trees and flowers.   </p> <p>Brewer purchased both <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/langlee-island.htm\">Langlee</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-sara.htm\">Sarah Islands</a>, and he continued to purchase land on World's End until he owned all but two parcels of land.

In 1886, Brewer hired <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-law-olmsted.htm\">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> to subdivide the plots into a redevelopment that would be called \"World's End.\" Olmsted mapped out roads, and created 163 lots. Although Brewer followed Olmstead's plans of tree-lined roads and groves, he never subdivided the lots. Brewer died in 1893, and left the estate to his children. By 1900, the estate included a creamery, a blacksmith shop, lodging for workers, greenhouses, and windmills. </p> <p>In 1936, Brewer's youngest daughter, Fanny Brewer, died. Farming operations ceased, though employees continued to care for the land. In the 1940s the military put a searchlight on one of the drumlins.<sup>2</sup> The Trustees of Reservation purchased the peninsula in 1967 and eventually the peninsula became a part of the Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park. Today, the island is still owned and operated by the Trustees of Reservation. The peninsula is open to the public, and has 4.5 miles of tree lined paths.<sup>3</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-woen.htm\">Island Facts: World's End - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes </h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017) 275-278; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> <em>Volume 1: Historical Overview</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 29. </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 31-34,187-188; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 275-278. </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 192; The Trustees of Reservations, \"World’s End,\" Accessed April 6, 2023, <a href=\"https://thetrustees.org/place/worlds-end-hingham/\">World's End, Hingham, MA - The Trustees of Reservations</a>. </li> </ol>",

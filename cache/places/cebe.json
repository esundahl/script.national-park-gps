    "bodyText": "<p>In the days before the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/battle-of-cedar-creek.htm\">Battle of Cedar Creek</a>, the US 19th Corps dug a series of trenches and earthworks to fortify the Federal position just south of Middletown, Virginia. The trenches started at the Valley Pike and extended for about a mile north. They included several redoubts— defensive works for artillery batteries— and one redan, or V-shaped work, which was constructed in front of the main line of trenches and intended to serve as an advance warning system. </p> <h2>Confederate Surprise Attack</h2> <p>Though they expected an attack from the west or southwest, the Confederate surprise attack early in the morning of October 19, 1864 came from the southeast. The men of the 19th Corps could not hold their positions. As an officer of the 75th New York Infantry wrote,</p> <blockquote> <p>“the regiment remained behind the works until all the troops on our left had fallen back, and as the enemy were charging over the works on our left and had already passed in our rear... orders were given for the regiment to do the same… falling back along the line of entrenchments to our right, as our retreat by the rear was already cut off…”</p> </blockquote> <p>In the confusion, Federal soldiers turned around to defend themselves. A member of the 114th New York Infantry would remember that their position</p> <blockquote> <p>“was now very critical. The enemy had gained possession of the road and, now that the Eighth Corps was <em>hors de combat</em> [knocked out of action], was turning his attention to us. Bullets began to reach us, but not from the front, and we saw plainly that if we were going to use this line of breastworks, which had cost us so much hard work, we must get upon the wrong side of them…”</p> </blockquote> <p>Quickly overwhelmed, the Federals retreated toward Belle Grove Plantation. The 128th New York Infantry’s monument, at the south end of this trail, honors some of the men who defended these earthworks. </p> <h2>Preservation</h2> <p>In the 1980s a developer purchased the property where the 19th Corps trenches are, planning to build houses. The developer found that they could not dig wells for water there. They sold the property to the <a href=\"https://www.ccbf.us/\">Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation (CCBF)</a>, who saved the 19th Corps trenches from destruction. Visitors can still see these earthen monuments to the soldiers here at Cedar Creek. </p> <h2>19th Corps Trails</h2> <p>Remains of the 19th Corps' trenches, long, shallow depressions along the now-wooded bluff, still snake through the woods along Cedar Creek. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/walk-the-19th-corps-trails.htm\">Find the trenches along the 19th Corps Trails</a> from either the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/128th-new-york-monument.htm\">128th New York Monument</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-grove-plantation.htm\">Belle Grove Plantation</a>..</p>",

He explained the monument's symbolism at the 1885 dedication:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The solid block of Vermont marble, which we are assembled today to dedicate, was purposely carved and fashioned on three sides in rough to represent the savage and peculiar feature of that awful struggle. It represents the regiment as it was surrounded at one time on three sides by an excited foe, fresh from their great victory over Crook’s Corps. It represents the three color bearers who were shot down in the terrible hand to hand conflict and who died. It represents three fourths of the commissioned officers killed or wounded. Again, I may say it represents the regiment’s total loss, for almost three fourths of the number of men and officers actually engaged were killed or wounded.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The inscription reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>Cedar Creek. The 8<sup>th</sup> Vermont Vol’s. Genl. Stephen Thomas. Commanding brigade advanced across the pike the morning of Oct. 19, 1864. Engaged the enemy near and beyond this point. And before sunrise lost in killed and wounded 110 men Three color bearers were shot down. And 13 out of 16 commissioned officers. Whole number of men engaged 164 Dedicated Sept. 1885. Gift of Herbert E. Hill.</p> </blockquote> <p>The 8th Vermont Monument is along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/8th-vermont-monument.htm\">Morning Attack Trails</a>  on Valley Pike (U.S. Route 11).</p>",

The bridge crossing over Cedar Creek became a choke point for Early’s retreating forces.</p> <p>Only the 2 bridge abutments and a small section of the original Valley Pike remain at the Historic Crossing Site. The National Park Service is restoring the property. It is not yet open to visitors. </p>",

Ramseur’s advancing Alabamians, Georgians, and North Carolinians. The 8th Vermont fought on Hayes’s far right, near the monument. Kitching’s “Provisional Division” lined up on Hayes’s left, extending toward Interstate 81. Three cannons of Capt. Frank Gibbs's Battery L of the 1st Ohio Light Artillery anchored the Federal left. </p> <p>Ramseur’s division of four brigades, close to 3,000 veteran soldiers, advanced on Hayes and Kitching. As the Confederates approached, Hayes rode over to Kitching and asked the young New Yorker if his men could hold. “This is a good position,” Kitching said, “and I can hold on here if you can hold on down there.” Perhaps offended by the younger man’s response, Hayes replied, “You need not feel afraid of my line... I will guarantee that my line will stand.”</p> <p>Hayes had no sooner spoken than the Federal lines began to dissolve. Confederates outflanked Kitching to the north, and others were doing the same to Hayes’s right. Capt. Gibbs’s cannons fired, but it did no good. As he wrote later, with “my supports giving away...to the advance of the enemy, I immediately limbered up and got away just in time to save my guns.” Hayes also had a close call, as his horse was suddenly killed. Temporarily stunned by the fall, Hayes managed to “hobble” away to avoid being captured.</p> <p>Kitching rode among his men, and tried to rally them, but to no avail. Maj. Edward Jones, commander of the 6th New York Heavy Artillery, was hit, and Kitching cried out: “Stop men, you will not let Jones be made a prisoner!” Some New Yorkers turned back to help save Jones. Shortly afterwards, Kitching was hit on the foot. He refused to leave the field of battle, however, until the loss of blood caused him to almost lose consciousness. In January 1865, Kitching would die of this wound.</p> <p>Ramseur’s Confederates outflanked Hayes and Kitching, and their lines soon disintegrated. “A heavy column of the enemy could be seen marching as if to gain the pike between us and Winchester,” US Col. Hiram Devol wrote, “and the troops on our right had given way, exposing the brigade to a flank fire from that direction.” Their withdrawal across the Valley Pike, which Devol wrote “was done in some confusion,” doomed the fate of Thomas’s brigade further south.</p>",

Others under Col. J. Howard Kitching arrived in camp on October 17. While the army often woke up early and scouted for the enemy, much of their time was spent lounging in camp and reading mail from home. 1864 was a presidential election year. Abraham Lincoln was running for reelection against George McClellan, who ran on a peace platform. Hayes was also running for a seat in Congress. On October 11, these fields buzzed with activity as Ohio soldiers came to cast their votes. The Civil War was the first time that soldiers in the field could cast absentee ballots. These soldiers’ votes and their victory at Cedar Creek just a week later helped strengthen Lincoln win reelection in November.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Heater House stands in the middle of the Cedar Creek Battlefield on the east side of U.S. Route 11, just south of Middletown, in the shadow of the better-known Belle Grove Plantation. The house, originally a 1700's log structure, was added to over time until it became the white clapboard farmhouse that remains today. It was owned during the Civil War by Solomon and Caroline Heater. The war divided the Heaters and their three sons. </p> <p>The Heater House and its property are not open to the public.</p> <h2>Hoge’s “Big House”</h2> <p>The property on which the Heater House stands was part of a 40,000-acre tract owned by Jost Hite. He parceled off a 760-acre section that he sold to fellow pioneer James Hoge. Hoge then built an outside kitchen, barn, springhouse, cider mill and press, granary, and stables on the property, which was referred to as Cedar Grove Farm. When Hoge died, his will transferred the property to his son, Solomon Hoge. The will mentioned a \"big house,\" most likely the present-day Heater House.</p> <p>In 1819, Solomon Hoge sold 274 acres of Cedar Grove, including the portion containing the house, to Dr. Cornelius Baldwin, Jr., of Winchester for $15,000. Dr. Baldwin's wife, Nelly C. Hite Baldwin, was the eldest daughter of Isaac Hite, Jr., who built Belle Grove, the large limestone manor house that overshadows the Heater House and sits on part of the original 40,000-acre Joist Hite property. Nelly was born in Belle Grove. The Baldwins owned 11 slaves when the farm was in full operation.</p> <p>The Baldwins had seven children. By 1830, both parents had died, leaving orphans ranging in age from seven to 20 years old. One of Nelly's many sisters, Rebecca G. Hite, moved from Belle Grove to the Heater House to care for the children. In 1843, the property was sold to Solomon Heater and his wife with a down payment of $2,500. Over the next few years, the Heaters paid off each orphan for his or her share of the farm for a total of roughly $9,735. </p> <h2>Civil War & the Battle of Cedar Creek</h2> <p>During the Civil War, armies from both sides marched through the Shenandoah Valley almost constantly, seeking food, supplies, firewood, and anything else they needed to survive. Caroline and Solomon Heater opened their doors to countless Union troops. One citizen of Middletown recalled, \"She entertained not only the officers, but many of the privates and fed them from her own table to the very best of her ability.\"</p> <p>On the morning of October 19th, 1864, the Heater family witnessed first-hand the climax of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley. Shortly after 7 a.m., the fighting reached the Heater House. Gen. Early used the grounds around the house as a platform to roll out all his artillery to shoot at a remnant of Sheridan's army stationed on a hill above the farm. By the time the smoke cleared, any Union soldiers still alive had fled. That afternoon, after Gen. Sheridan returned to Middletown and rallied his nearly defeated troops, it was Confederate soldiers who fled past the Heater House on their way to Strasburg.</p> <p>The war left the Heater farm, like most of those in the Valley, in ruins. The government did not pay any restitution before both Solomon and Caroline died (he in 1872 and she in 1892). As the only surviving son, Charles inherited the Heater Farm. In 1901 he was finally reimbursed by the federal government in the amount of $5,480, less than half of what the family requested to cover its losses.</p> <h2>Preservation</h2> <p>The Heater House and its surrounding property are owned today by the Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation. It hopes that one day the house will be restored so it can be used for historical interpretation. In the meantime, it is a monument to all the small farm families that witnessed so much suffering and destruction in the Shenandoah Valley. </p>",

Some eventually developed an agrarian society and grew indigenous crops of squash, corn, and beans. By the early 1700s most Native Americans were gone from the Shenandoah Valley, leaving it for the European immigrants.</p> <h2>The Hites & Traveler's Hall</h2> <p>In 1737, when Isaac Hite was 16, his father Jost gave him about 900 acres (part of Jost Hite’s 40,000-acre grant) along the North Fork of the Shenandoah, at the base of the northern end of Massanutten. Known as the Long Meadow Tract, the property was named for its lovely, fertile meadows. It extended from the river toward the land where Belle Grove Plantation now stands.</p> <p>The Hites built a great log house named \"Traveler's Hall\" on the property in 1738. The building was a mile downstream from the Shenandoah River's juncture with Cedar Creek and about two miles east of the Valley's main thoroughfare, the Great Wagon Road. Because of its location near the river, it also had water access for the transportation of goods.</p> <p>A cemetery, now containing the bodies of many Hite descendants, was begun on the property in 1739 when Jost Hite's wife, Anna Maria, was buried there.<br /> Isaac Hite married Alida Eleanor Eltinge in 1745 and by all accounts lived a comfortable life on the Long Meadow Tract. The author of <em>Some Prominent Virginia Families</em>, published in 1907, recalled:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Isaac spent his entire life upon this fine estate and enjoyed the rural life of a country gentleman. His skill as a planter, his close application to the development and improvement of this celebrated homestead, resulted in comfort and elegance to the owner and his large family, and from his caste of intellect and well-disciplined life, his offspring imbibed the principles and traits of character that distinguished many of his descendants as prominent in social and public life, whose influence was left throughout Virginia and even beyond her borders.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Isaac Hite, Sr., died in 1795. He left his vast estate primarily to his son, Isaac Hite, Jr., who was an up-and-coming planter and entrepreneur in the Shenandoah Valley. He received his father's land and divided the tract into five separate lots. Belle Grove Plantation was built on one of those lots.</p> <p>After Belle Grove was completed in the early 1800's, the fertile flood plain around Traveler's Hall was used to grow wheat, apples, and corn. A road that at that time crossed the Valley Turnpike between Traveler's Hall and Belle Grove was used for the transfer of goods between the two places. Now named Long Meadow Road, it is split by Interstates 81 and 66, and no longer directly connects the two houses</p> <p>When Isaac Hite, Jr. died in 1836, he left Traveler's Hall to his daughter, Matilda M. Hite Davison. She sold the land four years later, in 1840, to Col. George W. Bowman and his brother, Isaac Bowman, great-grandsons of Jost Hite.</p> <h2>Long Meadow Farm</h2> <p>Sometime between 1840 and 1848 Traveler's Hall was destroyed. In 1848 Col. Bowman erected the brick house that stands today. It was built over the wet basement foundation of Traveler's Hall at a cost of about $1,000. The house is Greek revival style with pillars on either side of the raised front staircase to reinforce the symmetry that is that style's hallmark.</p> <p>Bowman was listed in the 1850 census as a farmer with $20,000 worth of land and 22 slaves, 10 males and 12 females. The small number of male field workers reflects the fact that wheat, the main Valley crop, was not as labor intensive as tobacco, so Valley farmers were not as dependent on slave labor as Virginians east of the Blue Ridge.</p> <p>The 1860 census lists Bowman as owning $30,000 in real estate and $35,720 in personal property. That net worth would be approximately $1.5 million today. Bowman owned 32 slaves at the time, but 21 of those were under the age of 14. The international slave trade had been abolished by then, so most of Bowman's slaves had probably been born at Long Meadow.</p> <h2>Battle of Cedar Creek</h2> <p>From Signal Knob, Confederate General John Gordon saw Long Meadow and figured the army could turn left at the house and use Long Meadow Road as a direct route to the Union left, held by the 8th Corps. The Confederates crossed the North Fork of the Shenandoah River early in the morning of October 19, 1864. Divisions under generals Stephen Ramseur and John Pegram met Gordon and his division at Long Meadow and marched quietly along the road to their attack positions. </p> <h2>Long Meadow Today</h2> <p>Col. Bowman died after the Civil War and left his property to his son, George H. Bowman, who sold it to Andrew J. Brumback in 1888. Brumback added numerous outbuildings to the farm, including a barn and utility shed (built in 1891), which are still standing. A rear kitchen wing was added to the house that same year.</p> <p>The present owners, Virginia (Ginger) and George Pasquet, moved to Long Meadow in the mid-1980s. Ginger is Brumback's granddaughter. The couple said they \"have been carefully restoring the house since 1991.\"</p>",

Lee’s advance to the Confederate “high tide” at Gettysburg, the Virginia Military Institute Cadets’ valiant charge at New Market, and U.S. General Philip H. Sheridan’s final campaign to crush Confederate ambitions for the Valley—which included \"the Burning,\" the fiery destruction of the region’s agricultural bounty.<br /> <br /> Today, the Valley’s historic towns and preserved landscapes offer a wealth of sites where you can experience the region’s dramatic Civil War story. You can also explore the spectacular natural beauty of the Valley via historic roadways, winding mountain roads, leisurely walking tours, or challenging hiking trails to spectacular overlooks.  And you can enjoy the wide variety of other experiences that the Valley has to offer: natural wonders, history and heritage sites, arts and culture, and dining and lodging in the Valley’s historic towns.<br /> <br /> In 1996, Congress designated eight counties (Augusta, Clark, Frederick, Highland, Page, Rockingham, Shenandoah, and Warren) in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia as the <a href=\"http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/\">Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District</a>. The purpose of this <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/heritageareas/index.htm\">National Heritage Area</a> is to preserve and interpret the region’s significant Civil War battlefields and related historic sites. That effort is led by the <strong>Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation</strong>, which works with partners to preserve the hallowed ground of the Valley’s Civil War battlefields, to share its Civil War story with the nation, and to encourage tourism and travel to the Valley’s Civil War sites.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District is home to the following NPS units:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cebe/index.htm\">Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historic Park</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm\">Shenandoah National Park</a></p> </li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p>On the morning of Wednesday, October 19, 1864, US Brig. Gen. William Emory, commanding the 19th Corps camped west of Valley Turnpike (now US Route 11), had planned to lead a reconnaissance-in-force across Cedar Creek. As a result, he had all of his corps up early. Suddenly heavy firing broke out to their left, across Valley Turnpike where Brig. Gen. George Crook’s 8th Corps camped. Emory later wrote: “I was in the act of saddling when I heard firing to the left in the direction of General Crook’s camp, followed by prolonged cheers, as if the enemy were making an assault…” </p> <p>Emory was hearing a surprise attack on the unsuspecting and vulnerable left flank of the US Army of the Shenandoah. Aided by pre-dawn darkness and a dense fog, the first Confederate forces struck Col. Joseph Thoburn’s division about 5:00 a.m. By 5:30, Thoburn’s troops had been routed. Shortly after, other Confederate units assaulted Crook’s other division, commanded by future U.S. president, Col. Rutherford B. Hayes. </p> <p>In order to give the rest of the US troops time to respond, Emory ordered Col. Stephen Thomas’s brigade towards the fighting. Thomas quickly formed up his men and marched them at the “double-quick” across Valley Turnpike. Leading was Thomas’s own command, the 8th Vermont, followed by the 160th New York, and the 12th Connecticut. Bringing up the rear was the 47th Pennsylvania. They probably numbered no more than 1,000 strong and reached the ravine east of the road a little before 6:00 a.m. </p> <p>The trail follows the route Thomas’s brigade took through the ravine. With the exception of the pond, the terrain appears much as it did in 1864. As his brigade moved across the Pike, Thomas ordered Lt. James Welch’s Company G, 8th Vermont, ahead as skirmishers. They spread out in a skirmish line, then pushed down this ravine and up the ridge beyond. The rest of the brigade followed. Soldiers from the 8th Corps rushed by them, trying to escape their Confederate pursuers. One Vermonter recalled that these men “did not seem excited, only stolidly, doggedly determined to go to the rear... heeding no pleas to stand.”</p> <p>Years later, Gen. Emory told Col. Thomas, “I never gave an order in my life that cost me so much pain as it did to order you across the pike that morning. I never expected to see you again.’”</p> <p>As the Vermonters rushed up the hillside, the other three regiments veered off to the right. No doubt many thought the same as Vermont Capt. S.E. Howard: “The only question was, could we check the furious tide, could we hold that line for half an hour, and thus give the Nineteenth and Sixth Corps time to form a new line?”</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The 160th New York, commanded by Capt. Henry P. Underhill, followed the 8th Vermont and formed its battle line to their right. They met the same heavy Confederate fire that had greeted their comrades to the left. With 250 men, the New Yorkers put up a stiff fight for a time but their line soon collapsed. The survivors fled to the rear. Their retreat left a gaping hole in Thomas’s line, one that the Confederates soon exploited. The regiment suffered 66 casualties that day.</p> <p>Lt. Col. Lewis’s 12th Connecticut numbered 300 men as they formed into battle line to the right of the 160th New York. The men from the Nutmeg State fired three quick volleys at the enemy. They were soon hit on the right, when the regiment on that side, the 47th Pennsylvania, gave way. One soldier wrote later, “...in the mist and underbrush and in the flurry of close fighting, there was small chance to reload and there was some hand-to-hand work.” </p> <p>At one point the regiment took fire from its left. One Connecticut soldier, thinking it was coming from his New York comrades, yelled out: “What the devil are you firing this way for?” The reply was: “Surrender, you damn Yankee!” followed by more bullets. The 160th New York had already fled the field. The regiment held, “until both regiments on our flanks were driven back and we were flanked right and left. There was nothing to do but run the gauntlet.” The 12th Connecticut suffered 172 casualties that day. </p> <p>The 47th Pennsylvania had the misfortune of being the last regiment to reach this ridge and form into line of battle. Almost immediately, they were hit by Confederate forces on their right and front. The 47th’s commander, Maj. Shindell Gobin, tried to “refuse his right,” meaning he pulled back the right of his regiment, so it faced the new onslaught in the shape of an inverted V. The regiment could not hold, and it disintegrated almost immediately. </p> <p>One Confederate later described the scene as he and his fellow soldiers pursued to the edge of the ravine: </p> <blockquote> <p>“... we found the whole force we’d been fighting down at the bottom of it to escape our fire. Poor fellows! It looked like murder to kill them huddled up there where they could not defend themselves and while we had nothing to do but load and shoot. At the first volley, the most of those who were not killed or wounded began a scramble to ascend the steep side of the ravine, catching to bushes and any object that offered help. Their knapsacks on their backs presented a conspicuous target for our rifles”</p> </blockquote> <p>Of 300 men in the 47th Pennsylvania, 174 became casualties, including 40 killed outright. The next day one member of the regiment “went out to the woods where the 47th had stood, and the dead bodies strewn thickly over the ground showed that this had been a hot place.” </p> <p>Over 500 members of Stephen Thomas’s brigade were killed, wounded or captured that day, about fifty percent of his strength. Most of those casualties occurred along this ridgeline.</p>",

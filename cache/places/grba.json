This landscape of parallel mountains rangers and the valleys between them extends from the Great Basin all the way to Texas and Mexico. When this area was uplifted around 60 million years ago, the crust began to stretch up and out, fracturing into huge blocks. As time went on, some of those blocks were thrust up to become the mountain ranges divided by the broad valleys you see around you.",

The non-profit Great Basin Heritage Area Partnership is the coordinating entity.<br /> <br /> Straddling the Nevada-Utah state line, the Great Basin NHA lies in the vast, open, quiet expanse of the continent’s basin and range physiographic province characterized by long, high-elevation desert valleys separated by steep, narrow mountain ranges. This is a place of distant horizons, starry night skies, and a surprising diversity of flora and fauna including the ancient bristlecone pine. The NHA’s 16,000 square-mile area is equal in size to the nation’s five smallest states combined; home to only 23,000 people, it is one of the least densely populated regions in the country. Great Basin National Park lies in the middle. Many visitors arrive on Highway 50, “America’s loneliest road.”<br /> <br /> Humans have inhabited the Great Basin for more than 13,000 years. The first people migrated throughout their homeland in search of food, with the seasons, and in response to long-term environmental change. Today, their descendants live on four small reservations - the Duckwater Shoshone, Ely Shoshone, Confederated Tribes of the Goshute, and the Kanosh Band of the Utah Paiute – continuing to adapt to a changing world while enriching the heritage of this region through their traditions of dance, music, and art.<br /> <br /> White settlement began in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. Pony Express riders came through briefly, followed by gold and silver miners whose luck had run out in California. Mining towns sprang up when copper was found near Ely, Nevada in 1900, and the Nevada Northern Railway was laid down to carry the ore to the smelters. Farmers, cattle ranchers, and sheepherders took up residence in the wide-open spaces. Some ranches have remained in the same family for seven or more generations, and the old sheepherders still gather to tell their stories. Ghost towns dot the landscape to recall the dozens of communities that boomed, busted, and disappeared.<br /> <br /> In 1943, in an especially bleak stretch of desert outside Delta, Utah, citizens, and residents of Japanese descent were forcibly relocated from the California coast to the internment camp known as “Topaz,” named after a nearby mountain, for the duration of World War II. A museum on the main street in Delta now tells the stories of the 11,000 internees and this dark chapter in our nation’s history.  <br /> <br /> The Great Basin NHA offers visitors and residents crowd-free opportunities for recreational adventure – hiking, hunting, fishing, four-wheeling. This isolated expanse also invites contemplation of the landscape, and its occupants, through the ages. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{23}\" paraid=\"13\">Historic Sites and Points of Interest:</h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{39}\" paraid=\"16\"><a href=\"https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/territorial-statehouse/\">Territorial Statehouse State Park</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"2\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{47}\" paraid=\"17\"><a href=\"http://www.covefort.com/\">Cove Fort</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"3\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-font=\"Calibri\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{55}\" paraid=\"18\"><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/pahvant-valley-heritage-trail\">Pahvant Valley Heritage Trail</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"4\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{63}\" paraid=\"19\"><a href=\"http://www.topazmuseum.org/\">Topaz Museum </a><a href=\"http://www.topazmuseum.org/\">and Central Utah Relocation Center National Historic Landmark</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"5\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"5\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{74}\" paraid=\"20\"><a href=\"https://greatbasinmuseum.com/\">Great Basin Museum</a></p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"6\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"6\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{82}\" paraid=\"21\"><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grba/planyourvisit/lehman-caves-tours.htm\">Lehman Caves (in Great Basin National Park)</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"7\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"7\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{90}\" paraid=\"22\"><a href=\"http://parks.nv.gov/parks/ward-charcoal-ovens\">Ward Charcoal Ovens State Historic Park</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"8\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"8\" data-font=\"Calibri, Calibri_MSFontService, sans-serif\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{98}\" paraid=\"23\"><a href=\"http://wpmuseum.org/\">White Pine Public Museum & McGill Drugstore</a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"9\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"9\" data-font=\"Calibri\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{106}\" paraid=\"24\"><a href=\"http://www.nnry.com/\">Nevada Northern Railway National Historic Landmark </a> </p> </li> </ol> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"10\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"10\" data-font=\"\" data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-listid=\"2\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{17c349a4-fc86-4fb8-a105-7532d4e59f62}{114}\" paraid=\"25\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/gbnha-storymap/gbnhastorymap/index.html\">Big Warm Spring (Duckwater, NV)</a></p> </li> </ol>",

Many of the cracks in the limestone on this hillside are miniscule passages into the cave below. As rain falls and seeps into the ground , it picks up a little carbon dioxide from the dead matter in the soil, becoming a weak acidic compound we call carbonic acid. (this same compound can be found in soda you drink!) As this acid makes its way into tiny cracks and crevices in the rock, it dissolves a bit as it goes, picking up some of the native calcite.<br /> <br /> Once it reaches the cave, however, the carbon dioxide gets released into the air, just like opening a soda can, and the water can no longer hold onto that mineral it has gathered. The calcite then gets deposited wherever the water seeps out. The resulting diverse speleothems, or cave formations, create an underground world like something from fantasy.",

    "bodyText": "Rising high above the floor of Lexington Canyon, this imposing natural arch was created by the forces of weather working slowly over a span of centuries. Lexington Arch is unusual in one important respect: it is carved from limestone. Most of the natural arches of the western United States are composed of sandstone. The fact that Lexington Arch is made of limestone leads to speculation that it was once a passage in a cave system. Flowstone, a smooth glossy deposit that forms in caves, has been found at the base of the opening lending support to this theory.<br /> <br /> The hike to the base of the Arch is over 2.7 miles (total round trip mileage is 5.4 miles). The last quarter mile climbs several short switchbacks to the arch<strong>. *Expect an additional 0.5 - 1 mile each way for walking up the washout on the road before reaching the official trailhead.</strong>",

Water is a critical element in gold mining, and in 1889 construction began on a ditch to bring water from Lehman Creek on the east side of the Snake Range to the gold mines on the west. Limited gold returns, hampered by a water flume that did not deliver enough water, led gold mining to largely stop in 1905. Remnants of the original flume can be found along the trail, with century old pieces of wood baking in the sun.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{500488a8-78a9-43d9-a956-4f72bf4e987b}{40}\" paraid=\"1244952951\">Now that you’re above 8,000 feet, the montane life zone surrounds you. This stop also shows that general life zones are not perfectly delineated and can blend in their transitions. The area surrounding the road is studded with piñon and juniper trees, along with some larger coniferous species, such as white fir, ponderosa pine, and douglas fir. Listen for melodic Cassin’s finches and the repetitive red-breasted nuthatch. </p> <p paraeid=\"{500488a8-78a9-43d9-a956-4f72bf4e987b}{54}\" paraid=\"1512354708\">Enjoy the crisper air as you rise in elevation and keep an eye out as the Montane zone becomes more evident, soaking in the magnificent views of the Snake Valley.  </p>",

The sagebrush is home to Great Basin rattlesnakes, badgers, and leopard lizards, along with Brewer’s sparrows. Before you continue up the hill, breathe deeply through your nose and appreciate how much the sagebrush contributes to the landscape & aroma of the American west.</p>",

There are multiple primitive group and single vehicle campsites along the winding road. The vegetation changes as you gain in elevation from the sage brush, Juniper and Pinyon Pine of Granite Basin, to the Aspens and Elderberry trees of Serviceberry. After winters with heavy snow fall, Snake Creek roars with life in the spring, infusing the air with the scent of the native flora. Birds return to the trees and feed on the new berries and field mice. Snake Creek is a great place to catch site of a grey fox or mule deer.        </p>",

Strawberry Creek is closed to camping as there are a lot of hazardous trees. Heavy winds often fell these trees into the road, causing temporary closures.

In recent years, we have started to see bats returning to sleep and hibernate. If you go through a tour in the summer, particuarly in the morning, you may just spy a few getting comfortable.

The area within and around Upper Lehman campground is a rich wetland fed by Lehman Creek, home to non-native brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout. The increased level of moisture, largely due to snowmelt in the spring, allows larger trees to thrive, including ponderosa pines, mountain mahogany, and white fir. Birds you may encounter include American robins, Townsend’s solitaires, and mountain chickadees. </p> <p paraeid=\"{37e124ef-4d15-4cd8-8ab2-41020f8b9263}{249}\" paraid=\"598825491\">Enjoy the babbling of Lehman Creek from the fishing dock across from campsite 7 or relax underneath the shade of the trees at the picnic areas.  </p>",

Along most of the route, the trail follows the ridge up to the Wheeler Peak Summit. The beginning of the trail is gradual and winds through an open meadow with a view of the Wheeler Peak Cirque. Eventually, the trail takes you above tree line and through a talus (look rock) slope. Watch your footing. Stacked and worn rocks will show you the way. The majority of the elevation gain will be towards the end of the trail. At times, you will get a view of Stella Lake glistening below. There is no protection along the way, so exposure level to wind and weather is high. Reserve 6-8 roundtrip to complete this hike. Bring plenty of water and gear. ",

Standing 13,063 feet tall, Wheeler Peak and the surrounding area offer the park's best example of an Alpine Life Zone. Windswept and rugged, the alpine zone serves up a harsh existence to the life it supports. Above the tree line, the only plant life to be found are grasses and low perennial herbs and wildflowers. This is the domain of bighorn sheep, rosy-finches, and the American pipit, but even these are rare sights at such altitudes. Covered in snow for large parts of the year, Wheeler Peak stands in stark contrast to the dry, salty areas where the scenic drive began.  </p>",

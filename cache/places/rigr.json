    "bodyText": "<h4><strong>Trail Information</strong></h4> Roundtrip Distance: 1.5 miles (2.4 km) <br /> Elevation change: 150 feet (45 m)<br /> Average hiking time: 1 hour<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Dogs and other pets are not allowed on any trails in the park.</em></strong><br /> <br /> The Boquillas Canyon Trail is a great way to enjoy one of the three major canyons located in Big Bend National Park. A walk along the Rio Grande leads to the entrance of a magnificent limestone gorge that splits the Sierra del Carmen Mountains. Along the way, look for ancient fossils that existed when this area was under an ocean, and pre-historic grinding holes that indigenous inhabitants used in food production.<br /> <br /> This area is also a great place for scenic photography. The colors on the Sierra del Carmen at sunset are well worth the journey. During summer months, it is best to explore the canyon in the mornings, since daytime temperatures often exceed 110 degrees. Water and good footwear are essential items here, and for any hike in the Chihuahuan Desert. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> From the parking lot, this trail climbs a small rise before descending to the Rio Grande. The trail surface is rock and dirt. Once down at river level, the trail transitions to sand and the remainder of the walk is a flat, pleasant stroll along the river. Eventually the high limestone walls and the river prevent further travel and it's time to turn around and head back to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> The paved parking lot provides parking for about 15 vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Bring plenty of water!</span></em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed, or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.",
    "audioDescription": "The trailhead for the Boquillas Canyon Trail is located near the Rio Grande. The tall escarpment directly ahead is the Sierra del Carmen. The canyon walls are about 1200 feet high and are comprised of gray limestone. The trail climbs a small hill, and near the top of the steps are a number of holes in the rock that ancient people used for grinding food. The trail proceeds down the hill and then parallels the river. The trail is composed of sand and river cobbles. Willows and other riparian plants line the river. Listen for the song of the canyon wren and other birds, as well as the lapping of water on the riverbank .",

    "bodyText": "The area around you is the Daniels farm, know as Daniels Ranch. In the early part of the 20th century, hardy homesteaders constructed not only dwellings, but an elaborate network of irrigation ditches so they could farm the Rio Grande floodplain. The crops they planted and harvested included cotton, melons, and corn. These crops were either grown for their own consumption, or sold to provide income. <br /> This adobe house is the last remaining Daniels Ranch structure. It undergoes periodic conservation treatment that allows visitors to see a great example of adobe architecture. The entire system of irrigation ditches remain visible throughout the farm complex. The ditches extend from the building eastward through the campground, and almost 1/2 mile north of the Rio Grande Village visitor center. Some of the ditches are currently used to provide water to the campground and the Black Hawk nesting area. A portion of the irrigation complex north of the campground is being removed to restore that area to conditions similar to the pre-homestead era.  ",
    "audioDescription": "Text on the Daniels Ranch sign: \"From the parking lot you are surrounded by Cottonwood trees, willows and other riverside foliage. Under these trees are some picnic tables and a restroom. There is also a one story adobe building which was part of the farm operation. The building is about 20 feet by 40 feet and has a flat roof. Just 100 yards to the west, tall cliffs follow the course of the river toward the hot springs. These cliffs are made up of ancient limestone and are about 200 feet high on both sides of the river. These cliffs comprise what is called Hot Spring Canyon, which is about three miles in length. The area around Daniels Ranch is rich with wildlife, especially birds.\"",

    "bodyText": "The Langford Hot Springs are a very popular spot for park visitors. The area was also a popular place for ancient Americans for thousands of years. The confluence of Tornillo Creek and the Rio Grande was especially inviting as important food sources are available in greater quantities than the area further from the river. The hot water emanating from the edge of the river was, and is, inviting to all who found this spot. Evidence of ancient people is found on the rocks in the form of pictographs and petroglyphs. While the meaning is lost to time, one can ponder their relevance, or simply enjoy the view. <br /> <br /> J.O Langford had heard of the springs, and since he was in ill health, decided to homestead here since hot springs were purported to heal all ills. He improved the water catchment and started to develop a commercial enterprise that attracted tourists and those seeking health benefits. Mr. Langford left for a few years during the Mexican Revolution, but returned to begin business once again. He constructed the motor court, found just down the trail, to provide overnight lodging to guests. The business attracted customers from the United States and Mexico. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Maggie Smith took over operations and continued doing business even after the creation of the park. The post office and resort closed in 1952.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<p>J.O. Langford's impressive bathhouse is long gone; today the spring is contained by the foundation remains of the bathhouse, on the north bank of the Rio Grande. Relish a primitive bathing experience while enjoying unparalleled scenery.</p> <p>Along a stretch beginning upstream of Rio Grande Village, a series of thermal springs emerge adjacent to the Rio Grande. All of the hot springs in this region are believed to be related to normal faults. These Basin and Range type faults formed between 18 and 23 million years ago. Today, groundwater circulating deep in the earth becomes heated before it returns to the surface as hot springs.</p> <p>The most famous of the thermal features along the Big Bend of the Rio Grande is the Langford Hot Springs. Located where Tornillo Creek enters the Rio Grande, some four miles upriver from Boquillas Canyon and the Mexican village of Boquillas. The natural springs at the site are known as Boquillas Hot Springs. <em>Boquillas</em> is Spanish for \"little mouths\" and refers to the many small streams or arroyos that drain this part of the Sierra del Carmen range and flow into the Rio Grande. Later, when the springs were promoted for their health benefits, the settlement and spa resort there was called Hot Springs, and a post office by that name was established at the site in July 1914. Although there are several other small hot springs in the area, these larger and more accessible springs are the best known.</p> <p>Hot spring water is considered old water, fossil water, ancient and irreplaceable. Heated by geothermal processes and emerging at 105° F., the water carries dissolved mineral salts reputed to have healing powers. The water contains calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, and lithium. The springs' flow rate in 1936 was 250,000 gallons a day, but more recent measurements show a decrease. The therapeutic value of heat has long been touted as a remedy of both body and soul.</p> <p>Be aware that some hot springs can burn you either with the scalding effects of heat or the caustic nature of the water chemistry. Use caution when bathing and limit the exposure of children to the warm waters.</p> <h2><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Visiting the Langford Hot Springs</span></h2> <p>Contact <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/contacts.htm\">Big Bend National Park</a> for more information and before visiting to get any current conditions or updated information.  </p> <h3>The Rules</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Be respectful of others; soak only, and use no soaps or oils.</p> </li> <li> <p>Swimming is not recommended; be aware that adjacent river currents and depths can be unpredictable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Please help to keep the area clean by picking up trash.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alcoholic beverages and glass containers are prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>Overnight camping in the area of the Hot Springs is prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is illegal to purchase items from vendors operating on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Directions</h3> <h4><strong>Hot Springs Road</strong></h4> <p>The two-mile gravel road descends down a rough, narrow wash to the Hot Springs Historic District and trailhead area. <em>Note: Motor homes and oversize vehicles are prohibited on the one-way sections of the Hot Springs road.</em></p> <h4><strong>Hiking to the Hot Springs</strong></h4> <p>From the trailhead, the hot spring is a 0.5 mile round trip.

A high-clearance, 4x4 vehicle is necessary to reach the trailhead.  <br /> Views are magnificent as you ascend the western slopes of Mariscal Mountain. You can see the park's expansive low desert, and the mountains stretching far off into Mexico. Mariscal Canyon itself is difficult to see until you arrive at the rim, and suddenly encounter the deep precipice. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The route crosses open desert for approximately 1.5 miles before steeply ascending to the rim. <strong>Notice: </strong>Hikers must be prepared for the challenges of this trail. Temperatures may well exceed 110°F during spring and summer. You will find NO shade and NO water along this trail. This combination of factors make this trail potentially deadly during the late spring and summer. Tell someone your plans before heading out. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.",
    "audioDescription": "The hike to the rim of Mariscal Canyon provides hikers the opportunity to peer into the most remote of the three canyons in the park. The trail climbs a mountain composed of limestone, which is thinly covered in desert vegetation including cacti, lechuguilla, and cholla. 1,300 feet below, the river is a band of green providing life-giving water in a parched land. Distant views into Mexico showcase the mountains found on the other side of the Rio Grande.",

When this overlook was created in 1959, the cottonwood trees along the river were sparse and the river was visible from the top of this hill. If you look carefully at the cliff the tunnel goes through, the old road that originally went around the hill can be seen. The old road curve was known as Dead Man's Curve, due to a shooting that occurred here in the early 20th century.",

    "bodyText": "<h4><strong>Trail Information</strong> </h4> Roundtrip Distance: 0.75 mile (1.2 km) loop<br /> Elevation Change: 200 feet (61 m)<br /> Average hiking time: 30 minutes<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Dogs and other pets are not allowed on any trails in the park.</em></strong><br /> <br /> This trail is a fantastic place for birdwatchers and photographers. The first part of the trail is a boardwalk over a small pond that showcases riparian plants and animals. The trail proceeds up and around a small ridge that has a 360-degree view of the Rio Grande, the Sierra del Carmens in Mexico, and the Chisos Mountains in the park.<br /> <br /> This trail is great for first time as well as seasoned visitors. The mornings are alive with birdsong and animal life, and the late evenings showcase the colors of a typical Big Bend sunset.  <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> This trail begins from the back end of the campground. A level path leads to a wheelchair-accessible boardwalk that crosses a wetland area. The trail then becomes dirt and gravel and climbs to the top of, and back down, a small hill with the aid of wooden logs for steps. <br /> There are two small pullouts at the back end of the campground which provide parking for about four cars.  <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail. ",
    "audioDescription": "The Rio Grande Village Nature trail begins near site 18 in the campground. Surrounding the trailhead is a dense thicket of mesquite, huisache, willows, and other riparian plants. Just 100 feet down the trail you reach the pond, which is surrounded by cane. A short bridge crosses the pond and brings you to the higher portion of the trail. As you leave the pond, there is a change to common Chihuahuan desert plants like prickly pear cactus and creosote bush. The creosote has a pungent odor which is unmistakable. As you follow the trail, a vista provides views to the south into Mexico, to the village of Ojo Caliente. The terrain on both sides of the river are very similar. When you reach the top of the trail, about 200 feet higher than the pond, a sweeping vista of the surrounding area awaits. You can see the Sierra del Carmen mountains to the east and the Chisos Mountains to the west. The trail then leads back down the hill and returns to the pond and the trailhead.",

The trail is soft sand, so walking is more difficult, but the sound of the river just ahead coaxes one to continue walking.",

Listen for bird song and the splashes of turtles entering the water. Peer into the river and search for fish. Close your eyes and feel the wind against your skin, the warmth of the sun, and notice the lack of loud noises. Many people say one of the things that impresses them the most about Big Bend is the silence. What do you hear at this location?",

Depending on the time of year, the river can vary between one to five feet deep, and have a flow between 20-500 cubic feet per second. The majority of the year it holds around two to three feet deep. As the river flows downstream through this area it butts up against a limestone cliff, which causes it to curve to the left.",

As the sun begins to descend in the west, the remaining light turns the light-colored limestone rocks of the Sierra del Carmen into beautiful shades of pink, red, and purple.

    "bodyText": "One of the most bizarre-looking plants found along this trail is the ocotillo. At first glance, ocotillo (pronounced “Oh-co-TEE-yo”) looks like a tall, spindly shrub that died - a cluster of drab, gray stalks covered in sharp half inch spines, and no obvious signs of life like leaves along the branches. This bare bones appearance is actually part of ocotillo’s desert survival strategy. Plants lose most of their water through their leaves during photosynthesis. Ocotillo and several other desert plants have adapted to desert life by moving the photosynthesis into their stems. This strategy of photosynthesis is not as efficient or as productive as in typical plants, but the plants do save a lot of water and that is the principal issue for a desert dweller. Leaves are either not produced, or only produced during wet times of the year when the water losses are affordable to the plant. <br /> The real surprise though is in the spring when seemingly “dead stalks” of ocotillo burst into bloom. Slender clusters of bright red orange, tubular flowers form at the ends of the stalks, and in areas with abundant ocotillo plants it can look like a red haze is hanging just above the plants from a distance! Ocotillo are often mistaken for cactus, but in fact they are a member of a small, unrelated family of primarily South American plants, of which it is the northernmost representative. ",
    "audioDescription": "At this point the trail is surrounded by the tall, thin stalks of the ocotillo. They easily stand five to eight feet tall and during dry times they look dead and lifeless. Their large thorns dissuade anyone from trying to touch them.",

The mortars are archeological features once used by indigenous hunter-gatherer bands of Big Bend to prepare food. Native peoples returned to these sites to grind seeds and vegetation for consumption using stone or wooden pestles. Baked sotol and lechuguilla, pinon nuts, and prickly pear fruits are among the foods once prepared in the mortars.<br /> While it is difficult to date the use of mortars with certainty, archeologists believe that certain sites in the Park were used seasonally for up to four thousand years. Though simple in appearance, the number and grouping of mortars may be able to tell us both about size and social structure of the bands using them. Two to seven mortars are typically spaced at the distance a few people preparing food could converse. Their presence near springs, water holes, and the Rio Grande underscores the importance of reliable water sources to humans in the area.",

Highlights along the River Road include remote desert scenery, exploring the ruins of the <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/bibe/learn/historyculture/mariscalmine.htm\">Mariscal Mine</a>, and access to the rugged but spectacular <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/mariscal-rim-trail.htm\">Mariscal Rim Trail </a>(6.5 miles roundtrip hike).<br /> <br /> The west side of the River Road is lesser used, and generally in a rougher condition. Unless you have full confidence in your high-clearance vehicle, consider backtracking from the Mariscal Mine and returning via the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/glenn-springs-primitive-dirt-road.htm\">Glenn Springs Road</a>. The River Road crosses numerous washes, and regularly becomes impassable after rains.<br /> <br /> Protect Big Bend. Always stay on established roadways.<br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>OFF ROAD DRIVING IS PROHIBITED</strong>.</span></p>",
    "audioDescription": "From here, the rugged River Road stretches off into the wild southern reaches of Big Bend National Park. The route travels through remote Chihuahuan Desert, and provides access to the Rio Grande at a few primitive campsites. This road requires high-clearance and 4-wheel drive to safely negotiate. Highlights include spending time in one of the most remote areas in the lower 48 states, and visiting several historic sites along the way, including the remains of the Mariscal Mine. A journey along this route typically takes most of a day.",

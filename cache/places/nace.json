    "bodyText": "<p>The sheer immensity of the two Rodman guns at Fort Foote made them objects of curiosity wehn they were first brought to the Fort. Visitors frequently came to see them. The 15-inch Rodmans weigh about 49,000 pounds, and required 300 to 400 soldiers to move them up the bluff from river to fort. The balls fired by the smooth-bore Rodmans weigh 500 to 600 pounds and took about fifty pounds of black powder, a type of gunpowder.</p> <p>It was a special occasion each time the big guns were fired. On February 27, 1864, three shots were fired from the 15-inch Rodman. Crowds of visitors beheld the occasion. Again, on April 1, 1864, a large party from Washington came to witness the workings of the big guns. The Rodman was fired at a 25-degree elevation at a range of three miles. Because the guns put off an intense concussive force, it was noted that observers would raise their toes and open their mouths to lessen the effects.<br /> The cannon closest to the river is of particular importance. Engraved on its 15-inch muzzle is 'No. 1' and the initials 'TJR'. The 'No 1' is in reference to the fact that this cannon was the first produced by Cyrus Alger and Company. The initials are of the individual who inspected the gun, in this case Brigadier General Thomas J. Rodman who also designed the weapon. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Spaced about 70 yards apart two massive cannons point out over the water. Each cannon is roughly 12 ft long and is mounted on a large metal base which raises it to about 15 ft high. The barrel of the cannon is 15 in in diameter. Both Canon and base are painted black. This rests on a half circle mounts made of stone and metal.",

    "audioDescription": "Standing at the trailhead for Accokeek Creek, a wooden boardwalk extends before you before gently curving left and being lost in the foliage. An observation deck ringed with benches overlooks the view to your right, where marsh grass grows in the creek’s delta. When the tide is out, there may be some of the turtles, snakes, and other critters who call the marsh home. To your left the, Accokeek Creek spills into the Potomac river. The park is a popular spot for birders, and on your walk you may find yourself sharing the marsh with ospreys, herons, and falcons as well as the smaller songbirds flitting in the branches. Across the river is the Virginia shore where cars zip along the George Washington Memorial Parkway – another national park site. George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate stands on the opposite shoreline.",

    "audioDescription": "(296 words)<br />The Anacostia Roller Skating Pavilion is located in the southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C., north of Anacostia Park along the east bank of the Anacostia River.<br />From the Sousa Bridge underpass at Anacostia Drive, SE, travel seven hundred fifty feet north on Anacostia Drive. Turn right and continue along Anacostia Drive about four hundred yards. Turn left into the parking lot. The Anacostia Roller Skating Pavilion sits beyond the parking lot, about one hundred feet to the northwest.<br />The pavilion is an open-air, one-story, rectangular structure, about two hundred thirty feet long and one hundred forty feet wide. <br />Round cement columns, about twenty feet apart, line each side and support the pavilion's wood roof. In each corner are one-story brown stone buildings, each about forty square feet with rounded ends. <br />The southeast building has a curved front window where a National Park Service attendant is available to provide skating equipment and park information. The northeast structure houses restrooms. Two additional brown, curved structures sit at the northwest and southwest corners of the pavilion.<br />A wide-open smooth cement roller skating surface sits underneath the pavilion roof. The open sides provide an abundance of natural light into the space, and two steps along the sides allow for seating. Metal girders above sit on the underside of the wooden beams of the roof. Brown panels line the north and south sides of the roof. On the east and west side, the roof line is open and the roof's metal girders are visible.<br />The parking lot spans over five hundred feet and a basketball court sits to the west of the pavilion. Grass fields and open space line both north and south sides along the Anacostia River and the Kenilworth Avenue Freeway runs beyond the parking lot to the west.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Tall black walkway lights with glass tops line both sides of the walkway.<br />As you approach the memorial plaza area, the statue of Abraham Lincoln and a slave kneeling at his left side are facing the away from you. The cement plaza is about 100 feet wide and lined with 10-foot tall trees and bench seating throughout on both sides.<br />The memorial statue is surrounded by a ten by ten-foot square patch of grass with low bushes. Walking around to the front side of the statue, three by three-foot stone pavers lead up to its base.<br />The twelve-foot tall bronze sculpture of Lincoln also sits atop a twelve-foot high octagonal-shaped podium. Underneath are two square base pieces, of twelve by twelve and ten by ten widths and each four inches high.<br />The memorial faces out to the west and is directed at another statue about 1oo yards over on the park, who is faces back in his direction.<br />Lincoln is standing, with his left hand outstretched over the head of a man of African descent who is kneeling at his left side. Lincoln is wearing a long coat with tie and no hat. The kneeling man has tight curly hair, no shirt, and only a loin cloth. His left hand supports his weight on the ground, and his right fist is balled up, grasping the broken manacle around his wrist. His right wrist is also chained. Lincoln looks down upon the kneeling man with a benevolent expression. The kneeling man's head is uplifted with a steely hopeful expression.<br />Lincoln's right hand holds a furled-up copy of the Emancipation Proclamation, which rests atop a podium. In bronze below the two figures at the base of the statue is the word \"Emancipation.\"<br />The podium is adorned with the bust of what appears to be George Washington on one of its octagonal sides. Another panel shows a shield with thirteen stars and stripes. Thirteen stars also ring around the base of the podium.<br />Two by three-foot sized bronze memorial plaques are just below the statue on the front and back sides of the granite pedestal.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION <br />",

Colonel Barton S. Alexander, Chief Engineer of the Defenses of Washington, placed it among the second class of fortifications for purposes of retention in 1865. He believed that it occupied a position, \"Which must be held when the city is threatened by a land attack.\"</p> <p>The work was completed in 1864 and had 12 gun emplacements. Eleven of them were empty, and a single 24-pounder siege gun mounted and set in position (en barbette) was the fort's sole armament.</p> <p>Fort Chaplin had a perimeter of about 225 yards, and was built at the altitude of approximately 180 feet. There were no buildings at the site when the army turned it over to the original land owner, Selby B. Scaggs, in the summer of 1865.</p> <p><span>Fort Chaplin is named after Col. Daniel Chaplin.

    "bodyText": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fodu/index.htm\">Fort Dupont</a> was erected as part of the Eastern Branch Line Defenses (Anacostia River). Constructiobn commenced between Ocotober and December of 1861, and \"completed\" in the spring of 1862. The fort was built to protect a critical Ridge<br /> Road (Alabama Avenue) intersection and was supported by Forts Meigs and Chaplin to the north and Fort Davis to the south.<br /> <br /> Fort DuPont was a regular hexagonal redoubt, designed for 14 guns, 12<br /> firing through embrasures. Fort Dupont had six sides, each 100 feet long, protected by a deep moat and trees felled side-by-side with branches pointing outward. It was named for Flag Officer Samuel F. Dupont, who commanded the naval victory at Port Royal, South Carolina, in November 1861.<br /> <br /> It was never a strong work and in 1862, a commission studying the Defenses of Washington noted that a deep ravine to the west of the fort should be covered by a blockhouse. At other times, traverses to cover the sally port, magazine and rifle pits to the cover approaches were recommended.</p> <p>In April 1864, Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer, advised the abandonment of Fort Dupont. The army officially abandoned the fort in 1865. The grounds reverted to its original landowner, Michael Caton. </p> <p>Although its garrison and guns never saw battle, Fort Dupont served as a lifeline of freedom. Runaway slaves found safety here before moving on to join the growing community of \"contrabands\" in Washington. The barracks and guns are gone, but the fort's earthworks can still be traced near the picnic area on Alabama Avenue.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the National Capital Planning Commission acquired the old fort and surrounding land for recreation. A golf course was constructed and as the city grew, golf gave way in 1970 to the sports complex along Ely Place that now includes tennis and basketball courts, athletic fields, a softball diamond, and an indoor ice rink.  Once where soldiers viewed farmlands, park visitors now grow fruits and vegetables in the community garden.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><span>In October 1862, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton appointed a commission to examine the efficiency of the Defenses of Washington. The commision evaluated each of the forts, and made recommendations for improvement. Toward the end of the account, one gap was noted in the defensive arrangement:</span></p> <p>\"The commission furthers their opinion that the Defense of Washington cannot be considered complete without the defense of the river against an enemy's armed vessels. Foreign intervention would bring against us always in superior naval force on the Potomac, and we are, even now, threatened with Confederate iron-clads fitted in English Ports. The Commission believe on Jones' Point near Alexandria, a battery of six guns of the heaviest caliber, say four 200-pounders and two 15-inch guns in casements, and by constructing a battery of ten guns and a covering work on the opposite shore of the Potomac, at the near Roziers Bluff. An examination had been made, revealing a most favorable and strong position on that side, easily communicated with by water. Surveys are in progress.\"</p> <p>The suggestion of the committee was accepted, and the work on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fofo/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Fort Foote</a> began at Rozier's Bluff in 1863. </p> <p>The grand earthwork was first constructed in 1863 by the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, commanded by Colonel William Seward, Jr. The site, together with Battery Rodgers in Alexandria, Virginia, was designed for river defense. Their massive 15-inch Rodman guns (Columbiads) and 200-pounder Parrott rifles possessed the firepower to penetrate enemy ironclad ships. The Federal engineers had perfected earthwork construction around Washington D.C. by this point in the war. Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer Defenses of Washington, described the two sites as \"model works.\"Fort Foote was named in honor of Rear Admiral Andrew H. Foote, who distinguished himself in the actions against the confederate forts on the Mississippi Rivers and died of wounds on June 26,1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote's guns became a tourist attraction for government officials, military officers, and well-connect civilians, who traveled on river transports from the city to the Maryland shoreline to see the 49,000 lbs Rodmans test fired. General Barnard invited President Abraham Lincoln to visit the fort in late 1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote remained an active military installation until 1874. The U.S. Army performed a number of tests and experiments with cannons, carriages, and stone magazines at the site. <br /> <br />  </p> <p><span> </span></p>",

To deter the possible advance of the enemy through the wooded hills surrounding the sites, civilian construction gangs cleared paths which could be raked from the guns of the forts.</p> <p>Contruction work for Fort Greble was started in September 1861 but was not completed until the second half of 1864. Fort Greble was never called upon to play a major role in the war, but did provide training ground for various units prior to their commitment in many cases of battle. The irregular, octagonal shape of Fort Greble was built to conform to the terrain and the areas it defended.</p> <p>When Congress ordered the closing of the defenses, Fort Greble was offered to Thomas W.

The earthwork was built to guard the approaches to Benning's Bridge, which crosses the Anacostia River.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was irregularly shaped with nine sides, and a perimeter of 354 yards. This fort was located less than mile east of Benning's Bridge and commanded the approaches to the bridge from Bladensburg via the Eastern Branch Road, and from Upper Marlboro by way of Benning Road.</p> <p>Over the next four years it underwent extensive repair and modification. The major problem with the fort was that it sat atop a rounded hill, and approaches to it were not visible from the parapet. To fix this problem 400 yards of rifle pits were constructed to cover its approaches. Structures were built that would provide a full range on which to attack oncoming troops (bastionets). These structures were projected from three angles of the exterior slope of the ditch (counterscarp) to provide reverse and covering fire for the exterior slopes. After Early's raid in 1864, the engineers laid abatis and constructed rifle trenches toward Anacostia River in order to prevent a flanking movement from that side.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was one of the later forts to be abandoned. At the end of the Civil War, Fort Mahan was named among the 11 works that occupied commanding positions and should be retained for a skeleton defense of the city. However, it was abandoned and reverted back to the Manning family. Mary Manning claimed damages in 1864, and in 1865 bought the abatis around the fort for $31 at public auction.</p> <p>Structures that were built at Fort Mahan included a guard house, at least two barracks, officers' quarters, a mess house, stables and some sheds.</p> <p><span>Fort Mahan was named after Dennis Hart Mahan. who was an American soldier and educator. In 1824, he graduated from West Point. He taught taught civil and military engineering at the Military Academy, and became an authority on military engineering. His works include: Complete Treatise on Field Fortifications (1836), Summary on the Cause of Permanent Fortifications and of the Attack and Defense of Permanent Works (1850), and An Elementary Course of Military Engineering (2 vol., 1866–67). </span></p>",

Since this area belonged to the War, Jefferson Davis. Davis agreed to allow a light to be placed with conditions that \" the light shall be placed upon the wharf and not within any of the fortifications; and the light keeper shall be subordinate to the military command of the post and public ground in all that relate to police and discipline. If the care of the light can be placed with the Ordnance Sergeant, it will prevent interference with his present charge of other public property.\" With this permission the Lighthouse Board appropriated $500 for a light. This first light was an 18.5-foot iron post, which was placed November 7,1857. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{215}\" paraid=\"1587903521\">The 1857 light pole remained until the 1870's when growth of the wharf caused obstruction to the light pole. A small 16-foot tower was built closer to the water's edge to replace to light pole.

During the years that followed the wharf and all buildings associated with the lighthouse were removed. The light/fog bell tower is all that remains of a once active light station. Sometime during the late 1970's the fog bell mechanism broke, ending the bell ringing at Fort Washington. In 2020, the United States Coast Guard, removed the triangle red marker and light to the river, ending a more than a century of active duty. The tower remains standing in its original place.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The 32-foot tower is trapezoidal with the base being 16 feet and the top 4 feet. The wooden tower is painted white and is sitting on four grey brick pillars at the corners that are about 2 feet tall. There is a four-foot chain link fence around the lighthouse. The north and south sides of the light has a “ghost” image of the triangle marker that used to be on the tower and removed in October 2020. The west side of the lighthouse has two small windows on in the middle near the right edge and the other close to the top in the center, below a ridge that is part of the top of the lighthouse. The north side of the light has a small window on the left side of the light about midway up the tower. Above the ridge is a shelf that is attached to the tower that was for the light prior to its removal. There is a stack of wood under the tower, to add support to the structure until it can be repaired.",

A visitor center is located at street level at the corner of W and 15th Streets. A parking lot to the north of the visitor center is accessible on W Street. Stairs to the right of the visitor center entrance lead up to a road that winds up to the house at the top of the hill. A red brick sidewalk lines the south side of W Street and stairs lead straight up to the house at the middle of the block. A road leads into the property from 14th Street at the intersection with W Street, passes by the front of the house at mid-level up the hill, and continues to rise as it winds around to the back of the house at the top of the hill. Two metal railings line the brick center stairs that rise from street level through a grass hill lawn on both sides to the front door of the house. The tan-painted, two-story home features a sweeping forty-foot long porch with four white round columns. The double-hung white front door is bracketed by two floor-to-ceiling windows on each side with dark gray shutters. Tall evergreen trees are set on both sides of the house and the view from atop the hill provides sweeping views of downtown Washington including the Capitol building. Immediately behind the house is a white, fifty-foot long, one-story cottage home with a red roof and porch on the west side, closest to the main house. Three windows line the east and west sides of the house. Two windows sit along the back with a half-moon window above. Red brick walkways lines both sides. On the wall left of the front door, under the porch, is a one by two-foot bronze plaque with a gold border. An engraving on the plaque reads: In Loving Memory of \"The Guardian Angel of Cedar Hill\" Gladys B. Parham 1906-1983 In recognition of her steadfast dedication to the preservation and maintenance of the Frederick Douglass Home Erected by Frederick Douglass Memorial And Historical Association 1987 Behind the house is an eighty-foot long stretch of grass lawn that leads back to a circular paved road loop with a tree in its center. The road from 14th Street winds up to this location. About thirty feet east of the circle is a small one-story stone building, twelve feet wide and nine feet deep with a chimney on its right side. The building is bracketed by trees and shrubs. To the south of the circle set on a hill in front of a grass field is a partially constructed brick wall, about twenty feet across, five-feet-tall and the depth of two bricks. A smaller wall about ten feet long and two feet tall sits at the southwest corner of the circle. END OF DESCRIPTION",

Douglass was born in February 1818 on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, the son of an enslaved mother and a white father. As a child, he worked in the fields, was moved from one family to another and was hired out to shipbuilders in Baltimore. Through these years he learned to read and write, met free blacks – learning that it was possible to be African American and be free – joined the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Baltimore, and began to engage in debates. After several failed attempts to escape to the North, he succeeded in 1838, settling in New Bedford, Massachusetts, with his new wife Anna. Within the next few years, Douglass championed the right of African Americans to fight in the Union Army and in May 1863, saw two of his sons leave with the Massachusetts 54</span><sup>th</sup><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> Regiments for South Carolina. After the Civil War, he worked unceasingly for full civil rights for African Americans.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Douglass purchased his estate, Cedar Hill, in 1877. He was appointed US Minister and Counsel General to Haiti by President Benjamin Harrison, resigned the post in 1893, and returned to Cedar Hill where he died February 20, 1895.The site has a visitor center with exhibits. Contact the park for tours of the home. </span></p>",

    "audioDescription": "(632 words) The Frederick Douglass House is located in the southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. bordered by W Street SE to the north, 15th Street to the east, and 14th Street to the west. The house sits high atop a steep hill and the property encompasses the entire block. A black iron gate set atop a cement retaining wall surrounds the area. A visitor center is located at street level at the corner of W and 15th Streets. A parking lot to the north of the visitor center is accessible on W Street. Stairs to the right of the visitor center entrance lead up to a road that winds up to the house at the top of the hill. A red brick sidewalk lines the south side of W Street and stairs lead straight up to the house at the middle of the block. A road leads into the property from 14th Street at the intersection with W Street, passes by the front of the house at mid-level up the hill, and continues to rise as it winds around to the back of the house at the top of the hill. Two metal railings line the brick center stairs that rise from street level through a grass hill lawn on both sides to the front door of the house. The tan-painted, two-story home features a sweeping forty-foot long porch with four white round columns. The double-hung white front door is bracketed by two floor-to-ceiling windows on each side with dark gray shutters. Tall evergreen trees are set on both sides of the house and the view from atop the hill provides sweeping views of downtown Washington including the Capitol building. Immediately behind the house is a white, fifty-foot long, one-story cottage home with a red roof and porch on the west side, closest to the main house. Behind the house is an eighty-foot long stretch of grass lawn that leads back to a circular paved road loop with a tree in its center. The road from 14th Street winds up to this location. In the southeast corner of the grass lawn, about thirty feet east of the circle, is a small one-story stone building, twelve feet wide and nine feet deep with a chimney on its right side. The building is bracketed by trees and shrubs. About fifty feet north of the building, along the right side of a red brick walkway that leads to it, sits a two by three-foot wayside. Written in black letters in the upper left corner the sign is titled: Frederick Douglass's Rustic Retreat Text below describes Frederick Douglass's retreat cabin: Where do you go when you do not want to be disturbed? Frederick Douglass came to this tiny stone cabin that he called the Growlery. Coined by Charles Dickens, the word \"Growlery\" literally means a place to growl. Douglass kept his Growlery simply furnished with a desk, stool, and couch. He retreated here to do some of his deep thinking, reading, and writing in seclusion. The structure in front of you is a reconstruction. It was rebuilt in 1981 on the Growlery's exact location using materials salvaged from the original building. The full background of the sign is a black and white photograph of the building, showing a small one-story stone structure with brick chimney, no windows and a wooden door. A bush the height of the building grows alongside the left corner. Text below reads: The Growlery around 1893. An orchard once stood behind it. To the south of the circle set on a hill in front of a grass field is a partially constructed brick wall, about twenty feet across, five-feet-tall and the depth of two bricks. A smaller wall about ten feet long and two feet tall sits at the southwest corner of the circle. END OF DESCRIPTION",

When a bill to give the veterans their payment early failed in Congress, many of the protesters moved on, but many also stayed, so President Hoover sent in the army - led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur - to push them out on July 28. The camp was still inhabited by about 10,000 people, who were driven off by the cavalry with tanks and tear gas while infantry set fire to the shanties. DC's hospitals were overwhelmed with the wounded. Deemed an operational success for the army, the political fallout was a disaster for President Hoover, who lost his re-election bid later that year.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "(650 words)<br />From the Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens parking lot trailhead, traveling west on the trail about 200 yards you will reach a fork in the path, with branches off to the left and right. Directly in front of you will be the \"Planting Time / Sembrar o no sembrar?\" wayside. To your left about 50 yards is the visitor center.<br />The three by four-foot tall wayside sits just off the trail on a grassy patch in front of a pons area. A large tree stands at the intersection, and trees and low bushes surround the pond area. Five-foot long railroad tie beams guard this side of the trail.<br />The sign has a brownish-green background throughout with five square color photos and two oval images. Text in the top left corner reads in English and Spanish:<br />Planting Time<br />Below is smaller text that reads in English, and Spanish, that reads:<br />To grow tropical plants in the mid-Atlantic region takes patience and know-how. For over a century gardeners have watched for cues that it's safe to plant fragile aquatic lilies outdoors. But now climate change alters when these cues appear, especially in spring and fall. Your photos can help us track nature's cues. Take photos on the nearby picture post to help us record changes here.<br />At the center-right on the sign is a large two by one-foot oval color image of a man in tan waders, short-sleeve shirt and a Panama hat standing knee-high in a pond. His is looking down and to the right at lily pads that he holds in both hands.<br />A circular image to the left shows what looks to be the same man wearing the hat, a white shirt, and gray pants bending down on his left knee at the edge of a pond and holding a round, quarter-sized white object just above of the water's surface. Below the image is text that reads in English and Spanish that reads:<br />When nature signals spring, Kenilworth's gardeners check pond water temperatures. Too low, and tropical lilies could die.<br />Four square color photos, about 3 by 3-inches each, grouped as a square. Text above the group of photos reads in English and Spanish:<br />Signs of Spring<br />The top left image is of a robin, sitting on a tree and look off to the left, showing its bright orange breast. Text above the image reads:<br />Robins arrive, cherry trees blossom.<br />Liegan los mirlos, los cerezos florecen.<br />The top right image is tree branch hanging horizontally with bright purple budding blooms on the top side of the branch. Text above reads:<br />Redbud blooms.<br />Ciclamores florecen.<br />The lower left image shows the edge of a pond, curving as it meets tall grass and another pond area beyond. Yellow lilies float throughout in the pond.

A British squadron slowly making its way up the Potomac expected resistance from the well-positioned fort. Alexandrians, fearing they were next after Washington's fall three days before, expected protection from the fort.<br /> <br /> Samuel Dyson, U.S. Army captain in command decided his 45-man garrison would be no match for the British. He ordered the fort destroyed and was later court martialed for his decision.<br /> <br /> Defenseless Alexandria negotiated surrender, and the British confiscated tobacco and other property. As the enemy withdrew down the Potomac with their prizes, angry Americans shot from shore and dispatched fire-ships with little effect.<br /> <br /> Welcome to Fort Washington's Waterside Trail<br /> <br /> Living where the land meets the water gives us everything we need: shelter in the woods, food to eat, and clean water to drink. Our climate promises a good life for the 15 million people and the more than 3,000 types of plants and animals that live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Certain soils and plant roots soak up much of the 30-40 inches of rain we receive each year. Leaves also absorb water, and forests slow a hard rain’s fall to earth. Woodlands shade the streams, and their roots hold stream banks in place. Pine trees and hardwoods layered over flowering shrubs, berry bushes, and wildflowers provide food and shelter for birds, mammals, insects, and turtles- just to name a few. In the clean, cool water nearby, fishes and shellfish feast on aquatic plants, and become food for larger fish, birds- like the Bald Eagle -and people.<br /> <br /> When rivers flood, or when rain hits land without woodlands, fast running water takes everything in its path to the bay. Pollutants from our homes, yards, cars, and work also flow into the bay. To protect the water, plants, and animals that live here, ribbons of waterside (or riparian) buffers of forests line the rivers and streams. These waterside woodlands slow the erosion of soil and absorb extra nutrients, while also providing shelter and food for wildlife. Preserving even small sections of riparian habitat helps protect our largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay. <br /> <br /> As a river meets the ocean, a dynamic world of daily and seasonal changes in saltiness and temperature becomes the home to unique plants and animals. The rhythmic tidal changes work like an engine producing food, and decomposing matter. Winter storms tear wetland plants into food for fishes and all microscopic life. These tiny aquatic plants and single-cell animals grow in abundance when nutrients churn up from the bay floor and flow off the land. In the spring, many different types of ocean fishes swim up rivers to eat and lay eggs, and then return again to the salty ocean. In the warm waters of summer, crayfish and shellfish find food, and become food. Throughout the fall, millions of migratory birds come to the Atlantic Flyway to feed on the plants, nutrients, fishes, and shellfish. Throughout the year, each part of the ecosystem depends on another in a powerful dance of life. Walking on this trail, you will see some of the plants and Animals that make their home in waterside woodlands.",

Once abandoned, many of Fort Foote’s structures began to crumble beyond repair. End of Text Below the text, is a color illustration that shows how the King’s Depression Carriage Mount works. A black Rodman Gun sits on a gray concrete foundation dug into the earth. The gun is about 15 feet long by 8 feet tall, or 5 meters long by 2 and a half meters tall. The reddish-brown dirt is cut away to show the underground supporting structure. The gun consists of a large horizontal carriage with a bottle-shaped cannon on top. The gun points to the left, toward the river. Below ground, are stacked gray counterweights to balance the gun for raising and lowering it. On the right, four soldiers stand at the base of the gun, ready to push it up and over the fort wall to fire. On the left, two soldiers stand on top of the fort wall. The fort wall is built of upright logs and topped with green grass. One soldier points towards the river. Over the color illustration, is a ghosted illustration of the Rodman Gun in firing position. To fire, the soldiers pivot the enormous gun on its mount to raise it over the fort wall. At the same time, the counterweights below drop into a deep pit. After firing, the gun’s recoil slides it back down the mount to its resting position. [End of message]",

The Rodman Gun and its steel carriage stand on a round gray concrete platform, with circular tracks on top so the gun can rotate. A soldier stands at the left end of the gun. He is turning to his left and has his left hand near his ear. His right hand loosely holds the lanyard, which was used to ignite the friction primer and fire the gun. The ground around the gun is brown. To the right of the concrete platform, is a pile of black cannonballs, ready for the next shot. In front of the cannonballs, is a wooden box of gunpowder. Dark blue sky fills the top half of the panel. At the right end of the panel, is a bronze model of half of a cannonball. Below the model, is a rectangular bronze plate that displays Cannonball in English and Braille. Under the bronze plate, is white text on a brown background: Feel the mass of a 15-inch, or 35-centimeter, cannon ball. Each ball had 2 ears, or dimples, for the shell hook to lift it.

Its bottle-shaped cannon is mounted on a black steel carriage. Behind the gun, are the fort’s brown log and earthen walls, topped with green grass. The ground around the concrete platform is brown. The sky above is blue with purple across the top. There are 14 soldiers in blue Union uniforms around the Rodman Gun. At the far left, 2 soldiers hold a beige wooden box, filled with gunpowder. A soldier stands at the left end of the steel carriage. Another soldier stands on the carriage and holds the aiming ring on top of the cannon. In front of the gun, 4 soldiers hold a shell hook to lift a cannonball. A shell hook is a wooden log with arched metal tongs that hook into the cannonball. Behind them, are 2 more soldiers working to ready another cannonball. To the right of the gun, is a neatly stacked pyramid of cannonballs, each twice the diameter of a person’s head. At the right end of the gun, is a group of soldiers. 1 lifts a bag of gunpowder to give to a second soldier. A third soldier holds the sponge, which is a long staff with sheep fleece at the end.

In metric, that is about 2 meters long by a quarter meter wide by a half meter tall. Ahead of you, is a dense forest. A color illustration fills the panel. The illustration shows a busy fort, the Potomac River with many ships, and Alexandria in the distance. On the left, is the six-sided earthen fort. The fort is longer than it is wide. To the right, is a grassy landscape with several buildings. The buildings are labeled with white text on green backgrounds. From left to right, are the hospital, horse trough, barracks, and officers’ quarters. Around the horse trough and barracks, horses pull covered wagons with supplies. A dirt road runs from the bottom left corner of the panel, up and to the right, and past the fort. It ends at a rectangular dock on the top right edge of the landscape. Across the middle of the panel, is the light blue Potomac River. The other side of the river is Virginia, which was Union occupied.

    "bodyText": "<h2>Welcome to Fort Foote.</h2> In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln toured Fort Foote to survey this cutting-edge military technology. Would you feel safe behind 1,416 feet, or 432 meters, of earthen walls? How about with 2 - 25-ton, or 23-metric ton, Rodman Guns by your side? On Fort Foote’s flat hiking trails, you can follow Lincoln’s footsteps and conduct your own inspection.<br /> <br /> “The site selected for the fortification is a very steep bluff 100 feet, or 30 meters, high, 4 miles, or 6 kilometers, from Alexandria, 8 miles, or 13 kilometers, from Washington … It was to be the only defense between Fort Washington and the District line. It proved to be one of the very largest of the cordon of forts which encircled the city.” - Alfred Seelye Roe, Union soldier and historian <h3>Image caption:</h3> The fort’s namesake is Rear Admiral Andrew Hull Foote, who died in 1863.

    "audioDescription": "2 Upright Wayside Panels and Fort Tactile: Welcome to Fort Foote and Your Adventure Continues 619 words / Panel Description: 5.5 minutes In front of you, is a two-sided panel 3 feet wide by 4 feet tall, and 3 feet off the ground, on dark brown painted aluminum posts. Attached to the panel, is a table 3 feet wide by 1 and a half feet deep, and 3 feet off the ground. This table supports a bronze model of the fort. The panel is at the edge of the parking lot. Ahead is a dirt path, that leads to the fort. The background is a red map of Washington, DC, and the surrounding area. At the top, is the text quoted in this entry's body text, in yellow and white. Under the text, is a black-and-white photograph of 9 Boy Scouts sitting or standing on a Rodman Gun, lying in the grass. Students and scouts used the site in the early 1900s. The National Park Service took over the fort in 1931, changing the fort’s mission from defense to recreation and conservation. At the right, is a large black-and-white portrait of a standing Union Rear Admiral Andrew Hull Foote. He is bearded and dressed in military uniform, with prominent epaulettes, or decorative fringe, on his shoulders. His left arm wraps around his sword hilt. He died in 1863. He is known for his heroic actions on the Mississippi River. Across the bottom of the panel, is a black-and-white photograph of the fort under construction in 1863-1864. In the center, is a large earthen mound with wooden footings. To either side of the mound, is a flattened path. On the outer sides of the path, are earthen walls and wooden structures. Most of the structures are finished with round, earthen roofs, but some are still being built. The surrounding area is devoid of trees, unlike today. Across the bottom, is a transparent yellow banner. Within the banner, on the right, is the quote by Alfred Seelye Roe in red text. The other side of the panel is filled with a blue, green, and off-white map. Virginia is at left, Maryland is at right, and the Potomac River is in between. Washington, DC is at the top. Several National Parks Service sites are located in this region along the river. On the map, they are shaded green and labeled by name. The map shows hiking trails, off-road bicycle trails, on-road bicycle routes, food services, marinas, boat ramps, and canoe or kayak launches. Across the bottom, is a color photograph of a farm. This is Oxon Hill Farm at Oxon Cove Park, which is 4 and a half miles, or 7 kilometers, north of Fort Foote. At left, are 2 brown cows lying on green grass. In the background, at right, is a red barn with a gray roof. A red hay loader sits in front of the barn. In top left corner of the photograph, is white text: Your Adventure Continues End of Text At the right end of the photograph, is the image caption in white text on a green background. On the left side, in the middle, is a color photograph of Fort Washington Park. The fort is a gray stone and concrete building on a grassy hill. It was built on the east bank of the Potomac River. Fort Washington is 6 and a half miles, or 10 kilometers, south of Fort Foote. Under the photograph, is the image caption in white text on a green background. In the top left corner of the panel, is a color photograph of Piscataway Park. A man stands among driftwood on the banks of the Potomac River. Piscataway Park is 12 miles, or 19 kilometers, south of Fort Foote. Under the photograph, is the image caption in white text on a green background. [End of message]",

Where there is no railing, and 2-inch high wood curb lines the side of the boardwalk. The boardwalk is treelined on both sides, and a shallow river runs through a marshy and brackish landscape of the left.<br />At the 300-foot mark, the boardwalk makes a 45 degree turn to the left. At this point, on your left, will be the wayside sign. A tree rises right in front of the boardwalk just beyond the wayside, its thick branches fanning out right at eye level. This corner area is shaded but as the boardwalk continues to the left, it opens up immediately as it crosses over the river.<br />As you face the wayside, a three-foot wide wood bench is directly behind you on the other side of the boardwalk.<br />The four by three-foot wayside is titled across the top right side: \"Under the Boardwalk.\" Underneath the text and spanning the entire sign is a color image background of a muddy, brown and shallow riverbed. Marshy lily pads line the river to the left, right, and forward in the image. Beyond in the distance is a lush forest tree line, and bright blue sky with puffy clouds.<br />A column of black text runs down the left third of the sign. It reads:<br />A walk along this boardwalk will take you over one of the greatest environmental restoration efforts in Washington, D.C.<br />Starting in 1900, dredging, filling and other alterations to the Anacostia river, destroyed this marsh habitat. As result, many of the plants that previously absorbed pollution and prevented erosion could not survive.<br />For years local residents urged the city and federal government to improve the quality of water in the Anacostia River. As a result, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments launched the Kenilworth Marsh Project.<br />During the 1990s, over 32 acres of tidal wetland were restored and native vegetation was reintroduced to provide habitat for native wildlife.<br />At the center bottom half of the sign is text in white letters that reads:<br />Marsh Waters<br />The waters of Kenilworth Marsh are tidal, with an average range between ties of 2-3 feet.<br />Anacostia River water from this marsh flows into the formal ponds of the aquatic gardens.<br />This boardwalk takes you over three different marsh zones (low, mid and high) that support unique wildlife habitat.<br />A four by five-inch color phot in the lower right corner shows a man in white baseball hat and dark jacket facing away with two children in fall vest jackets with hoods, as they look out over a wood boardwalk railing at a field of tall dead grass that has turned a bright, light brown. <br />Text to the left of the image reads:<br />Local students on the boardwalk look out over Kenilworth Marsh.<br />Photo: Friends of Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens<br />A two-inch tall white logo of a blooming flower stands in the lower left corner.

The trail leads past lush marshland and tall grasses on both sides for about 50 yards to a more heavily forested area where the boardwalk begins and curves slightly to the right. A picnic table sits on a plot of land about 40 feet off the trail on the left side, and a wooden bench rests left of the trail right before it turns from gravel trail to the beginning of the wooden boardwalk. <br />The top quarter of the three by four-foot tall wayside has a black background. In large white lettering it is titled: \"Boardwalk to Tidal Marsh\"<br />Text in smaller white lettering reads:<br />Along the boardwalk, you will see tidal wetlands fed by the Anacostia River, with a tidal range of two to three feet. These wetlands support people and wildlife by serving as a natural water filter, acting as a storage basin for floodwater, and providing habitat for a wide variety of plants and animals. This area also includes some of the last original tidal wetlands in the nation's capital and some of the best wildlife viewing in the park. Keep your eyes open for herons, egrets, osprey, bald eagles, and beavers.<br />The middle of the sign features a large map about 3 feet wide by two feet tall showing a series of pond areas in blue surrounded by green areas. In the center of the map it is titled in black lettering: \"Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens.\" To the north and west around the pond area are rivers and creeks, represented in blue, and strips of land shown in green. The map points to the southeastern corner of the pond area and states: \"You Are Here.\"<br />The bottom quarter of the sign shows four color photos side by side, about four by three-inches each. They are laid atop a background image of a large pink flower, about one foot tall and two feet across the width of the sign.<br />The far-left photos show a wide and shallow, muddy riverbed with water flowing through a marshy landscape. A tall tree line is visible in the distance. To the right is a photo of a white crane, facing right and standing among weeds and tall grass in a shallow pond area. Right of that is a photo of a wooden walkway bridge, moving away from the camera left to right. Tall grass rises up on both sides and a tree with vibrant red autumn leaves stands on the right side.

    "audioDescription": "(456 words)<br />Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens is located in the north eastern corner of Washington, DC by the Maryland state border, nestled near the banks of the Anacostia River and directly west of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Traveling west on Anacostia Avenue, NE from the intersection with Ponds Street NE, a driveway on the right after about 100 feet leads into the parking lot.<br />Traveling north into the parking lot, you will bend around to the right. At about 300 feet the trailhead entrance will be on your left.<br />Here, a three by four-foot tall wayside sign on the right side of a dirt and gravel trail welcomes you into the park. An inoperable cement water fountain sits on the left side of the trailhead. The trail bends slightly to the left, through a deep and grassy field of trees.<br />The top third of the wayside has a black border with large white lettering that reads:<br />Welcome to Kenilworth<br />Aquatic Gardens<br />Text below reads:<br />All year round abundant wildlife flourishes in the park, including local and migratory birds, turtles, frogs, and dragonflies. Trails lead to scenic overlooks featuring tidal wetlands and the Anacostia River. In summer, stunning water lilies and lotus, both native and exotic, bloom in ponds established by Civil War veteran Walter B. Shaw. To begin your visit, follow the trail to the visitor center.<br />The middle section of the sign shows a map of the entire park. In the center of the map is a rectangular-shaped area showing a series of blue sections meant to represent ponds. A listing in the middle is labeled \"Lotus and Water Lily Park.\" Much of the west side of the map is blue, indicating an intertwined series of creeks and small rivers. Above this blue area in large black lettering states: \"Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens.\" On the right side of the map is an arrow pointing down to a location in the park labeled \"You Are Here.\" A trail labeled \"Garden Trail\" leads from right to left towards the blue pond area in the map's center.<br />The bottom third section of the sign shows a large five by six-inch closeup image of a bright pink flower. Four, six by four-inch color photos are laid on top of the flower image. The images from left to right are of a pink flower in full bloom, a black and white photo image of a crane in flight with wings extended, a color image of about a dozen bright green water lilies floating in a pond, and a wooden bridge with railings, extending away from close on the left and traveling away to the right. The bridge carries over a tall grassy area and past a tree showing its bright red autumn leaves.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

During the Civil War, a temporary hospital, known as \"Lincoln Hospital\" was constructed on the site for wounded Union soldiers. Following the war, the army removed the hospital and Congress appropriated funds to improve the park with flowers, trees and pathways. Then as now, it remains one of the most popular city parks on Capitol Hill.</p> <p><br /> Lincoln Park is the largest of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cahi/index.htm\">Capitol Hill Parks</a> in Washington, D.C., and features monuments to two leaders: <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">President Abraham Lincoln</a> and educator and civil rights leader <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/mamc/index.htm\">Mary McLeod Bethune</a>. The square was part of Pierre L’Enfant’s original 1791 plan for the city and was intended for public use.<br /> <br /> During the Civil War, the square was used as a hospital for wounded troops, whom poet Walt Whitman visited on occasion. When Congress officially named the park Lincoln Square in 1867, it was the first site to bear the name of the assassinated president.<br /> <br /> To honor Lincoln's memory, Charlotte Scott, a formerly enslaved woman living in Virginia, used the first $5 she earned as a freedperson to start a fundraising campaign to build a statue in Lincoln Park. Donations were only accepted from formerly enslaved persons, primarily <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/afam/index.htm\">African American veterans</a>, though a white-run war relief organization called the Western Sanitary Commission coordinated the effort Ms. Scott started. </p> <p>Designed by Thomas Ball, the statue features President Lincoln in his characteristic frock coat, holding the Emancipation Proclamation before a kneeling black man. Modeled after Archer Alexander, the last person captured under the Fugitive Slave Act, the black man’s arm is extended to show his shackles have been broken.<br /> <br /> The memorial statue, known as the Emancipation Memorial, was placed in the park in 1876 and dedicated on April 14<sup>th</sup>, the 11<sup>th</sup> anniversary of President Lincoln’s death, with over 25,000 people in attendance. <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/people/frederick-douglass.htm\">Frederick Douglass</a> delivered the keynote address before <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/people/ulysses-s-grant.htm\">President Ulysses S. Grant</a>, his cabinet, and members of Congress.<br /> <br /> While Lincoln Park became a major tourist attraction through the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, the statue of Lincoln has not been met with universal acclaim. For many people, including Frederick Douglass, the monument perpetuated negative stereotypes about African Americans.<br /> <br /> In 1959, Congress authorized the National Council of Negro Women, Inc. (NCNW) to build a memorial the organization's founder and first president, Mary McLeod Bethune. Originally conceived to be dedicated in 1963, on the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, the urgency of the Civil Rights Movement sidelined the statue project. When it was unveiled in 1974 on the 99th anniversary of Bethune's birth, the Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial was the first statue of a woman and the first statue of an African American, on public park land in Washington, D.C. The Emancipation Memorial originally faced west toward the U.S. Capitol until it was rotated east in 1974 to face Bethune's Memorial.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Content used with permission from Eastern National’s <a href=\"http://generalstore.eparks.com/store/product/92424/Guidebook-to-African-American-History-in-the-National-Parks/\">Guidebook to African American History in National Parks.</a></strong></p>",

With its interesting walkways and beautiful vegetation, it's the perfect place to take the kids for a stroll to the playground, or enjoy a snack in the grass under any of many ornamental trees.<br /> <br /> Marion Park was first established as open ground, dating back to the original plans for the city created by Pierre L'Enfant in 1791. Also included in updated plans from Andrew Ellicott, this reservation has served continuously as a park since its first improvements in 1885. One of the larger parks in the Capitol Hill area, dating back to 1764 the tract of land was known as Houp's Addition, was originally owned by Jonathan Slater. In 1791, Mr. Slater sold the tract to William Prout, who then had to turn over the land to the federal government soon after. Improvements that were made by 1886 gave the park an ornamental elegance in the vastly developing neighborhood. In the center of the park used to stand a large vase that was filled with tropical flowers every summer. The \"Large Hilton Iron Vase\" was used to direct the flow of traffic through the park due to the carriage paths that created beautiful patterns from a bird's eye view. In 1963, the vase was removed, and the traffic patterns were redirected outside of the boundaries of Marion Park. Today, the site provides hours of serenity with the variety of trees and other vegetation. There is a play area available in one quadrant of the park that is easily accessible for toddlers.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "(205 words) The Mary McLeod Bethune Council House NHS is located in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest, Washington, DC. Traveling south on Vermont Avenue from Logan Circle, travel about four hundred fifteen feet and the location will be on your right. The site is a three-story red brick Victorian row house with off-white trim. A two-foot-tall iron gate lines the front of the property and three steps lead up to a checkerboard walk of about eight feet. On the left is a black iron post from which a one by two-foot brown sign reads in white lettering: Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site. Left of the walkway is a fifteen-foot square lawn with a black urn-shaped planter with flowers. A five-step gray wooden staircase with rounded railings at the bottom runs up to a double-sided glass front door. To the left are three windows of a first-floor alcove. Three windows line the front second floor, and three gabled windows sit atop the third floor. The neighbor's ten-foot tall bush hangs slightly over the front steps on the right side. Along the left side of the red brick façade from the front door are two bronze plaques describing some of Bethune's significant contributions to American history. END OF DESCRIPTION",

    "audioDescription": "(526 words) Located one mile east of the U.S. Capitol in Lincoln Park, at Massachusetts Avenue and North Carolina Avenue NE is the Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial. The memorial is closest to 13th Street NE at the eastern end of the park. Lincoln Park has a rectangular shape and is bounded by 11th Street NE to the west and 13th Street NE to the east. North and south of the park are the respective westbound and eastbound lanes of East Capitol Street, NE. All sides have walkway access into the park with traffic lights, as well as at the park's four corners. There is also street access at 12th Street SE on the south side and 12th Street NE on the northern side. The memorial sits in an open approximately 100-yard wide cement plaza area. 30-foot tall shade trees surround the plaza in a three-foot elevated grassy area on both sides. The plaza is lined with benches and flower-designed cement planters throughout. Behind the memorial at both end corners of the park are playgrounds guarded by black metal fences. The bronze sculpture depicts Bethune as an older African-American woman standing next to two black children, a girl and a boy. They are both reaching out for a furled piece of paper she is holding in her left hand. In Bethune's right hand she supports herself with a cane. The figure of Bethune is seventeen feet tall. The girl stands at about four feet and the boy five feet tall. All three figures are sculpted in a very rough and acned style, as if formed from globs and chunks of clay. The memorial faces west, and Bethune appears to be looking directly at the Abraham Lincoln statute of the Emancipation Memorial, who faces back at her from about 200 yards east in the park. An 85- yard wide and 200-foot long grass field sits in between the two memorials. Just beyond the field from the Bethune Memorial are four cement steps which span the entire plaza and lead up to the Emancipation Memorial. The sculpture sits atop a hexagonal white concrete base of about one foot in height. Beneath that, a circular concrete base of about one foot supports the entire structure. Raised bronze lettering on the stucco face of the hexagonal base of the statue reads: \"Mary McLeod Bethune 1875-1955 Let her works praise her. Just beneath this, also on the concrete base, is a bronze plaque with a raised border replicating wheat of about 18 inches by 10 inches. The sides of the hexagonal concrete memorial base all feature bronze signs along the top edge of about 4 inches high by five feet across in length. Raised text on them reads: I Leave You Love * I Leave You Hope * I Leave You the Challenge of Developing Confidence in One Another * I Leave You a Thirst for Education * I Leave You A Respect for the Use of Power * I Leave You also a Desire to Live Harmoniously with Your Fellow Man * I Leave You Faith * I Leave You Racial Dignity * I Leave You Finally a Responsibility to Our Young People * Mary McLeod Bethune * END OF DESCRIPTION",

    "audioDescription": "Mockley Point juts out into the Potomac to form the mouth of Piscataway Creek. The shore is lined with medium sized broken rocks that protect against the erosion of the Point’s sandy beaches, which are visible at low tide. There are often small rocks and driftwood dotting the beaches. A thin line of trees grows between the beaches along the Potomac and the marshes further inland. Fort Washington is situated across the mouth of Piscataway Creek and may be visible, depending on the day and season. Just over six miles to the north is the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. Across the Potomac is the George Washington Memorial Parkway nestled along the wooded shoreline of Virginia.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Believed to have been originally built in the last quarter of the 18th century, the Laurel Branch house was a simple one-story two-room dwelling of modest dimensions and appearance. Deeper than wide, room behind room, and exterior chimneys at one end the house was typical of an architectural style popular in lower Southern Maryland from the second half of the 18th century well into the first half of the 19th century. Homes of this style and construction were often owned by tradespeople or small landowners of modest means. As typical as this house is it is also in many ways atypical.</p> <p><br /> What makes this home more interesting is the way it was constructed. Much of it is far less “sophisticated” than one might think. Its sills and joists were laid without any support and riven clapboard of less than ideal dimensions were used in the construction of the roof and attic partitions. There is evidence that the ceiling rafters and joists were made from improperly dried wood and warped shortly after construction. No doubt other homes were built using these shortcuts, and no wonder only one, Laurel Branch, survived.<br /> If there is one aspect of the house that is the most interesting and helps us date it more precisely it is the two small, cater-cornered fireplaces. Laurel Branch is the only example of this room behind room plan with such fireplaces recorded in Charles County or as far as is known, in all of Southern Maryland. This design of corner fireplaces was common in the area between 1740 and 1770 and given all the other data the house is generally agreed to have been built circa 1770.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The tobacco barn which now stands at the National Colonial Farm is arguably one of the most significant known remaining pieces of agriculturally related 18th-century architecture in eastern North America. This tobacco barn was originally the property of William Hall of southern Anne Arundel County. He had two such barns, and they were the largest and most important structures on his property. Built well, these barns survived all manner of weather, but one of the barns, at last, was endangered by development plans. Efforts by the National Park Service and the Accokeek Foundation secured the relocation of this tobacco barn to the National Colonial Farm. The barn features fascinating construction techniques and was carefully reconstructed to preserve early agricultural messages. The original designers had made use of pieces from earlier barns. The basic construction technique is known as “Tidewater framing” and consists of plates, rafters and corner braces connected by pinned mortise and tenon joints. Hand adzed oak, walnut and chestnut timbers predominate. The roof is steeply pitched at about 54 degrees, and the eves rest on a false plate (where the soffit would normally fit) allowing for increased ventilation.</p> <p> </p> <p>The frame was covered with clapboard siding in approximately 4-foot lengths. The open spaces, where clapboards have been left off, serve to increase ventilation as well.  All siding and roofing were secured with completely hand-forged nails made in the 18th century. The tobacco barn is capable of housing 12,000-18,000 lbs of tobacco. At a time when most people have lost connection to land and agricultural roots, visitors are invited to enter the tobacco house, stand under the curing leaf and weathered beams and experience the rhythms of our agricultural past that continue to inform the present day.  </p>",

The floating dock and kayak launch are attached to the pier by a 4-foot by 28-foot L-shaped gangplank, which is designed to have a maximum 8.33% slope (at low tide). The floating dock is approximately two feet above the surface of the water. The water depth near the fishing pier varies between 8 feet at high tide and 6 feet at low tide.

    "bodyText": "The farmhouse, known as Mount Welby, is the oldest building on the farm, dating to around 1811. <br /> <br /> During the War of 1812, Mary DeButts and her husband Samuel lived at the home. The war was especially hard for the DeButts; unable to access English banks and markets, the British sympathizers (Samuel was from Ireland, Mary from England) struggled to keep their farm. When the British navigated up the Potomac in late summer of 1814, they sailed past Mount Welby; the DeButts later found three Congreve rockets near their home.  <br /> <br /> Today, it is used as the Park's Administrative offices.  <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The building is a two-story, brick house painted white with a shed roof, it slopes toward the north. There are porches on the north and south sides of the house, both porches are the full length of the walls. The south side porch is supported off the ground several feet, a white lattice covers the opening under the porch. A five step stair leads to the porch landing. There are six posts that support the roof of the porch, a white wood railing with vertical pickets surround the porch. The left side of the porch has remains of what used to be an accessible ramp. The wooden entrance door is in the center and above the door is a glass rectangular window. There are two floor to ceiling windows with black shutters in the open position, one of each side of the door. The north side of the building is the same style, full length porch, the height is closer to four or five feet above the ground. The trim on the windows and porches green in color.

To the south, a small bridge crosses the cove and the MGM skyscraper of National Harbor peeks out from the tree line. At the beginning of the trail, there is a small clearing with a picnic table. The trail follows the cove and a connecting stream a quarter of a mile before crossing a small bridge to a meadow. The trail is not a loop. You will need to return the same way you came.",

    "bodyText": "Suitland parkway, now part of National Capital Parks-East, extends 9.18 miles from the end of the South Capitol Street bridge in the District of Columbia to Route 4 in Maryland. Authorized by President Roosevelt as a national defense road during World War II, this new highway would allow direct access from Boiling Field in Washington, D.C. to Camp Springs Army Air Base in Maryland. Officially opened on December 9, 1944 the parkway design and construction combined the efforts of the Public Roads Administration, District of Columbia Engineer, National Park Service, National Capitol Park and Planning Commission, and the Maryland National Capitol and Park Planning Commission.1 Boiling Field and Camp Springs Army Air Base were renamed Boiling Air Force Base and Andrews Air Force Base respectively in 1945.<br /> <br /> Legislation, introduced in 1949, called for the permanent transfer of the parkway and \"all (its) lands and easements heretofore or hereafter acquired by the United States\" to the National Park Service. H.R. 2214 passed Congress on August 17, 1949. The law stated that the Suitland Parkway be \"developed, operated, and administered as a limited access road primarily to provide a dignified, protected, safe, and suitable approach for passenger-vehicle traffic to the National Capital and for an uninterrupted means of access between several Federal establishments adjacent thereto and the seat of government in the District of Columbia. \" <br /> <br /> All information from the HISTORIC AMERICAN ENGINEERING RECORD for Suitland Parkway. ",

It is now just a reminder of the Cherokee Removal known as the Trail of Tears. Founded in 1798 by James and Sarah Lusk, the ferry rights on the Kentucky side were purchased some years later by John Berry who owned a thousand acres of land along the Ohio River above and below the ferry site.<br /> <br /> His large home was built of slave-made bricks and served travelers with accommodations when needed. In 1831, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky enacted a law that established a voting precinct “which shall be held at the house of John Berry, at the Ferry,” to serve the citizens of Livingston County. Berry died in December of 1839 and the ferry operations continued under various owners until 1942.<br /> <br /> Historical Significance: At Berry's Ferry, thousands of Cherokee boarded flatboats to cross the Ohio River during the 1838-39 migrations. This is also the site where, in late December 1838, moving ice forced the ferry to shut down. As a result, hundreds if not thousands of Cherokee were forced to wait - sometimes for weeks - in scattered encampments southeast of the ferry crossing. Adjacent to the ferry site (of which no tangible evidence remains) are scattered remnants that mark the homesite of John Berry, the ferry operator during the late 1830s.\"</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Upper River Rd, Livingston, KY 42081 (end of road))</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.cherokee.org/about-the-nation/remember-the-removal/sites-on-the-trail/berry-s-ferry-and-berry-homesite/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Big Springs, a natural spring that emerges from the limestone, served as a water source and stopping point for the weary travelers. <br /> <br /> Today, people visit Big Springs for the day trips or weekend getaways. The serene and peaceful environment, combined with the natural setting, provides an enjoyable escape from the city. It is a picturesque destination where visitors can connect with nature, learn about local history, and recreate. The site around Big Springs features picnic spots, walking paths, and seating areas where people can relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Please note that the cave is not accessible, and visitors are caution not to drink from the spring. <br /> <br /> Adjacent to the Big Springs site is a Trail of Tears Commemorative Park, featuring a large, engraved granite stone monument that reads \"A Mother's Burden\" both in English and in Cherokee. The stones for the monument were sourced from a quarry location along the original trail route, and dedicated to the park. In between the stones sets a garden shaped like a tear drop to depict removal.<br /> <br /> The nearby city of Princeton offers various amenities such as restaurants, accommodations, and shops.

Half of those who made it to Indian Territory died within the following year from the strain of the journey or complications from cholera, as did Lt. Harris.

    "audioDescription": "As you approach the blockhouse you begin to feel as if you are stepping back in time. Well before the boats carrying Cherokee, Muscogee(Creek), Choctaw, Chickasaw and Seminole up river to Indain-Territory (present day Oklahoma) the blockhouse was gone. The hill is densely wooded as it likely would have been in the 1830s. The sounds of the forested river bank are coming to your senses, the leaves and branches swaying in the breeze, birds singing and flying from tree to tree, insects buzzing as if they are the orchestra playing harmony in the background. As you walk closer to look at the river the leaves a crunching under your shoes and a startled squirrel scurries away and up a tree. Looking out at the river the smooth wide gentle flow is far from what they would have experienced it was a treacherous with many obstacles and delays to overcome. You take a moment to consider the more than 80 Cherokee mostly children that were buried here in 1834 after being stranded due to low water they were struck with a cholera epidemic. Lots of the graves were unmarked, undoubtedly their are still more graves undiscovered, as you explore this park please remember the Cherokee who passed this way and the ones who are still here.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The <strong>Vann Cherokee Cabin </strong>was built by a Cherokee, David Vann, and is now surrounded by the town of <strong>Cave Spring</strong>. This site represents the first removal phase - where the military actively rounded up Cherokee and sent them to forts and camps to be organized for the journey west to Indian Territory (today's Oklahoma). These holding camps had deplorable conditions and for the Cherokee, who were already demoralized, the conditions caused some deaths before the final journey even began.<br /> <br /> At first, Cherokee actively, physically resisted removal by staying in their home. They were removed by force. In the camps, they suffered from exposure, disease epidemics, inadequate sanitation, and heartbreak, remaining prisoners in the camps until their final deportation to the West.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(24 Broad St, Cave Spring, GA 30124)</p> <p>Cave Spring is located in Floyd County, Georgia, within a few miles state of Alabama, 75 miles from Atlanta, and 16 miles from Rome. It is a small town and has a flowing spring that comes out of a cave, as it has for millennia. The area is lush and the stable water source made the land verdant and valuable for growing crops. Ironically, water sources were important during Indian Removal when large groups of people being forcibly moved to camps. In the center of town there is a park that gives access to the spring which now flows into a pond and swimming pool filled by the spring.<br /> <br /> The historic building allows visitors to imagine the scene as Cherokee passed during removal. Built by Avery Vann, Jr., (1770-1845), a Scottish trader who married a Cherokee woman. He was the brother of <a href=\"https://vanishingnorthgeorgia.com/2019/02/19/chief-james-vann-house-1804-spring-place/\">Cherokee Chief James Vann</a> and his prominence in the area led to its designation as Vann’s Valley. For many years, the structure was hidden within the walls of the old Webster-Green Hotel in downtown Cave Spring. <br /> <br /> The cabin, spring, and park offer a place to reflect on the Trail of Tears.</p> <p><br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.cavespringhistoricalsociety.com/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2 paraeid=\"{8177a853-4631-4df2-a677-434643a34cfb}{195}\" paraid=\"322852933\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/cave-springs-exhibits-audio-description.htm\">Exhibit Audio Description available</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "audioDescription": "The Charles Hall Museum and Heritage Center is housed in two buildings. The grounds are flanked with the Tellico mountains in the background, a community flower garden, walking trail and large fields in the back. The half mile community walking trail winds through these fields that were once the ancestral lands of the Cherokee. The only smells are fresh mountain air. Outside as you enter building one you can hear the sound of the traffic including motorcycles. Building two sits behind and to the side of building one and sounds are muffled of any traffic. At times you can hear farm tractors working the fields and laughter along the waling trail. Building one is stone and cement siding that is painted taupe. There is a wrap around porch with iron railing. This building sits near the beginning of the Cherohala Skyway, a national scenic byway. There are two entrances to Building one. Both entrances are off the porch. When you walk on to the porch from the museum entrance you will enter a gift shop. This gift shop is filled with souvenirs of our area, women’s boutique items, and home décor. There is another entrance on the other side of the museum that faces the Cherohala Skyway Visitor’s Center and our shared courtyard big a flag pole. The Tennessee flag and American flag hang from the pole. There are large glass doors that open into the Museum section of the building from the gift shop. As you enter the museum there are 4 displays cabinets of native American and Cherokee artifacts, along with intrepretative panels and maps about the Cherokee who lived in our area. There are many other artifacts that focus on local, Appalachian and American history including military displays with weapons displayed used in all the wars. There are picture tables of historical early pictures of the area. You enter Building 2 from a front porch. The floor is beige ceramic tile, and most of the walls are glass or sheetrock. The display cabinets are glass or plexiglass. The smells are neutral and occasionally you can smell the wood in the old telephones or logging tools. One side is glass or glass doors that open onto the porch. This gives lots of light to the area. You go through the gift shop to the museum. The entrance to the museum is to the side and back. This gift shop has spaces laid out for the local crafters and artisans. There are lots of unique handmade and crafted items, along with vintage items and one boutique area. You can smell the sweet smells or handmade candles, soaps, and lotions as you enter the store. When you enter the museum area of building 2, there is a 1922 Model T telephone truck and a 1934 Plymouth. There are many other telephone related items in the “Telephone Museum” part of the museum. There are over 300 telephones with lots of the hand cranked phones and candlestick phones. There are 13 switchboards and a switching station where you can use a dial telephone and call one another on either end of the switching station. There are many Appalachian relics. Among the many items are wood stoves, moonshine stills, washing machines, looms and Forest Service and logging Relics.",

    "bodyText": "<p>In 1819, Cherokee leaders began holding council meetings at a place called New Town, near current Calhoun, Georgia. Six years later, in 1825, New Town was renamed New Echota, and became the capital of the Cherokee Nation. The Nation had, by this time, developed a police force and a judicial system.<br /> <br /> In 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a constitution establishing executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government as well as a system of checks and balances. After gold was discovered on Cherokee land claimed by the state of Georgia, the Treaty of New Echota was passed by the US Senate in May of 1836 (despite arguments that the Cherokee who negotiated it did not have the authority of the Nation). From 1838 to 1839, over 16,000 Cherokee were removed from their lands by Federal troops and state militia, and forcibly marched over 800 miles west to Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma. This is called the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Trail of Tears</a> (Nvna Daula Tsvyi: The Trail Where They Cried; and Tlo-va-sa: The Removal in Cherokee).<br /> <br /> Talequah in what is now Oklahoma was established as the nineteenth century capital of the Cherokee Nation in 1839.<br /> <br /> In alignment with the Cherokee constitution that declared the necessity of schools and education, Principal Chief John Ross proposed in 1846 that the Nation establish two seminaries (or schools): one for boys, and one for girls. The National Council agreed, and both schools opened simultaneously on May 7, 1851.<br /> <br /> The Cherokee Female Seminary was originally built three miles south of Tahlequah. It burned down in 1887, and was replaced by the current Female Seminary building that was dedicated in 1889. The Seminary was the largest building ever erected by an Indian tribe. Despite this, when it opened for classes in August of 1890, the school had to turn away many prospective students for lack of space. Now Seminary Hall, the massive, three-story brick affair is roughly L-shaped. Over all it has 127 usable rooms with some 50,500 gross square feet. Two turreted towers flank the main entrance.<br /> <br /> In 1907, Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory became the State of Oklahoma. Two years later, the Cherokee Female Seminary was purchased by the state and opened as Northeastern State Normal School with an enrollment of 511 students. In 1919, the school became Northeastern State Teachers College, a four year institution. In 1939, with an expanded curriculum, it became Northeastern State College. In 1974, graduate-degree programs were added, and the school became Northeastern Oklahoma State University.

    "audioDescription": "Standing in the park you are looking across the river you can see the lock and dam and the hydro power plant with the Ouachita Mountains rising up behind them. The developed areas of the park are dotted with manicured native hardwood trees Oaks, Southern Pecan, Cottonwood and Sycamore give shade to the campers and families picnicking here today. Just to the north of the park you passed through densely forested area of more hardwood trees that are home to many species of native animals in the area deer, squirrels, birds, raccoons and opossum just to name a few that can be seen and heard in the park as you reflect on how it must have looked so long ago. It is obvious that it has changed so much since those weary travelers were here in the 1830. Now there is a lock and dam that helps to maintain the river in its current state to make navigation possible for transporting goods and to provide recreation opportunities that wouldn't be possible otherwise. You most likely hear the sounds of the water rushing through the spillway of the power plant and the hum of the turbine generators at it provides electricity to families across the state.",

Alongside the road is a long berm, a narrow hill or ledge along the edge of the road created when during the building process. Erosion from weather and use has made the berm very high in some places and can be easily seen today. <br /> <br /> The Cross Hollow site is a landmark on the old Springfield, Missouri to Fayetteville, Arkansas Road created in the 1830’s. This road is now known as the Old Wire Road due to it being the route for the first telegraph wire in the region.  The Cross Hollow area was well known to early travelers and is noted in some journal entries as X Hollow.  All of the Cherokee detachments that did not turn to the west in the vicinity of Little Sugar Creek in Benton County would have traveled the old road through Cross Hollow.  <br /> <br /> The Taylor Detachment came through Cross Hollow March 20, 1839.  William Isaac Irvins Morrow, a physician traveling with the Taylor detachment, mentions in his journal: “March 20, 1839 Wednesday 20th Cloudy & cool – traveled 15 miles to the X Hollows, eat dinner at Homeslys & came on 5 miles to Fitzgerald’s...”  An earlier treaty party detachment, a group of Cherokee who moved west in 1837 before the forced removal of the Cherokee Nation in 1838-1839, led by B.B Cannon came through the area in December of 1837 camped here at Cross Hollow.<br /> <br /> Cross Hollow is a special site on the Old Wire Road. It connects the fairly well-preserved historic road that served the Trail of Tears detachments, and later the Butterfield Overland Mail, and then major Civil War troop movements.<br />  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Cross Hollow is located at the intersection of the Old Wire Road and Cross Hollow Road just north of the town of Lowell, Arkansas.)<br /> <br /> <strong>Amenities</strong><br /> There are no amenities at this site.

    "bodyText": "<p>In the early 1830s, the John and Mary Fitzgerald family settled on land located alongside the Military Road (also called Old Missouri Road), which ran from Springfield, Missouri to Fort Smith, Arkansas. The Fitzgerald’s took advantage of their location by establishing an inn and tavern on their farm. By the late 1830s it was a well-known stop for travelers. It became a supply source for many of the Trail of Tears Cherokee removal detachments in the late 1830s.<br /> <br /> All of the detachments that did not turn west in Benton County north of here would have passed by the Fitzgerald Farmstead. One of the detachments was mentioned by William Isaac Irvins Morrow, a physician traveling with the Taylor detachment, who noted the Fitzgerald farm in his journal:</p> <blockquote> <p>March 20, 1839. Wednesday 20th Cloudy & cool – traveled 15 miles to the X Hollows, eat dinner at Homeslys & came on 5 miles to Fitzgeralds in company with Cox Fields Hemger & George D. Morrow. A mean house.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Some Cherokee moved west before the forced removal in 1838-1839 that became known of the Trail of Tears. B.B Cannon, a disbursing agent who accompanied an earlier group kept a journal recording that they used much of the same route, passing by Fitzgerald Station, and receipts show numerous purchases from John Fitzgerald in December of 1837.<br /> <br /> Most Cherokee detachments next took a road to the southwest from Fitzgerald’s and travelled through the small settlement of Shiloh on their way to their destination in Indian Territory. Some of the detachment leaders travelled south into Fayetteville as well.<br /> <br /> John and Mary Fitzgerald played an important role as they were witness to Cherokee removal and sold needed provisions to the weary and often sick Cherokee. John and Mary are buried in the Fitzgerald Cemetery near the route of the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail just to the south of their farmstead on Old Wire Road through the intersection of Hwy 265 where it becomes E Randall Wobbe Lane.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2>   <p><strong>Location</strong> (The old Fitzgerald Farmstead is located on the Old Wire Road in north Springdale.

The cabin site is part of local property seized by the military for Fort Payne, one of over 20 removal forts (stockades) established in Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. Research indicates the cabin belonged to Cherokee John Huss (Spirit the Preacher) and was built circa 1825. Historical documents show that Cantonment Payne existed as early as fall 1837, became Fort Payne by December 1837, and was a major emigrating depot by the fall of 1838. The majority of Cherokee who were forced by the military to leave their homes in Alabama left from Fort Payne. A detachment led by Cherokee John Benge departed for Indian Territory in October of 1838, and the fort was closed soon after. Although the fort was used for only about a year, the cabin continued in use until the mid-1940s. Today a chimney, the cabin foundation, and a nearby stacked stone well remain.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(106 4th Street SE (just east of Gault Avenue S), Fort Payne, Alabama)<br /> <b>Access</b><br /> Landmarks of DeKalb County; open to the public by appointment</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.landmarksdekalbal.org/preserving-dekalb-county-alabama-landmarks/the-old-cabin-site/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Thirteen detachments of approximately 1,000 Cherokees each left Tennessee in the fall of 1838. The groups were staggered across the trail to ensure an adequate supply of wood, spring water, food, and forage for all. They crossed into Illinois in October and December 1838 where an unforgiving bitter winter met them. The 60-mile trek across southern Illinois, normally a nine-day hike, took several months.  <br /> <br /> Arriving at Hamburg Hill, they followed a steep-sided, thickly wooded hollow four miles to the Mississippi River. At the river’s edge, tremendous blocks and walls of ice reared and crashed, preventing eight of the Cherokee detachments from any attempt to cross.  <br /> <br /> Trapped in freezing temperatures, they made makeshift tent structures with board floors to escape the cold, muddy ground. Some waited over a month before they could span the river into Missouri---one more nightmare endured during the brutal removal of the Cherokee people. <br /> <br /> Today, visitors can retrace a one-mile segment of the same roadbed traveled by the detachments, on an out-and-back trail. The trailhead features a gravel parking area, informational wayside exhibits, and a vault toilet. Reaching the trailhead requires travel on gravel roads. The trail continues on past the end of the one-mile retracement segment, offering a total of 20 miles of out and back trail.

    "bodyText": "<p>\"Discover a compelling story of human spirit and tragic sacrifice. The banks of the Hiwassee River were witness to nationally significant history involving the Trail of Tears and the Civil War. Present-day Charleston was once the site of the federal Indian Agency and eventually Fort Cass, the U.S. military headquarters for the entire Cherokee Trail of Tears removal. The Hiwassee River was a pivotal crossing for troop movement in the Civil War and several officers on both sides of the conflict made Charleston a stop in their operations. Discover these important stories and more at this recently opened interpretive center, designated by the National Park Service as a certified site on the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.\"<br /> <br /> This visitor center and art gallery, opened in May 2013, is owned by the Charleston-Calhoun Hiwassee Historical Society and is managed in conjunction with the Cleveland/Bradley Chamber of Commerce. The facility features a large number of interpretive panels that tell the story of the Trail of Tears in Charleston (a key removal site) and elsewhere in eastern Tennessee.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(8746 Hiwassee Street (US Hwy. 11/State Hwy. 2), Charleston, Tennessee)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.hiwasseeheritage.com/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The keel boats had a shorter draft and could pass through more shallow waters than the steamboats. From this point on, however, low water levels could require that even keel boat passengers disembark and continue on foot towards Indian Territory or wait until the water levels rise. For many at this point on the journey, contemplating the need to transition from the boat and go overland the rest of the journey would be overwhelming.<br /> <br /> As you stand facing the exhibit as it sits on the shore of Lake Dardanelle and look out across the water’s expanse, you can see the bluff line along the far shore, the border of the original river channel. This is where the Cherokee and other tribesmen traveled during their journey from their Eastern homelands to what is present-day Oklahoma. You will notice the sound of cars, and even children playing. But if you really listen, you will also hear the sounds of water on the rocks. You will notice numerous birds, and maybe even fish jumping. You will notice that even today there is boat traffic. Today's boats are much faster than the steamboats and keelboats used during the time of removal. As you stand here with a  gentle breeze on your face, one can only wonder, would that breeze have been a welcome push for the boats and their inhabitants?<br /> <br /> Lake Dardanelle is 99 miles by water to Indian Territory, the end of the Trail of Tears Water Route.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p>Today, Lake Dardanelle State Park is in the heart of the Arkansas River Valley and provides a vast array of recreational opportunities.

It became a postal route and was a prime route connecting Northwest Arkansas and Indian territory (Oklahoma). In 1837 to 1839 it was called the Springfield to Fayetteville Road and witnessed a peak in Indian Removal with tribes moving west. In 1860 when the telegraph lines were strung along the road it became Telegraph Road and eventually was named Old Wire Road. The alignment has changed very little from 1838-1839 when it carried 12 Trail of Tears detachments on the final leg of their journey to Indian Territory. You may notice different road names throughout the stops on this itinerary, but they all connect to what is still today referred to as the Old Wire Road. <br /> <br /> Take a walk along the historic road from the Little Sugar Creek parking lot. View this area detached from by main body of Pea Ridge National Military Park on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/peri/planyourvisit/maps.htm\">park map</a> and note the separate green area to the south of the park’s main boundary. <br /> <br /> Five of the 12 detachments are thought to have left the road near this area and went west across Benton County to their disbandment area near Beaties Prairie. If you look at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/upload/TRTEmap1.pdf\">Trail of Tears map</a>, you can see where the northernmost orange Disbandment Route line goes west from here.<br /> <br /> The area is a beautiful natural place with a hiking trail. It is steep in places but take the opportunity to walk a portion of the Trail of Tears. By the time the Cherokee reached this far they had very mixed feelings.

    "bodyText": "<p>Nestled in ten acres of wooded land at the foot of Lookout Mountain in present-day Ft. Payne, Alabama sits a cave so special in its history and diverse in its geological formations and biology that it has attracted human interaction for centuries. In the early 1800's, this area was a Cherokee settlement called Willstown. Willstown was chosen by Sequoyah as a place to settle and work on creating the Cherokee syllabary. As a result, Sequoyah's son, Richard Gist (Guess), ventured into Manitou Cave and wrote inscriptions on the wall capturing ceremonial events leading up to an important stickball game. <br /> <br /> Within a few years after the stickball game, the U.S. military rounded up Cherokee people from this area and re-named Willstown as Ft. Payne. Ft. Payne was a military stockade holding Cherokee people until they were removed to present day Oklahoma along the Trail of Tears. In the 1860's, Manitou Cave was mined for salt peter in support of the confederate army during the Civil War. Also during the Cold War, Manitou Cave was designated as a fallout shelter. Provisions for the shelter can still be seen in the cave to this day. <br /> <br /> During the late 1800's, a large chamber in the cave was used as a ballroom. People came from all around to dance and listen to a band deep inside the cave. Due to interesting formations inside the cave including a large formation rising over 40 feet in height, the cave became an interest to tourists passing through the city. It opened formally as a tourist attraction in the early 1900's, and in 1961, a midcentury modern visitors center was built. This historic visitors center has been restored and functions as an interpretive center and classroom. Groups may book a tour by appointment only and attend an educational session in the interpretive center where attendees will learn about the history of Manitou, the unique geological features and also the fragile biodiversity inside the cave. Along with other wildlife like bats and salamanders, there is a rare snail inside the cave that exists nowhere else in the world. The Manitou Cave snail, called the Antrorbis brewerii, relies on the pure cave spring water for existence. On the tour, visitors are sure to see a few of these special species. Since this location is a certified Trail of Tears Interpretive Center, visitors will learn about the history of the Trail of Tears and how this cave site fits into the Cherokee story in Willstown.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Located blocks from downtown Ft. Payne, Alabama; Contact Manitou Cave of Alabama for details)</p> <ul> <li>Annette F. Reynolds, <a href=\"mailto:manitoucaveofal@gmail.com\">manitoucaveofal@gmail.com</a></li> </ul> <h3>Physical Description</h3> <p>Guests drive up to the interpretive center along a residential street. Pulling into the designated parking area, visitors will immediately view the midcentury modern interpretive center and notice the pink limestone block and unique historic architecture of the building. From the parking lot, to the left of the restored building, the wooded line of trees slightly opens up to view the gravel pathway leading up a winding path with series of stairs reaching higher elevations to the mouth of the cave. Visitors taking this path will view rock walls towering above the path. A metal bridge leads to steps rising up to the cave entrance. On the right of the cave trail is the spring flowing from the inside of the cave. The cave temperature is a constant 56 degrees all year round. Once inside the cave, visitors might view species including salamanders and bats. Touching or leaning on the limestone walls is prohibited to protect the historic record and fragile ecosystem. Concrete steps and steel and wood bridges run throughout the course of the interior pathway. This pathway hugs tightly to the spring that runs almost the entire length of the cave. Water features flowing around rock formations run the entirety of the tour. Remnants of Cold War fall-out shelter provisions litter some cave chambers and can be seen from the path. Signatures of human visitors dating back to the Cherokee in the early 1800’s to men who mined here during the Civil War in the 1860's and 1870's that have lasted centuries along the cave walls are throughout the tour. Cherokee syllabary can be seen along the walls and on the ceiling in some areas. After about thirty minutes of walking, the cave pathway opens up to a 90’ x 60’ chamber. This chamber was used by people in the late 1800's was to dance to live music. The chamber is the turn-around point for guests on group tours. The walk back to the cave opening is also approximately 30 minutes.<br /> <br /> Once guests return to the interpretive center, there is a grassy lawn that gradually slopes downward to the picnic tables overlooking the spring run and native plants. Picnic tables line the lower elevation for wildlife viewing along the creek. Guests are accommodated in the interpretive center with a pre-tour educational session which provides an informational backdrop to enhance the experience of the cave tour. The interpretive center is designed as an open floor-plan classroom and kitchenette. A handicap accessible restroom is located on the right side of the visitors center across the breezeway that separates the restroom from classroom space. Different groups experience different needs, so accommodations should be communicated when the tour appointment is made. The grounds and cave are natural spaces and are therefore not ADA accessible. The restrooms, interpretive area and grassy area is ADA accessible, so guests who are unable to make the tour are welcome to these spaces as well as the classroom orientation.<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave tour guests:</strong> Inside the cave, the path is clay. Please wear or bring appropriate footwear that secures to the foot. Boots and tennis shoes are appropriate as flipflops and slick-sole shoes are not.The paths inside and outside the cave are all natural. They are not ADA accessible. There is a gravel path with a series of stairs and landings to get to the cave entrance. Guests must capable of climbing many steps and enduring a one hour walk for the cave tour.The inside of the cave is not lighted. Cave guests must bring a good flashlight. To enjoy all the signatures and Cherokee syllabary, a good, bright beam flashlight is recommended.The inside of the cave is cool and stays 56 degrees all year round.

    "bodyText": "<p>Retracing the Trail of Tears During that harsh winter, 11 detachments containing more than 10,000 Cherokee passed through the Mantle Rock area, not even halfway to Indian Territory. One of those groups, the Peter Hildebrand Detachment, was forced to spend two bitterly cold weeks in the Mantle Rock area, encamped for miles along the road. <br /> <br /> They were waiting for the frozen Ohio River to thaw enough for the ferry to carry people from Berry’s Ferry, Kentucky, to Golconda, Illinois. Once across the river, many became trapped again between the frozen Ohio and Mississippi rivers until they could continue traveling west to Indian Territory. These 11 detachments left Tennessee in 1838 with over 10,000 Cherokee, but due to exhaustion, illness and death, they numbered hundreds less when they arrived in Oklahoma.<br /> <br /> The Cherokee walked the road that is now a hiking trail at Mantle Rock Preserve, halfway through an 800 mile journey, feeling the loss of homeland and unsure of what lay ahead. Over 10,000 men, women, and children traveled this road during the winter of 1838-1839. When visiting Mantle Rock Preserve, you can walk in their footsteps and think of their experience as you hike the trail.

Those that made it to Indian Territory (today's Oklahoma) had to adapt to a new, unfamiliar land.<br /> <br /> At North Little Rock, both the land and water routes of the Trail of Tears intersect. Detachments of Choctaw, Muscogee, and Chickasaw, traveled the Memphis to Little Rock Road, and the Cherokee used the same road, referred to as the Bell Route of the Trail of Tears. Choctaw and Chickasaw were ferried across the river on their removal routes. Some removal groups traveled overland northwest from here to Fort Gibson in Indian Territory, parallelling the river for hundreds of miles. All five of the southeastern removed tribes (Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee, and Seminole) on water removal routes traveled this stretch of the Arkansas River.<br /> <br /> In 1838, 720 Cherokee on the Steamboat Smelter camped near here on the north bank of the river. In 1839, the wife of Cherokee Chief Joss Ross, Quatie, passed away while traveling on the Steamboat Victoria with the last group of Cherokee just before Little Rock. She was buried in town, and her grave site can be visited at Mount Holly Cemetery. Her headstone is in the Historic Arkansas Museum. All Cherokee suffered from the daily conditions of life on the Trail of Tears and no one was exempt. She represents the dangers of travel to all Indian people being removed by water, including sickness.<br /> <br /> North Little Rock is 191 miles by water from Indian Territory, the end of the Trail of Tears Water Route.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2>   <p><strong>Location</strong> (Intersection of Willow St. and Riverfront Park Drive, in North Little Rock, Arkansas)<br /> <br /> <strong>Amenities</strong><br /> Tables, Restrooms accessible if there is an event<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://nlr.ar.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/parks/nlr-riverfront-park/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/north-shore-riverwalk-park-exhibit-audio-description.htm\">Exhibit Audio Description Available</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/trail-of-tears-arkansas-river-water-route-itinerary.htm\">Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary</a></h2> <p>You can visit multiple Water Route sites on the Arkansas River by following the <strong>Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary.</strong> Each site features one aspect or story about the Cherokee and Creek experience traveling the Trail of Tears by water, highlighting the challenges and complexities that arose daily on the Arkansas River.</p>",

The following year, the journal of a preacher traveling with the Cherokee here expresses the challenges of finishing the journey and apprehension about arrival in their new land in 1838 and 1839.<br /> <br /> The Visitor Center and staff can help you plan your visit at the park. The Trail of Tears stop has an exhibit and directional sign that shows you where the trail passes and how far you are from it’s stop to end. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/elkhorn-tavern.htm\">Elkhorn Tavern</a> is located on the old Springfield to Fayetteville Road There is an exhibit about the Trail of Tears and visitors can enter the reconstructed tavern. From there, visitors can walk a short distance of the trail if they continue north on the mowed path through new growth forest. <br /> <br /> Reddick’s Field is located at the next stop on the park road and tour. The Cherokee camped nearby at Reddick’s farm in a large field area with springs. The field has been maintained and you can imagine hundreds of Cherokee camped in this area during the Trail of Tears.

Occasionally you hear the louder drone of the engines and propellers on a tow boat as it pushes barges of goods along the river. In its wake you can hear the sloshing of the waves against the banks. You can hear the sounds of campers going about their day in the background and the occasional bark of a squirrel mixed with other sounds in the forest.

    "audioDescription": "It is morning as you approach the crest of a small mound overlooking the river where the exhibit panels are located at this site. You are facing the north and you feel the sun as it is rising breaking over the trees on the horizon across the river it gently warms your right cheek slightly. There is a mild breeze off of the water and its quiet and peaceful as you take in the sight you are not alone you realize as you hear sounds around you. The wooded river bottom is stirring to life as the sun acts as an alarm clock for nature and its sleeping creatures you can hear the birds singing especially the Red-headed Woodpeckers there are so many and their distinct querrs and drums are more prominent than the other birds singing back up to their lead. Then there is a harsh raspy bark of the squirrels as they announce your presence to everyone in the area and they scurry from tree to tree. There is a crispness to the air even though it isn't cool out this morning it is refreshing. This is the environment of Rising Star Park. Indians traveling the Water Route would have hoped for days like these on the boats, but the reality of the combined experience of removed tribes on the Arkansas River was far harsher with sickness and bad weather causing miserable conditions.",

    "bodyText": "<p>From 1819-1838, the Tennessee River served as the border between Cherokee lands to the south and United States lands on the north side of the river opposite Ross's Landing. John Ross, a Cherokee businessman and later Principal Chief (1828 - 1866), established a ferry crossing and warehouse here between 1813 and 1816. In 1827, Ross moved to Georgia to serve his people as President of the Cherokee National Council. Ross opposed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the Treaty of New Echota, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.<br /> Ross's Landing became a designated departure point for Indian deportation. In May 1837, approximately 350 Muscogee (Creek) Indians who had taken refuge in the Cherokee Nation were rounded up at gunpoint and brought to Ross's Landing where they were put on boats and forced west. In 1837, two detachments of Cherokees left from Ross's Landing by boat under their own accord. In 1838, the landing was a holding camp and launching point for the first three detachments of Cherokees forced from their homelands on the Trail of Tears. In the first two of these detachments, over 1,300 Cherokees were crowded onto flatboats pulled by steamboats. In the third detachment, 1,072 people crossed the Tennessee River on Ross's swing ferry and traveled overland to Waterloo, Alabama, where they boarded boats for Indian Territory. 216 deaths were recorded in these first 3 detachments.<br /> <br /> Ross's Landing also played an important role in the Civil War,, opening up a critical supply route known as the Cracker Line. Supplies from as far away as Bridgeport, Alabama flowed to forces in the Chattanooga area across a pontoon bridge at Ross's Landing. Thanks to the Cracker Line, US Army forces ended the siege of Chattanooga and began an offensive to take Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain from the Confederates in November 1863.<br /> <br /> Today, Ross's Landing is downtown Chattanooga’s signature park along the south shore of the Tennessee River. This popular recreational area features a natural amphitheater, marina, and handicapped accessible playground, as well as Chattanooga Green, the river pier, and numerous walkways along the river. The park lies at one end of the 13-mile Tennessee Riverwalk, which extends from the riverfront at Ross's Landing to the Tennessee Riverpark and Chickamauga Dam. The path is used for bicycling, in-line skating, walking, jogging and includes several canoe/kayak launch points. An art installation at the waterfront recognizes the culture of the Cherokee people.<br />  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (201 Riverfront Pkwy, Chattanooga, TN 37402 Along the Tennessee River in downtown Chattanooga)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> Dock/Pier, Restroom - Accessible, Wheelchair Accessible, Boat Ramp, Benches Seating, Pets Allowed, Picnic Table, Playground</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://chattanooga.gov/parks/downtown-river-parks\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Cannon (1837) and the Richard Taylor (1839) detachments of Cherokees traveled on the Military Road and passed by the present-day museum site on their way west to Indian Territory.<br /> <br /> Those traveling in the 1837 Cannon group were part of the Treaty Party, the minority of Cherokees who supported a treaty made with the U. S. government without full Cherokee consent. The Cannon detachment was one of three organized and supervised by the U. S. government. Unlike the later detachments whose removal was involuntary, the Cannon party requested and received a military escort to move earlier.  <br /> <br /> The 1839 Taylor detachment of Cherokees was one of the detachments organized and removed under the supervision of the Cherokee Nation and there are records of their time in this area. This was the forced removal known as the Trail of Tears, 1838-1839. Several other detachments probably travelled this same route on their way to various disbandment locations in the Indian Territory. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2>   <p><strong>Location</strong> (118 W.

There is a Trail of Tears exhibit at signage on site.<br /> <br /> The name Toad Suck actually spans back to the early 1800s when the water in the river would get very low and create a \"suck.\" A suck was a great place for toads and frogs to live in the shallow water. It was in these shallow water areas that the steamboats would get stuck. Getting stuck extended the time on the river, and the longer the Cherokee and other tribes were trapped on the river during removal increased the likehood of other problems such as disease.<br /> <br /> Toad Suck Park is 51 miles by water from Indian Territory, the end of the Trail of Tears Water Route.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2>   <p><strong>Location</strong> (93 Park Road Bigelow, AR 72016 at Toad Suck Lock & Dam)<br /> <br /> <strong>Amenities</strong><br /> 48 Class A Campsites, Restrooms/Showers, Picnic Sites/Group Shelters, Playground, Boat Launch, Sightseeing, ADA accessible<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232721\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/trail-of-tears-arkansas-river-water-route-itinerary.htm\">Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary</a></h2> <p>You can visit multiple Water Route sites on the Arkansas River by following the <strong>Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary.</strong> Each site features one aspect or story about the Cherokee and Creek experience traveling the Trail of Tears by water, highlighting the challenges and complexities that arose daily on the Arkansas River.</p>",

    "bodyText": "John Bell led one detachment from Cherokee Agency at Charleston, Tennessee, westward across the southern part of Tennessee to Memphis and then to Indian Territory. This route is now Highway 64 and crosses the Natchez Trace Parkway here at milepost 370.<br /> <br /> His party consisted of about 650-700 Cherokee who supported the removal treaty and opposed John Ross. Bell’s detachment also differed from the Ross-allied parties in that it had a military escort. Lieutenant Edward Deas, who had earlier led a party by river, commanded the Bell’s detachment military escort. The Bell detachment took a more direct route than did the Ross-allied parties, and reached Indian Territory in January 1839.<br /> <br /> The Trail of Tears National Historic Trail commemorates the forced removal of Cherokee from their homelands; the paths that 17 Cherokee detachments followed westward; and the revival of the Cherokee Nation. The trail passes through 9 different states including Alabama and Tennessee. The sites on the trail, stretching 5,043 miles, form a journey of compassion and understanding.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/trail-of-tears-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">Trail of Tears on the Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.",
    "audioDescription": "This fourth exhibit in a series of four is titled “Journey of Injustice,” and contains an illustration that depicts the overland journey of the Cherokee from their eastern homeland to Indian Territory. A map shows several routes taken by the Cherokee during the Trail of Tears, but highlights the Bell Route. There are three other exhibits to your left. [Text] In 1835, a small group of Cherokee signed the controversial Treaty of New Echota, leading to the removal of over 15,000 Cherokee from their homelands. A sense of indescribable sadness and foreboding hovered over the Cherokee people as they were removed from their cherished homelands. Due to the raw emotions, illness, and death along the way, the journey became known as the Trail of Tears. Years in the making, the tragic journey began in October 1838. Both state and federal officials wanted the Cherokee removed to the west. The panel shows men, women and children wrapped in long coats and blankets traveling via covered wagon, horseback, but mostly on foot across a barren winter field. A man and woman kneel on the ground next to a baby wrapped in a red blanket. The woman is bent over, her head near the ground, her straw hat next to her. The man removes his hat and reaches toward the deceased infant. Other Cherokee gather round—two men on horseback and a half dozen others watch the kneeling couple. Two women—one an African American—and a child walk away. The Cherokee woman looks down toward the child whose face is sad. Others in the background huddle around fires and wagons covered in canvas. The Cherokee’s clothing varies from simple and unadorned to decorative and multi-colored. A Cherokee man in the foreground looks straight at the viewer. He wears a dark blue turban with red pattern and trim. His hunting frock is blue with pale fringe. He has several silver loop earrings in each ear and a silver nose ring. His lips are pursed, his brow furrowed, his eyes glaring. The panel map highlights the route from Tennessee to Oklahoma followed by John Bell and a group of over 600, including treaty supporters. It shows where Bell crossed the Natchez Trace. The highway near here is the actual Bell Route on the Trail of Tears. Other groups of Cherokee followed different routes over land and water. The Water Route and Benge, Bell, Drane, and Deas-Whiteley routes are marked on the map. All of the panels in this shelter have a black band across the top. The band contains the National Park Service arrowhead on the right and the words National Park Service and U.S. Department of the Interior. On the left, the band contains the words Natchez Trace Parkway.",

    "audioDescription": "This exhibit, titled “The Trail Where They Cried,” contains an illustration that depicts the overland journey of Cherokee from their eastern homeland to Indian Territory. A map shows several routes followed by the Cherokee. You are standing at the corner of the parking area looking into a grove of trees toward the Cherokee removal route. The Parkway is to your left. [Text] In 1838, the Cherokee living in the Southeast faced the combined weight of hostile federal and state policies. Forcible removal from their traditional homeland became a fearful, tearful reality. In the aftermath of hardships suffered by Cherokee who had already traveled west, tribal leaders managed their own removal plans. The illustration shows men, women and children wrapped in long coats and blankets traveling via covered wagon, horseback, but mostly on foot across a barren winter field. A man and woman kneel on the ground next to a baby wrapped in a red blanket. The woman is bent over, her head near the ground, her straw hat next to her. The man removes his hat and reaches toward the deceased infant. Other Cherokee gather round—two men on horseback and a half dozen others watch the kneeing couple. Dozens of others in the background huddle around fires and wagons covered in canvas. Four women—one an African American—and a child walk away. One woman is dressed in a long hooded cape over a bonnet with ribbon tied under her chin. An ornamented bag with shoulder strap hangs on her hip. She looks down toward the child whose face is sad. The African American woman carries a large bundle against her chest, her apron is tattered and mud spattered. The two other Cherokee women carry large baskets. Two mounted soldiers watch from the left side of the painting. On the right there is a covered wagon pulled by oxen—their backbones and ribs are clearly visible. A man wearing a slouch hat, a sash with a black, red, and blue geometric design, and an ornamental belt walks ahead of the wagon. A Cherokee man in the foreground looks straight at the viewer. He wears a dark blue turban with red pattern and trim. His hunting frock is blue with pale fringe. He has several silver loop earrings in each ear and a silver nose ring. His lips are pursed, his brow furrowed, his eyes glaring. The panel map shows the routes, over both land and water, taken by Cherokee groups during Indian removal. John Benge led one detachment of about 1,100 fellow Cherokee across the Natchez Trace near here. On September 29, 1838, John Benge and George Lowrey reported conditions among the Cherokee in their group: “ ... [M]any of them, say at least two thirds are in a destitute condition and in want of shoes, clothing and blankets.” The exhibit panel has a black band across the top. The band contains the National Park Service arrowhead on the right and the words National Park Service and U.S. Department of the Interior. On the left, the band contains the words Natchez Trace Parkway. There is one other exhibit panel with information about this site 15 feet behind you along the walk adjacent to parking.",

    "bodyText": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">In 1838, the United States government forcibly removed more than 16,000 Cherokee Indian people from their homelands in Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia, and sent them to Indian Territory (today known as Oklahoma). The impact to the Cherokee was devastating. Hundreds of Cherokee died during their trip west, and thousands more perished from the consequences of relocation. This tragic chapter in American and Cherokee history became known as the Trail of Tears, and culminated the implementation of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which mandated the removal of all American Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River to lands in the West.</span></p> <p>The Trail of Tears National Historic Trail commemorates the removal of the Cherokee and the paths that 17 Cherokee detachments followed westward. Today the trail encompasses about 2,200 miles of land and water routes, and traverses portions of nine states.</p> <p>The National Park Service, in partnership with other federal agencies, state and local agencies, non-profit organizations, and private landowners, administers the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. Participating national historic trail sites display the official trail logo. The Trail passes through the present-day states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. Due to the trail's length, you may decide to travel its entirety or just a few sites.</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

In 1830, the United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. This law required native tribes to vacate their ancestral lands and relocate to reservations in Oklahoma, then simply called Indian Territory. Then, in 1835, a small group of the Cherokee Nation signed the Treaty of New Echota, which divided the Cherokee People into two factions—those that supported the treaty and those that opposed it.<br /> <br /> In May 1838, the U.S. Army, bolstered by various state militia groups, forcibly removed over 16,000 Cherokee from their homelands so that white settlers could move in. This journey, now referred to as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears</a>, saw more than a thousand Cherokee, mainly the old, young, and infirm, perish on this brutal forced march. Thousands more died shortly thereafter from the exposure, disease, and starvation they had suffered while en route to the reservations.<br /> <br /> The park’s visitor center offers exhibits focused on both the forced removal of the Cherokee People and the area’s natural history. A 23-minute documentary titled “Trail of Tears” is also available on demand. Interpretive programs are scheduled throughout the summer from Memorial Day through Labor Day.  <br /> <br /> Those looking to spend time outdoors will enjoy boating, fishing, hiking, and swimming. There are also two playgrounds within the park.Picnic sites are scattered throughout the park, some of which are accessible to those with disabilities. The park’s two covered pavilions are available for rent or, if not reserved, can be used on a first-come-first served basis for free. The campground offers basic, electric, and sewer/water/electric/water campsites, along with a special use camping area reservable for groups only.<br /> <br /> To reserve a pavilion, call (573) 290-5268. Camping reservations may be made by calling (877) 422-6766. To reserve the special use camping area, call (573) 290-5268.

    "audioDescription": "Trail of Tears State Park encompasses 3,415 acres of land along the Mississippi River. Trails wind through forested wilderness and along the river's edge. At the visitor center, a decorative wall made of field stone announces the park's name. Just above the name, small silhouetted figures, some on horseback and others on foot, appear in a line along the top of the wall as if marching. Behind this and to the right is the parking lot, just beyond which lies the visitor center. Steps lead up the hill to the light grey building, which is partially hidden by the thick foliage of green trees.",

Edward Deas and Lt. Robert H. K. Whiteley attempted to travel from Ross Landing, Tennessee, to Fort Gibson, Indian Territory, via the water route. These detachments floated down the Tennessee River to Decatur. Due to low water and potential difficulties navigating through Muscle Shoals, they rode on the railway west to Tuscumbia Landing and then boarded boats headed downriver. Prior to that summer, numerous other water route detachments brought Creeks, Choctaws, and other tribal groups past this spot on their way to Indian Territory.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Park West (Blackwell Road/Fontana Street) Sheffield, AL 35660)</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.sheffieldalabama.org/\">More Site Information </a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

This is from the large open area that surrounds you and the wide expanse across the water to the other bank which is over 1700 feet. At first it is quiet then gradually you notice the sounds of the small waves washing against the shore gently and the sound of insects singing in the background. Now you hear the songbirds as they call to each other and then suddenly the loud squawk of a great blue heron as it takes flight from the shallow water in front of you.  As you settle back to your experience you feel the sun on your back and smell the freshness of the air and wonder if this what it was like when the Cherokee and other tribesmen were brought from their homelands up the river on flat boats to an unknown territory. The Trail of Tears exhibit recounts a day on the river in 1834, where the normal difficulties of water travel were mentioned, plus the sad note of the burial of a Cherokee child. <br /> <br /> Willow Beach Park is located 101 miles by water from Indian Territory, the end of the Trail of Tears Water Route.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2>   <p><strong>Location</strong> (11698 Blue Heron Parkway, Scott, the park is just minutes from Little Rock the state capitol)<br /> <br /> <strong>Amenities</strong><br /> 21 Class A Campsites, Restrooms/Showers, Picnic Sites/Group Shelters, Playground, Boat Launch, Sightseeing, ADA accessible<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232746\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/trte/index.htm\">Trail of Tears National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/trail-of-tears-arkansas-river-water-route-itinerary.htm\">Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary</a></h2> <p>You can visit multiple Water Route sites on the Arkansas River by following the <strong>Trail of Tears: Arkansas River Water Route Itinerary.</strong> Each site features one aspect or story about the Cherokee and Creek experience traveling the Trail of Tears by water, highlighting the challenges and complexities that arose daily on the Arkansas River.</p>",

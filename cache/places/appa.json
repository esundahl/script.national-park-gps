It is a two-story white plaster and stone building with a black tin roof protruding above the first floor and spanning the width of the building. The roof overhangs a concrete walkway along the base of the building that is raised to maintain the level of the first floor, counter to the incline of the brick sidewalk out front. The entrance is located through a double door at the right of the building, up four stairs to the stoop. In the center of the front facing wall is inset a double window with a wooden bench underneath. An at the left of the building is a bulletin board and a registration box. On the wall to the left of the front door is a dark wood sign engraved with the Appalachian Trail logo and the words \"Appalachian Trail Conservancy.\" On the right of the door, a square plaque is mounted just above ground level. The plaque reads: The American Institute of Certified Planners has designated The Appalachian Trail as a National Planning Landmark and Benton MacKaye as a National Planning Pioneer. Conceived by Benton MacKaye in 1921 as a walking trail from New England to Georgia, the Appalachian Trail was a pioneering invention in regional interconnection. MacKay's work in regional planning theory and practice also laid the foundations for the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Rural Resettlement Administration programs of the 1930s, and the Civilian Conservation Corps. The National Trails System Act of 1968 made the Appalachian Trail the spinal cord of a fourteen-state greenway and the premier component of a national system of scenic and historic trails. Erected 2000. The American Institute of Certified Planners, The Society for American City and Regional Planning History, The West Virginia Planning Association.",

Two wayside exhibits highlight the types of hawks migrating along this mountain flyway.</p> <p>Hikers can access the Appalachian National Scenic Trail as it passes through the overlook.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The overlook is a large paved parking area in the shape of an “M” on the right from the southbound lane of the parkway. In the grassy median between the overlook and the parkway is a slope with a few small trees. The overlook sits slightly below the parkway and faces west over the Great Valley. During the summer months, the vista is composed of rich green, forest-covered mountains and farm fields and forests in the valley far below, which contrast with a deep blue sky on clear days. In autumn, the forests become a varied palette of red and yellows dotted with deep green pine trees, and the valley becomes more golden. In late fall and into winter, the thinning foliage reveals lichen-covered granite boulders under the canopy.",

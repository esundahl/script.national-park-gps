Concurrently, rainwater percolating down through the mowed grounds has undermined the wall as the water seeps out into the bay. These forces have helped destabilize the historic seawall and make its long-term future uncertain.<br /> <br /> In 2011 the National Park Service facilitated the construction of a living seawall 25 feet eastward of the original seawall. The living seawall is constructed of coquina boulders. (Coquina is the same stone from which the Castillo is built, which has stood strong for more than three centuries.) Over time, sand and sediment will wash through gaps in the new seawall and build up between the two walls, which will help stabilize the historic seawall. This new substrate will also create a habitat for oysters, marsh grass, and black mangroves, which will in turn attract marine life such as crabs, shrimp, and fish. At the same time, the coquina boulders and the oysters that adhere to them will act as a breakwater, reflecting pummeling wave energy away from the vulnerable historic seawall. It is hoped that the creation of natural habitat will help preserve a historic resource for many years to come.</p>",

Hurricanes, waves, and rain have weakened the fort's historic 1840s seawall. In 2011 the National Park Service created a living seawall using coquina boulders. Silt filling the space between the 2 walls will stabilize the historic seawall, preventing further erosion while allowing mangrove and marsh grasses to grow. In addition, the outer wall will create a natural habitat for marine life such as oysters, crabs, shrimp, and fish.<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />On the panels lower half, a color photo of the fort and the 2 seawalls. In the distance is the fort's grey facade with tall green palm trees to the left and right and green grass in front. Along the right edge of the grass is the low grey historic 1840s seawall. To the right, pale blue water and a line of low, grey boulders, with water rising almost to its upper surface.<br /><br />Inset to the right, a rectangular color photo of green seagrass growing up to the edge of the grey boulders and the water. <br /><br />Below, white text in English and Spanish reads:<br /><br />In time, the living seawall will provide better erosion protection and a healthier habitat for young marine life.<br /><br />Beyond the panel, 2 low concrete walls, and the fort's low, wide stone wall. Beyond the wall, a view of the living seawall's line of boulders with seawater on either side. Ahead, in the distance, a view of the fort's grey facade. <br />",

Roman Catholic Christianity was the common faith throughout the Spanish empire, maintaining a single culture and system of government. One of the most important reasons Spain spent so much treasure and blood founding an empire throughout the Americas, the Philippines, and Africa was to take Christian beliefs to lands where they were unknown. <br /><br />British Protestant ideas of Christianity differed yet upheld a similar, if opposing, empire. U.S. soldiers also used this chapel during the 19th century. In the 1870s and 1880s, it also became the center of Captain <br />Richard Pratt's efforts to assimilate Plains and Apache Indian prisoners into white society. Church services and lessons in Christianity were held here for the Native Americans.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>This chapel was the scene of daily worship for hundreds of years. Religion guided all aspects of life in the 15th through 18th centuries. Roman Catholic Christianity was the common faith throughout the Spanish empire, maintaining a single culture and system of government. One of the most important reasons Spain spent so much treasure and blood founding an empire throughout the Americas, the Philippines, and Africa was to take Christian beliefs to lands where they were unknown. <br /><br />British Protestant ideas of Christianity differed yet upheld a similar, if opposing, empire. U.S. soldiers also used this chapel during the 19th century. In the 1870s and 1880s, it also became the center of Captain <br />Richard Pratt's efforts to assimilate Plains and Apache Indian prisoners into white society. Church services and lessons in Christianity were held here for the Native Americans.<br /></p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Chapel is accessed from either the Second Spanish Room or the American Indian room. This room's exhibits, in English and Spanish, describe religion at the Castillo. This room is described as if entering from the Second Spanish room.<br /><br />The courtyard entrance has a wooden door that forms an arch and opens inward to the room. That door remains closed. Above the door is a window. <br /><br />The room is about 20 feet wide and 30 feet long, with an arched ceiling about 17feet high. <br />In the center of the back wall, a 5 foot tall arched niche is recessed about one foot into the wall. A narrow four foot ledge runs the length of the back wall with a five foot long, 4 foot section in the center. All ledges have a wooden top and trim. The altar has 4 images of the chapel during different time periods.<br /><br />The entrance to the American Indian room is on the east wall.<br /><br />Standing at the Second Spanish Room entrance to the room, the description, moving from left to right, includes:<br /><br />Religion at the Castillo Exhibit.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Castillo de San Marcos, in St. Augustine, Florida, serves as the oldest masonry fortification in the United States. Fortifications were built as a defensive wall or barrier to prevent potential attacks. During the height of the modern Civil Rights Movement, St. Augustine was selected in 1964 by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) as a target city for civil rights activities. Activists obtained permits from the National Park Service to use the Castillo as a meeting place for demonstrations.<br /> <br /> In early 1963, local members of the NAACP developed a desegregation plan. NAACP leaders Fannie Fullerwood and Elizabeth Hawthorne wrote letters to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. The letter urged Johnson to cancel his trip to dedicating a historic Spanish landmark. Johnson responded, stating that he would not participate in segregated functions. President John F. Kennedy was also the recipient of a letter from the local NAACP in May 1963, advocating against a federal grant of $350,000 intended for the Castillo’s Quadricentennial. All members of the Quadricentennial board were said to be white persons and were unsympathetic to issues facing the Black residents of St. Augustine.<br /> <br /> On June 25, formal demonstrations began with Black teenagers of the NAACP's Youth Council picketing the local Woolworths and the St. Augustine Civic Center. The next day, 25 teenagers conducted sit-ins at Woolworths, McCrory's, and Service Drugs. White community members did not respond well to the peaceful demonstrations. Youth council leader Robert Hayling was depicted as a violent extremist, which garnered direct opposition from Mayor Joseph Shelley. By 1964, the Ku Klux Klan had begun a campaign of violence and intimidation. Shootings, clashes of violence during protests, and chaotic court cases nearly destroying the peaceful strides of the NAACP. Officials of the local NAACP realized that white militants were trying to seize the initiative. It was time to seek help from outside the city of St. Augustine.<br /> <br /> In March of 1964, Robert Hayling and other Black local leaders met with the aides of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the SCLC annual state meeting held in Orlando, Florida. The Black leaders from St. Augustine were able to convince Rev. C.T. Vivian to visit their town and see the conditions for himself. The SCLC watched events unfold in St. Augustine from July, and after visits with Vivian, they decided that their involvement could strengthen the community. The SCLC anticipated starting their St. Augustine campaign during the week of Easter, which gave white Northern college students a chance to participate. The inclusion of whites was an important strategy within itself, showing positive examples of integration. Hosea Williams coordinated the campaign, consisting of sit-ins, marches, meetings, and demonstrations. Each strategy had the common goal of placing a national microscope on years of oppression and convoluted race relations.<br /> <br /> Several of the meetings were held on the grounds of Castillo de San Marcos, for which permits were obtained from the NPS. The national park grounds served as a safe assembly place for activists of all backgrounds. The police department and St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office failed to protect activists. Four of the local Sheriff's deputies were known active Ku Klux Klan members. On national park property, however, local law enforcement would not have authority over the activists. The successes of the movement in St. Augustine helped to convey the importance of passing a sweeping Civil Rights Act, and in July of that same year, The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson.<br /> <br /> The Castillo de San Marcos National Monument in Florida became part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> in June 2021.<br /> <br /> <i>The African American Civil Rights Network recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private elements.</i></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Welcome to the gun deck! The Castillo de San Marcos is one of the tallest buildings in town, which means it's a great place from which to view the skyline of the Ancient City. Take time to stroll clockwise around the gun deck and learn about some of our local landmarks.</p> <h3>Anastasia Island</h3> <p>From the top of the stairs, you are looking east towards Anastasia Island, a 15-mile-long barrier island that protects the mainland from wave and storm action. For a short period of time, the first settlers of St. Augustine tried to move their community to the island, but the dynamic nature of the land made it impossible. When the British attacked from Georgia in 1740, James Oglethorpe set up a 40-gun cannon battery directly across the bay from the Castillo and bombarded it for nearly a month.</p> <h3>Water Battery & Shot Furnace</h3> <p>As you look down from the east wall, you will see an area known as the water battery. In the 1840s, the U. S. Army filled in the eastern side of the moat, installed large cannons along the seawall, and built the furnace for creating red-hot cannonballs to fire at wooden ships. The cannons were mounted on the granite blocks near the seawall, and the half-circle tracks enabled them to pivot almost 180 degrees.</p> <h3>Ravelin</h3> <p>This triangular structure stands seperate from the front entrance of the fort. It shielded the fort's weakest point. The wooden drawbridge, from enemy fire. It was never finished as planned. If completed, the outer wall would have been five feet higher, with embrasures for cannon and a powder magazine. The drawbridge here and the main drawbridge are both working reconstructions. The ravelin bridge would have been secured each night at sunset; the main bridge was secured only when the fort was under attack.</p> <h3>St. Augustine Lighthouse</h3> <p>To the st is the St. Augusoutheastine Lighthouse with its distinctive red top and black & white spiral-striped tower. It was finished in 1874 and replaced an old Spanish coquina watchtower that had been adapted for use as a lighthouse. Lit by its original first order Fresnel lens, the lighthouse still serves as an aid to navigation for boats at sea. Visitors can climb the tower for a spectacular view of the Ancient City!</p> <h3>St. Augustine Inlet</h3> <p>As you stand near the bell tower and look northwest, you can look out the St. Augustine inlet to the Atlantic Ocean. The original inlet to the Matanzas Bay was closer to where the lighthouse stands today, and anyone trying to bring a ship into the harbor had to navigate around the barrier islands and tricky sandbars, giving the city added protection. The natural inlet filled in over time, making it necessary for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to cut the current one in 1940.</p> <h3>Bridge of Lions</h3> <p>Connecting downtown St. Augustine and Anastasia Island is the Bridge of Lions, named for the Carrara marble lions guarding the west side of the bridge. Construction began in 1925 at the height of Florida's first land boom and was completed two years later. After decades of wear and tear, the bridge was taken apart, restored piece by piece, and reassembled in a 4-year rehabilitation project that was completed in 2010.</p> <h3>First National Bank Building</h3> <p>Directly south of the Castillo, you can see St. Augustine's first and only \"skyscraper!\" The building was completed in 1927 and has been owned by several different banks over the years; it was converted to a private event venue in 2014. It remains the only building of its kind in town, because St. Augustine now has a height limit of 35 feet for new construction.</p> <h3>Cathedral Basilica</h3> <p>To the right of the bank building is the bell tower and steeple of the Cathedral Basilica, the oldest church in Florida. Though it was built in the 1790s, its congregation was established in 1565 with the founding of St. Augustine, making it the oldest Christian congregation in the United States. The previous church was destroyed by fire, and the current building was gutted by fire in 1887, after which it was renovated and the bell tower was added.</p> <h3>Flagler College</h3> <p>The matching towers and brick smokestack visible to the southwest are part of Flagler College, formerly the Ponce de Leon Hotel. The hotel was opened in 1888 by railroad tycoon Henry Flagler as a luxury winter resort for his wealthy northern friends, beginning St. Augustine's \"golden age\" of tourism. It was used as barracks by the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II. Declining visitor numbers caused the hotel to close in 1967, but it re-opened a year later as Flagler College, now a 4-year, private liberal arts college of about 2,800 students.</p> <h3>Memorial Presbyterian Church</h3> <p>The green dome to the right of the college belongs to Memorial Presbyterian Church, built by Henry Flagler in honor of his daughter Jennie Louise, who died of complications following childbirth. She and her child, as well as Flagler himself and his first wife, are laid to rest in a mausoleum inside the church. The design was inspired by St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, Italy, and it is well known for its beautiful stained glass windows.</p> <h3>Cubo Line</h3> <p>As you look down from the west wall of the Castillo, you will see a replica of the Cubo Line, one of the walls that once encircled St. Augustine. When the English attacked the city in 1702, they failed to take the fort, but they burned the city to the ground as they left. To keep this from happening again, the Spanish built walls to protect their homes. The Cubo Line went half a mile west to the San Sebastian River. Another wall, the Rosario Line, bordered the west edge of town, near where Cordova Street is today. The walls were composed of earth and palm logs and had a shallow moat along the outside of it.</p> <h3>Visitor Information Center</h3> <p>The St. Augustine Visitor Information Center and parking garage are visible to the northwest of the fort. The VIC was built by the Works Progress Administration in 1935 and used as a community center until the city began using it for visitor orientation in the 1950s. The garage behind the VIC opened in 2006 and offers convenient parking 24 hours a day, year-round.</p> <h3>Great Cross</h3> <p>The large cross to the north of the Castillo stands on the grounds of Mission Nombre de Dios and marks the place where historians believe Pedro MenÃ©ndez de AvilÃ©s, the founder of St. Augustine, came ashore on September 8, 1565, and claimed this land for Spain and the Catholic Church. The Great Cross stands 208 feet tall and was dedicated on September 8, 1965, to commemorate the city's 400th birthday. Today, the mission grounds also contain a church, a museum, and a shrine to the Virgin Mary.</p>",

It smells and sounds like a farmyard. Mooing cows, clucking chickens, and snorting pigs are penned in the moat. The 1702 British siege made staying in town dangerous. Townspeople moved into the fort for protection, bringing their livestock with them. Farmers brought their recent harvest to extend the storeroom rations. For more than a month, nearly 1500 people crowded into the fort, relying on these provisions until the siege ended. This wide, dry ditch made the Castillo less vulnerable to infantry attacks.

    "audioDescription": "At the left and right sides of the panel, against a color illustration of light blue sky with pale pink clouds, black text in English and Spanish reads:.<br /><br />Multi-Use Moat. It smells and sounds like a farmyard. Mooing cows, clucking chickens, and snorting pigs are penned in the moat.<br /><br />The 1702 British siege made staying in town dangerous. Townspeople moved into the fort for protection, bringing their livestock with them. Farmers brought their recent harvest to extend the storeroom rations. For more than a month, nearly 1500 people crowded into the fort, relying on these provisions until the siege ended.<br /><br />This wide, dry ditch made the Castillo less vulnerable to infantry attacks. Combined with other defenses, the moat protected the fort's lower walls from cannon fire. The uncovered expanse also exposed would-be attackers to soldiers firing from the fort's gun deck. <br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />Between the English and Spanish text, a wall of the white, wedge-shaped fort bastion recedes back into the distance. The ends of several cannons poke out of square-shaped cut outs called embrasures along the upper portion of the fort's wall. <br />Below the fort is a muddy area where 5 cows, 3 with horns; 6 brown and black pigs; and 13 chickens meander. A man in a blue shirt, white pants, and cap sticks a pitchfork into the back of a straw-filled blue cart. Chickens peck on the straw that is already on the ground.<br /><br />On the left, on top of the coquina stone wall a man in a knee-length brown coat, knee-high brown boots, and black hat leans against a long brown musket. <br /><br />To the right, white text caption in English and Spanish reads:<br /><br />The moat was filled with water from 1938 until 1996, when the National Park Service drained it to reflect its original appearance.<br /><br />At the bottom right, a small circle divided into 4, triangular wedges. Each wedge has a portion of a flag and date range for an important period in the fort's history. 1 wedge is bright, indicating the time period of the panel story and the other three wedges are muted. From the top, moving clockwise: Great Britain: 1763-1784; Spain: 1784 to 1821; the United States: 1821-1900; and Spain: 1672-1763, is bright.<br /><br />Below the circle, white text in English and Spanish reads:<br />First Spanish Military Era.<br /><br />Beyond the panel, a grassy area in between the 6-foot high stone wall to the left, and the fort's 30-foot high grey stone wall to the right is the moat.

The walls have cutouts about three feet wide by three feet high, stopping at two feet height above the floor. There is a cutout in the south facing wall with a wayside exhibit in front of it and another cutout to the right of it. At the northwest corner is a sentry boxâ€”a cylindrical shaped structure, with a domed top. It is closed to the public by a wooden barricade. The west facing wall has one cutout. In the center of the bastion is a 9 foot square, low wooden platform. A rope stretches between metal posts at each corner. In the center of the platform is another wooden platform on which sits a 15-inch diameter bronze mortar. The bronze has weathered into a pale green patina color. The tube-shaped barrel of the mortar is tilted up into the air at about a 45-degree angle. Its base is connected, crossways, to a thick bronze rod. This rod is secured to the wooden platform by thick metal strips with rounded metal knobs. The front of the mortar platform has a raised wooded lip with metal strips securing it on each end. The mortar barrel has ornate bronze sculptures. At the center of the barrel is a coat of arms. At the top, are two curved handles in a dolphin shape.",

The walls were raised to 35 feet during this remodeling, and these arched ceilings were constructed. Vaulted casemates disperse the weight of the structure throughout the supporting walls and foundation, so they are able to hold much more weight than a simple squared roof. This made these rooms \"bomb proof\" and allowed the Spanish to place more cannon on the gun deck above. When the casemates were finished, the Castillo was able to defend itself, the city, and all approaches to the city out to three and a half miles, the maximum range of the 16-, 18-, and 24-pounder cannon mounted along the fort's walls. <br />",

    "audioDescription": "The Spanish Guard room can be accessed from the Sally Port space. The curved arch entryway is 5 feet wide and is accessed by a shallow ramp. <br /><br />This vaulted room is about 20 feet wide by 30 feet long, with an arched ceiling, about 12 feet high. In the room are two long platforms covered with blankets, a fireplace, a window, and an exhibit panel.<br /><br />If, after entering the room, you turn to face left, this describes the room, going from left to right:<br /><br />On the left, a large wooden platform runs the length of the wall. It is 15 feet by 6 feet. The side closest to the wall is slightly higher than the other side. About 6 sheets and rough woolen blankets are laid out in rows that run perpendicular to the wall. Above the platform is a long wooden shelf with a lantern, bowls, and hats. Blue and red uniform jackets and white shirts hang from pegs below the shelf.<br /><br />A rope at the far end block access to the back of the room.<br /><br />At the back wall is a wooden rack, with two muskets resting in it.<br /><br />Centered at the top of the back wall, is a 5 foot wide by 6 foot high window, with metal bars, and shutters that open inward. <br /><br />in the right corner of the back wall is a curved, stone block fireplace, with a smooth white chimney, shaped like a half cone. Inside the fireplace a kettle is hanging from a black metal tripod. Above the kettle hangs a bundle of fish. A hidden light makes the fireplace glow.<br /><br />In front of the fireplace is a wooden bench and table, set with a ceramic jug, loaves of bread, and vegetables in bowls. <br /><br />Along the right wall, just outside of the roped off area, is another long wooden platform and shelf, like those already described. On far end of the shelf are a jug, bowls, strands of dried vegetables, and other cooking supplies.<br /><br />Directly to the right is a door to the second Spanish Guard Room.<br /><br />On the wall to the behind and to the right, a display is tucked back in a corner that is behind you and to the right if you are looking into the Second Guard Room. The exhibit, in English and Spanish, titled,<br /><br />A Soldiers Life: A photo shows re-enactors, in uniform, posing as soldiers in this room. Text explains that the soldiers here experienced homesickness, loneliness and fear. In their downtime, they may have smoked or played games here. An illustration shows a guard room as it would have looked historically, with smooth white walls, a lit fire, bed, and table at meal time. The text explains that soldiers cooked and slept here before and after guard duty. A historic illustration of blacksmiths hammering a metal pole on an anvil in the 1700s. Text explains that soldiers needed second jobs to feed their families. An illustration shows a soldier reloading a musket in the 1700s. Text explains that soldiers spent most of their time with drills, repair work, and their second jobs.<br /><br /><br />",

It also has a window, fireplace, and several exhibits. All exhibits are in English and Spanish. If, after entering the room, you turn to face left, this describes the room, going from left to right: Along the left wall are three of the illuminated glass panels. In front of each is an exhibit relating to wall carvings behind the glass. A brief summary for each exhibit panel includes: A Spanish Fleet: A sketch of a sailing ship. Text explains that Spanish soldiers made the carvings of the fleets on the walls. American Flags on Foreign Ships: A sketch of a sailing ship with a striped flag mounted on the stern. Text explains that British ships like this are carved into this wall and the north wall. U.S. soldiers may have added American flags to the carvings. Etched, Burned, and Scrawled: Photos and sketches show letters of the alphabet are carved into the wall. Some are written backwards. Text explains that this wall contains 200 year old graffiti left by former soldiers. Soldiers of the 18th century were usually illiterate, so the artists may have just been learning to read and write. At the left corner of back wall is a curved block fireplace with a smooth top shaped like a half cone. The opening to the fireplace is protected by a clear plastic panel. At the top of the back wall is a 5 foot by 6 foot window, with metal bars, and shutters that open inward. Below the window is another illuminated glass panel and an exhibit, titled, British Ships: A line drawing shows a sailing ship with a large striped flag.

An American soldier probably added the U.S. flag. On the right wall is the entrance to the carcel, or prison. Exhibits on either side of that door are audio described separately. Behind you, on the back wall, is another exhibit panel, titled, A Mysterious Note: A diagram shows several, faded, handwritten words. Text explains that someone carved a message in old Spanish. Yet, so many letters have been worn off, that the message is illegible.

Divided into East and West, Florida remained loyal to Great Britain during the American Revolution. During the war, St. Augustine's population nearly doubled as loyalists from Georgia and the Carolinas headed south for safety. Over 500 British soldiers were housed inside the Castillo. Many more were placed in the homes of local citizens.<br />",

        "altText": "The British Room is accessed from the courtyard or the Second Spanish Period room. This room shows how British soldiers remodeled the Castilloâ€™s rooms during their occupation. This room is described based on entering from the courtyard. A wooden door opens into the room. Above the door is a barred window with a wooden shutter that opens inward. Barred windows are on either side of the door. The room is about 20 feet wide and 30 feet long. A flat, wooden beamed loft is at a 10 foot height, the 17-foot arched ceiling is visible above the wooden second floor as you stand just inside the doorway. Wooden stairs along the back wall lead up to a loft. On the right is an entrance to the Second Spanish Room. Standing at the entrance to the room, moving from left to right, the exhibits, in English and Spanish, include: Inside a Casemate Exhibit. A bronze tactile model shows a cross section of how this casemate would have looked during the British Period. Sir Frederick Haldimand. 1718 â€“ 1791. Text explains that a Swiss mercenary hired to fight for England became a colonel, and eventually, a knight. Haldimand was posted here from 1769 to 1770. In an illustration, he wears a black triangular hat with jaw length gray hair. He has thick black eyebrows, brown eyes, and a broad nose. He is wearing a red jacket with blue trim with a silver epaulet on the right shoulder. He wears a white vest with silver buttons and tan breeches. His white ruffled shirt has a black collar. Around his neck, he wears a flat, silver medallion, with an engraving of a coat of arms. Two inches of ruffled white lace shows at his wrists. A red sash is tied at his waist. He wears knee high black boots. He holds a silver sword with a gold tassel on the hilt. The living area is roped off. On the left, is a table with a checkers game and goblets. At the far right corner is a white wood bunk bed, with uniforms hanging on pegs. Nearby, there is a gray desk with a flip-down top, and a gray chair. Next to it, on a gray wooden stand, is a metal tub, with a rag hanging over the edge. Close Quarters Exhibit. The text explains that multiple bunk beds occupied each room. Four soldiers would have slept on a bunk bed. Two on each bunk of the bed. Great Britain Takes Control Exhibit. A photo shows re-enactors in this room, wearing red coat uniforms, with black triangular hats. An illustration shows a man in the same attire. A historic map of St. Augustine. A portrait of an older man, in a uniform with many badges and epaulets. The text explains that Great Britain takes over the Castillo in 1763. Within a few years, the Revolutionary War led the British to strengthen the fortâ€™s defenses.",

The most vulnerable part of the fort is its entrance in front of you. To protect it, the Spanish designed an elaborate set of defenses: a heavy grated gate called a â€œportcullis,â€, 2 drawbridges, and the ravelin. The larger drawbridge took 3 soldiers 15 minutes to close and remained open except in times of danger. Soldiers closed the outer drawbridge at night when most of them returned to their homes in the town. The ravelin protected the fortâ€™s front door. End of Text Below, a color illustration of the fort and the drawbridge entrances; text and thin black lines connect to different structural elements. Cut into the left end of the fortâ€™s white wall, is the large drawbridge entranceway. 2 soldiers in white shirts and dark colored pants, face the portcullis, ready to roll it closed. To their right, 3 more soldiers work a hand-crank machine called a windlass. This moved counterweights attached to metal chains that lifted the large brown, 1800-pound wooden, rectangular drawbridge up and away from the connecting planked walkway. On the walkway stand 7 soldiers in blue uniforms, trimmed in red; on their heads, they wear black, 3-cornered hats. One soldier faces the drawbridge as it begins to lift upwards; 6 others stand in the scene, with one of these soldiers holding a tall pole weapon: a silver-colored horizontal axe blade with a spike, mounted on a long, brown staff. At the far-right end of the walkway, 2 men in white shirts and brown knee-length pants, raise a smaller, planked drawbridge. At the top right corner of the panel, a touchable, 10-inch square bronze plaque with raised Spanish coat of arms; below, raised letters and Braille. Below the plaque, black text in English and Spanish reads: This simple version of the Spanish coat of arms above the entrance is very symbolic: â€¢ Small cross and orb atop the crown shows the Spanish Empireâ€™s devotion to the Catholic faith. â€¢ Castles and lions symbolize the kingdoms of Castile and Leon. â€¢ The sheep represents the Order of the Golden Fleece, the highest ranking chivalric order given by the Spanish crown. End of Text At the bottom right, a small circle divided into 4, triangular wedges. Each wedge has a portion of a flag and date range for an important period in the fort's history. 1 wedge is bright, indicating the time period of the panel story and the other three wedges are muted. From the top, moving clockwise: Great Britain: 1763-1784; Spain: 1784 to 1821; the United States: 1821-1900; and Spain: 1672-1763, is bright. Below the circle, white text in English and Spanish reads: First Spanish Military Era. Directly in front of the panel is a brown wooden railing. To the right of the panel and ahead is the wide, wood planked walkway that connects to the fortâ€™s drawbridge entrance; directly above, 2 cannons poke out of artillery positions. Further to the right of the panel is the smaller, secondary drawbridge entrance. To enter the fort from here, turn to your right and then immediately to your left. Move ahead across the walkway and through the open entrance into the fort. Below, and on either side of the walkway, is the grassy moat area. [End of Message]",

Avera left three houses behind when she fled to Cuba when the British took over. An illustration shows Avera with dark hair, reaching just below her ears and covered in a net. She wears dangling pearl earrings. She has an angular face with black eyebrows and dark set eyes. She wears a pearl choker around her neck. The top of her dress is white, with a square neck top, and full sleeves with long ruffled lace. There is a red ruffled ribbon design at the front.

    "audioDescription": "The Treasury Room is accessed from the courtyard. <br /><br />The room is higher than the courtyard by about 3 inches, requiring a step up to enter the room. On the exterior of the planked wooden door is a metal latch that slides left with two \"U\" hooks for a padlock. The door is 5 feet wide and is reinforced with four thick flat metal bars. <br />The room is about 20 feet wide and 30 feet long, with an arched ceiling about 17 feet high. <br />Visible on the left and back walls, at a height of about 5 feet, are the wooden blocks sitting in the open holes in the walls, about 5\" square, and spaced about 3 feet apart. Just inside the treasury room, on the left, there is a four foot high and four foot wide wall, with an exhibit.<br /><br />The exhibit is titled,<br /><br />The King's Coffer: Treasury Room Exhibit. <br /><br />Graphics show a modern illustration depicting this room, in historic times, described in more detail later. The text reads,<br /><br />In the 18th Century, Spanish military pay chests, important documents, and valuables consigned for shipment back to Spain were kept secured in this room. Notaries, administrative officials appointed by the king, accounted for all monies and goods going to or from the New World.<br /><br />During the 19th Century, the U.S. Army use this room as a supply room. The solid slab of granite in the doorway was placed there in the 1840s at the request of the Quartermaster to serve as a counter so that soldiers could not enter the room beyond that point.<br /><br />An artist's representation of what this room looked like historically with smooth white painted walls. The lower portion of the walls has a yellow stripe at four feet with red paint below. The emblem of the Spanish Empire is seen in the center of the back wall. The emblem shows water with cresting waves. Above the water is a world map, shaped as two overlapping circles with oceans and continents. Above the globe is a large, gold, jeweled crown, with a red padded center with five gold loops that join in the center above the red padding, topped by a scepter and a cross. The map is flanked by white pillars, wrapped with red sashes, with topped with gold cornices and ornate gold crowns. The wooden furniture in the room includes four tables with a yellow chair. Candlesticks and books can be seen on two of the tables. Wooden chests can be seen on a table and along the back wall.<br /><br />A photograph of a worn silver coin, with emblem of the Spanish empire, just described, in the center. Several characters are arranged in a circle around the edge of the coin. On the bottom is the date of 1737. On either side of the date is a small flower, with 6 petals. On either side of the flowers is a capital M, with a small circle above it. On either side of those is another small flower. On the top, spanning the distance between those two flowers are the letters, \"V,T,R,A,Q,U,E, then V,N,U,M,\" in capital letters.",

Each one had its own strengths and weaknesses. A CANNON was best at shooting far, a MORTAR used exploding projectiles, and a HOWITZER was a mix of the 2. Battles to conquer a fort often last a long time. Choosing the right artillery could mean the difference between victory and defeat.",

The top third is a light blue sky; the middle section, brown earth; the bottom section, white text in English and Spanish against a blue background: Weapons of War. Touring the fort, you will see 3 types of artillery: mortars, howitzers, and cannons. Attackers as well as defenders had access to many types of weaponry. Each one had its own strengths and weaknesses. A CANNON was best at shooting far, a MORTAR used exploding projectiles, and a HOWITZER was a mix of the 2. Battles to conquer a fort often last a long time. Choosing the right artillery could mean the difference between victory and defeat. End of Text On the top, against the light blue sky are 3 small circles. In each circle is a photograph of a piece of artillery. In the left circle, a green and brown squat mortar gun tips upward at a left angle. In the center circle, a grey, stocky horizontal howitzer gun is supported on a low grey wedge. To the right, a long, green and brown cannon, its barrel tipped slightly upward, is set in a low, dark grey structure. Below each photo is a small brown illustration of the corresponding gun firing. A brown dotted, arcing line, runs from the mouth of each piece of artillery to a spot at the left side of the panel to show the trajectory of the shot from each gun. The mortar and howitzer lines end in an illustration of an exploding shell, and the cannon line ends with an illustration of a cannonball. Below, at the left, against the light brown earth, black text in both languages reads: Fire! Exploding shells were most effective when fired from mortars and howitzers while solid shot (cannonballs) were best when used with cannons. End of Text To the right, and below each artillery illustration, 3 light tan rectangular boxes with black text in both languages. Below the mortar: â€¢ Shortest barrel â€¢ High, lobbing arc reaches targets behind walls and other barriers â€¢ Often used to fire on a besieged town End of Text To the right, below the howitzer: â€¢ Hybrid gun with a mid-length barrel â€¢ Medium to high angle, adjusted to increase or decrease range â€¢ Combines cannon mobility with mortar firepower End of Text To the right, below the cannon: â€¢ Longest barrel â€¢ Relatively flat trajectory â€¢ Destroys buildings, walls, and other obstacles End of Text Directly in front of the panel is a 13-foot wide by 23-foot long wood-planked platform; its front edge raised one foot from the ground. Surrounding the platform are metal stanchions with connecting ropes. Lined up on top of the platform are 8 pieces of artillery; all are set horizontally on wood blocks. The first 2 are 4 Â½-foot long, black iron cannons. Next are 5, longer cannons, their barrels a blue-ish green bronze. On the center top of these cannons are double handles, called â€œdolphins.â€, To the right of the first 2 cannons, set on a wood platform and tilted upward, is a blue-ish green, squat mortar; its surface covered in etched scrollwork. Beyond this wooden platform, set on a wooden base is a second mortar. To the left and right of the artillery platform, are the fort walls: to the left are wood benches; to the right, attached to the walls, are 2-stepped low platforms. [End of Message]",

    "audioDescription": "Within10 years, the reconstituted Awatixa returned to their ancestral land to build a new village. It is known as today Awatixa or Sakakawea Village. They lived here from 1790-1834.  Historical records indicate from 40 to 60 lodges were here at different times. Currently there are 31 visible depressions.   The Sakakawea village archeology site was named after Sacagawea Charbonneau who joined the Lewis and Clark expedition to the Pacific Ocean as a guide and interpreter. Her and her husband Toussaint Charbonneau lived in this village before and after their adventure on the Corps of Discovery. Toussaint Charbonneau lived here most of his life.  What does the wayside sign tell us? Awatixa Village (Ah-wah-TEE-Khah) Disappearing Village Site The river that nurtured Awatixa Village is erasing evidence of its existence. In 1798, explorer-trader David Thompson estimated fifty-two earthlodges here. As of 1990, one thirty-one earthlodge depressions remained. Cutbank erosion and channel shifting had washed away at least six, partially destroyed another six, and modern farming had obliterated ten others. To protect the site from future flooding and ice jams, the park has constructed a berm along the river’s edge. Images remain. In 1832, George Catlin visited the village, stayed several weeks, and painted the view from the opposite bank. Though Catlin was a self-taught artist and his technique sometimes appears clumsy, his cultural impressions were accurate. Caption under image: Most historians agree that Toussaint Charbonneau and probably his wife Sakakawea lived in this village. When Lewis and Clark camped in the area, they hired Charbonneau as an interpreter for the expedition. Photo: George Catlin's Hidatsa Village on the Knife River",

On the horizon you might see Bison, Deer or Elk and as you walk down the path you see your Mother in the garden with her sisters singing their prayers to the growing corn. Your Father would be sitting on top of the lodge keeping watch for herds to hunt or enemies attacking.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3cbb3e3b-ceb5-453a-81fd-775492b6b659}{14}\" paraid=\"1472759059\">Feeling safe, you walk into the lodge and smell the fire. You know something good is cooking. You are home. Passing the windbreak (Wid-daksuti), you see the corral for your family’s prized horses on the right. They are valued for their skill in hunting and warfare. The horses are kept inside overnight protected from weather and thieves. Under the watchful eye of your brother. The horses, now, are grazing a short distance away.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c12426e5-537d-4c22-8073-71970dd9b856}{230}\" paraid=\"606778487\">Your favorite dog comes to greet you.

Food and water are stored in clay pots. The mortar and pestle have been used. The mortar has grain in it and there are berries on the mashing hide. You go to grab a berry, but your sister pops her head out of the cache pit (root cellar) to tell you that you must wait for the others. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3cbb3e3b-ceb5-453a-81fd-775492b6b659}{66}\" paraid=\"631160317\">You sit on a mat at the fireplace next to your Mother’s Father who is reclining on the Atuka.

The shrine holds headdresses, medicine bags, ancient clan bundles, shields, spears and arrows all used in battle. They are all sacred and cherished items. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3cbb3e3b-ceb5-453a-81fd-775492b6b659}{48}\" paraid=\"659684664\"> As you walk outside of the Earthlodge, you hear sounds of the village, men talking, children playing, dogs barking, and women singing.

    "audioDescription": "Outside: A brown, dome shaped lodge with a daisy chain of logs supporting sod covering on the sides and roof. The lodge is surrounded by a concrete sidewalk, brick seating, young trees and green lawn overlooking grass fields. Entrance is a hall built with smaller vertical logs with a roof of similar material. Inside: The houses of the village-dwelling tribes on the upper Missouri usually were circular in shape, the larger houses averaging about thirty feet in diameter. Their design incorporated four center wooden pillars and an adjoining framework of posts and beams supporting numerous rafters and wall poles. Over these was laid a matting of willow and grass and an outer, insulating later of earth. A hole in the roof admitted some light and otherwise vented the smoke from a central firepit in the floor. An exterior, moveable screen shielded the vented from the wind and rain. The entrance to the interior was protected from the weather by a covered passageway.

Wayside: Awatixa Xi'e Village (Ah-wah-TEE-Khah) (Eh) Circles in the Earth You are at the Edge of the large village of earthlodges. When the dwellings collapsed, they left circular mounds of earth around hardened, saucer-like floors. From that pattern you can picture the extent of this village and speculate about the number of inhabitants. The bowl-shaped earthlodge depressions are surprisingly close together, leaving barely enough room for corn-drying scaffolds between dwellings. On sprawling prairie this crowded design suggests a close-knit social structure or the need for protection against marauding tribes. Sketch of an unfinished earthlodge wooden framework. These earthlodges measure thirty to sixty feet in diameter-large enough for an extended family of five of their best horses. At least five inches of earth covered a wooden framework of rafters and support posts. Photo: Arial view of Lower Hidatsa Fifty-one earthlodge depressions are clearly visible from the air. According to archeological evidence, people occupied the site for centuries before the Awatixa built this village. They abandoned it after the smallpox epidemic in 1780, but later returned and built a new village at the river's edge.",

    "audioDescription": "Small gardens on the left and right in the summer and spring. Otherwise the garden sits fallow. Wayside: Hidatsa Garden With simple tools, Hidatsa women grew corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers in the fertile soil along the Missouri and Knife Rivers. “My grandmother Turtle made scarecrows to frighten away the birds…she drove two sticks for legs, and bound two other sticks to them for arms: on the top she fastened a ball of cast-ways skins…Such a scarecrow looked wicked!” Picture: Hidatsa woman hoeing with bone hoe, 1912 Buffalo Bird Woman, known in Hidatsa as Maxidiwiac, was born about 1839, in an earthlodge along the knife River in present day North Dakota. In 1845, her people moved upstream and built Like-a-fishhook village, which they shared with the Mandan and Arikara. There Buffalo Bird Woman grew up to become an expert in traditional Hidatsa gardening. Mapi (Sunflower) “Usually we planted sunflowers only around the edges of a field. We thought a field surrounded thus by a sparse sown row of sunflowers, has a handsome appearance.” Ama’ca (Beans) “In the spring, when I came to plant beans, I was careful to select seeds for the following points: seed should be fully ripe…plump, and good size.” Ko’xati (Corn) “We knew when corn planting time came by observing the leaves of the wild gooseberry bushes. This is the first of the woods to leaf in the spring.” Kuku’l (Squash) “We had a reason for planting the squash seeds in the side of a hill. If we planted them in level ground the rains would beat down the soil …but if we planted the sprouts on the side of the hill, the water from the rains would flow over them and keep the soil soft.” Buffalo Bird Woman’s Garden As you walk further north there is a Drying Stage on the right. the description below for a Watchers' stage is similar to the Drying Stage. \"A watchers' stage was not hard to build. Four posts, forked at the tops, upheld beams, on which was laid a floor of puncheons, or split small logs, at the height of the full grown corn. The floor was about four feet long by three wide, roomy enough for two girls to sit together comfortably. Often a soft robe was spread on the floor. A ladder made of the trunk of a tree rested against the stage. The latter had three steps.\" Wilson, Waheenee Wayside: Drying Stages \"A corn drying stage stood before every lodge.\" Buffalo Bird woman's Garden \"By far the chief use of the drying stage was to dry vegetables, especially our corn and sliced squashes. Firewood, collected from the Missouri in the June rise [flood], was often piled on and under the stage floor to dry.\" \"The keepers of the O'kipa ceremony used to bring out their buffalo head masks, and air them on the drying stage that stood before their lodge door.\" Buffalo Bird Woman's Garden",

Along that river were two Hidatsa towns, which were also home to many Mandan. Awatixa was the town where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sacagawea-s-story.htm\">Sacagawea</a> and her husband, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hiring-of-charbonneau-and-sacagawea.htm\">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, lived. These were winter villages, which were smaller than and upriver from summer villages. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{179}\" paraid=\"914467629\">Mandan and Hidatsa people cultivated crops in the fertile riverine lands, and they were well-acquainted with the French, British, and Spanish traders who traveled the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers to trade with them. They even permitted some of these traders, like Charbonneau, to live with them, as was customary in many Indigenous villages across the continent. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{223}\" paraid=\"1030498113\">In the winter of 1804–1805, Mandan and Hidatsa people permitted members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition to build a dwelling for the winter seven miles downriver. </p> <p paraeid=\"{58d6f9bb-754c-4639-a479-a218897d7450}{251}\" paraid=\"810725828\">Meriwether Lewis and William Clark wanted to be at this site because of its proximity to the Mandan and Hidatsa villages on the Knife River. They wanted to have access to the expansive trading network that revolved around these towns, which spanned west to the Rocky Mountains, north into Canada, and south through the Great Plains. A wide array of goods was available at these marketplaces: Spanish horses, Cheyenne leather goods, English and French guns and ammunition, and food grown and preserved by Mandan and Hidatsa people.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ab000ee8-b82f-45c3-a12b-0e56a16726af}{44}\" paraid=\"339846512\">Lewis and Clark wintered here because they needed access to the goods and information that Mandan and Hidatsa people had thanks to generations of developing relationships and trade networks with people who lived up and down the Missouri River. <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p paraeid=\"{154f891e-a0db-4853-ad9f-37e83e605222}{241}\" paraid=\"8\">On March 30, 2009, the United States Congress designated the <a href=\"http://www.northernplainsheritage.org/\">Northern Plains National Heritage Area (NOPL NHA)</a> into existence. The Northern Plains Heritage Foundation is the coordinating entity for the heritage area who celebrates traditional and modern native cultures, farming and ranching heritage, and its infinite legacies. </p> <p paraeid=\"{154f891e-a0db-4853-ad9f-37e83e605222}{252}\" paraid=\"9\">The Northern Plains National Heritage Area is rooted in the historical significance of the Missouri River. The first peoples traversed this landscape in the Paleo and Archaic eras. Settlements of the region trace back to the ancestral homelands of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people who utilized the fertile Missouri River bottomlands for agrarian purposes. The Oceti Sakowin ( known as “The Great Sioux Nation” in the 19th century) have ancestral ties to this nationally important lived-in landscape.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6435e32d-15f2-4c3d-8cb8-a7b28a6a5cee}{5}\" paraid=\"10\">Lewis and Clark spent 1803-1804 wintering here and the Mandan and Hidatsa people helped them during their long journey. This is also where Lewis & Clark met Sakakawea (or \"Sacagawea\"). Indigenous communities formed relationships with the early European fur traders from the 1730s to the 1860s. Numerous European artists, such as George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, dedicated time visiting the area to paint portraits of the Mandan people and the landscapes they inhabited. Through this, the Mandan are one of the most documented indigenous groups in all of North America.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6435e32d-15f2-4c3d-8cb8-a7b28a6a5cee}{20}\" paraid=\"11\">With westward expansion and the tension created by encroaching Euro-American settlements, the area became the battleground for the U.S. Dakota Wars of 1862-1865. The arrival of Jay Cooke’s Northern Pacific Railroad to the area in 1872 brought a new wave of European immigration to the region. With the establishment of the railroads, global immigration descended into the area. In 1883, the Northern Pacific Railroad completed construction of a permanent bridge that spanned the Missouri River at Bismarck. Completion of the bridge in 1883 coincided with the first agricultural economic “boom” in Dakota Territory. Immigrant farmers established cooperative and social activities that influenced local politics to push for their own economic agency. In 1919, a North Dakota state-owned Mill, a state Elevator, and the Bank of North Dakota were established to allow farmers and ranchers better local market control. </p> <p

Wayside: Middens To imagine these people's daily lives, consider their trash. Molehill-like mounds two to four feet high near the village edge are middens or garbage heaps packed with broken pottery, bone tools, and flacked stone. Shattered buffalo bones are the most frequent objects archeologists have unearthed there. Though agrarian and river-based, the Awatixa (Ah-Wah-TEE-Khah) still depended on bison for meat, hides, and bone tools. Hunters brought back the butchered bison, and villagers crushed the large leg bones to extract marrow fat for grease. Photo 1: Bison hunt, from a painting by Karl Bodmer Photo 2 of Archeological cross-section of a midden. By focusing on everyday debris, you can begin to picture village activity yet miss the rich ceremonial life. For that you must rely on paintings and sketches by 19th-century artists George Catlin and Karl Bodmer. Catlin visited Awatixa Village, the next site along the trail.",

The Missouri River and its tributaries provided fish, fertile soil for crops, and a green world of berries and wild game below the semi-arid prairie. While the river made permanent settlement possible, it also brought inexorable change. Europeans and Americans used the Missouri River as their primary trade route. Mandans and Hidatsas began to be absorbed into the Euro-American economy, and were exposed to diseases from which they had no immunity. Below the text is a map of trade routes captioned as: Routes and centers of intertribal trade in 1805. Intertribal trade predated contact with Europeans. The map shows Mandan and Hidatsa traded with a Shoshoni trade center in Wyoming, Arikara trade center in South Dakota, a Dakota trade center and the Cheyanne, Arapahoe Comanche and Apache and Kiowa trade route. Painting of the Steamboat Yellow Stone on the Missouri River, from a painting by Karl Bodmer “People of the Willows” A bullboat was made from a freshly shinned buffalo hide stretched over a frame of willow branches. The craft could transport several hundred pounds of passengers or cargo, yet was light enough for one person to carry. Built and primarily navigated by the women of the village, bullboats floated dried meat downriver from buffalo hunts far to the west. Sketch of two women make a bullboat.",

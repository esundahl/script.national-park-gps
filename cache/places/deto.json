From the trail, the Tower appears perched atop this giant pile of boulders. Cracks in the Tower’s columns lead people to wonder “How often do they fall?” and “Am I likely to get hit?” The answer to the former is not often, with the last large chunk of column falling over 100 years ago. The second question, however, is possible, though very unlikely.</p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{40bf457f-d918-4f6d-a338-377560cf0535}{77}\" paraid=\"125435271\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Boulders range from small pebbles to the size of refrigerators and the length of school buses. The boulder field inspires visitors of all ages to and climb and scramble all over. If you feel compelled, feel free, just be safe and do not venture above the boulder field unless you register at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/deto-climbingkiosk.htm\">climbing kiosk</a>. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5c4d394c-4a1c-4032-a73e-43621a64e3ee}{61}\" paraid=\"198366129\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The boulder field is a great place to watch rock climbers. In spring, summer, and fall, around 5,000 people climb Devils Tower. Only about half will summit, but often that’s intentional – reaching the top isn’t always the goal. You may even catch a climbing ranger out on patrol. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{45e62c4c-8c5b-4a8c-a829-3942865666c3}{230}\" paraid=\"997718980\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Devils Tower is special to people throughout time and place. Those who visit the Tower up close feel it. Over 26 Native American tribes consider the Tower sacred; many have visited for centuries and continue to do so today.

It is not uncommon to be visited by eagles on this platform and spy large maritime vessels carrying freight to and from Thunder Bay. Evident is the island's ridge and valley topography from this view, with layers of lakes and trees interwoven in the foreground below. There is almost no evidence of human construction from this view unless binoculars are used to gain a clearer view of the Ontario shoreline.",

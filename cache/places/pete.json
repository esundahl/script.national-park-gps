Although this mortar is not the original one, it is the same weapon from the Civil War era.

Before removal, in September, it had sent 218 shells across the river.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This trail junction leads down the hill into the woods, in front of Battery #5. The paved sidewalk leads to the \"Dictator.\" The slope can be steep on the return hike. To the \"Dictator\" and back is roughly 0.25 miles. If you continue past the \"Dictator,\" the trail becomes a nature trail and circles around Battery #5, returning to the open field you are in now, finalizing to a 0.5-mile hike. There is one wayside at this junction titled \"Battery 5 of the Dimmock Line.\" There is a black bar along the top, and the photo beneath is a historic photo of Battery 5 taking up the lower half of the wayside. There are two maps on the right side, one showing the Confederate works and the Union additions to Battery 5. The other is a map of Petersburg, showing the Dimmock Line in its entirety. Text on the wayside is the following. \"In 1862-two years before the first Federals appeared at the city's gates-Confederate Captain Charles Dimmock oversaw the construction of a ten-mile line of defensive works ringing Petersburg. In front of you is Battery 5, one of the largest of the fifty-five artillery positions in the Dimmock Line.\" The caption for the historic photo is the following. \"This photograph, taken from just inside Battery 5, shows how the battery looked a few days after its capture by the Federals. During the Siege of Petersburg, Battery 5 would be more than a mile behind the main Union siege lines.\" The caption for the map of Battery 5 is the following. \"Most of the works you see at Battery 5 were built by slaves. The parapet to your left, shown on the diagram (near right) in blue, was added by the Federals after the battle here on June 15, 1864.\" The caption for the map of the Dimmock Line is the following. \"Far Right: On June 15, 1864, more than 30,000 Union troops marched from the east toward the Dimmock Line. Only 2,300 Confederates stood between the Federals and Petersburg.\"",

The daily shelling shaped the landscape and was central to the siege experience. For soldiers, surviving the shelling meant vigilance, living in bomb proofs, and dealing with the stress of bombardments. The artillery pieces before you are examples of types of cannon used by both sides during the siege. Quote by William P. Hopkins 7th Rhode Island Volunteers Reads “Simultaneously the rebels opened their mortar battery very savagely. Our mortars and field artillery responded. This continued for ninety minutes during which time fifteen or twenty shells could be constantly counted in midair at one time. A more splendid display I never witnessed.” Small historic black and image of soldiers around a large artillery piece behind tall reinforced earthen wall. Five other artillery pieces are inline further down the wall. Caption reads First Connecticut Heavy Artillery in siege lines.",

In capturing Confederate troops in these trenches there were instances of USCTs shooting Confederate prisoners. Here 250 yards up the trenches is the closest they came to their objective. Twice this division of soldiers charged westward from these captured trenches across the field toward Blandford Cemetery. Each time they were stopped by devastating Southern artillery and rifle fire.

Some of the USCTs retreated to the Crater or back to the Union lines, sweeping with them supporting Federal troops which had just arrived.

    "audioDescription": "Two Waysides 1st Wayside Crawford’s Sweep. Body Text reads: The decisive Union movement at the Battle of Five Forks was, for the Federals, a fortunate mistake. While one union division struck the Confederates left at the Angle, Brigadier General Samuel W. Crawford’s division passed too far north and missed the confederate line altogether. Instead, Crawford's lines swept westward to the Confederate rear, cutting the main confederate escape route here along Ford's road. Crawford then pushed across the fields in front of you, toward the rear of the Confederate lines at five forks (to your left). His attacks spelled doom for Pickett’s command. Caption above map: After reaching the Confederate rear, Crawford turned South smashing hastily formed confederate lines here in Benjamin Boisseau’s field. The Federals pushed all the way to the White Oak Road where they turned West again. From that point on they overcame sporadic resistance from the remnants of what had been a 10,000 man confederate force. Map: shows confederate line noted in red a line along White Oak Road with a bend upward on the right end of the line. Blue arrows show the attack on the angle and a blue arrow loops around past the angle, around the back, and heading to the left after crossing the red Confederate line.

Image caption reads: Captured confederate after the battle of five forks. this photograph was probably taken at city point Virginia. Second Wayside Body Text Reads: “Among my gallant officers…” Colonel Thomas Munford One of the Confederates trying to stem Gen. Crawford’s Union troops was James Breckinridge. Born in Fincastle, Virginia he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute and the law school at the University of Virginia. At the outbreak of the war he volunteered, along with his brothers, rising to the rank of Captain of Company C, 2nd Virginia Cavalry in 1862. Colonel Cary Breckenridge of the 2nd Virginia Cavalry wrote about the events of April 1st, 1865 and the death of his 28 year-old brother, “We were ordered to move to the left of his [General George Pickett’s] line, the rest of the Brigade remaining near the road. This was a hurry order and we went through the woods as rapidly as the nature of the ground would permit, and in a direction parallel with the line of battle as it was then raging. When probably 1/4th of a mile from the starting point we ran against a column of Federal Infantry moving directly across our front. The men of the 2nd were dismounted as they came up, being in a straggling condition owing to rapid movement through thick woods, and a weak skirmish line formed which opened on the enemy at close range. The Federals marching in columns of fours right shoulder shift took little notice of us at first, but presently faced to the left returned our fire at the rate of about one thousand shots to one and soon swept us out of the way. This was the beginning of the retreat as far as the 2nd Regt was concerned. We lost some officers and men in this unequal contest. Among them Capt. James Breckinridge, Co. C who endeavored to make a stand on the bank of a small stream at the edge of the woods. He was discharging his pistol into the face of the enemy not over twenty paces distant when shot down.” Breckenridge was buried on the battlefield. A memorial marker was placed in Longwood Cemetery in Bedford, Virginia by his family. During the 1950s the remains were found by a local resident along Courthouse Road. Research indicates the remains belonged to Captain Breckinridge and after consulting with the soldier’s family , a decision was made to rebury the remains where they were found.

Caption beneath it reads: “His gallantry and dash were universally recognized as second to no other officer in the command.” – Munford.",

Added to this was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/jefferson-davis.htm\">President Jefferson Davis'</a> (CSA) commitment to continued prosecution of the war and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/us-grant.htm\">Gen. Grant's</a> (USA) continued buildup of Union troops at Petersburg.</p> <p>Lee had <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/john-gordon.htm\">Gen. Gordon</a> (CSA) formulate a plan that, at the very least, would enable the Army of Northern Virginia to pull out of Petersburg unmolested and perhaps give it a chance to link up with the Confederate army in North Carolina. The idea was a surprise attack that would force Grant to shorten his lines or even set his lines back, allowing for a clean pullout for Lee.</p> <p>Gordon developed a pre-dawn surprise attack on a Union fort, Fort Stedman. It was one of the closest spots on the line, there were fewer wooden obstructions, and a supply depot on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/united-states-military-railroad.htm\">U.S. Military Railroad</a> was less than a mile behind it. Lee approved the plan.<br /> <br /> <strong>4:00 am</strong></p> <p>On a signal, lead parties headed out to overwhelm Union pickets and to remove wooden defenses. This was the initial wave of a force that represented nearly half of Lee's army.</p> <p>It was a complete surprise as they captured Fort Stedman and the batteries just to the north and south of it with little resistance. As the Confederates rounded up nearly a 1,000 prisoners, the lead attackers reached Harrison's Creek along the Prince George Court House Road.</p> <br /> <p><strong>6:00 am - 7:00 am</strong></p> <p>Due to the various whereabouts of the senior commanders, the Union response fell upon <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/learn/historyculture/john-hartranft.htm\">Gen. Hartranft</a> (USA), a divisional commander in the IX Corps.</p> <p>Between some confusion among the attacking Confederates, Union artillery support from up and down the line, and the response by Hartranft's infantry the attack is stopped.</p> <p>Gordon, who was in Fort Stedman, realized the plan had failed when his lead men started returning unable to find the depot and reporting Union resistance. Lee soon gave permission to Gordon to pull his men back.<br /> <br /> <strong>8:00 am</strong><br /> <br /> By 7:30am the Union forces had sealed the breach and the Union artillery was heavily bombarding Fort Stedman. A coordinated attack started shortly before 8:00am, Hartranft advanced on the fort, re-claimed it, and made the ground between the lines a true \"no man's\" land for those Confederates retreating to their trenches.<br /> <br /> This gamble turned out to be a four hour action with no impact on the Union lines. In fact the Union counter attack further down the line near Fort Fisher, produced greater results. The ground won there allowed the Union to launch one of their break through attacks on April 2, 1865.</p> <p>The battle of Fort Stedman was a devastating blow for Lee's army.</p>",

Grant chose the Eppes family Appomattox Plantation at City Point for his headquarters and supply depot because of its strategic location. It provided easy water communication with Fort Monroe and Washington D.C. Supplies could be sent up the James River directly to City Point. From here the old City Point Railroad ran from the waterfront to the rear of the United States Army at Petersburg, allowing Grant to easily send reinforcements and supplies to the field.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "General Grant's cabin is a wooden cabin with the planks constructed together while placed vertically. It is shaped like a wide \"T\", with the front door on one side. This door is currently covered with plexiglass. There are windows on each side of the building with a fireplace in the back. The chimney is made of red bricks. The interpretive panel in the grass to the front states the following. \"From November 1864 through March 1865, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant lived in this modest cabin. From here he directed Union armies in the climactic final campaigns of the war and hosted some of the notable figures of the era: President and Mrs. Lincoln, Major General William T. Sherman, Secretary of State William Seward, and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. This was one of 22 cabins that stood on the Eppes property. After the war, Grant's cabin was moved to Philadelphia, where it remained on display for 116 years. In 1981, the National Park Service returned the cabin to City Point and reassembled it on its original site. About 10 percent of the structure is original. It is one of the few vestiges of the Union occupations of City Point.\" The background of the panel is tan, with a sepia photo of eight wooden cabins in a row leading up the Eppes family front door. It is captioned, \"Grant's cabin is at the left of this photograph. The cabin was built in November 1864 to replace the tents that had served as headquarters during warmer months\". To the right of the photo is another black and white photo of three men standing in front of the cabin dressed in uniform. It is captioned, \"Grant and some of his staff officers pose on the porch of the cabin. Grant is in the center\".",

Behind you and to your left were the quarters of sixteen enslaved Black men and women owned by Jordan. Starting in 1862, slaves and Confederate troops built a wall around Petersburg. Going from your right and running behind you it split the Jordan property. If war came to Clermont the wall may have meant protection to the Jordans but perhaps freedom to the enslaved. By the time war arrived here on June 15, 1864, the Jordans had left. At war’s end there is no evidence the freed Blacks returned here, and nothing is known of their post-Civil War lives. The Jordans returned to their destroyed house and chose to rebuild. Clermont’s story played out in different ways in post-war Petersburg with people uprooted in terms of loss, in terms of a new-found freedom, or both.",

Grant knew that the key to Richmond was Petersburg which was lightly defended by Confederate forces. Failing to take Richmond by approaching from the north, Grant surprised by attacking Petersburg from the south. With Union General Benjamin Butler's forces to help strengthen his drive to Petersburg, Grant reached Petersburg defenses, here where you are standing, on June 15, 1864. General P.T.G. Beauregard the confederate commander and Petersburg held off union attacks for the next two days and kept the city in confederate hands. Beauregard brought more of his own troops down from the Bermuda Hundred lines, rebuilding confederate defenses, and finally receiving reinforcements from Lee on June 17th. At the end of the battle on June 18, 1864, Lee still held Petersburg the key to Richmond.

The deteriorated building was removed in 1868. Beginning in 1871, the federal government implemented a series of improvements for the cemetery, including the cemetery’s brick enclosure wall and iron gates, marble headstones for the graves, and the erection of a superintendent’s lodge near the cemetery’s entrance. Additional improvements at Poplar Grove National Cemetery included the construction of an iron rostrum (1897) and restrooms and maintenance facilities (1929). <br /> <br /> In 1933, the management of the cemetery was transferred to the National Park ServiceIn 1957 the cemetery officially closed to new interments. The last burials were of three unknown U.S. soldiers on Memorial Day in 2003.Poplar Grove National Cemetery is part of Petersburg National Battlefield.<i></i></p>",
    "audioDescription": "Rod-iron gates in a brick lead to a wide paved walkway into the cemetery. On the is a lodge - a one-and-one-half story brick building in the Second Empire style, notable for its mansard roof and dormer windows. On the left is a large rectangle of asphalt in front of a single-story white building with a green roof. Just past the building on the left are long straight rows of white marble headstones and smaller white blocks marking grave sites. On the right is the octagonal iron rostrum, followed by a section of graves in straight lines. The pathway begins a gentle curve leading to a tall flagpole with large U.S. flag an a black and white POW/MIA flag. As the path curve the graves become more of a circular pattern rather than the straight lines on the edges. A variety of trees are scattered throughout amongst the headstones. A red brick wall marks the boundary.",

Prelude to Petersburg 1864 overland campaign On May 4th 1864, the federal army crossed the Rapidan River 20 miles west Fredericksburg. The next day Confederate General Robert E Lee's forces struck the union army at the Wilderness opening a month-long campaign of nearly nonstop fighting and staggering casualty totals. After the Wilderness, Lee attempted to block Union General Ulysses S. Grant’s southward drive toward Richmond at Spotsylvania Court House then along the North Anna River, again at Topotomoy Creek, and finally at Cold Harbor just eight miles from Richmond. At Cold Harbor Grant’s headlong assaults into Lee’s lines on June 1 and June 3 failed. Undaunted he marched his army South to Petersburg and began the long process of cutting Richmond's supply lines Map of Eastern Virginia with a series of red and blue arrows that meet up at the different battle locations. Wilderness May 5-6 The fighting in the thick woods West of Fredericksburg produced nearly 30,000 casualties but no clear winner. Spotsylvania Court House May 8-21 Grant ignored the indecisive results of wilderness and pressed southward. Lee blocked him here and for two weeks close to 200,000 men fought for an advantage North Anna River May 23-26 and Topotomoy Creek May 28-30 These two engagements forced Grant to continue moving to Lee’s right as the union forces searched for a way to capture Richmond. Cold Harbor May 31 -June 12 Major attacks on the Confederate lines bring the total number of casualties to around 90,000 men in six weeks of fighting. Grant's failure here turns his attention to Petersburg ending the overland portion of the 1864 campaign. The sign on the left.

The rivers are wide and on the other side, the land is covered in trees with a few small buildings to see. There are two interpretive waysides next to each other, both waysides have a black band on top, with the National Park Service arrowhead in the top right corner. The text is all in black and the background of both panels is a light tan color. The panel on the left reads, “Resistance and Punishments. Prior to the Civil War, Dr. Eppes commanded his sales to not get drunk, steal, commit adultery, damage property, nor attack him, the overseers, or each other. The enslaved people resisted by stealing, feigning illness, breaking tools, and at least one slave fought an overseer. In an attempt to make his laborers follow the rules, Eppes commonly took away his slaves’ ability to leave the plantation or he decreased their food allotment. He and his overseers whipped those who resisted and had slaves whip each other as punishment for fighting or stealing from one another. Eppes sold a man named Bins in 1859 for his continued resistance. Though none of the slaves here tried to escape before the war, between May and August of 1862, 106 of Eppes’ 122 slaves escaped. Of the escaped slaves, at least four served in the Federal Navy during the war and at least two others served in United States Colored Troop regiments by war’s end.” On the left under the text is a photo of an enslaved person looking away from the camera, with multiple whipping scares on their back. Underneath the text in the middle is a quote in bold letters that states, “Patience and Dilsy received a few blows for laziness, by Richard Eppes on June 18, 1858”. The last photo on the right is a drawing of an enslaver whipping an enslaved woman who is tied with her hands up on a pole. The caption reads “From a slave narrative published in 1858”. The panel on the right is titled “Beyond the Big House”. “By 1860, Richard Eppes owned 2,300 acres divided into four farms on all sides of the confluence of these two rivers and held 113 people as slaves ranging in age from a few months old to 79 years old. He hired two men as overseers and one free black man before the Civil War. Enslaved field hands planted, tended, and harvested wheat, corn, and oats; they also fished, slaughtered livestock, picked fruit, and did other jobs that generated income for the Eppes family. Eppes’ skilled enslaved men worked as carpenters, blacksmiths, and sawyers. One enslaved woman was a weaver, and another was a midwife. The enslaved community worked on Eppes’ Bermuda Hundred farm (across the Appomattox River where the factory is), on Eppes’ Island to the east (across the James River), and south of here at the Appomattox and Hopewell farms. Only the island remains undeveloped today”. To the write of the text is a drawing of a map showing the different farms of the Eppes’ family as was described in the text. Beneath the text is a drawing of enslaved people stacking wheat and using ox to pull flat wagons. It is titled “Culpeper, VA, Stacking wheat by Edwin Forbes (LOC)”.",

Our throwing up works and taking position were simply general matters of military precaution.” Major General Fitzhugh Lee, CSA Main body text reads You are standing on the left (east flank) of the confederate line at Five Forks. Here the earthworks turned abruptly northward, forming angle. Few of the 1000 North Carolinians gathered behind these trenches on the afternoon of April 1, 1865, expected an attack. Neither did their commander, Major General George Pickett, who had retired to the rear for a lunch of shad. At 4:15 p.m., Major General Gouverneur K. Warren’s Union Fifth Corps swarmed across what were open fields to your right. While two Federal divisions moved too far north and missed the confederate line altogether. One division of 3,100 men struck the Confederates here. Brigadier General Matthew Ransom's North Carolina brigade resisted fiercely. But the federals rolled forward and vaulted the works.

Second Wayside Quote across top reads: “My command had to lament the loss of some of its bravest and best…” General Charles Griffin. As union general Romeny Ayres Finished aligning his men, about 4:15 PM on April 1st, 1865, near the Gravelly Run Methodist Episcopal Church the order was given for the division two attack. Generals Philip Sheridan. Gouverneur Warren, and Colonel Horace Porter of General Grant’s staff road at the front of the line. Union skirmishers drove in the Confederate outposts. Ayres was told by a staff officer that there were indications of enemy to the left. Ayres alerted his reserve brigade bereft Brigadier General Frederick Winthrop to be ready to bring his brigade forward. Confederate General Matthew Ransom’s brigade began to fire on Ayers’s division after they crossed White Oak Road. Warren later recalled that Ransom's brigade was in a thick belt of woods, which disrupted their aim and reduced initial union casualties. Ayres realized the situation and changed this front to the left to face the return of the southerner’s line. The movement opened a space in the line which Ayres fill filled with Winthrop’s brigade. Ayres‘s men faltered briefly when they became exposed Two closer more accurate firing from Ransom’s brigade. Sheridan rode along the battle line shouting encouragement. Sheridan and Ayres and his officers managed to quickly get the troops under control and ordered them forward again. Ayres's men would take the position, key to the entire confederate line, over 1000 prisoners and eight battle flags but among the union casualties was general Winthrop who was mortally wounded.

The thumb of his left hand is tucked in his belt. Text reads: Born on August 3rd, 1893, in New York City, the 25-year-old Winthrop would be taken back to Gravelly Run church, which was now transformed into a field hospital. It was there he succumbed to his wounds. His body was transported back to New York for burial at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, Kings County, New York. From his April 13, 1865, obituary in the New York Times. “From private in the ranks to General commanding a brigade, his record has been stainless. Participating in all the principal battles fought in the East, his conduct and each was worthy of the man who in the heat of battle could die as he did in an act of quiet heroism and noble self-sacrifice. He was a splendid soldier, skillful, gallant, cool, and accomplished. But those who knew him simply as a soldier were ignorant other things that most endeared him to a multitude of friends. How many who served with him in the army of the Potomac or who met him in his brief intervals of recreation will mournfully remember his kind genial manner, his love of pleasure, his frank hearted hearing and gentle courtesy in act and word, long after the victory which his name is connected shall have become a tradition in the land.",

    "audioDescription": "Wayside 1 “Hold Five Forks at all hazards…” General R.E. Lee Confederate General George Pickett’s infantry and General Fitzhugh Lee’s cavalry were ordered to protect the last remaining supply line, the South Side Railroad, coming in to Petersburg. The infantry dug a line of entrenchments along White Oak Road through this intersection of muddy roads to help in the defense. A numerically superior force of Union infantry and cavalry under the command of General Philip Sheridan approached from the south and focused their attack on control of the Five Forks road network. In the last few remaining hours of daylight on April 1, 1865 the Federal troops were able to envelop both ends of the southern line. Faced with being completely surrounded the Confederates were forced to retreat. Several thousand of the infantry were captured as others fled unceremoniously from the battlefield leaving behind the dream of protecting the railroad and Petersburg.

Pegram tended to his artillery: three guns in this field, three others further west (your right). Then came the Federals. Sheridan’s dismounted cavalry attacked frontally. Later Warren’s infantry swept down from the east. After fierce fighting, the Confederate positions around the intersection collapsed. In the melee fell Colonel Pegram, mortally wounded in the side. Just 23 years old, Pegram had survived all of the Army of Northern Virginia's major battles. He died only five miles from his ancestral home and just nine days short of the war's end. Caption Colonel William R.J. Pegram “the boy Colonel” whom one man described as “the most splendid soldier in all the world.” Another considered him “one of the few men who, I believe was supremely happy in battle.” Pegram fell near this spot he died the next day at Ford's depot 10 miles to the northwest.

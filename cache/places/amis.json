To the left of the doors are site bulletins and park maps, also called unigrids. Inside the doors, the staffed welcome desk is to the left, a sofa with bookshelves and coffee table in a nook beyond the desk, and restrooms to the back and left corner with the women's restroom in left corner. There are drinking fountains, one wheelchair or child height (left) and one standard height (right) with water battle filling station built in. The men's restroom is to the right of the drinking fountain, and right of that is a vertical display with various photos that protrudes from the wall into the floor space about 10 feet or more. Around the display is a 3/4s size image of cave paintings at Panther Cave and display cabinets along the wall and in the floor space of ancient Lower Pecos inhabitant replicas. Further into the floorspace are books and other souvenirs in the bookstore. The final thing along the back wall in the right corner of the room is the door to the theater; you will need to ask the desk attendant to start one of the park films for you. The films are fully ADA-compliant, but you may need to ask the attendant to set audio descriptions, if needed. Other informative displays are along the remaining wall.",

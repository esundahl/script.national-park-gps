    "bodyText": "<p>This monument was originally located closer to the tip of this peninsula and is dedicated to Lt. Colonel George Armistead:<br /> <br /> Born on April 10, 1780, in Caroline County, Virginia, George was one of five brothers, all of whom later served in the War of 1812. On May 18, 1813, while serving as an artillery officer at Fort Niagara, New York, he took an active part in the American attack on Fort George across the Niagara River in upper Canada and was accorded the honor of delivering the captured British flags to President James Madison. On his taking command of Fort McHenry in June 1813, Armistead ordered a flag made \"so large that the British will have no difficulty in seeing it from a distance.\"<br /> <br /> He earned his enduring place in American history under that flag at Fort McHenry whose stalwart defense of Baltimore against British attack in 1814 inspired Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Armistead remained in command of the fort until his untimely death at age 38 on April 25, 1818. He is buried in Old St. Paul's Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland.</p>",

Today this is Patterson Park, but in 1814 this was known as Hampstead Hill. It was there that American soldiers, militia, and citizens came together to dig large earthworks and a force of 15,000 troops stood in the way of 5,000 British soldiers on their way to burn Baltimore. It was the defenses of Hampstead Hill that forced the British Navy to attack Fort McHenry in order to attempt to get into the Baltimore harbor. <br /> <br /> In additon Francis Scott Key's position while observing the battle is out on the river about three miles from the location of this bastion.

It was completed in 1864 and could hold up to 1,500 barrels of powder.<br /> <br /> By the time the Civil War came to Fort McHenry, it was no longer readily prepared for war. Improvements were quickly made, including expanding the existing powder storage. The bombproof casements in the sallyport were expanded to hold powder, but an officer was worried about having large amounts of powder stored in a frequently used area where smoking was common. Thus, a Powder Magazine outside of the fort was contracted in 1863 and completed in 1864. The brick-vaulted magazine could hold up to 1,500 barrels of powder. <br /> <br /> The Civil War powsder magazine is not open for the public to go inside, however visitors can access the outside of the structure by following the seawall trail toward the large Orpheus Statue. From the statue take the small path that branches off of the main seawall trail. Next to the building is a small interpretive sign as well as a picnic area. ",

    "bodyText": "<p>During the War of 1812, the people of Baltimore believed that the British would attack the city. Not knowing for sure when an attack would occur, they spent months preparing for it. Everything was made ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore.<br /> <br /> Major George Armistead, the Fort’s commanding officer, desired \"to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty in seeing it from a distance.\"<br /> <br /> In the summer of 1813, Armistead ordered a large garrison flag (30 feet by 42 feet) as well as with a smaller storm flag (17 feet by 25 feet) for the Fort. The job went out to a 37-year-old widow, Mary Pickersgill, a ship and signal flag maker. She labored for seven weeks with her 13-year-old daughter, Caroline, two nieces, 13-year-old Eliza Young and 15-year-old Margaret Young, a 13-year-old African-American indentured servant, Grace Wisher, and possibly her mother, Rebecca Young, who had taught her the trade. They pieced together strips of loosely woven English wool bunting then laid the whole flag out on the expansive floor of a brewery near Mrs. Pickersgill’s Pratt Street house, now the Star-Spangled Banner House museum. The flags were finished on August 19, 1813.<br /> <br /> The larger of the two flags had stripes two feet wide, and stars 24 inches from point to point. At that time, it was the practice to add one star and stripe for each new state joining the Union. In 1814, the United States flag had 15 stars and 15 stripes.<br /> <br /> The 30' x 42' flag was the one that Francis Scott Key saw on the morning of September 14, 1814. It inspired him to write the words to \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Today this flag is displayed in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C. The smaller storm flag, which many historians believe was the flag that flew during the rainy bombardment, has been lost to history.</p>",

There are rope lines at the front and back of the pole. The base of the pole has a stage. On the pole various sizes of the historic Star-Spangled Banner flag or modern day President's flag fly depending on the weather and time of day.",

A national competition was held by the “Fine Arts Commission” on May 28, 1916. One of the 34 entries was a design by Charles H. Niehaus. His work, called Orpheus with the Awkward Foot was chosen.<br /> <br /> There was a delay erecting the statue due to World War I. Finally, the statue was completed and a dedication was held on Flag Day, June, 14, 1922. The ceremony was attended by President Warren G. Harding.<br /> <br /> The statue was originally placed in the middle of the entrance road with a circular drive around it. In 1962, Orpheus was relocated to the present site.<br /> <br /> The monument consists of a 15-foot high circular base made of white marble. Decorated with a frieze in low relief, the base is surmounted by a 24-foot high figure of Orpheus in bronze, shown playing a five-stringed tortoise-shell lyre. The frieze starts with a portrait shield of Key and the dedication, then continues around the drum of the base with a representation of the classic muses paying honor to the army and navy.<br /> <br /> The marble base bears a medallion honoring Francis Scott Key, flanked by a procession of allegorical figures. The pedestal contains a time capsule filled with documents of patriotic and historical interest. Although the time capsule was opened in 1962, there are no plans to open it in the future.<br /> <br /> The inscription on the base reads:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>To Francis Scott Key - Author of the Star Spangled Banner and to the soldiers and sailors who took part in the Battle of North Point and the defense of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812.</em></p> <p><br />  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Fort McHenry outer battery first began to see its modern shape come to fruition in the 1840's when improvements were made to the fort's defenses. The outer battery is one of the aspects that gives the fort more of an appearance for how it would have looked during the Civil War, rather than the War of 1812. Originally the battery was outfitted with large Columbiad guns meant for coastal defense. In 1866 the military began replacing these guns with the larger Rodman guns. Fort McHenry boasts the largest collection Rodman cannons with a collection of 8, 10, and 15 inch guns. The Rodmans are no longer active with their last firings occuring on June 30, 1903. <br /> <br /> In visiting the outer battery visitors can get quite a view, and a first hand visit into history. Brick paths allow visitors to walk in the outer defenses between the walls of the original fort and the earthen mounds, as well as on top of the outer battery walls. Some powder magazines are still open for visitors to enter and explore. Not to mention you can get up close and personal with original, massive, Rodman cannons that are over 150 years old!</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The outer battery is located just outside the walls of the original star fort structure, between the star fort and the Patapsco river. the outer defenses of the battery (facing the river) are large earthen mounds, reinforced by brick walls on the side that faces the star fort. the outer walls have a brick path on top of them that allows visitors to walk along them, as well as several underground powder magazines, of which one is open for the public to enter. Up against the outer batter walls are several large Rodman cannons, original to the site, that face towards the water. Between the cannon and the fort is a brick path that allows visitors to walk in the outer battery area.",

    "bodyText": "The star fort structure was completed in 1803 and named after James McHenry, Washington's Secretary of War and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The fort was constructed to defend Baltimore's harbor that sits just about 2 miles to the north west. This structure, as well as water batteries that would have surrounded it, is what stood between the British Navy and being able to support their ground forces in the possible burning of Baltimore in 1814 during the War of 1812. The British Navy Bombarded this fort for 25 hours but was unable to remove the defenders from its wall, forcing their invading forces to withdraw and saving the City of Baltimore from destruction. This event inspired Francis Scott Key to write the Star-Spangled Banner, today's National Anthem.<br /> <br /> The fort remained active beyond its War of 1812 fame. Today the fort most resembles its Civil War era appearance with the inner buildings being built up to two stories, and an outer battery area featuring Rodman cannons dating to the 1860's. The Civil War period found the fort acting as prison for both prisoners of war, and political prisoners who threatened Maryland's possible secession. The fort's busiest time period was during the First World War where it was the centerpiece of a 3,000 bed hospital that was built up on the grounds surrounding it. Shortly after the First World War the fort was removed from active military use, although it was recalled into action during the Second World War as a Coast Guard training facility.<br /> <br /> As you enter the fort explore the various rooms in the buildings that tell the many stories of the fort's long history. Follow paths on top of the ramparts and outer battery that provide scenic and historic view sheds. And take a step back in time with interpretive programs that occur regularly. ",
    "audioDescription": "When entering the star fort historic zone there is a brick path that leads into the area. It forks and to the left it leads to the outer battery, a region with large earth and brick mounds and large historic cannons. To the right the path leads into the brick structure that is the star fort. Inside the star fort are five buildings that are open to be explored. There is also the large 90 foot tall flag pole.",

The batteries also featured a brick hot shot furnaces.</p>   <p>These water batteries were charged with keeping the British ships at bay, and had a range of a mile and a half. When the British ships reached what Armistead believed to be \"good striking distance,\" he ordered \"fire to be opened, which was obeyed with alacrity\" with \"a roar that shook the whole harbor...\" and within half-an-hour the \"intruders again sheltered themselves by withdrawing beyond our reach.\" The garrison \"gave three cheers and again ceased firing.\" The British ships \"continued throwing shells,\" at the forts and batteries.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The reconstructed water battery has a wooden deck that has a wooden wall in front of it. the wall is built into an earth mound. The wall and mound have four openings for guns to to be placed. There are four large iron guns on wheels with ropes and pully systems attached to them. Seasonally there are also reconstructed cannon balls and artillery implements out on display.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Blossoming cherry trees are a welcome sight for visitors each spring at Fort McHenry on the banks of the Potomac River. These trees were planted in 1931 by 1,500 Baltimore school children to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of George Washington’s birth.<br /> <br /> Each of the 152 cherry trees were planted to represent a Baltimore public school. The schools were highly segregated at the time, and the groves reflect this segregation. The trees planted by the African American students were planted on the east side of the Fort while these trees were planted by white students. The cherry blossoms have been replanted over the years, and still bloom annually.<br /> <br /> Originally plans to establish these groves at Fort McHenry were proposed to attract visitors to Baltimore in the same vein as the popular cherry trees that were planted around the Potomac Park Tidal Basin in Washington D.C. in 1912. Today visitors are invited to walk among these beautiful trees each spring to experience the rebirth of the season.</p>",

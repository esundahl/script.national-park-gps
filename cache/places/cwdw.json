    "bodyText": "<p>The sheer immensity of the two Rodman guns at Fort Foote made them objects of curiosity wehn they were first brought to the Fort. Visitors frequently came to see them. The 15-inch Rodmans weigh about 49,000 pounds, and required 300 to 400 soldiers to move them up the bluff from river to fort. The balls fired by the smooth-bore Rodmans weigh 500 to 600 pounds and took about fifty pounds of black powder, a type of gunpowder.</p> <p>It was a special occasion each time the big guns were fired. On February 27, 1864, three shots were fired from the 15-inch Rodman. Crowds of visitors beheld the occasion. Again, on April 1, 1864, a large party from Washington came to witness the workings of the big guns. The Rodman was fired at a 25-degree elevation at a range of three miles. Because the guns put off an intense concussive force, it was noted that observers would raise their toes and open their mouths to lessen the effects.<br /> The cannon closest to the river is of particular importance. Engraved on its 15-inch muzzle is 'No. 1' and the initials 'TJR'. The 'No 1' is in reference to the fact that this cannon was the first produced by Cyrus Alger and Company. The initials are of the individual who inspected the gun, in this case Brigadier General Thomas J. Rodman who also designed the weapon. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Spaced about 70 yards apart two massive cannons point out over the water. Each cannon is roughly 12 ft long and is mounted on a large metal base which raises it to about 15 ft high. The barrel of the cannon is 15 in in diameter. Both Canon and base are painted black. This rests on a half circle mounts made of stone and metal.",

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. </p>",

Engraved at the top it reads: ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN AT THE DEDICATION OF THE GETTYSBURG NATIONAL CEMETERY NOVEMBER 19, 1863. Text of the Gettysburg address is in the main content. Directly back seventy feet to the east from the Cemetery entrance is a central flagpole, surrounded by forty-one one-foot tall marble headstones. Set behind is a thirty-foot wide white marble rostrum with eight columns. END OF DESCRIPTION",

A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location. Lined in front to the north are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One six-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />Set in the grassy hill, equidistant between the two cannons and back to the south about thirty feet, is a bronze plaque atop a cement block. The cement base is about five-feet wide, four-feet deep, and three-feet tall. The bronze plaque measures three by three feet. It features a bas-relief of the fort design as viewed from above, detailing its walls, borders, bunkers and cannon platforms. In the upper right corner is a compass rose.<br />The lower left corner is inscribed to read:<br />Dedicated September 1936<br />In the Memory of<br />The Grand Army of the Republic<br />by the<br />Daughters of Union Veterans<br />of the<br />Civil War<br />1861-1865<br />An inscription in the lower right corner reads:<br />Scale Model of Fort Stevens<br />A measurement ruler is etched below.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Colonel Barton S. Alexander, Chief Engineer of the Defenses of Washington, placed it among the second class of fortifications for purposes of retention in 1865. He believed that it occupied a position, \"Which must be held when the city is threatened by a land attack.\"</p> <p>The work was completed in 1864 and had 12 gun emplacements. Eleven of them were empty, and a single 24-pounder siege gun mounted and set in position (en barbette) was the fort's sole armament.</p> <p>Fort Chaplin had a perimeter of about 225 yards, and was built at the altitude of approximately 180 feet. There were no buildings at the site when the army turned it over to the original land owner, Selby B. Scaggs, in the summer of 1865.</p> <p><span>Fort Chaplin is named after Col. Daniel Chaplin.

It was built originally in the shape of a trapezium, armed with 7 guns, and afterwards expanded to mount 11 guns and mortars, including a massive 100-pounder Parrott rifle located at reshaped northeastern angle</p> <p>The fort was heavily engaged during the Battle of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-stevens.htm\">Fort Stevens</a> on July 11-12, 1864. Fort DeRussy's provided battery support to Fort Stevens to the northeast and also engaged rebel infantry north of the Defenses of Washington.. Altogether, Fort DeRussy had 11 guns and mortars which fired a total of 109 rounds to aid in the defense of Fort Stevens. Its 100-pounder Parrott rifle was the largest piece of artillery in the engagement, and was very effective in checking the Confederates' advance. It had a range that reached nearly all the way to Silver Spring, Maryland, and could destroy large bodies of troops.</p> <p>Fort DeRussy is in a good state of preservation. The parapet which consists of high earth mounds with openings where guns were mounted, and the deep ditch (dry moat) around the parapet, remain in clear and distinct outline. Also, there is visible evidence of where the powder magazines were located inside the fort. Near the fort, on the outside, well-defined rifle trenches extend in each direction.<br />  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fodu/index.htm\">Fort Dupont</a> was erected as part of the Eastern Branch Line Defenses (Anacostia River). Constructiobn commenced between Ocotober and December of 1861, and \"completed\" in the spring of 1862. The fort was built to protect a critical Ridge<br /> Road (Alabama Avenue) intersection and was supported by Forts Meigs and Chaplin to the north and Fort Davis to the south.<br /> <br /> Fort DuPont was a regular hexagonal redoubt, designed for 14 guns, 12<br /> firing through embrasures. Fort Dupont had six sides, each 100 feet long, protected by a deep moat and trees felled side-by-side with branches pointing outward. It was named for Flag Officer Samuel F. Dupont, who commanded the naval victory at Port Royal, South Carolina, in November 1861.<br /> <br /> It was never a strong work and in 1862, a commission studying the Defenses of Washington noted that a deep ravine to the west of the fort should be covered by a blockhouse. At other times, traverses to cover the sally port, magazine and rifle pits to the cover approaches were recommended.</p> <p>In April 1864, Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer, advised the abandonment of Fort Dupont. The army officially abandoned the fort in 1865. The grounds reverted to its original landowner, Michael Caton. </p> <p>Although its garrison and guns never saw battle, Fort Dupont served as a lifeline of freedom. Runaway slaves found safety here before moving on to join the growing community of \"contrabands\" in Washington. The barracks and guns are gone, but the fort's earthworks can still be traced near the picnic area on Alabama Avenue.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the National Capital Planning Commission acquired the old fort and surrounding land for recreation. A golf course was constructed and as the city grew, golf gave way in 1970 to the sports complex along Ely Place that now includes tennis and basketball courts, athletic fields, a softball diamond, and an indoor ice rink.  Once where soldiers viewed farmlands, park visitors now grow fruits and vegetables in the community garden.</p>",

The commision evaluated each of the forts, and made recommendations for improvement. Toward the end of the account, one gap was noted in the defensive arrangement:</span></p> <p>\"The commission furthers their opinion that the Defense of Washington cannot be considered complete without the defense of the river against an enemy's armed vessels. Foreign intervention would bring against us always in superior naval force on the Potomac, and we are, even now, threatened with Confederate iron-clads fitted in English Ports. The Commission believe on Jones' Point near Alexandria, a battery of six guns of the heaviest caliber, say four 200-pounders and two 15-inch guns in casements, and by constructing a battery of ten guns and a covering work on the opposite shore of the Potomac, at the near Roziers Bluff. An examination had been made, revealing a most favorable and strong position on that side, easily communicated with by water. Surveys are in progress.\"</p> <p>The suggestion of the committee was accepted, and the work on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fofo/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Fort Foote</a> began at Rozier's Bluff in 1863. </p> <p>The grand earthwork was first constructed in 1863 by the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, commanded by Colonel William Seward, Jr. The site, together with Battery Rodgers in Alexandria, Virginia, was designed for river defense. Their massive 15-inch Rodman guns (Columbiads) and 200-pounder Parrott rifles possessed the firepower to penetrate enemy ironclad ships. The Federal engineers had perfected earthwork construction around Washington D.C. by this point in the war. Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer Defenses of Washington, described the two sites as \"model works.\"Fort Foote was named in honor of Rear Admiral Andrew H. Foote, who distinguished himself in the actions against the confederate forts on the Mississippi Rivers and died of wounds on June 26,1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote's guns became a tourist attraction for government officials, military officers, and well-connect civilians, who traveled on river transports from the city to the Maryland shoreline to see the 49,000 lbs Rodmans test fired. General Barnard invited President Abraham Lincoln to visit the fort in late 1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote remained an active military installation until 1874. The U.S. Army performed a number of tests and experiments with cannons, carriages, and stone magazines at the site. <br /> <br />  </p> <p><span> </span></p>",

The earthwork was built to guard the approaches to Benning's Bridge, which crosses the Anacostia River.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was irregularly shaped with nine sides, and a perimeter of 354 yards. This fort was located less than mile east of Benning's Bridge and commanded the approaches to the bridge from Bladensburg via the Eastern Branch Road, and from Upper Marlboro by way of Benning Road.</p> <p>Over the next four years it underwent extensive repair and modification. The major problem with the fort was that it sat atop a rounded hill, and approaches to it were not visible from the parapet. To fix this problem 400 yards of rifle pits were constructed to cover its approaches. Structures were built that would provide a full range on which to attack oncoming troops (bastionets). These structures were projected from three angles of the exterior slope of the ditch (counterscarp) to provide reverse and covering fire for the exterior slopes. After Early's raid in 1864, the engineers laid abatis and constructed rifle trenches toward Anacostia River in order to prevent a flanking movement from that side.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was one of the later forts to be abandoned. At the end of the Civil War, Fort Mahan was named among the 11 works that occupied commanding positions and should be retained for a skeleton defense of the city. However, it was abandoned and reverted back to the Manning family. Mary Manning claimed damages in 1864, and in 1865 bought the abatis around the fort for $31 at public auction.</p> <p>Structures that were built at Fort Mahan included a guard house, at least two barracks, officers' quarters, a mess house, stables and some sheds.</p> <p><span>Fort Mahan was named after Dennis Hart Mahan. who was an American soldier and educator. In 1824, he graduated from West Point. He taught taught civil and military engineering at the Military Academy, and became an authority on military engineering. His works include: Complete Treatise on Field Fortifications (1836), Summary on the Cause of Permanent Fortifications and of the Attack and Defense of Permanent Works (1850), and An Elementary Course of Military Engineering (2 vol., 1866–67). </span></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gwmp/planyourvisit/fortmarcy.htm\">Fort Marcy</a> and nearby Fort Ethan Allen, among other batteries on the northern bank of the Potomac River, were built to protect Leesburg Pike and Chain Bridge. Construction began in 1861. When Fort Marcy was completed, it had a perimeter of 338 feet and mounted 18 guns, a 10-inch mortar and two 24-pounder Coehorn mortars.</p> <p>The hill on which the fort is located was known as Prospect Hill. Originally the fort was called Fort W.F. Smith after Major General William F. Smith, the troops of whose division began construction of the work. His division crossed Chain Bridge on the night of September 24, 1861, and immediately commenced construction of Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen. The 79th New York Highlanders, the 141st Pennsylvania and the Iron Brigade also helped complete the work in the fall of 1862. A force of about 500 contrabands were employed. The 152nd New York worked on the entrenchments, which are still in a very good state of preservation. The site of Fort Marcy is near the location where the famous, but bloodless duel between Henry Clay and John Randolph was fought in 1826.</p> <p>The fort was not entirely completed until the fall of 1862. It is a relatively undisturbed fort and was named in honor of a native of Massachusetts, the Honorable Randolph B. Marcy, a distinguished soldier, father-in-law, and Chief of Staff to Gen. George B. McClellan. Detachments of the 4th New York Heavy Artillery, 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and the 130th Pennsylvania infantry were among the troops that performed garrison duty here during the war. An interesting incident of history is that the body of troops, which afterwards became famous, and the \"Iron Brigade\" was originated at this fort in the summer of 1861. It was composed of the 19th Indiana, the 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin Regiments. The 24th Michigan was added to the brigade soon after the battle of South Mountain. These regulars remained together until the close of the war.</p> <p>After the Civil War ended Fort Marcy was returned to its original owners, the Vanderwerken family. The land remained in the Vanderwerken family until after World War II, when the DeLashmutt family purchased the property.</p> <p><span>\"</span>Thoughts on Fort Marcy,<span>\" is a poem written by Lillian Money-Read that was published in the </span><em>The Washington Post</em><span>, April 12, 1936. The poem is an eloquent tribute to not only Fort Marcy, <span>but the other forts in the Defenses of Washington system that have, over time, been covered by deciduous forests of American elm, yellow-poplar, and white ash. <span>Today these remnant earthworks</span><span> are a silent reminder of the protective shield that surrounded the nation’s capital during the Civil War years. </span></span></span></p> <p align=\"left\"><strong> </strong></p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Thoughts on Fort Marcy </strong>by Lillian Money-Read:</p> <p align=\"left\">The woodland drips with sun-warmed April rain,<br /> The trees are colorful with new–oped leaves,<br /> With half-blown buds the dogwood trees are snowed,<br /> The maple-tassels, green with scarlet cleaves.</p> <p align=\"left\">May apple flings its sweetness on the air,<br /> Translucent stemmed, the big dark violet<br /> And pied spring beauty, bride of early morn<br /> Bloom in the vivid moss with shy bluet.</p> <p align=\"left\">My dog bounds down and leaves a darkened trail<br /> Along the silvered hillside, wild with mirth,<br /> His mouth is spread, his limpid eyes a-shine,<br /> His muzzle wet with brown, sweet-smelling earth.</p> <p align=\"left\">On fair Fort Marcy, thus I dream today.<br /> And hear the swollen creek rush to the river,<br /> With muffled roar like a dreadful battle din<br /> Which made, of old, these frightened forests shiver!</p> <p align=\"left\">Ah, bright the ferns that clothe these silent moats,<br /> And sweet the lanes where walked the sentinel,<br /> Yet scarce a flower springs on this haunted ground<br /> But marks the place where some young soldier fell!</p> <p><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Reno was originally named Fort Pennsylvania, and was built during the winter of 1861 shortly after the disastrous defeat of the Union Army at the First Battle of Manassas. Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard, Col. of Engineers, U.S. Army, was in charge of construction of the defenses around Washington. Barnard chose the location of Fort Reno for its strategic importance in guarding the Rockville Pike (present day Wisconsin Avenue). Being the highest elevation in the city (429 feet above sea level), Fort Reno also served as a forward outpost and signal station for detecting enemy movement near the northern part of the city.</p> <p>Constructed by the 119th Pennsylvania Regiment, the fort's name was later changed to Fort Reno in 1863 in memory of Major General Jesse Lee Reno, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of South Mountain, September 14, 1862. <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Originally rather small, Fort Reno was enlarged and strengthened with an advanced battery 300 yards north from the highest ridge, across from what is now Fessenden Street and along 39th Street. This advanced battery had eight 12-pounder guns and a magazine, a covered walkway connected it to the main fort to the south. A double line of rifle trenches was added to strengthen the position.</span></p> <p>Eventually, the fort was the largest and strongest of those defending the capital with a dozen heavy guns, three Parrott siege guns and nine 27-pounder barbette guns. A strength of three thousand men of the First Brigade made Fort Reno the stronghold of the northern defenses of the capital.</p> <p>In July 1864, due to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's insistence that troops be moved from the defenses to reinforce his army at Petersburg, Fort Reno was under-manned, as were all of the defenses around the city. Hearing from spies that the capital was poorly defended, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Gen. Jubal A. Early to attack from the north. Around noon Monday, July 11, 1864 (before the Battle of Fort Stevens), Fort Reno was the first of the defenses to view Early's advance near Rockville, Maryland. The lookouts from the signal tower at Fort Reno saw clouds of dust, and then Confederate army wagons moving toward the city.</p> <p>During Early's assault of Fort Stevens on July 11th and 12th, 1864, the heavy guns of Fort Reno lent little support value, as there was a fear the long range guns would hit the Union Army's advanced pickets. One of the shells that was fired from Fort Reno by a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle traveled 3.5 miles north of the fort, killing four Confederates where the present day Bethesda Naval Hospital is located in Bethesda, Maryland. Due to Fort Stevens being reinforced on July 12, 1864, it was never taken by the Confederate army, nor was the capital city ever reached.</p> <p>During the fighting of July 10-12, 1864, small squadrons of soldiers from Forts Reno and Stevens had advanced into the countryside north of the city to fend off the invaders. A few Confederates were taken prisoner and brought back to camps where they were held until transfer to a central prison. Early's army retreated back across the Potomac River near Leesburg, Virginia, and Washington breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>After the close of the war, the forts (Reno included) were slowly dismantled and abandoned. Most of Fort Reno could be seen as late as 1892, but the fort and battery at the north end were eventually graded down for the construction of a water reservoir. Today the site is bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Fessenden Street, Belt Road, and Chesapeake Street, NW.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Stevens, now partially restored, was built to defend the approaches to Washington from the 7th Street Pike (now Georgia Avenue) which was then the main thoroughfare from the north into Washington. Originally called Fort Massachusetts by the soldiers from that state who constructed the fort, it was later named after Brig. Gen. Isaac Ingalls Stevens, who was killed at the Battle of Chantilly (Ox Hill), Virginia, September 1, 1862.<br /> <br /> By the summer of 1864, the great bulk of Union troops in the east were engaged in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/index.htm\">siege operations around Petersburg, Virginia</a>. In fact, when Ulysses S. Grant moved south in the Spring of 1864, he stripped Washington, DC, of many well trained troops to add weight to his offensive. As a result, in July of 1864, there were only 9,000 troops to defend the city, down from over 23,000 the year before. Those that were left were primarily poorly trained reserves. Robert E. Lee was desperate to reduce the pressure on his forces around Petersburg, and so decided to send General Jubal A. Early and about 20,000 troops to strike at Washington which spies had reported was poorly defended.<br /> <br /> On June 12, Early began his march north from Petersburg and by July 9, was at Frederick, Maryland, where he demanded and received $200,000 to spare the city. On the same day, Early <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/index.htm\">defeated Union Gen. Lew Wallace at the Monocacy River</a>. In the light of later events, Wallace's defeat after a stubborn fight became a victory for the Union because he was able to delay Early's advance for a day. On July 10, Early encamped at Rockville, Maryland, only 10 miles from Fort Stevens.<br /> <br /> Reacting to this threat to Washington, Grant ordering the 1st and d 2nd Divisions of the 6th Corps and part of 19th Corps to the capital on July 7. The veteran units reached Fort Stevens arrived off the Potomac River around noon on July 11 as Jubal Early's lead elements advanced toward the capital.<br /> <br /> Over the following several days, Early probed Fort Stevens and its environs but never mounted a full-scale attack. Union reinforcements had reached Washington and Fort Stevens just in time.<br /> <br /> Located atop the parapet of Fort Stevens is a commemorative stone dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>. On July 12, 1864, the President stood atop the parapet to observe the fighting and came under fire from Confederate sharpshooters. It is the only time in American history in which a sitting president came under direct fire from an enemy combatant.<br /> <br /> In the years to come, many individuals would claim the honor of advising the President Lincoln to come down from the parapet. The most notable was a young officer named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. His remarks to the president were short and straightforward: \"Get down, you damn fool!\" Holmes would eventually serve as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902-1932.<br /> <br /> Each year, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cwdw/planyourvisit/anniversary-of-the-battle-of-fort-stevens.htm\">anniversary of the Battle of Fort Stevens</a> is commemorated with special programs, living history, and more.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(632 words)<br />Fort Stevens is located in the northern corner of Washington, DC, within the center of a block bordered by 13th Street, NW to the west, Georgia Avenue to the east, Rittenhouse Street to the north, and Quakenbos Street to the south.<br />The park area rises about thirty feet from street level at the northwest corner of 13th and Rittenhouse streets to the eastern end where the fort is situated. A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location. Lined in front to the north are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One six-foot tall hill to the west of the flagpole has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />About thirty feet behind and six feet to the right of the right cannon sits a two by three-foot wayside. The sign is titled in black letters in the upper left corner: Fort Stevens.<br />The left two thirds of the sign feature a color painting of a battle scene. Men in blue military uniforms stand in a fort on a hilltop around a cannon set on a wheeled turret. A man standing above in the top left corner wears a long black suit coat and black top hat. Below him a man holds an American flag. Two men carry a wounded soldier below, a man runs with a raised right arm and hand, and a man to the right stands while holding a white flag with a red and blue cross. A quote above the image reads: \"We haven't taken Washington, but we scared Abe Lincoln like hell!\" The quote is attributed to General Jubal Early.<br />Text in the bottom right reads:<br />Illustration of President Lincoln on the parapet of Fort Stevens<br />Text below describes the battle that took place at Fort Stevens:<br />Built between 1861-1863 this structure was originally called Fort Massachusetts and guarded the northern defenses of the nation's capital during the Civil War. On July 11-12, 1864 Fort Stevens defended the city from a Confederate attack under the command of General Jubal Anderson Early. During the battle, President Abraham Lincoln came under direct fire from Confederate sharpshooters while he witnessed the battle from the parapet of the fort. The Battle of Fort Stevens marks the only time in American history that a seated President came under fire from an enemy combatant during a time of war.<br />Fort Stevens was named after General Isaac Ingalls Stevens. General Stevens was killed on September 2, 1862 during the Battle of Chantilly, Virginia.<br />You can download a podcast of Fort Stevens at www.nps.com/rocr<br />The right third of the sign is a white panel. In the top left is a sketch of an older African American woman, sitting with a slight smile and hands clasped. Text to her right reads:<br />In order to construct Fort Stevens, the home of the original property owner, Elizabeth Thomas, was destroyed.<br />To the right is a QR code to scan for additional information about the Battle of Fort Stevens.<br />Below is a black and white image of about forty military soldiers posing in a fort for the camera To the right men stand among two cannons, and another four cannons line the fort behind them from a raised platform, pointed out over the tops of the forts walls. About twenty more soldiers stand and kneel on the left by a flagpole and amongst piles of cannonballs. Text beneath them reads:<br />3rd Massachusetts Heavy Artillery at Fort Stevens 1865<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>By the 1890s, Union veterans, civic leaders, and community members desired to preserve the remnants of the Defenses of Washington. The earthen citadels that encircled the capital had long been abandoned by Federal soldiers. Peace, posterity, and the ploughshare returned much of the landscape to its pre-war condition, including Fort Stevens, site of the famed battle in July 1864. Early preservation efforts included the installation of a sign marking the spot where President Abraham Lincoln was under fire on July 12, 1864.<br /> <br /> Fort Stevens' eroding earthworks were a lasting testament to the Defenses of Washington as the Brightwood neighborhood developed around it. <br /> <br /> As part of the McMillan Plan, a comprehensive planning document for the development of the monumental core and the park system of Washington, D.C (first written in 1902 by the Senate Park Commission), the proposed Fort Drive Parkway consisted of \"a new drive-way through the suburbs of Washington to be called 'Fort Drive,' and include in its winding ways some of the most important of the fortifications which served as the Defenses of Washington during the rebellion . . .\"<br /> <br /> Rapid urban expansion and budget restraints, including the First World War and Great Depression, affected the full development of the parkway; however the Federal government was able to acquire most of the Fort Drive right-of-way between 1929 and 1932, and the forts/batteries managed by the National Park Service today.<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) accomplished a great deal of work on the fort parks. The CCC established nine camps in the Washington D.C. area, including one, established on October 23, 1933, at Fort Dupont Park. The CCC activities at Fort Dupont included erecting buildings for workers to live and eat in, cleaning up foot and horse trails, performing minor road construction, putting in a sewer, and constructing a two-car garage, carpenter shop, and toilet room. The CCC also performed \"forest protection,\" including cleaning up dead and fallen lumber, burning brush, grubbing stumps, cleaning up the dump, and disposing of trash at forts Stanton, Bunker Hill and Mahan, and doing general cleanup at forts Totten and Foote. At Fort Stevens, the CCC undertook a restoration, reconstruction, and landscape project; costing $25,000. The workers rebuilt the western portion of the fort parapet, using cement \"falsies,\" as one author called them, \"instead of logs and planks,\" because they would last longer.<br /> <br /> The work at Fort Stevens was completed in 1938. It was the only fortification restoration project. Today, Fort Stevens Park is managed by the National Park Service (Rock Creek Park).</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(436 words)<br />Fort Stevens is located in the northern corner of Washington, DC, within the center of a block bordered by 13th Street, NW to the west, Georgia Avenue to the east, Rittenhouse Street to the north and Quakenbos Street to the south.<br />Two fifty-foot tall oak trees stand along the lower south end of the park at street level by 13th Street. The park area rises about thirty feet from street level at 13th and Rittenhouse Streets about two hundred yards to the eastern end where the fort is situated. A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front, to the north of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face. The bunker measures sixty feet across and twenty feet deep. The white door is about seven feet tall and six feet wide and has three metal brackets on the outer sides of each door. The doors overlap in the center. It is set on a cement base that appears to run back into the hill.<br />A cement bunker wall with three-inch-wide log-like vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons on wheels, set on cement platforms and directed out to the north. Five additional cement platforms are set on about three-foot tall grass mounds that lead up to the cement wall.<br />About six feet left of the left cannon, sitting on grass just beyond the cement bunker wall is a stone marker with a bronze plaque displayed on its face. The stone is about five feet tall, four feet wide, and two feet deep. The plaque measures about one and a half feet high by two feet wide. It features a bas-relief and is engraved across the top to read:<br />LINCOLN UNDER FIRE AT FORT STEVENS<br />July 12, 1864<br />The image below is a bas-relief of a man in the center with top hat and long suit coat tending to a wounded man on the right falling with his head thrown back. Another man tries to pull the man in top hat away from the left.

A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front to the east of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face. The bunker measures sixty feet across and twenty feet deep. The white door is about seven feet tall and six feet wide and has three metal brackets on the outer sides of each door. The doors overlap in the center. It is set on a cement base that appears to run back into the hill.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards (90 meters) across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with six three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(560 words)<br />Battleground National Cemetery is located in the Brightwood neighborhood of Washington, DC. The one-acre park is on the east side of Georgia avenue, NW between Whittier place to the north and Van Buren street to the south.<br />The Cemetery sits on a terrace approximately five feet above street level. A bluestone wall along the front edge is separated by two sets of three steps that lead up to a wrought-iron black gate at the Cemetery entrance. Set atop stone pillars on either side of the entrance are two six-foot long black cannons, one pointing north and one pointing south. On the face of the columns are black signs in the shape of a shield that both read in white: U.S. National Cemetery.<br />To the left about six feet from the front edge of the cemetery and set in a row across the lawn are four granite monuments, each between six and eleven-feet tall. To the right is a two-story red stone building with brown shutters and a gabled roof. A porch extends out on the west side of the building.<br />Directly back seventy feet from the entrance is a central flagpole, surrounded by forty-one marble headstones. Behind them and the east end of the Cemetery stands a white marble pavilion with four granite pillars.<br />Set to the right of the walkway about six feet from the top of the entrance steps is a two by three-foot wayside sign. Written across the top in black letters it is titled:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />The background of the entire sign is a black and white photograph of a small, one-story building with chimney, two windows on one side and one on another. A white picket fence runs behind the backside of the building. In front is a flagpole surrounded by white gravestones. Text in the lower right corner reads:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />Circa 1865-1870<br />Text in the bottom right corner reads:<br />You can download a podcast of Battleground National Cemetery at www.nps.gov/rocr<br />A smaller four by five-inch picture is set in the upper right corner. It shows a view from across the street at a two-story building set on a raised plot of land bordered by a stone brick wall in front. A staircase leads up through an opening in the wall. Monuments line the left front side of the property. A tall evergreen tree stands over the building, and other trees are set further back in the yard. Text written underneath reads:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />Circa 1930<br />Text written on the left side of the side describes the formation of Battleground National Cemetery:<br />During the late evening of July 12, 1864, 4o Union soldiers that perished while defending Washington, DC from a two-day Confederate attack) known as the Battle of Fort Stevens) were laid to rest here in what was once an apple orchard. President Abraham Lincoln, who attended the burial ceremony, dedicated the land as hallowed ground, making Battleground National Cemetery one of America's smallest national cemeteries.<br />Between the 1870s and early 1900s a Superintendent's Lodge, rostrum, flagpole, and regimental monuments were added to the cemetery to pay tribute to the brave men who sacrificed all to preserve this nation and its capital city. In addition to the fallen soldiers, the cemetery also holds the remains of the wife and three children of Augustus Armbrecht, the original superintendent of the cemetery.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(497 words) Fort DeRussy is located in Rock Creek Park in northwest Washington, DC, bordered by Military Road NW to the south, Oregon Avenue to the west, and Rock Creek to the east. From the northeast corner of the intersection of Oregon Avenue and Military Road, travel two hundred fifty feet north on the east side of Oregon Avenue, along a cement paved path into the edge of a forest. A four by three-foot wayside titled Fort De Russy sits at the right side of the path. Follow the path around the wayside to the right and proceed one-hundred twenty feet east at a slight incline into the forest to a fork in the road with a dirt path to the left. Follow the dirt path four hundred thirty feet where two waysides sit to the left of the path. The left wayside is three by two feet and titled in the top left corner: Fort DeRussy. The sign features an image of men in military dress standing in a circular bunker around a cannon lowered in the circle and on a wheeled turret. Six men stand atop a four-foot-tall wall that encircles the cannon. Eight other men stand within the lowered cannon space. Text below describes the cannon and Fort DeRussy: Built in 1861 to protect the Rock Creek Valley during the Civil War, Fort DeRussy's cannon fired a total of 109 projectiles into the northern countryside as 12,000-15,000 Confederate soldiers attacked the city under the command of Confederate General Jubal Anderson Early on July 11-12, 1864. During this two day battle (known as the Battle of Fort Stevens) Fort DeRussy aided the surrounding forts by providing the main suppressive fire to ensure a Union victory on the battlefield. The largest piece of armament which Fort DeRussy utilized was the 100-Pound Parrott Rifle. This cannon, shown above at nearby Fort Totten, could hurl 100 pound projectiles several miles into the Maryland countryside. During the Battle of Fort Stevens, Fort DeRussy halted the Confederate advance into the city by firing this deadly and accurate cannon a total of 28 times. The top right corner features a black and white photograph of a man standing at attention in a plain coat, pants and boots with a strap across his chest and holding a rifle and bayonet at his right side. Text beneath him reads: Private Samuel Strawser, a member of the 151st Ohio Volunteer Infantry, was stationed at Fort DeRussy during the Battle of Fort Stevens. A black and white oval photograph in the bottom right shows a bearded man in a hat, suit and vest. Text to his right reads: \"On the right was Rock Creek running through a deep ravine which had been rendered impassable...every appliance of science and unlimited means had been used to render the fortifications around Washington as strong as possible\"<br />General Jubal Anderson Early Commander of Confederate forces during the Battle of Fort Stevens You can download a podcast of Fort DeRussy at www.nps.gov/rocr END OF DESCRIPTION",

A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front to the east of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four-feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards (90 meters) across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with six three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />Set at the low-end corner of the block at 13th and Rittenhouse Streets is a four by three-foot wayside. The yellow sign is written in brown letters across the top:<br />Fort Stevens<br />The partial reconstruction of Fort Stevens that you see today was done by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. No visible evidence of the original fort remains.<br />Across a blue border just below, text reads in white letters:<br />Civil War Defenses of Washington<br />1861-1865<br />Text in the middle left describes the Battle of Fort Stevens:<br />Battle of Fort Stevens<br />July 11-12, 1864<br />On July 11-12, 1864, Fort Stevens was the focal point of a Confederate attack by Gen. Jubal Early with his force of 15,000 soldiers. Defended by a meager force of convalescents, quartermaster employees and 100 day militia volunteers, Fort Stevens held back an attack by Confederate skirmishers on July 11. Reinforcements from the Union 6th and 19th Corps on the second day checked and turned back the only Confederate threat against Washington, DC, during the war. Late in the afternoon of July 12, President Abraham Lincoln was exposed to Confederate fire while observing this battle where approximately 900 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing.<br />Nearby Battleground Cemetery, which was dedicated by President Lincoln soon after the battle, contains the graves of 40 Union soldiers who died in defense of Fort Stevens.<br />To the right is a map of the top corner of Washington, DC, showing the locations of Civil War forts. From west to east they are: Battery Kemble, Fort Bayard, Fort Reno, For De Russy, Fort Stevens, Fort Slocum, Fort Totten, and Fort Bunker Hill.<br />Text below reads:<br />Other Civil War for locations administered by Rock Creek Park.<br />The bottom third of the sign shows a black and white photograph of Civil War soldiers standing in a fort around an eight-foot long cannon on a rotating platform, aimed to the left.

A black Rodman Gun sits on a gray concrete foundation dug into the earth. The gun is about 15 feet long by 8 feet tall, or 5 meters long by 2 and a half meters tall. The reddish-brown dirt is cut away to show the underground supporting structure. The gun consists of a large horizontal carriage with a bottle-shaped cannon on top. The gun points to the left, toward the river. Below ground, are stacked gray counterweights to balance the gun for raising and lowering it. On the right, four soldiers stand at the base of the gun, ready to push it up and over the fort wall to fire. On the left, two soldiers stand on top of the fort wall. The fort wall is built of upright logs and topped with green grass. One soldier points towards the river. Over the color illustration, is a ghosted illustration of the Rodman Gun in firing position. To fire, the soldiers pivot the enormous gun on its mount to raise it over the fort wall. At the same time, the counterweights below drop into a deep pit. After firing, the gun’s recoil slides it back down the mount to its resting position. [End of message]",

As the soldiers cleared for safety, a flame shot into the powder bag and ignited the powder. End of Text A color illustration fills the panel. In the center of the panel, is a large black Rodman Gun, just like the one in front of you. It stands on a round gray concrete platform with circular tracks so the Rodman Gun can rotate. Its bottle-shaped cannon is mounted on a black steel carriage. Behind the gun, are the fort’s brown log and earthen walls, topped with green grass. The ground around the concrete platform is brown. The sky above is blue with purple across the top. There are 14 soldiers in blue Union uniforms around the Rodman Gun. At the far left, 2 soldiers hold a beige wooden box, filled with gunpowder. A soldier stands at the left end of the steel carriage. Another soldier stands on the carriage and holds the aiming ring on top of the cannon. In front of the gun, 4 soldiers hold a shell hook to lift a cannonball. A shell hook is a wooden log with arched metal tongs that hook into the cannonball. Behind them, are 2 more soldiers working to ready another cannonball. To the right of the gun, is a neatly stacked pyramid of cannonballs, each twice the diameter of a person’s head. At the right end of the gun, is a group of soldiers. 1 lifts a bag of gunpowder to give to a second soldier. A third soldier holds the sponge, which is a long staff with sheep fleece at the end. On the top right, is black text on a blue background: The Rodman Guns were the largest weapons developed during the Civil War.

To the left, is the trail toward the fort. Behind you, on the other side of the trail, is a concrete horse trough, which is about 6 feet long by 1 foot wide and 2 feet tall. In metric, that is about 2 meters long by a quarter meter wide by a half meter tall. Ahead of you, is a dense forest. A color illustration fills the panel. The illustration shows a busy fort, the Potomac River with many ships, and Alexandria in the distance. On the left, is the six-sided earthen fort. The fort is longer than it is wide. To the right, is a grassy landscape with several buildings. The buildings are labeled with white text on green backgrounds. From left to right, are the hospital, horse trough, barracks, and officers’ quarters. Around the horse trough and barracks, horses pull covered wagons with supplies. A dirt road runs from the bottom left corner of the panel, up and to the right, and past the fort. It ends at a rectangular dock on the top right edge of the landscape. Across the middle of the panel, is the light blue Potomac River. The other side of the river is Virginia, which was Union occupied. On the top right, is the City of Alexandria, made up of red-roofed buildings. To the right of the dock, is black text on a blue background: Distances are exaggerated for interpretive purposes.

Attached to the panel, is a table 3 feet wide by 1 and a half feet deep, and 3 feet off the ground. This table supports a bronze model of the fort. The panel is at the edge of the parking lot. Ahead is a dirt path, that leads to the fort. The background is a red map of Washington, DC, and the surrounding area. At the top, is the text quoted in this entry's body text, in yellow and white. Under the text, is a black-and-white photograph of 9 Boy Scouts sitting or standing on a Rodman Gun, lying in the grass. Students and scouts used the site in the early 1900s. The National Park Service took over the fort in 1931, changing the fort’s mission from defense to recreation and conservation. At the right, is a large black-and-white portrait of a standing Union Rear Admiral Andrew Hull Foote. He is bearded and dressed in military uniform, with prominent epaulettes, or decorative fringe, on his shoulders. His left arm wraps around his sword hilt. He died in 1863. He is known for his heroic actions on the Mississippi River. Across the bottom of the panel, is a black-and-white photograph of the fort under construction in 1863-1864. In the center, is a large earthen mound with wooden footings. To either side of the mound, is a flattened path. On the outer sides of the path, are earthen walls and wooden structures. Most of the structures are finished with round, earthen roofs, but some are still being built. The surrounding area is devoid of trees, unlike today.

He holds his horse's reins with his left hand and his right hand placed on his hip. The horse's right front hoof is raised, and its head curled downward.<br />The eighteen-foot tall, nine-foot long oblong granite pedestal rests on a forty-four-foot long, thirty-foot wide base. On either side of the pedestal is a bronze relief featuring an array of armaments - spears, axes, eagle-capped staffs, and a pair of crossed cannons draped in a shroud. An inscription on a bag at the bottom left corner of the east side relief reads: 57. An inscription in the lower right corner reads: Mac Monnies.<br />Encircling the pedestal base is a bronze oak and laurel garland that runs between bronze eagles standing atop spheres in each corner. Bronze shields line the top of the pedestal and are inscribed with the names:<br />Yorktown<br />Malvern Hill<br />Fair Oaks<br />South Mountain<br />Antietam<br />Williamsburg<br />Rich Mountain<br />Gaine's Mill<br />An inscription on the front face of the pedestal reads:<br />MAJOR GENERAL<br />GEORGE BRINTON McCLELLAN<br />1826-1885<br />Six granite steps lead up to the memorial from all four sides.

A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location. Lined in front to the north are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One six-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />About six feet left of the left cannon, sitting on the grass just beyond the cement bunker wall is a stone marker with a bronze plaque set on its face. The stone is about five feet tall, four feet wide, and two feet deep. The plaque measures about one foot high by two feet wide. It features a one-inch raised border and is engraved across the top to read:<br />LINCOLN UNDER FIRE AT FORT STEVENS<br />July 12, 1864<br />The image below is a bas-relief of a man in the center with top hat and long suit coat tending to a wounded man on the right falling with his head thrown back.

    "bodyText": "In 1890, brothers Edward and Edwin Baltzley created the Glen Echo on the Potomac real estate development hoping to lure Washingtonians to live in the beauty and serenity of this new suburban community. Glen Echo became the site of the 53rd Chautauqua Assembly, offering summer courses in the liberal and practical arts. The crown jewel of the Chautauqua was an 8,000-seat amphitheater that sat atop Minnehaha Creek and used the water flow to power the speaker system. During the amusement park era, the amphitheater became the Midway, home to many rides and entertainments.<br /> <br /> The trestle that supported the Glen Echo trolley - the primary mode of public transportation that carried visitors to the park during the Chautauqua and early amusement park years - is visible from the bridge as you look toward MacArthur Boulevard. <br /> <br /> The Baltzley brothers donated a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/clara-barton-national-historic-site.htm\">house and land to Clara Barton</a>, the founder of the American Red Cross, in an effort to bring prestige to their Glen Echo community. Built in 1891, it was first used as a warehouse for disaster relief suppolies. In 1897, Miss Barton made it her home and the headquarters for the American Red Cross. Thinking the house looked too somber, Miss Barton changed the Original granite facade of the residence to an elegant Victorian wooden facade, retaining only the granite corners.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Over the course of her lifetime, Clara Barton was a dedicated Civil War nurse, an active women’s rights suffragette, and the founder and first president of the American Red Cross. She lived in the house on the property for a brief time in 1891, and then again from 1897 until her death in 1912. </p> <p>From 1891-97, the house served as an American Red Cross warehouse, and it was the organization’s national headquarters from 1897-1904. The Red Cross continued to use the house as a warehouse for relief supplies, stationery, and Red Cross publications. </p> <p>Inside, the first floor includes a parlor room, dining room, offices, and a kitchen. The second floor was for bedrooms, including Ms. Barton's room at the rear of the house. Look up to the third floor and note the windows with red crosses in them. Some of the interior walls and ceilings are covered with muslin, the same material used in bandages.</p> <p>During her residence here, Barton developed the landscape into a miniature farm that was primarily self-sustaining, including crops, stables, and a chicken coop. This agricultural use of the landscape is no longer evident; development at the Glen Echo amusement park including roller coasters and the modern parking lot built over most of the farming operation. Many of the trees and plants that grow today are not consistent with the historic function of the grounds. However, the Clara Barton House is the most significant building associated with her time at Glen Echo, and it remains intact.</p> <p>In the years following Ms. Barton's death in 1912, her colleague, Dr. Julian Hubbell, replaced the porch with a columned, one-story porch. His twin nieces inherited the house in 1929 and converted the interior to rent-producing apartments, added baths and kitchens, and a garage with screened porches above at the western rear corner. </p> <p>Congress declared the Clara Barton House a National Historic Landmark on January 12, 1965, and in 1974 passed legislation establishing the house and grounds as the Clara Barton National Historic Site. This property was acquired by NPS in April 1975 through a donation from the Friends of Clara Barton. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>During the Civil War there was no official system in place to document missing or dead soldiers. As the war ended Clara Barton, the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" who had achieved fame as a nurse during the war, took it upon herself to fill this void. She began to receive letters from family members trying to find out the fate of their loved ones who had not returned home. Each of these letters led to a painstaking process of researching the whereabouts of these missing soldiers and to respond to the family members' inquiries. </p> <p>In June of 1865 a young clerk named Dorence Atwater contacted Barton and requested copies of her lists of missing soldiers. Atwater had been a prisoner at Andersonville and had been paroled to work in the hospital, where he diligently maintained a copy of the death records. Ecstatic, Barton contacted Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and asked to accompany the US Army's expedition to Andersonville to identify the graves there.</p> <p>At Andersonville in July and August of 1865, Atwater and Barton poured through the letters she had received, and began to search for these missing soldiers in the Andersonville Death Register and captured hospital records. While laborers worked to erect headboards in the cemetery, Barton wrote dozens of letters informing families that their loved ones had died at Andersonville. At the end of the expedition, Barton was given the honor of raising the American flag for the first time over the recently established Andersonville National Cemetery.</p> <p>After returning from Andersonville, Barton set up the Missing Soldier's Office in Washington in 1865. She hired numerous clerks, including Dorence Atwater, to respond to the more than 60,000 letters that she received. By the time the Missing Soldiers Office closed in 1867, Barton and her staff had identified more than 20,000 missing soldiers, including nearly 13,000 who had died at Andersonville Prison.<br /> <br />  </p> <p>Because of her fame as a nurse, she received much of the credit for the work of the Missing Soldiers Office and the Andersonville expedition. In a post war speaking series she was hailed as the \"Heroine of Andersonville\" and toured the nation displaying artifacts that she had collected at the prison site and lectured on the sufferings of the prisoners. She was even inducted as an honorary member of the Andersonville Survivor's Association, and the army's expedition to Andersonville to identify the graves quickly became known as Barton's expedition, even though she had only accompanied the previously planned endeavor and had worked primarily writing letters - not identifying graves as has often been claimed.</p> <p>Barton's greatest contribution to the Andersonville story is through her work in the Missing Soldiers Office and her support of Dorence Atwater. Atwater was court-martialed and jailed in the fall of 1865 related to a dispute over the ownership of the Andersonville Death Register. It was through Barton's efforts that he was finally released and she then supported his publication of the Death Register. Barton is often mistakenly given credit for identifying the graves at Andersonville. However, she deserves a great deal of credit for her efforts to account for the missing soldiers, both at Andersonville and across countless battlefields.</p>",

She built a career of humanitarian service in a society that did not grant her full rights because of her gender.<br /> <br /> When Clara Barton moved into this house in 1897, she was 75 years old and had gained international fame for her work in the Civil War. After the war, Clara Barton traveled to Europe where she learned about the International Red Cross. She served with the German Red Cross in the Franco-Prussian War and earned several honors. When she returned to America, she spent five years lobbying Congress to ratify the Treaty of Geneva in order to establish the American Red Cross. In Glen Echo, Miss Barton continued her work in foreign aid, dipomacy, and equal rights while leading the American Red Cross. Along the way, Clara Barton developed ways of thinking that are part of our lives today. She gave us the first aid kit, emergency preparedness, and was a pioneer of natural disaster relief.</p>",

Changes made to the creek in the past 100 years mirror the history of Glen Echo Park.<br /> <br /> Two kinds of landscapes are worth looking at - those that man has never touched, and those in which man has gained harmony.<br /> <br /> <em>\"...the Glen widens amphitheater like as if intended by nature for the great auditorium to seat 8,000 people. The stream flows under the building which together with one acre of grotto work under the stone floor...lighted by electricity will constitute one of the pleasing features of this vast structure.\"</em><br /> <br /> The arrival of the Glen Echo Chautauqua changed Minnehaha Creek: a large amphitheater was constructed in the creekbed in 1891. Here students gathered for lectures until a malaria scare closed the Chautauqua in 1892. Later, in 1899, a Glen Echo company developed the site into an amusement park. A remodeled amphitheater opened as the \"Midway\" in 1911.<br /> <br /> Glen Echo Park's popularity again changed Minnehaha Creek. In 1956 park owners extended the parking lot by removing the \"Midway\" and installing a large metal pipe or culvert. For 33 years Minnehaha Creek flowed silently underground until record breaking rains collapsed the parking lot and culvert in 1989. Following the flood, the National Park Service restored the creek's natural stream bed. Look closely along the banks to spot signs of Minnehaha Creek's past.<br /> <br /> Photo captions: <ul> <li>Minnehaha creek</li> <li>Interior view of amphitheater, 1891</li> <li>The Chautauqua amphitheater, circa 1891</li> <li>The remodeled amphitheater opened in 1911</li> <li>An extended parking lot covered Minnehaha Creek circa 1960</li> <li>The collapsed parking lot and culvert in May 1989</li> <li>Restoring Minnehaha Creek, January 1991</li> <li>Minnehaha Creek today: the natural stream bed restored at Glen Echo Park</li> </ul>",

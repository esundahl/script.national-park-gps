By November of that same year, after being battered by storms the original jetties began to drop and fall below the surface, severely limiting the usability of the channel. In 1962, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed the present, and now public, channel and larger protecting jetties.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{e439fb9a-274f-492d-8114-d9de91feae9c}{247}\" paraid=\"612675394\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Today, the Mansfield Channel is utilized by recreational boaters and commercial barge traffic as an access route between the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The channel is regularly maintained and dredged by the USACE and consists of a 12.9 mile long shallow-draft channel from the jettied inlet along the Gulf of Mexico to Port Mansfield, TX. The channel has a depth of 14 feet deep and is 125 feet wide. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9440e29b-da8c-4aa3-8bd8-ba9fd5634d3f}{53}\" paraid=\"1817229415\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The rock jetties, constructed during the creation of the channel, provide a great area for viewing dolphins, green sea turtles, and other wildlife that might be seen swimming in the area. Fishing is also a very popular activity along the jetties. </p>",

The line camp was used by cowboys as a place of shelter and a site to corral cattle. Novillo Line Camp was the northernmost line camp used by the Dunn Cattle Ranch company in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with other camps, Black Hill Line Camp and Green Hill Line Camp, being located further south.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{ba54e456-6a38-4618-bf22-a07ecabf2a5b}{4}\" paraid=\"701545029\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Today, Novillo Line Camp is one of the last historic structures still standing within the national seashore, reflecting an early human use and occupation of Padre Island. These preserved structures such as the bunk house, cattle fences, and even the table and eating area, provide us a unique window of how life on the island would have looked for many of the ranch workers and inhabitants. </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d88096f-2556-4621-ab71-57f2ea92e61f}{224}\" paraid=\"169307694\">As with many areas of Texas, Padre Island's history has been intertwined with the cattle ranching industry. From 1879 through 1970 the successful Dunn Cattle Ranch would eventually span two-thirds of the island. Individuals such as Patrick Dunn saw the benefit of the island as a ranch and would develop the land to take part in the lucrative business. His efforts and the growth of his ranch would lead to many changes on land and left a lasting impact on the history of Padre Island. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{451cfd7b-fbcd-45c4-8259-c0d47b88ad45}{245}\" paraid=\"731160389\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">To access Novillo Line Camp, you must park in the small pullout along Park Road 22 across from Bird Island Basin Road and walk along the dirt road. Do not block the gate. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{923eae46-9b62-4ab6-acac-579248b93267}{250}\" paraid=\"1887251399\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The National Park Service regularly completes projects to upkeep and preserve these historic structures. If you visit Novillo Line Camp, whether from a distance or up close, please help us preserve it by staying out of the buildings and not removing anything from the site. </p>",

The scientific name of this species gives an indication to its physical characteristics as well as its uses. Baptisia means “to dye,” and some species within this genus have been used to make dyes. <em>Bracteata</em> refers to the bracts that the plant bears, and <em>leucophaea</em> describes the off-white coloring of the flowers. The flower stalks can reach upwards of one foot long, and the large flower clusters droop and hang to the ground due to the weight of the inflorescence. In late summer, the entire upper portion of the plant loses its green color. It becomes dry, turns dark grey to black, and breaks off to become tumbleweeds. This process aids the plant in seed dispersal. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{1830467b-d63e-4c04-8e7d-5107f92183fc}{119}\" paraid=\"137628236\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections</h2> <p paraeid=\"{1830467b-d63e-4c04-8e7d-5107f92183fc}{135}\" paraid=\"1184426098\">This member of the legume family has been cited as having special value to native bees of the region, especially bumblebees. The shape of the indigo flowers is unique and makes accessing nectar slightly difficult. The size and strength of bumblebees, when compared to other types of pollinators, is well adapted to propel them towards the nectar deeper in the flower. The specific timing of the flowers’ nectar and pollen development on the plant also aids in proper pollination. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{1830467b-d63e-4c04-8e7d-5107f92183fc}{155}\" paraid=\"1685317182\">North American Ethnobotany </h2> <p paraeid=\"{1830467b-d63e-4c04-8e7d-5107f92183fc}{163}\" paraid=\"738692707\">The Pawnee people used the plant as a gastrointestinal aid and would crush the seeds of the plant. They would then combine them with buffalo fat to be applied to the abdomen for colic. During the Civil War, plains wild indigo was used medicinally by Confederate surgeons as an emetic (causes vomiting) and as a cathartic (causes purging). The Army of Virginia (US) would frequently attach the fresh plants to their horses to act as an insect repellant. </p>",

It is distinguished from similar Paspalum species by its numerous flowering branches, its purple-colored spikelets, and by its linear leaves. This grass grows in sand and muck soils on coastal sand dunes, prairies, marshes, and disturbed habitats of the southern coastal plain from eastern Mexico to Florida. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{a7497a78-21f6-4592-9db8-871364c8888d}{61}\" paraid=\"1889042295\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections </h2> <p paraeid=\"{a7497a78-21f6-4592-9db8-871364c8888d}{77}\" paraid=\"1254745093\">Because of its abundance in the grasslands of the island, <em>Paspalum monostachyum</em> serves in tandem with seacoast bluestem to provide dense cover for a variety of small animals. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{a7497a78-21f6-4592-9db8-871364c8888d}{95}\" paraid=\"2053834267\">North American Ethnobotany </h2> <p paraeid=\"{a7497a78-21f6-4592-9db8-871364c8888d}{103}\" paraid=\"654459989\">Limited information about the historical and cultural uses of gulfdune paspalum has been recorded in common text sources. This does not mean that Native American people did not use it, only that information regarding its use is not as circulated. Other species of <em>Paspalum</em> were used by Native American people, like the Kiowa people, as a valuable fodder and pasture plant for livestock. </p>",

The leaves grow spirally, giving it the characteristic “rosette” growth pattern. Century plants produce a flowering stalk that can reach upwards of 30 feet in height. They reproduce by seed dispersal from the stalk, or by a process known as “suckering” in which the plant will produce shoots from the parent plant. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{e2c11f35-4db6-463b-8b10-1cb0cc1c54ec}{72}\" paraid=\"1741184733\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{e2c11f35-4db6-463b-8b10-1cb0cc1c54ec}{92}\" paraid=\"170916540\"><em>Agave americana</em> is a nectar source for insects, birds, and bats. Small wildlife, such as javelinas and rodents, snack on the leaves. The trapdoor giant skipper (<em>Agathymus</em>) butterfly complex utilizes the plant as larval food. The plant can harbor other insect eggs, although these relationships may not always be to the benefit of the agave. Some animals do find the plant to be toxic upon ingestion.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{e2c11f35-4db6-463b-8b10-1cb0cc1c54ec}{140}\" paraid=\"467514039\">North American Ethnobotany  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{e2c11f35-4db6-463b-8b10-1cb0cc1c54ec}{152}\" paraid=\"1875576689\">The century plant was used as one of the most important sources of food for the Apache, Comanche, Mohave, Paiute, Papago, Ute, and Yuma people. In times of famine, the plant was essential in the avoidance of starvation for the Pima people. Cooking practices involved pit roasting many aspects of the plant, including the heads, leaves, tubers, flower stalks, roots and fruit. The leaves and flower stalks were also eaten as greens, and juice from the plant would be boiled and used as a syrup by the Pima people. The Papago people used the fibers to make brushes and used the leaves as a component in the weaving material of house frames.</p>",

The fruits are named for their pear-like appearance in English, while the Spanish name “tuna” is derived from the Caribbean word “tun,” meaning fruit or seed. The jointed stem segments are referred to as “nopals,” deriving from the Nàhautl tribe’s name for the <em>Opuntia</em> “Nopalli” and the Spanish “nopalito.” The flowers of this cactus sport very bright and showy colors, ranging from yellows to reds. Each nopal of prickly pear cacti is capable of producing roots for several weeks after detachment, making vegetative spread common, especially after storms. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{a38ddfe3-119c-4788-ac20-9f11fcecedf7}{106}\" paraid=\"682742229\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections </h2> <p paraeid=\"{a38ddfe3-119c-4788-ac20-9f11fcecedf7}{122}\" paraid=\"1253743471\">Like other cacti, the prickly pear cactus is capable of storing large quantities of water within its nopals and fruit, making it an important source of nourishment for the animals that can overcome its spiky defenses. Jackrabbits, javelinas, rodents, bats, and coyotes have been known to feed on this vegetation. In cattle, <em>Opuntia</em> has been cited as being the difference between life and death during periods of drought due to the extensive amounts of water found within the nopals, although the spines may become lodged in the cattle. Further harmful effects may include bloating and diarrhea in young cattle if they are not accustomed to the cactus as a food source, but these consequences are greatly preferred over death by malnutrition and dehydration. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{a38ddfe3-119c-4788-ac20-9f11fcecedf7}{160}\" paraid=\"76460261\">North American Ethnobotany </h2> <p paraeid=\"{a38ddfe3-119c-4788-ac20-9f11fcecedf7}{168}\" paraid=\"1744767721\">Just as wildlife has found great value in the prickly pear cactus, humans have long benefited from their interactions with the plant. The Navajo people in particular found great use with this particular species of prickly pear, using the plant for its fruit by either eating them raw, drying and boiling them, or harvesting them for later winter use. They also used the spines in dermatological efforts and the stems for assistance in childbirth. In the mid-19th century, Confederate states described the process of using the leaves of the prickly pear to aid in the making of hard tallow candles. In another historical context, the prickly pear cactus is indirectly responsible for the red dye that colored the British “red coats.” The cochineal scale insect that eats the cactus is crushed to produce the red cochineal dye. Over 20,000 pounds of cochineal, the result of approximately 1.4 million insects, was found aboard the 1554 shipwrecks here at Padre Island. After gold and silver, cochineal was the third most prolific Spanish export from the New World. </p>",

The inflorescence type, or the arrangement of the flower parts of the plant, is what’s known as an umbel and resembles an umbrella in shape. The plant roots at the nodes and takes root in sand or sandy clay, and the time of year for blooming mistflowers usually ranges from early spring through late summer. Within the park, this plant is most common near ephemeral ponds and marshes, roadsides, open grasslands, and disturbed areas. The mistflower is moderately tolerant of drought periods and partial shade but thrives most effectively in areas of full sun. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{41654754-9bf8-4ed4-8161-a6aec492e5f6}{118}\" paraid=\"209735738\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections </h2> <p paraeid=\"{41654754-9bf8-4ed4-8161-a6aec492e5f6}{134}\" paraid=\"192342368\">Mistflower is one of the most important nectar sources for butterflies and moths on the island.

Texas goldentop leaves are glandular and sticky, which is a reliable way to tell them apart from their goldenrod look-alikes. They produce small yellow flowers that are typically clumped together to create patchy masses of color in the island grasslands. The blooming period of goldentop plants can range from July to October, but peak months occur in August and September. Members of this genus (<em>Euthamia</em>) display what is called phenotypic variation, which means that varied environments will foster visible differences in these plants.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{9bf51e66-2ba7-4f19-82b6-b9c5591e2b08}{103}\" paraid=\"1526598668\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections </h2> <p paraeid=\"{9bf51e66-2ba7-4f19-82b6-b9c5591e2b08}{119}\" paraid=\"278360930\">Species in the <em>Euthamia</em> genus play as hosts to many moth species and also provide a nectar source for butterflies, skippers, bees, and wasps. They are especially important to pollinators during the fall because many other plants have finished flowering. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{9bf51e66-2ba7-4f19-82b6-b9c5591e2b08}{145}\" paraid=\"385515906\">North American Ethnobotany </h2> <p paraeid=\"{9bf51e66-2ba7-4f19-82b6-b9c5591e2b08}{153}\" paraid=\"674556665\">Limited information about the historical and cultural uses of the Texas goldentop has been recorded in common text sources. This does not mean that Native American people did not use it, only that information regarding its use is not as circulated. More generally, the Chippewa and Ojibwa people used another species of goldentop for chest pain, and the Potawatomi people used the same species to treat certain kinds of fevers. The Ojibwa people regarded a closely related <em>Euthamia</em> species as a hunting medicine. The flowers were dried and smoked, and the smell emitted resembled the odor of deer hooves. The simulated odor would then attract deer.  </p>",

It goes by a variety of names, those of which include pinkscale gayfeather, white bract blazing star, handsome blazing star, and white featherflower. The flowering part of the plant creates a cylindrical cluster of flowers that sprout various shades of white and purple and surround the stalk on all sides. The flowers bloom from late summer until early winter, and the seeds are typically dispersed through wind. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{25a214d7-4545-45fb-a2be-270515ce3d1b}{60}\" paraid=\"352775390\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections </h2> <p paraeid=\"{25a214d7-4545-45fb-a2be-270515ce3d1b}{76}\" paraid=\"2139869503\">This plant is very valuable for pollinating wildlife, such as butterflies and day flying moths. <em>Liatris elegans</em> plants attract large numbers of native bees to support the vegetation in flowering, and the plant is also incredibly important as a nectar source for migrating monarch butterflies during the fall months. In the spring and summer seasons, deer will eat the foliage of the elegant gayfeather. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{25a214d7-4545-45fb-a2be-270515ce3d1b}{100}\" paraid=\"160378039\">North American Ethnobotany </h2> <p paraeid=\"{25a214d7-4545-45fb-a2be-270515ce3d1b}{108}\" paraid=\"1003483494\">Limited information about the historical and cultural uses of the Elegant gayfeather has been recorded in common text sources. This does not mean that Native American people did not use it, only that information regarding its use is not as circulated. Plants in the same genus of <em>Liatris</em> have been used by Native American people, like the Koasati and Seminole people, for their antirheumatic properties. Two other species of <em>Liatris</em>, the Rattlesnake master and the Button snakeroot as they were referred to in the 19th century, were used by Confederate surgeons to treat sore throats, pain, coughs, colds, colic, and even snake bites. The documented usage of Rattlesnake master is also found at another NPS site; <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/prehistoric-cave-discoveries.htm\">indigenous artifacts at Mammoth Cave National Park</a> have been discovered inside the caves, including a piece of footwear made from the fibers of the <em>Liatris</em> plant. </p>",

The leaves of this plant have a “spicy,” pine or conifer like fragrance, and bloom periods occur in late winter and through the spring. This plant is dioecious, which means that the male and female reproductive parts of the flowers are on different plants. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{84a4ed46-625c-4027-a5e0-ac26fdd89687}{60}\" paraid=\"1817665542\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections </h2> <p paraeid=\"{84a4ed46-625c-4027-a5e0-ac26fdd89687}{76}\" paraid=\"20157083\">In the winter months, wax myrtle seeds are a very important food source for wildlife. <em>Morella cerifera</em> is also an excellent source of honey. The berries of this shrub are eaten by many birds, and the vegetation serves as a larval host to the Red-banded Hairstreak species of butterflies. The larvae of these butterflies have been found on the fallen leaves and detritus of the wax myrtle plant to feed. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{84a4ed46-625c-4027-a5e0-ac26fdd89687}{102}\" paraid=\"567585083\">North American Ethnobotany </h2> <p paraeid=\"{84a4ed46-625c-4027-a5e0-ac26fdd89687}{112}\" paraid=\"1513280309\">The Choctaw, Houma, Koasati, Micmac, and Seminole people have been cited in their uses of wax myrtle for both medicinal and more general practices. The plant, including its leaves, roots, and stems, was used as a treatment for: fevers, inflamed tonsils, parasitic worms, stomachaches, headaches, and generalized inflammation. More specifically, the Houma people utilized the berries by boiling them and extracting the wax to make candles. The Micmac people used the berries, bark and leaves as an exhilarant and as a beverage. The Seminole people would decoct the wood’s ashes and place them on the tongue in order to cleanse the body and strengthen their marriage. They also used wax myrtle as a substitute for tobacco and to make lye. </p>",

Being so close to a large body of salt water, the plant is highly tolerant to excess salt spray and is also tolerant to periods of drought. The plant leaves are modified spikes and sport very sharp leaf tips. Once the plant has produced white and lightly purple bell-shaped flowers, the trunk of the plant ceases growth. The plant continues to grow by way of lateral buds for vertical growth, as well as offshoots near the base that form a cluster of the plants. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{348b3156-89d5-4802-bb99-61d3d7f35e4f}{31}\" paraid=\"329718970\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections </h2> <p paraeid=\"{348b3156-89d5-4802-bb99-61d3d7f35e4f}{47}\" paraid=\"396835047\"><em>Yucca aloifolia</em> plays many important roles in its ecosystem and has ecological connections to many forms of wildlife. Not only do yucca plants provide wildlife cover for birds and insects; they have also developed an evolutionary relationship with yucca moths. These two species participate in what is known as obligate mutualism. Mutualism describes a relationship in which both organisms involved in the relationship benefit from the interaction between each other, and as obligate mutualists, neither species can survive without the other. In the case of the yucca plants and their partners, the moths will transfer pollen between yucca flowers and will lay their eggs in the flowers. The moth larva will feed on some of the developing seeds but will leave enough seeds viable so that the plant can reproduce and continue as a partner in their mutual survival.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{348b3156-89d5-4802-bb99-61d3d7f35e4f}{97}\" paraid=\"752623579\">North American Ethnobotany </h2> <p paraeid=\"{348b3156-89d5-4802-bb99-61d3d7f35e4f}{105}\" paraid=\"1239081726\">The Choctaw people used the aloe yucca plant as a dermatological aid by boiling mashed roots with grease or tallow and using the result as a salve for a variety of purposes.  </p>",

It is an attractive grass forming upright clumps of slender green leaves which have a tinge of blue at the base. It has striking clusters of fluffy, silvery-white seed heads which often persist into winter and seem to shine under sunlight. The most outstanding feature of this grass may be the bronze-orange fall foliage color. This species is not as tolerant of excessive salt spray and can therefore be found in the grasslands of the island or on the side of the dunes facing away from the gulf. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{2706e5c0-df3b-44f6-8285-c6d14c35ce57}{72}\" paraid=\"1716389623\">Park Wildlife Ecology/Connections </h2> <p paraeid=\"{2706e5c0-df3b-44f6-8285-c6d14c35ce57}{88}\" paraid=\"1763163250\">Because of its bunchgrass growth pattern, <em>Schizachyrium littorale</em> is a good cover for ground nesting birds, like the Northern Bobwhite quail. The Gulf Coast kangaroo rat may also benefit from the cover that the high-density grass provides. In terms of predation and grazing, butterflies and grasshoppers have been known to feed on Seacoast Bluestem. Grazing animals take advantage of the abundance of this grass, especially the cattle that once historically grazed the island. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{2706e5c0-df3b-44f6-8285-c6d14c35ce57}{126}\" paraid=\"728139089\">North American Ethnobotany </h2> <p paraeid=\"{2706e5c0-df3b-44f6-8285-c6d14c35ce57}{134}\" paraid=\"2075005517\">The Comanche people used the grasses’ stems by burning them and using the ashes for syphilitic sores, as well as in ceremonies. The Lakota people would use the grass as a fur-like insulation in their moccasins during the winter. </p>",

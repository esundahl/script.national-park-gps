Along the Virgin River, the riparian area is home to plants and animals that require an abundant supply of water.  <br /> Fremont cottonwood trees (<em>Populus fremontii</em>) require a constant source of water and thrive along the Virgin River. When Fremont cottonwoods have access to reliable water, they can grow between 10–20 feet per year. These trees can also be helpful for streambank protection and are able to withstand low levels of flooding.<br /> The riparian area is also the perfect habitat for the American beaver. You may not immediately think of the American beaver when in the Southwest, but the Virgin River provides a welcome habitat for this river specialist. Sightings are rare, but evidence of the beaver's activity can be seen on many of the park's Fremont cottonwood trees. They do most of their tree-chewing during the night when the cover of darkness helps them to avoid predators. </p> <h3 paraeid=\"{73fbe6d5-2801-4581-af4e-14af52ccfaa6}{16}\" paraid=\"833899767\">Look</h3> <p>Have you seen any evidence of wildlife along the trail?

    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a wide concrete path that follows the Virgin River. The side of the path facing the river is lined with a wooden, split-rail fence. The other side is open to the sandy shrubland of the South Campground. To the south, the path continues towards the Zion Canyon Visitor Center. To the north, the path continues towards Canyon Junction. Just off the path along the split-rail fence is a long sandstone bench and a hip-height metal wayside sign. A picture spans the top half of the sign showing three buck deer with large antlers grazing near a clear, slow-moving river surrounded by yellow-leaved cottonwood trees and dormant grasses and shrubs. A title in the top left corner reads, “A Living Canyon.” In the lower right corner of the picture, a paragraph reads, “Stop for a moment. What do you see, hear, and smell? Where water is abundant, plants and animals thrive. The Virgin River and the vegetation in the riparian zone along it provide habitat for many species. Away from the river the temperature increases and the humidity drops. But life is tenacious and adapts. As you stroll the Pa’rus trail consider life with—or without—water.” The bottom left corner of the sign shows a Prickly Pear Cactus (scientific name Opuntia phaecantha) with dark-green spiked flat pads and three bright-yellow blooms. “The sharp spines of a cactus are believed to have evolved from leaves and serve a dual purpose – protecting the cactus from hungry critters and limiting water loss with reduced surface area.” Next to the cactus is a light-green, rounded Fremont Cottonwood leaf (scientific name Populus fremontii.) The caption reads, “On a hot summer day, the cottonwood’s branches create shade and cooler temperatures. These native trees thrive where there is water and are found lining the river. They offer shelter and food to many animals and help stabilize riverbanks.” At the center of the page, a 2-inch-long Virgin Spinedace fish with shiny scales is shown (scientific name Lepidomeda mollispinins). The caption reads, “This medium-sized silvery minnow was once found throughout the Virgin River. Due to habitat fragmentation, introduction of non-native species, and water demands, it is now found only in protected areas like Zion National Park. One of four native fish in the park, it is well adapted to the changing river temperatures and flood prone and sediment-laden rivers of Zion.” The bottom right corner of the sign has a 4-inch-long mottled brown lizard with a blue belly standing up on its hind legs. Its long toes grip a reddish sandstone rock and its long, narrow tail hangs down. Its front feet are against a taller sandstone rock. It is identified as a Plateau Lizard (scientific name Sceloporus tristichus). The caption reads, “Reptiles are ectotherms (or cold-blooded) and need to soak up the sun to warm their bodies so they can scurry away from predators and after prey. Much of their hydration is obtained from the insects and spiders they consume which allows them to live away from water sources.”",

Water that is absorbed at the highest points of the canyon can travel through the Navajo Sandstone, but is not able to travel through the tightly packed mudstone particles of the Kayenta layer.

An image of the same cliffs fills the entire sign. At the top right, the sign is titled, “Changing Landscapes.” Under the title, text reads, “Where you are standing was once a tidal flat at the edge of an ocean, a massive arid desert, and a river system where dinosaurs roamed. A lot can change in 200 million years, and the sedimentary rock layers tell those stories. The presence and absence of water has shaped Zion through geologic time.” An illustration on the left shows five rock layers with dashed blue lines connecting to the background image to show where each layer can be found on the cliffs around you. The youngest top layer is shown in yellow and labeled “Temple Cap Formation.” The rock in this layer was created 175-170 million years ago and is at the top of the highest peaks in Zion Canyon. Next down on the graphic is “Navajo Sandstone” represented by cream, pink, and brown sections within the layer, which was created 185-180 million years ago. An inset picture shows large hills of tan sand with the caption, “Desert sand dunes formed the Navajo Sandstone Layer.” This layer forms the sheer multi-colored cliffs seen in the background image. Below the \"Navajo Sandstone” layer is the ”Kayenta Formation”. This layer was deposited 195-185 million years ago, when dinosaurs lived here. Footprints of prehistoric creatures are illustrated within this brown layer on the graphic. The blue dashed line links this formation to the section of junipers below the vertical Navajo Sandstone cliffs. “Springdale Sandstone” is a subpart of the Kayenta Formation and makes up the smaller cliffs below the vegetated slopes of the Kayenta Formation. The Moenave Formation is the fourth section from the top and is represented by a rust-colored layer. It was created 210-195 million years ago and has dinosaur footprints and a fish skeleton in the graphic to represent the prehistoric animals that lived here. A photograph to the left side of the graphic spanning the Kayenta and Moenave layers shows a river system and floodplain. The picture is inset with an image of a person’s hand next to a three-toed grey fossilized footprint that is twice as large as the hand. The caption below says this type of landscape provided habitat for dinosaurs in the Kayenta and Moenave layers. Additional portions of the graphic are faded out to show that some layers in Zion are not visible in the cliffs around you. Older layers below the Moenave layer are not yet exposed in the main part of Zion Canyon, and younger layers above the Temple Cap Formation have already eroded completely from the Main Canyon. A quote by Heraclitus sits in the corner of the sign and reads, “Change is the only constant in time.”",

The river drops roughly 7,800 feet in the 160 miles it travels. In the park, the river drops an average of 71 feet every mile. In comparison, the Mississippi River drops about one inch every mile. This steepness, caused by the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, has given the Virgin River the ability to cut through sandstone and carve canyons. </p> <h3>Look</h3> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{75f09f85-8dff-40ae-830d-60e08ccbd3ad}{3}\" paraid=\"593015807\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">When you look at the river is the water clear?

    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a wide, concrete path right next to a bridge over the Virgin River. The path crosses over the bridge towards the Zion Canyon Visitor Center to the south. To the north, the path continues to travel through shrubland, with cottonwood trees lining the river. The large, sandstone Bridge Mountain is on the opposite side of the path. Connected to the path is a concrete pad with a wide sandstone bench and an angled metal sign. At the top center of the sign a title reads, “Creation from Destruction” A photograph covers the sign. The red cliffs of Zion tower over the green foliage of the canyon below. A bright-blue sky filled with fluffy clouds is above. In the foreground is the Virgin River with still blue water. A tall cottonwood tree stands about 15 feet from the river’s edge up a slight slope. In this picture, the river is running at 128 cubic feet per second. A smaller picture to the left shows the same view, but the sky is dark with storm clouds looming behind the cliffs. A muddy and turbulent Virgin River flows right up to the base of same cottonwood tree, showing how wide the river’s path becomes when the river flows at 3,970 cubic feet per second. Text on the sign’s right side reads, “What made a young canyon in old rock? Sediment carried in the water gives rivers power to carve down and through soft rocks. The canyon you see today was carved by the Virgin River and its tributaries in the past 2 million years, exposing rock layers nearly 200 million years old.” At the bottom of the sign, the text reads, “The Virgin River’s power becomes apparent when it floods. During times of low flow, the small river may flow at 25 cubic feet/second or less. In flood season the river may rise to 4,000 cubic feet/second or more. The force of the water rips trees from riverbanks, moves tons of sediment, and sends huge boulders tumbling downstream, creating a vast and dangerous path of destruction. But in destruction there is creation. New habitat is formed, soils are redistributed, and old materials are washed away. Can you see evidence of flooding? Look for plant debris suspended high above the river’s current level, logs on gravel bars, or fresh deposits of mud and sand as you continue along the trail.”",

    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a wide, concrete path that follows the Virgin River winds through desert sand and shrubs. To the south, the path extends towards the South Campground and Zion Canyon Visitor Center. In the distance, the large, triangular sandstone formation known as the Watchman is visible. To the north, the path continues through desert shrubs to Canyon Junction. Connected to the path where you are standing is a wooden shade structure standing over a wide sandstone bench and an angled wayside sign. An historic black-and-white photo takes up two-thirds of the right side of the sign. In the picture, the cliffs of Zion tower above three small, rustic wooden structures and a wagon. A larger light-colored building can be seen in the background. Cursive handwriting at the bottom of the image identifies it as the Crawford Homestead looking south. A title at the top right of the image reads, “Footprints in Time.” Underneath the image, text says, “Humans have survived and adapted in the Zion area for over 15,000 years. The waters of the Virgin River have provided sustenance for different cultures through time under the towering red rock cliffs. Though the people have changed, the landscape and the nourishing water remain constant.” The left third of the sign has a vertical timeline. At the top is a picture of two rough-edged white stone arrowheads lying on red sand. The image is labeled “Archaic People: 13,000 Before Common Era to 0 Common Era. The Archaic people were hunter-gatherers who left behind spear points, knives and other stone tools.” Next in the timeline is a picture of an 8-foot-square sandstone structure without a roof nestled in an alcove on a cliff. It is labeled, “Ancestral Puebloan and Fremont Peoples: 1 Common Era to 1150 Common Era. These people were cultivators who built permanent communities with homes and granaries.” At the center of the timeline is a black-and-white picture of a large gathering of Southern Paiute adults and children kneeling and standing around an open patch of ground. One person is gesturing as if telling a story to the group. The timeline reads, “Southern Paiute: 1150 Common Era to present. The Southern Paiute people were farmers, hunters and gatherers who shared traditions through dances and storytelling. Today, they combine old ways with new and maintain connection to their native homeland.” The fourth picture in the timeline is a black –and-white picture of two horse-drawn wagons with large wooden-spoked wheels carrying corn stalks. Men, women, and children are gathered around and on the wagons. The caption reads, “Euro-Americans Settlers: 1860 to 1909. Mormon pioneers came west in search of sanctuary and built settlements near water. Remnants of irrigation ditches are still visible.” At the bottom of the timeline, a brightly colorized historic photo shows a dirt road with large sandstone masonry monuments on either side. The monument on the left side of the road is about 5 feet high while the monument on the right is twice as large with a “Zion National Park” sign hanging from a horizontal log pole near the top. In the background, towering red-and-white sandstone cliffs are set against a blue sky with fluffy white clouds. It is identified as the South Entrance to Zion and represents the timeline from 1909 to the present. The area was designated as “Mukuntuweap National Monument in 1909 then Zion National Park in 1919. Each visitor writes their own story of Zion.”",

    "bodyText": "<h2>The Master Sculptor</h2> <h3>Learn </h3> <p>The power of wind, water, and gravity have shaped Zion Canyon over time. Erosion and weathering also play a role forming natural arches in the park. A natural arch is formed when deep cracks penetrate into a layer of sandstone. Erosion wears away the exposed rock layers and surface cracks expand, isolating narrow sandstone walls, called \"fins\". Water, frost, and the release of tensions in the rock cause crumbling and flaking of the porous sandstone, eventually cutting through some of these fins. The resulting holes become enlarged to arch proportions by rockfalls and weathering.<br /> Architecturally, arches are the most stable load bearing structure, but through weathering, eventually all arches collapse, leaving only buttresses that will inevitably give way to the unyielding forces of erosion. </p> <h3>Look</h3> <p>Among the arches in Zion, one of the most visible is the Crawford Arch. It can be seen from the Pa’rus Trail on Bridge Mountain, a thousand feet above the canyon floor. Bridge Mountain is located on the east side of the canyon and is one of the tallest peaks along the trail. Once you locate the peak, follow the left edge down to where it intersects with the other peak. From the intersection follow the small line of trees to the right. Can you spot the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/nature/arches.htm\">Crawford Arch?</a> </p> <h3>Connect</h3> <p>Have you wondered why Utah and the Colorado Plateau have so many natural arches? Sandstone throughout the region meets the favorable conditions for large natural arches to form. The rock is strong enough to support the weight of the arch but soft enough to be easily eroded by wind, water, and gravity.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a wide concrete path surrounded by shrub brush and junipers. To the south, the path extends towards the Zion Canyon Visitor Center. To the north, the path continues towards Canyon Junction. Connected to the path is a wooden shade structure, that covers an angled metal sign. A photograph taken within a narrow canyon spans the sign. The canyon’s smooth sandstone walls extend up and out of the picture. A peaceful Virgin River covers the canyon floor. A title in the top left corner reads, “The Master Sculptor.” Underneath the title, text says, “While the Virgin River carved the depth of the canyon, the work of rain and ice helped sculpt the wide canyon surrounding you now. Erosion and weather are natural geologic processes that shape the surface of the earth. Can you see evidence of their power in the landscape around you?” At the bottom of the sign, a quote from Henry David Thoreau reads, “The finest workers of stone are not copper or steel tools, but the gentle touches of air and water working at their leisure with a liberal allowance of time.” Four graphics on the sign’s right side depict the four stages of how canyons are created by layers of sediment slowly being carved down by the river and widened by freeze-thaw cycles and gravity. The top graphic shows red, cream, and pink layers of sediment with remnants of dinosaur bones and seashells representing the layers found in Zion Canyon. It is captioned, “Sediment layers are deposited over millions of years.” The second graphic shows the same layers but with an inverted-triangular section in the middle removed. A blue line across the bottom of the new canyon represents the Virgin River, which is implied to have eroded away the layers of sediment. The canyon walls are rugged, showing how various layers erode differently. A caption reads, “The Virgin River and its tributaries carve the depth of the canyon. Mudstone and siltstone erode more readily than sandstone.” The third graphic shows the eroded layers like the second graphic above, but with snow and rain droplets falling into small cracks in the top layer and freezing. The caption reads, “Zion only receives about 16” of rain annually, but that is enough to seep into cracks in rock layers. Winter freeze and thaw cycles cause the cracks to expand.” The bottom graphic shows the effects of this ice wedging. The jagged outcroppings shown in previous graphics have now fallen into the canyon below and the canyon walls are smoother. It is captioned, “Gravity causes the undercut rocks to fall from the steep cliffs; additional sediment is washed away.”",

On the southern end of the picnic area are two sandstone buildings connected by a concrete path. The first building is larger and is the new restroom facility. The second building is a smaller, historic building that used to be the restroom here. Further south is a gravel parking area fenced in by a split-rail wooden fence, which ends at a third sandstone building. This third building is known as The Grotto House, where artists-in-residence stay during their time at Zion. In the past, this building was the park’s first museum. On the opposite side of the road is a concrete path leading to a bridge that crosses the Virgin River. This is the trailhead for the West Rim and Kayenta trails.",

    "bodyText": "<h2>Zion Lodge</h2> <p>The Zion Lodge is located in the heart of Zion Canyon and offers unparalleled views of the towering sandstone cliffs. The lodge has a variety of accommodations and is the only place inside Zion to eat; either in the main dining room (Red Rock Grill) or at the Castle Dome Café (open seasonally). For more information about eating, visiting, or staying at the Zion Lodge, please visit their website at <a href=\"http://www.zionlodge.com/\">www.zionlodge.com</a> or call 435 772-7700.</p> <h4>Zion Lodge History</h4> <p><br /> In the early days of the National Park Service, railroad companies were often the catalyst for the creation or improvement of park accommodations. For Zion, that railroad was the Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad. With the completion of a railroad spur line to nearby Cedar City in 1923, visitors now had an easy and comfortable way to get to Zion. The next step was to provide lodging that complimented the world-class scenery.<br /> <br /> While initial designs of the lodge called for enormity and immensity, park officials ultimately determined that a lodge in the narrow canyon should better harmonize with the landscape and scale of the surroundings. Gilbert Stanley Underwood – a frequent architect of numerous national park lodges – was up to the challenge. Using 265,000 board feet of lumber brought down from the plateau by the Cable Mountain Draw Works, the Utah Parks Company designed a main lodge building that was inviting and exuded warmth. The Zion Lodge was completed in May of 1925, and was later complimented with a series of stand-alone cabins nestled nearby. These improvements signaled an important milestone in a visit to Zion National Park.<br /> <br /> The main lodge building stood for over 40 years until it was consumed by a fire on January 26, 1966. A mere 108 days after the fire, a new prefabricated building was up and operating. This quick turn-around speaks volumes about the significance that the Zion Lodge had garnered in the story of Zion National Park.<br /> <br /> Whether you're looking for a shady respite from the heat or hoping to dine among a majestic backdrop, the Zion Lodge is a beautiful place to stop. Visitors can even attend <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/ranger-led-activities.htm\">ranger-led activities</a> at the lodge, a service that started back in 1935. For many, the Zion Lodge has become a hallmark of a visit to the area, and occupies an important place in the history of Zion National Park.</p> <h4>Trails accessed from here:</h4> <ul> <li> <p>The Grotto Trail</p> </li> <li>Sand Bench Trail</li> <li>Emerald Pools Trails: Upper, Middle, and Lower Emerald Pools can all be accessed via the trailhead across the road from the Lodge</li> </ul> <h4>Shuttle Service</h4> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/zion-canyon-shuttle-system.htm\">Zion Canyon Shuttle Bus</a> is running, the Zion Lodge is shuttle stop #5 at the end of the canyon. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Lodge is located in the bottom of Zion Canyon, near the steep canyon walls that extend high above. A two story wood and stone structure with large square stone columns out front sheltering a patio with rocking chairs. The Lodge has a large lawn with a giant cottonwood tree in the middle that casts cooling shade in summer, making it a comfortable spot to relax. To the south, several other similar structures are built to house the hotel rooms and smaller rustic cabins.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Taft birthplace home and a portion of the cultural landscape has been restored to its appearance of 1857 - 1877 when Taft was growing up here. The Taft property, during the family's occupation, demonstrated qualities associated with both rural and urban landscapes. The front of the property contained simple plantings of trees, flowers and shrubs that fit into the urban landscape of the neighborhood. While the back of the property was more rural in nature. The suburban setting of large homes in which Taft grew up changed as the city grew around it. The restoration of the natural setting is important in helping to retain something of the original setting. Visitors to the site today will get a glimpse of the natural environment that William Howard Taft saw as a boy in this Mount Auburn neighborhood.<br /> <br /> The Taft family house was built in two phases.  The original section of the house was the front portion of the house, constructed in essentially a two-story, squared shape, facing Auburn Avenue.  It was completed in 1840.  Eleven years later, Alphonso Taft, William Howard's father, purchased the house for he and his expanding family.  Not long after purchasing the house and additional property around it, he began expanding the home by adding the portion on the house's eastern side, transforming the house into an \"L\" shape.  The new rear section followed the contour of the land and added a level to the overall plan.<br /> <br /> On September 15, 1857, William Howard Taft was born.  He and his siblings were raised in the home as the family played host to many social and political friends and events in the large house.  William would wind up leaving the family home when he entered Yale University in 1874.  The home would still house the Taft family for several more years, until 1889 when Alphonso and his wife moved to San Diego due to his declining health.<br /> <br /> The Taft family attempted to sell the home several times after Alphonso's death in 1891 but it wasn't until 1899 that his widow did sell the house.  Years would go by with the home changing hands a few times until the National Park Service became involved in plans to set aside the house and property as a National Historic Site in the 1960's.  Together, with William Howard Taft's son, Charles Taft, the home would finally be set aside and protected on December 2nd, 1969 when President Richard Nixon signed the legislation authorizing William Howard Taft National Historic Site.<br /> <br /> Read the story of how the Taft family home became a National Historic Site in the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/wiho/adhi/adhit.htm\">Administrative History book</a>.</p>",

After the war h</span>e began his career in this city, met his beloved wife, and ran for the highest office of the nation here. He was the last Civil War veteran elected president. His election in 1896 launched an era of Republican dominance that continued until 1910. McKinley governed during a period of intense American expansionism. Domestically, he supported policies that benefitted American business, including high protective tariffs and deflationary fiscal policies.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">On September 6, 1901, an anarchist shot McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He died eight days later. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">After lying in state at the United States Capitol, McKinley’s body returned to Canton.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Mark Hanna, McKinley's <span>lifelong friend, political mentor, and manager,</span> and some of McKinley’s friends immediately began planning a suitable memorial. They chose this site in Canton’s Westlawn Cemetery that McKinley once suggested would be an appropriate location for a soldiers’ and sailors’ memorial. The McKinley National Memorial Association, organized in 1901, purchased the site, and appealed to the public for the $600,000 needed to create the memorial. Construction began in 1905. Nine different States donated materials used in the memorial, completed in 1907. Ida McKinley died that year; she lies next to her husband in the memorial chamber. William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum, a private nonprofit organization under the umbrella of the Stark County Historical Society, administers the memorial and its grounds.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The McKinley Memorial that contains the tomb stands on a grass-covered hill overlooking the city of Canton. Designed by architect H. Van Buren Magonigle, the circular, domed pink granite building rises 96 feet above ground and measures 79 feet in diameter. The double bronze doors of the entrance were the largest in the nation at the time of installation. Originally a long, narrow reflecting pool stretched out from the base of the hill in front of the memorial. This feature, together with the 108 stone steps that lead up to the mausoleum, symbolized the President's sword in time of war. In 1951, a depressed lawn replaced the pool, but the sword effect remains. Midway up the steps is a large bronze statue by Charles Henry Niehaus of President McKinley delivering his last speech in Buffalo.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Colored marble laid in a cross pattern forms the floor of the mausoleum. The bodies of McKinley and his wife lie side by side in two polished, dark-green, granite sarcophagi, resting atop a ten-foot-square of polished dark maroon granite in the center of the space. Their two young daughters are also laid to rest here. Three semi-circular arched bays encircle the central chamber. The entablature and frieze extending around the bottom of the dome contain words from McKinley's last speech.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the </em></span><em><a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a></em><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><em>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded preservation work at the McKinley Memorial in 2000. </em></span></p>",

That’ll cool off things a little, and people could sit and wait ‘til the mess hall’s open.’ So we built a great big pond.”<br /> Block 22 kitchen worker, Harry Ueno<br /> <br /> It is serene here now, but Block 22 Garden, built as a gesture of compassion, was to become a testing ground of resistance at Manzanar. Deep generational differences and political divisions among those incarcerated met here and swirled around the garden’s controversial creator, incarcerated activist Harry Ueno.<br /> <br /> Ueno, who had been born in Hawaii and educated in Japan, spoke out against alleged black marketing of food supplies meant for the incarcerated population and defied camp administrators by unionizing mess hall workers. On the night of December 5, 1942, six masked men beat Fred Tayama, an alleged FBI informer. Ueno, accused of being one of six, was arrested. The next day, hundreds of angry supporters converged here to protest the jailing of the popular, outspoken Ueno. The protests and tensions that followed erupted into the Manzanar “riot” on December 6, 1942.<br /> <br /> Ancient Japan, the frontier West and the Owens Valley environment all met in this garden. Visualize the hug cottonwood stump, wagon wheels, old barrels, desert plants, and fish placed here. While sacred water flowing to a temple in Kyoto, Japan, have the garden its Japanese name, Otabe No Iki, the kitchen workers who built this garden called it “Three Sack Pond,” referring to the War Relocation Authority’s monthly limit of three sacks of cement per block for landscaping projects. This garden inspired incarceration Japanese Americans in other blocks to build similar gardens.<br /> <br /> To hear Harry Y. Ueno talk about his involvement in the creation of Block 22 garden and it's importance, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhLQAJMw9Nk&t=2s\">here</a>.</p>",

In each, you can find three distinct levels aligned north to south: a hill of earth represents the mountains for which water flows south to a pond, symbolizing an ocean or lake. Incarcerated Japanese Americans planted trees from the camp nursery and hauled stones from the rugged Inyo Mountains east of Manzanar.<br /> <br /> You can find crane and turtle rocks, which, found together are said to ensure ageless vitality.<br /> <br /> “Six months ago Manzanar was a barren, uninhabited desert.

    "bodyText": "America went to work for the war effort in 1942, and Manzanar was no exception. More than 500 young Japanese Americans wove camouflage nets here for the US Army. Since citizenship was a job requirement, most saw weaving nets as a chance to prove their loyalty—and earn some money. A friendly camaraderie grew among the crews—who often worked to big band music blaring from loudspeakers—as they turned out an average of 6,000 nets a month.<br /> <br /> The three 18’ tall sheds built on long concrete slabs soon became a flash point for discontent over wages and friction between citizens and non-citizens that spread throughout camps. The work proved hazardous, too, with those incarcerated enduring long hours of breathing find lint and contact with harsh dyes.<br /> <br /> The net factory closed after the Manzanar Riot in December 1942 and the sheds were converted to other purposes. The mattress factory produced 4,020 mattresses for the camp before fire destroyed it in 1943.",

With children “running wild,” parents and incarcerated teachers organized nursery school and other classes. In June 1942, Dr. Genevieve Carter of UC Berkeley was hired as Manzanar’s Superintendent of Education.</p> <p>As the task of creating a state-accredited school system got under way, elementary classes were held in recreation halls throughout the camp, while the high school took over barracks in Block 7. All initially lacked furniture, textbooks, and supplies. In May 1944, the barracks here in Block 16 were converted to an elementary school for 700 children.</p> <p>Teacher recruitment and retention was difficult given Manzanar’s isolation, relatively low pay, and daunting challenges, but some teachers asked to come and quite a few chose to remain. Moved by so many children uprooted from normal life, most dedicated themselves to bringing hope for a better future while promoting a “better understanding” of American ideals and institutions. Thousands of adults also attended classes, ranging from English and “Americanization” to auto mechanics and agriculture.<br /> <br /> To see silent images of the schools and students of Manzanar, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViHchiJkWOI\">here</a>.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Standing at this location in 1942, you would have been at the nerve center of camp life: First Street. Supply trucks and automobiles rumbled by on this thoroughfare, where the lines between camp life and the world outside seemed to intersect. The street always bustled with activity, as incarcerees and administrators worked together to transact the business of camp.</p> <p>White buildings on the street’s south side included the War Relocation Authority (WRA) offices and staff housing as well as the Town Hall, where elected block leaders met weekly. At the main post office, 1,500 letters arrived each day to be delivered to barracks addresses. On the north side of the street, black tar-papered barracks housed the police station, Manzanar Free Press newspaper office, and other camp functions and services. Wooden signs identifying each swayed outside in the Owens Valley wind.</p> <p>A typical morning on First Street saw secretary Mary Kageyama walking to her job at the Public Works office and Jack Takayanagi signing up for a softball league at the Community Activities office. Marian Fujimoto checked the job board for employment opportunities out of camp, while WRA staff children Art Williams and Fred Causey waited near the sentry post to catch the school bus to Independence.</p> <p>Manzanar Free Press reporter Sue Kunitomi enjoyed walking around camp to find out what was going on. “They had set up a co-operative,” she recalled. “It included beauty and barber shops, a shoe repair shop, dry goods store, and what we called the canteens—like a little grocery store.” The stores were located all over camp but were administered by the Manzanar Cooperative Enterprises here on First Street. Catalog companies like Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward also did brisk mail-order business in camp.</p>",

    "bodyText": "The small desert shrubs planted in front of the visitor center are Guayule (<i>Parthenium argentatum</i>). They typically grow in the southwest U.S. and northern Mexico, yet played a unique role in Manzanar’s history.<br /> <br /> During World War II, the U.S. needed rubber, but Japan controlled most of Southeast Asia where rubber trees (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>) grew. The situation was dire: without rubber for airplane and truck tires, gaskets, machine belts, fuel tank liners, boots, raincoats, gas masks, life rafts, and more, the U.S. could not fight the war.<br /> <br /> Japanese Americans in Manzanar, in collaboration with Dr. Robert Emerson, a Quaker and Plant Physiology Professor at California Institute of Technology (CalTech), successfully produced high quality natural rubber from guayule. They accelerated seed germination, invented equipment to extract more rubber in less time, and yielded more than twice the rubber from each plant compared to a large scale guayule project in Salinas. The tensile strength and elasticity of Manzanar’s rubber (5,000 PSI) exceeded the Salinas-produced rubber (3,600 PSI) and even the Hevea rubber tree in the South Pacific (4,200 PSI).<br /> <br /> This 1943 painting by artist Kango Takamura illustrates the proud achievements and dedicated service of incarcerated Americans who served their country honorably in the face of prejudice, and the success of scientific collaboration without discrimination.",

    "bodyText": "Life at Manzanar was uncertain, but the prospect of dying behind barbed wire, far from home, may have been unthinkable. On May 16, 1942, Matsunosuke Murakami, 62, became the first of 150 men, women, and children to die in camp. He and 14 others, most infants and older men without families, were laid to rest in this cemetery outside the barbed wire fence in an old peach orchard from Manzanar’s farming era. In the shadow of majestic Mt. Williamson, their somber funerals and memorials were attended by hundreds of mourners.<br /> <br /> While some deceased were sent to hometown cemeteries, most were cremated and their ashes held in camp until their families left Manzanar. Giichi Matsumura, an incarcerated man who died in 1945 while exploring the Sierra, is buried high in the mountains above.<br /> <br /> Today, only six graves here, including Matsunosuke Murakami’s, contain remains; families requested the removal of others after the war.<br /> <br /> I REI TO<br /> <br /> The Japanese Kanji characters read “Soul Consoling Tower.” Master stonemason Ryozo Kado, a Catholic, and Buddhist minister Shinjo Nagatomi designed this iconic monument as a permanent tribute to Manzanar’s dead. Kado built the obelisk with the assistance of Block 9 residents and a young Buddhists’ group, funded by 15-cent donations from each family in camp. Rev. Nagatomi carefully inscribed the monument’s characters—including “Erected by the Manzanar Japanese, August 1943” on the west side.<br /> <br /> While Rev. Nagatomi and Ryozo Kado live on in the memories of family and community, Kado also left his legacy in concrete and stone. He built the sentry post at the camp entrance and other camp features in his distinctive faux wood style.",

Under the guidance of Seigoro Murakami and Shigeo Tashima, 400 judo students practiced in Manzanar on a 40’ by 60’ canvas-covered sawdust platform. Judo’s demanding physical conditioning and code of behavior lifted spirits and introduced many young Japanese Americans to the disciplines and traditions of their cultural heritage.</p> <p>Framed by old cottonwood trees, the white dojo defied the camp’s monotonous, rectangular layout and stood in contrast to the black tarpapered barracks. Japanese sliding screens were added in winter. “When we weren’t practicing hard enough, Sensei (teacher) Murakami would open the screens and blast us with the cold air,” recalled Isamu Yamashita. Today visitors can see sidewalks that connected the dojo to a dressing and storage room, built on the foundation of Ed Shepherd’s ranch house from decades earlier.</p> <p>Enthusiasts of kendo (Japanese fencing) practiced in their own dojo just southwest of the Judo dojo. Most were among Manzanar’s Kibei population, American-born Japanese educated in Japan, whose strong cultural and political ties to that country sometimes put them in conflict with more Americanized Nisei. Following the 1943 “Loyalty questionnaire” crisis, many Kibei were sent to Tule Lake Segregation Center and, reported the Manzanar Free Press, “all interest in kendo has died away.”</p>",

    "bodyText": "“America is strong as it makes amends for the wrongs it has committed . . . we will always remember Manzanar because of that.”<br /> Sue Kunitomi Embrey<br /> <br /> Over the years, the cemetery monument has become as icon, inspiring a grass-roots movement to preserve Manzanar and remember the sacrifices of 120,313 Japanese Americans confined by their own government.<br /> <br /> Buddhist minister Sentoku Mayeda and Christian minister Shoichi Wakahiro first returned here on Memorial Day 1946. For the next 30 years, they made “pilgrimages” to honor Manzanar’s dead.<br /> <br /> Amid the 1960s civil rights struggles, younger Japanese Americans spoke out, shattering their elders’ silence and shame about the camps. On a cold December day in 1969, 150 people journeyed here on the first organized pilgrimage. An annual event ever since, the Manzanar Pilgrimage attracts hundreds of people of all ages from diverse backgrounds. On the last Saturday of April, they gather at the Manzanar Cemetery for a day of remembrance with speeches, a memorial service, and a traditional ondo dance.<br /> <br /> Visiting the cemetery anytime can be a personal pilgrimage—of reflection, worship, remembrance, or protest. Some people leave offerings—coins, personal mementos, paper cranes, water and sake, and religious items—as outward expressions of the ongoing, unspoken conversations about America’s past and its future.<br /> <br /> Sue Kunitomi Embrey, 1923-2006<br /> <br /> Sue Kunitomi arrived at Manzanar in May 1942, at age 19. In camp, she served as a teacher’s aid, wove camouflage nets to support the war effort, and worked as a reporter and then managing editor of the <i>Manzanar Free Press</i>.<br /> <br /> Years later Sue Kunitomi Embrey was among the first of her generation to speak out about the camps. As the driving force behind the Manzanar Committee, she organized the Manzanar Pilgrimage for 37 years and worked tirelessly to ensure that this site and its stories would be preserved to protect the human and civil rights of all.

You would have heard laughter, tears, music – the sounds of celebration and sadness that echoed through this building’s cavernous space. They linger in the stories of Manzanar, of those who worked and played here over many decades: incarcerated Japanese Americans, War Relocation Authority (WRA) staff, and Owens Valley residents.<br /> <br /> In just five months, incarcerated carpenters transformed standard government blueprints into a community auditorium for more than 5,000 people still confined here in June 1944.<br /> <br /> With a stage, locker rooms, and projection booth, the 14,000 sq. ft. building changed the way Manazanar gathered. Concerts, lectures, Japanese American cultural activities, and physical education classes filled its calendar – and often its 1,280-seat capacity. Tickets for dances, talent shows, and movie nights were 5 cents for children, 25 cents for adults, and 50 cents for camp staff, and “everyone else.”<br /> <br /> Standing Together<br /> <br /> A somber Manzanar community, including Project Director Ralph Merritt, center, gathered at the west entrance after an April 29, 1945 memorial service for Pfc. Sadao Munemori and Sgt. Robert Nakasaki, American soldiers killed in Italy on April 5, 1945, while their families remained confined at Manzanar.<br /> <br /> Built to Last<br /> <br /> The auditorium faced an uncertain future as Mananar closed in November 1945. Inyo County purchased it in 1947, and the Independence Veterans of Foreign Wars hosted community social and sports events here until 1951. The south wing was moved to Lone Pine in 1954, and Inyo County converted the auditorium to a road equipment maintenance shop where many local residents worked over the next forty years.<br /> <br /> A Place for Remembering<br /> <br /> Time, weather, and alteration had taken their toll when the National Park Service purchased the building in 1996. Six years later, a $3.5 million rehabilitation process began. On April 24, 2004, more than 2,500 formerly incarcerated Japanese Americans, local residents, and others celebrated the building’s dedication as Manzanar’s Visitor Center and park headquarters.<br /> <br /> To hear Rose E. Honda talk about her memories of the auditorium, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUSi4gCHbW8\">here</a>.<br /> To see silent film footage of a Manzanar graduation at the auditorium, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iP8I2Jgt08&t=13s\">here</a>.</p>",

Baseball was a powerful symbol of an American way of life that boosted morale and brought some sense of normalcy to a confined community. By summer 1942, nearly 100 men’s and 14 women’s softball teams were playing a full schedule of games. Teams like the <i>San Fernando Aces</i> and <i>San Pedro Gophers</i> came intact from their pre-war communities while other teams formed in camp. The <i>ManzaKnights</i> grew out of a popular young men’s social club while older men formed their own league. Women’s teams included the <i>Dusty Chicks</i>.<br /> <br /> Those incarcerated here joined sports of virtually every kind—basketball, volleyball, tennis, judo, sumo, weight-lifting, and golf—to combat boredom and stay active. But baseball was king! “Without baseball,” said one person, “life at Manzanar would be miserable.”",

    "bodyText": "<p>“The buildings were constructed for temporary use only, of wood throughout. The sides were covered with tar paper . . . Needless to say they were one of the greatest fire hazards possible.”<br /> Joseph Fine, Fire Protection Officer<br /> <br /> Fire poses a danger wherever people live, but Manzanar’s wood and tar paper buildings were especially prone to disaster. “The buildings within the blocks were too close together,” wrote Joseph Fine, Fire Protection Officer. “During high wind, fire could have raced out of control.”<br /> <br /> Manzanar’s layout was, in part, a fire prevention measure. The US Army separated groups of buildings with open areas called firebreaks. Keenly aware of the threat of fire, incarcerated Japanese Americans worked alongside government staff in developing a fire protection system.<br /> <br /> In April 1942, people had only garden hoses, water buckets, shovels, and one borrowed truck to fight fire. Soon the Army Corps of Engineers installed fire hydrants and provided hoses and nozzles. By August, each barracks had a fire extinguisher, installed by the staff of the Manzanar Fire Department.<br /> <br /> Japanese American firemen received a salary of $16 per month, while fire chiefs made $19. Most had no experience, but a report noted, “They were eager to learn and developed into good firemen.”<br /> <br /> Engineer Fred Nagai recalled, “We used to have fire drills once a week or twice a week and polish the fire truck. And the rest of the time you just laid around . . . play cards . . . That was the easiest job.” Yet over the course of three years, Manzanar’s fire personnel responded to nearly 100 fires.<br /> <br /> Manzanar’s largest fire occurred in the warehouse section on July 28, 1944. All paid and volunteer firemen reported to work. A strong south wind drove flames toward Block 4 as people rushed to wet down the roofs of their barracks and other nearby buildings. The fire destroyed warehouses 33, 34, and 35.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fire Station<br /> <br /> Construction crews built the fire station to support fire prevention and protection operations in Manzanar. They completed the central part of the structure in June 1942, and added the wings – serving as fireman dormitories, office space, and truck garages – in October 1942. Some Japanese Americans put personal touches to their work, inscribed dates, names, and phrases in the concrete foundation. Look for these inscriptions on the original ramp in front.<br /> <br /> Situated at the east edge of the camp, the fire station’s location was unfavorable. Fire chiefs and inspectors worried about increased response time to fires. They also complained about the slow fire alarm system, which delayed response time up to ten minutes. In 1944, the department requested the purchase of a fire siren, but it “was denied by Washington without further justification.”<br /> <br /> Despite these setbacks, Japanese American firemen successfully battled 91 fires, averting catastrophe for these incarcerated in Manzanar.<br /> <br /> Fire Engines<br /> <br /> For the first few months, Manzanar’s fire personnel relied on hand tools and a borrowed truck. On July 11, 1942, the Army Corps of Engineers delivered a new Ford engine with a pump capacity of 500 gallons per minute. The Dodge fire engine arrived on April 3, 1943, adding an additional 500 gallon pump capacity. Soon after, the Manzanar Motor Pool provided a pickup truck to carry an extra 1,000 feet of hose.<br /> <br /> After the war, the Bishop Fire Department purchased the Ford and used it for decades. They expanded the bed and added the ladder in the 1950s. The National Park Service acquired it in the 1990s. The Dodge was used by Lone Pine Fire Department before being transferred to the Keeler Volunteer Fire Department. Keeler used the truck for years. They donated it to Manzanar in 2017.</p>",

You don’t know what the outcome of the war is going to be. It’s just impossible to kind of consul them. You have to console them.”<br /> Dr. Masako Kusayanagi Miura<br /> <br /> The dust, poor food, and crowded conditions of Manzanar’s early weeks heightened fears of serious illness and epidemic. Rose Bannai Kitahara “started working as a nurse’s aid for the Public Health Department, going from barrack to barrack in the howling dust storms, and around open ditches to urge residents to complete their typhoid shots.”<br /> <br /> Initially, doctors treated patients in a single barracks without running water, adequate supplies, or equipment. Dr. Masako Kusayanagi Miura recalled only “five doctors and ten thousand people . . . we had old people, young people, women, children, everybody.”<br /> <br /> In July 1942, patients, staff, and equipment finally moved into a new 250-bed hospital complex built here. In sixteen connected buildings, the hospital housed operating rooms, laboratories, pharmacy, dental and eye clinics, a morgue, and staff quarters. Over a period of 3 ½ years, the hospital staff treated more than 70,000 cases.<br /> <br /> Most hospital employees were Japanese American. The hospital offered classes in nursing, stenography, and other fields. “When I first went to Manzanar hospital to work, I didn’t know any medical terminology,” said Mae Kageyama Kakehashi. After the war, she continued her career as a medical stenographer.<br /> <br /> Life began and ended at Manzanar. Doctors and nurses delivered 541 babies. Of the 11,070 people incarcerated here, 150 died.<br /> <br /> To hear George Tsuyoshi Iwamoto talk about having his tonsils out at the Manzanar Hospital, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-fAsUNGe5I\">here</a>.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Manzanar National Historic Site was established by Congress (PL 102-248) on March 3, 1992, to “provide for protection and interpretation of historical, cultural, and natural resources associated with the relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II.” While Manzanar is best known for its wartime history, its layers of the past echo the larger themes of American history, including displacement of native peoples, the settlement of ranchers and farmers, water wars, and the consequences of prejudice.<br /> <br /> It was—and is—a place of significance for the Paiute and Shoshone peoples who have lived in this valley for centuries. After 1860, the U.S. Army killed some Paiutes and drove many others out of the valley. Some Paiutes eventually returned, and their descendants maintain traditional affi liation and uses in the Owens Valley.<br /> <br /> In the early 1900s, farmers planted thousands of apple and other fruit trees in the town of Manzanar (Spanish for “apple orchard”), just as the city of Los Angeles was building an aqueduct to carry the valley’s water 200 miles south. In the mid1920s, Los Angeles bought out Manzanar’s farmers, and in 1941, Inyo County declared the town abandoned.<br /> <br /> No one could foresee how quickly and dramatically Manzanar would change in the aftermath of Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Newspapers, politicians, and labor leaders lobbied for action against people of Japanese ancestry, intensifying long-standing anti-Japanese prejudice on the West Coast. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, authorizing the military to forcibly exclude “any or all persons” from the West Coast. Under the direction of Lt. General John L. Dewitt, the army applied the order to everyone of Japanese ancestry, including more than 70,000 U.S. citizens. Half were under the age of 18. Ultimately, the government deprived 120,000 people of their freedom by forcing them to relocate.<br /> <br /> Those exiled to Manzanar were largely from the Los Angeles area and ranged in age from newborns to an 86-year-old widower. They were from cities and farms, young and old, rich and poor. Most had never been to Japan. They had only days or weeks to prepare. Businesses closed, classrooms emptied, friends separated. The U.S. government incarcerated a total of 11,070 people at Manzanar between March 21, 1942 and November 21, 1945. They lived within a 540-acre housing section, divided into 36 blocks. Military police manned eight guard towers and patrolled the camp’s barbed-wire perimeter fence. People crowded into barracks apartments, ate in communal mess halls, washed their clothes in public laundry rooms, and shared latrines and showers that aff orded almost no privacy. Within these exposed and cramped conditions, 188 couples married, 541 babies were born, and 150 people died.<br /> <br /> The camp closed in November 1945, three months after World War II ended. The government sold most of the structures and equipment as surplus. Concrete and rock features such as gardens and basements were buried. Manzanar’s prewar orchards, revived by Japanese Americans, again were abandoned. Time passed and much of Manzanar was further buried, both in sand and in memory. Many people chose not to talk about it.<br /> <br /> Buddhist and Christian ministers returned each year to the Manzanar cemetery to remember the dead. They gathered around the stark white obelisk that had been constructed in 1943, inscribed with characters meaning “soul consoling tower.” In 1969, a group came to the cemetery on their own pilgrimage of healing and remembrance. With the formation of the Manzanar Committee, this pilgrimage grew into an annual event attended by thousands. In 1972, the Manzanar Committee successfully lobbied to have Manzanar recognized as a California State Landmark. Later eff orts resulted in the site’s 1976 listing on the National Register of Historic Places and its 1985 designation as a national historic landmark. The advocacy of the Manzanar Committee ultimately resulted in the establishment of Manzanar National Historic Site in 1992.<br /> <br /> In 1983, nearly 40 years after the confi nement ended, the Commission on the Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians concluded: “Executive Order 9066 was not justifi ed by military necessity. . . . The broad historical causes that shaped these decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership.”<br /> <br /> Today, the National Park Service preserves 814 of the 5,415 acres that comprised the Manzanar War Relocation Center. The historic site includes the housing area, the administrative area where War Relocation Authority (WRA) staff lived and worked, the military police compound, the chicken ranch, the hospital site, and the cemetery. Most of the buildings are gone, but many features remain, including historic orchards and numerous Japanese gardens and ponds.<br /> <br /> Other features are buried, yet come to life through historic photos, artwork, archives, and hundreds of oral history interviews. The National Park Service restored the former camp auditorium to serve as a visitor center and park headquarters. A restored World War II-era mess hall and two reconstructed barracks in Block 14 (adjacent to the auditorium) feature exhibits on daily life and the many changes and challenges people faced at Manzanar. The National Park Service has also reconstructed one of the eight guard towers, along with the barbed-wire fence that surrounded the living area. More than 80,000 people visit the national historic site each year.<br /> <br /> Manzanar became a national historic site because people whose lives had been aff ected by it vowed that such an injustice should never happen again, to any group in this country. A visit to Manzanar is an invitation to consider our Constitution and the protections it promises at a place where—not so long ago—they were largely ignored.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded work to restore the perimeter fence around the camp cemetery</em><em> in 1999.</em></p>",

Since farmer Romeo Wilder planted pear trees here 1918, they have thrived in years of expert care and grown resilient through long decades of neglect. Manzanar’s Bartlett and Winter Nellis pears, as well as its prize-winning Winesap and Spitzenburg apples, brought profits to a few, but others’ dreams of wealth eventually withered like the trees themselves as water became more valuable than the fruit they produced. Today, visitors may walk among these trees and imagine how they have nourished, in both body and spirit, those who have called Manzanar home.</p> <p>1910-12: Envisioning an apple-growing empire, water developer George Chaffey’s Owens Valley Improvement Company plants 22,000 apple trees in the new Manzanar Irrigated Farms. By 1920, tons of apples, pears, and peaches are shipped across the nation.</p> <p>1927- The City of Los Angeles acquires all water rights and land at Manzanar. Under its management, large-scale fruit production continues until the City halts orchard irrigation in 1934.</p> <p>1942 – Japanese American crews prune, thin, and irrigate nearly 40 acres of abandoned orchards within Manzanar War Relocation Center. There were “some very fine trees” among them, said orchard foreman Takeo Shima. Several thousand crates of fruit are harvested and used in the mess halls.</p> <p>1945-1992- Many trees die, but a high ground water table keeps these and others nearby producing. In the fall, local townspeople harvest apples and pears for baking and preserving.</p> <p>Present – Since 2006, National Park Service arborists have rehabilitated more than 100 fruit trees, installing new irrigation systems, pruning, and grafting old stock to new roots to preserve Manzanar’s heirloom fruit varieties.<br /> <br /> To hear Kenji Suematsu discuss tasting a Manzanar pear while incarcerated at the Children's Village, click <a href=\"https://youtu.be/76Rd_xWjmkQ\">here</a>.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In spring 1942, the US Government transformed this landscape from an abandoned town to a “city” where it would forcibly confine more than 11,000 Japanese Americans. The abundance and quality of water was critical.Decades earlier, the Owens Valley Improvement Company built a creek-fed water system, including a small reservoir, for the farming town of Manzanar (Spanish for “apple orchard”).<br /> <br /> In May 1942, army contractor Vinson and Pringle began construction on this reservoir, also fed by Shepherd Creek. Reservoir infrastructure included a settling basin, sand trap, chlorine house, and storage shed. In 1943, Japanese American crews enlarged the 540,000-gallon reservoir to a 900,000-gallon capacity.The reservoir provided a daily supply of up to 1,500,000 gallons of water through 40,000 feet of pipes to faucets outside Manzanar’s barracks and into mess halls, latrines, and laundry rooms. The system also supplied 84 fire hydrants, Victory Gardens, and dozens of Japanese gardens.The camp closed in 1945. For decades after the war, Owens Valley locals came here to swim. Although no longer in use for water storage, the reservoir is an important part of Manzanar’s history.<br /> <br /> Inscriptions<br /> <br /> The inscriptions in the reservoir’s concrete illustrate a sampling of attitudes among Japanese Americans. Embedded pebbles in the wall around the reservoir spell out: “STONE WALL BY THE EMERGENCY CREW 2/25/43.” The Emergency Crew performed vital work, but it was hard labor and thought to be one of the worst jobs in camp. The camp administration considered some of the crew members uncooperative. Some inscriptions reflect feelings of alienation: pro-Japanese and anti-American sentiments occur alongside names, initials, and dates. But artistic touches – rustic stone lanterns and decorative upright rocks – suggest that the reservoir crews took pride in their work. One inscription, the Japanese character for “peace,” echoed the hopes of thousands of people confined at Manzanar.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In an old pear orchard, 101 American-born children ranging from newborns to 18 year olds lived in the Children’s Village, the only orphanage in any war relocation center. Living in three specially-built barracks and nurtured by a dedicated Japanese American staff and others, they became a unique wartime family. Nearly half had been brought from west coast institutions and foster homes. Others were temporarily separated from families when their parents were arrested or became ill or were infants born to unwed mothers.<br /> <br /> Children’s Village was landscaped with lawns, flowers, and cherry trees. Japanese American staff built playground equipment and furniture and collected money for toys and other items, while some Owens Valley neighbors brought freshly-baked cookies and clothing. The children made friends through camp schools, churches, clubs, and sports and even formed their own baseball team. “But however much we encouraged our children to participate in the life of the larger community, we remained separate from it,” recalled Lillian Matsumoto.<br /> <br /> To hear from Annie Sakamoto, who was in the Children's Village as a child, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q26NRTUY3F0\">here</a>.<br /> To hear from Celeste Loi Teodor, who was in the Children's Village as a child, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxK7_-iS5ZQ\">here</a>.<br /> To hear from Dennis Tojo Bambauer, who was in the Children's Village as a child, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atsczVyot08\">here</a>.<br /> To hear from Kazuye Suyematsu, who was in the Children's Village as a child, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjRBqM-l76A\">here</a>.</p>",

You know, that's what you call survival.”<br /> <br /> Although the barracks improved, life for many became more challenging in 1943. The government forced everyone 17 and older to answer what came to be called the Loyalty Questionnaire. Authorities planned to use peoples’ answers to draft young Japanese American men into the army, clear some people for resettlement in the Midwest or East Coast, and to identify those to be segregated into a high security camp.<br /> <br /> As soon as Japanese Americans came to Manzanar, they started organizing a school system. “The first Manzanar Schools bring back memory of aching backs and muscles. There wasn’t any chairs to sit on and we had to sit on the floor and read & write,” Henry Nakano wrote in 1943. “Now Manzanar High School is well organized and is a place where we can get an education.”</p>",

The tower was the only icon—that and the barbed wire.”<br /> — Sue Kunitomi Embrey, at the 2005 dedication of the replica tower<br /> <br /> From 1942 to 1945, eight US Army guard towers loomed over the more than 11,000 Japanese Americans held in Manzanar. For most of that time, US Military Police manned the towers, a visual reminder that the unconstitutionally incarcerated people were not allowed to leave without permission.<br /> <br /> “The barbed wire . . . separated us from the rest of the world,” Shi Nomura remembered. “With the shouted warnings from the armed guards on the towers, we learned to keep our distance.”<br /> <br /> A 1942 newsreel claimed that the Japanese Americans were not prisoners but “merely dislocated people—the unwounded casualties of war.” However, even children couldn’t help but notice that the MPs aimed their weapons inward toward them.<br /> <br /> John Tateishi was a toddler in Manzanar. His mother walked him to the barbed wire fence and warned him to stay away from it and the towers. “As she was telling me this, I was looking up at this guard . . . he had a rifle,” Tateishi said. “I was old enough to know when a soldier has a rifle, he uses it for one thing.”<br /> <br /> After Manzanar War Relocation Center closed on November 21, 1945, the guard towers were removed, yet they remain a powerful icon of confinement.<br /> <br /> Toyo Miyatake took this photo of guard tower number 4 on the west edge of Manzanar. The concrete footings remain at that site.<br /> <br /> To hear from Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston speak about the guard towers, click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zxhe8kGCJ0\">here</a>.<br /> To hear John K.

Is this for us?’”<br /> <br /> In each block, two latrines—one for women and one for men—served about 300 people. Women’s latrines had ten toilets, men’s had eight and a urinal. Francis Kikuchi recalled, “The pots were sitting right next to each other . . . if you're going, you're sitting there rubbing elbows.\"<br /> <br /> Although the women’s latrines (and some of the men’s) did get partitions between the toilets, many people never forgot the humiliation of those early months using a latrine.<br /> <br /> Manzanar showers also lacked privacy. “We all had to take a shower together, you know, that one big room,” Aiko Alice Inouye remembered. “So I went at midnight. And everybody else, all the other women had the same idea.”<br /> <br /> To hear Grace K.

A gazebo built of locust wood stood on a concrete foundation nearby, and two upright stones marked the park’s southern corners.

Paiutes utilized this valley’s natural resources. They built conical shelters called <i>novi </i>from birch branches covered with tule grass and willow stems. They fashioned bows of juniper to hunt deer and mountain sheep in the Sierra Nevada and Inyo Mountains. They caught fish and freshwater mussels from the creeks and developed a flood-irrigation system to enhance the growth of native plants.  Paiute women harvested <i>tuva</i> (pine nuts) from mountains and prepared them using <i>suhava</i> (willow) baskets.<br /> <br /> After 1861, miners, ranchers, and farmers settled in this area, bringing an economy that clashed with Paiute culture; cattle destroyed native crops, fences divided the valley, and homesteads encroached on villages. After two years of warfare, the US Army forced over one thousand Paiutes from this valley in 1863, but many returned.",

The drama of our frontier community began to unfold. . . ”<br /> Eva Lee Shepherd</p> <p>In 1864, cattleman John Shepherd homesteaded 160 acres of fertile land and brought his young family to a small adobe cabin he built nearby. As one of the first Euroamerican settlers in the area, Shepherd employed dozens of Paiute men and women, whose labor helped him prosper. He supplied mining camps with beef, hay, and grain, hauled ore to Southern California, and operated a toll road to eastside mines. By 1900, the Shepherd Ranch encompassed 1,700 acres. Much of it would become Manzanar War Relocation Center.</p> <p>In 1873, Shepherd built an elegant nine-room home. With water piped to its kitchen and an ornate fountain in the front yard, it was called “the showplace of the Owens Valley.” You would have seen the home’s tall white gables from far down the dusty Inyo County Wagon Road. Shaded by walnut, apple, and poplar trees, it became a popular stopping place and the center of a lively Owens Valley social life.</p> <p>John Shepherd retired and sold the ranch to water developer George Chaffey in 1905. The house was headquarters for Chaffey’s Owens Valley Improvement Company and home to its farm superintendents. In 1924, the City of Los Angeles purchased the property, and with the orchard community’s decline after 1930, the buildings were moved, burned, or torn down.</p>",

    "bodyText": "“A wonderful community atmosphere—picnics in the cottonwood grove, Christmas programs, and ice cream socials—brought everyone together in kindred spirit.”<br /> Gladys Graham Branson, former Manzanar town resident<br /> <br /> Step back in time along to the early 20<sup>th</sup> century fruit-growing community that once occupied this area and gave Manzanar its name. In 1910, developer George Chaffey started the town as part of a 3,000-acre agricultural community. By 1920, Manzanar was an oasis of fragrant orchards, hay fields, and gardens. Two hundred people lived here then, many on irrigated farm parcels. Fifty children attended the grammar school. It had “two rooms and two outside conveniences [toilets], plus a shed for the horses,” recalled former student Dorothy Lydston Gates.<br /> <br /> Within Manzanar’s town center was the Bandhauer’s General Store, where residents traded farm produce for dry goods and mailed letters at the post office inside. You could buy gas at the garage across the highway and cold cider at the fruit stand nearby. The big community hall housed a library and was the scene of weddings, funerals, and church services. Potluck suppers and old-time dancing often filled the hall with music and laughter far into the night. Packing crews later used it to process tons of Manzanar apples, pears, and peaches to ship across the country.<br /> <br /> Advertisements for the Manzanar fruit-growing venture had promised the Lydstons, Wilders, and other families “fortunes in Apples.” But as Los Angeles began buying land and water rights in 1924, many owners sold—some willingly, others under duress—and left. Although others leased back their land and continued farming, the community slowly declined. By the late 1930s, there was little left at Manzanar except abandoned orchards and roads.",

It was like there was a force field separating us. It was not there to see, but it could be felt.”<br /> Arthur Loren Williams<br /> <br /> War Relocation Authority workers and their families – more than 400 people – lived within the same barbed wire fence that confined 11,000 Japanese Americans. But those government workers enjoyed higher pay, better apartments, and freedom.<br /> <br /> What was it like to live here?<br /> <br /> “When people are thrown together day after day and at the end of the working hours still find themselves in each other’s presence, there is no way, short of a deep and lasting coma, for them to ignore their fellow man,” Manzanar music teacher Lou Frizzell wrote. “In time, this constant awareness makes everyone decide that everyone else is a little peculiar, and I suppose everyone is.”<br /> <br /> Children of the staff “were all in the same boat,” according to Art Williams, whose father was assistant police chief. “There was no ‘new kid on the block’ barrier to penetrate. Everyone lived in similar housing.” Older WRA kids road a school bus six miles north to Independence, while many younger ones attended school in Manzanar.<br /> <br /> Some WRA staff and Japanese Americans established close working relationships and even friendships. Staff attended churches and funerals, and enjoyed sporting events, movie nights, and “Symphony Under the Stars” in the firebreaks.<br /> <br /> What became of the buildings?<br /> <br /> The WRA structures were built to a higher standard than the barracks that Japanese Americans lived in. Until the early 1950s, the apartments were rented to locals to help alleviate the post-war housing shortage. The buildings were later sold and moved to local communities, where many remain.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>“We have problems to combat here which are new to us. We don’t know these hot dry winds. There are no rabbits to plague us . . . Everything is so different and we have to do much experimenting.”<br /> John Fukasawa, a Manzanar farm foreman<br /> <br /> Manzanar receives very little rain, but in the late spring, snow melting in the Sierra Nevada replenishes nearby streams. Tumbling down granite-walled canyons, those streams bring water that infuses life into this high desert landscape. For centuries, humans have harnessed that water to coax food from the land.<br /> <br /> Paiutes diverted stream water to irrigate plots of edible native plants. After passage of the Homestead Act in 1862, farmers and rangers who came to support nearby miners staked claims on those irrigated fields. North of Manzanar is a slender line of cottonwood and willow trees marking Shepherd Creek, named for a family that settled here in 1864. Later ranchers and farmers dug canals to irrigate hay and grain fields. In 1905, brothers George and Charles Chaffey began buying land to subdivide into the orchard farms that gave Manzanar (Spanish for apple orchard) its name. George Chaffey installed concrete irrigation pipes to conserve water, and by 1921 there were 20,000 fruit trees growing at Manzanar. In the 1920s, the City of Los Angeles bought up Manzanar farms to secure additional water rights for the city. Inyo County declared the town of Manzanar abandoned in 1941.<br /> <br /> The War Relocation Authority utilized Manzanar’s abundant water supply to make the camp as agriculturally self-sufficient as possible. Japanese Americans restored earlier canals and pipes, and diverted Shepherd Creek into a 900,000 gallon reservoir constructed northwest of here in 1942. In fields north and south of the camp’s living area, they cultivated 440 acres with 35 varieties of vegetables, grains, and fruits. In the area in front of you, victory gardens flourished, yielding bountiful vegetables and colorful flowers.<br /> <br /> Water Wars<br /> <br /> During the early 1900s, a thirsty, growing Los Angeles looked toward Owens Valley for its water. In 1913, the 233-mile Los Angeles Aqueduct started carrying much of the water south. Hailed as an engineering triumph and still in use, the aqueduct remains a flashpoint for conflicts over the region’s water and environment. Since the 1920s, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) has owned nearly all land and water rights in the valley.<br /> <br /> The federal government leased Manzanar from LADWP from 1942-1947. Fifty years later, the US government exchanged other federal land to create Manzanar National Historic Site.</p>",

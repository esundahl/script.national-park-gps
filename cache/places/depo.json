    "bodyText": "<p>Approximately 80,000 years ago, a lava flowed from an unknown location upstream from the location of today's monument. As it flowed down the valley, it eventually ran into an obstruction which served as a dam to the lava's path. Pooling up to 400 feet behind the natural dam, the lava cooled. Conditions were such that the lava--that was incredibly uniform in its mineral composition--cooled at a very slow rate. As it cooled, it contracted and cracked, forming hexagonal columns. 65,000 years later, a glacier flowed through the same valley, revealing the sides and tops of the columns. Glacial polish can still be seen today at the top of the formation.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Just a 2.5 mile walk from the Devils Postpile Ranger Station, Rainbow Falls is the highest waterfall on the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin river. Plunging 101-feet, the falls are aptly named for the many rainbows that appear in its mist on sunny summer days. Visitors interested in a moderate day-hike can make a loop, embarking from the Ranger Station's trailhead to the waterfall and returning via Shuttle Bus Stop 9 (Rainbow Falls Trailhead) or Shuttle Bus Stop 10 (Reds Meadow Resort). The bus can return hikers to the monument's ranger station, other bus stops in the Reds Meadow Valley, or the Adventure Center in Mammoth Lakes. Be sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen for every member in your hiking group as the walk to the Rainbow Falls is very hot, dry, and has little shade.</p>",

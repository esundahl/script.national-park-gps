    "bodyText": "In this approximate location, running North to South, was the Confederate picket line held by the 63<sup>rd</sup> GA regiment. A picket line is a forward defensive position, usually made up of several shallow depressions or ‘rifle pits’. The men in these positions were the first to be engaged in the frontal assault on Pigeon Hill. Just a few weeks prior, the 63<sup>rd</sup> GA troops had been on the relatively quiet assignment of garrison duty in Savannah, GA. Many of them were very inexperienced in the hard marching and fierce fighting that would make up much of the Atlanta Campaign. A few hundred of these green troops would attempt to defend these positions.Under Brigadier General Joseph Lightburn, 7 regiments of battle hardened Union troops made the first push here at around 8:00 am. The untested and outnumbered GA troops waited too late to fire their first volley and quickly became overrun. In their haste to retreat, they collided with another regiment trying to reinforce the position. Private Celathiel Helms describes this chaotic moment and the officer that ordered the reinforcements: “This loss wold not have been verey mutch if it had not been for the [Major]. He made them charge on the yankys and the yankys had ten men to thir one. I recon the [Major] wanted to git his wants but I think it will com [contrary] to his [expectations] or at leas the [privates] will not think any the more of him for his bravery and not so mutch the bravery as the fool”.Shortly after the Confederates had been pushed back from this spot, the Union soldiers came under heavy artillery fire from Pigeon Hill ahead. Major Thomas T. Taylor, of the 47<sup>th</sup> Ohio said that they “faced the sheeted flame filled with missiles, giving forth ten thousand shrieks and tones, intensified by the cries of agony and the torture of the wounded..”. The new Union position was extremely exposed in an open field with little to no cover. Despite pushing past the Confederate picket line, Union soldiers here were forced to seek shelter and wait for nightfall before they fell back to their main line.",

It reads \"CSA 63rd Georgia, Mercer's Brigade, Walker's Division, Hardee's Corps. Directly in front of this position is a large tree line, running from left to right. To the right is a wooden fence separating the field from the parking lot.",

    "bodyText": "This was a Confederate defensive position occupied by Brigadier General Francis Cockrell’s ‘Orphan’ Brigade. A veteran collection of seven regiments, the 1<sup>st</sup> MO Brigade had fought since the beginning of the war at battles like Corinth and Vicksburg. They were responsible for holding the position on these rocky slopes against the furious Union assaults. On the offense was Brigadier General Giles Smiths’ brigade. The terrain and defensive works of the Confederates proved to be extremely effective in holding them off. While a few Union soldiers managed to make it to the works themselves, they were quickly killed or wounded. In recounting the Confederate response to the assault, Private James Bradley of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Consolidated MO regiment writes “Suddenly as if the mountain had burst wide open from crest to base along the ridge, and poured forth all the pent-up fire of buried ages, a blaze shot out of the whole length of the Confederate line… The enemy did not reel or stagger, they were literally swept down the mountain side”. James A. Kennerly of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Consolidated MO regiment wrote “We mowed them down like hay, killing one colonel, on major, and.. several other officers.”  If you look at the wayside sign here, you may notice that the rock in the phot is just a few yards ahead of you. This is a rare visible remnant from the past.",

To the front is an interpretive wayside highlighting a historic photograph. This black and white was taken from this exact location shortly after the battle. The proof of this is a large boulder near the center of the photo. This same boulder is visible just over the fence line in the trench. Just in front of the boulder is a small gray sign that reads \"Confederate Cockrell's Brigade, French's Division, Loring's Corps\"",

And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, for the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods”. This brigade would suffer heavy casualties during the fighting that would follow. ",

    "bodyText": "This is the position of Captain C.L Lumsden’s Alabama Battery. Thought to have been made up mostly of 12 pound Napoleon cannons, this battery would have had an effective range of up to one mile. Notice the position behind and above the trenches meant for the infantry. This would allow the artillery to shoot over the heads of the soldiers defending the slope at their front. During the Confederate occupation of the Kennesaw Line, Lumsden’s Battery would actually move to this position from the peak of Kennesaw Mountain before the battle. Robert Maxwell, a gunner in this battery, describes a hellish scene from near this spot: “ Fire! All four guns belched at once… Within five minutes, the enemy’s batteries opened on us with all the guns that could be brought to bear on us. Passing over, striking the front of the works, striking the ground in our front, and ricocheting over us, knocking down our embrasures, bursting right above the top of our works.” During this barrage, one of Maxwells’ cannoneers would be decapitated by a Union artillery shell. The shell traveled through the soldier and into the ammunition chest behind the cannon, causing a large explosion. This chaotic scene is thought to be the inspiration for the painting “Thunder On Little Kennesaw” by Don Troiani. The young man who was killed during this engagement was a soldier from Georgia named ‘Gurley’. Maxwell describes him as “a country boy who never under any circumstances showed any excitement” and who “was just as cool and calm as at any other time” in the moments before his death.",

Major General Benjamin Cheatham (for whom this location is named) planned his defense very strategically. As early as June 24th, Cheatham would order the batteries \"to be closely masked with brush and under no circumstances to reply to the artillery of the enemy'. This strategy would be effective in essentially keeping the Federals in the dark as to where the Confederate artillery was and what kind of artillery they had. As a result, when the thickly amassed column of Union infantry approached during the battle on the 27th, they made it to within 60 yards of this position without knowing any cannons were there at all. Cheatham writes \"The advance was nearly all swept down by the first volley, the remainder being driven in confusion into the ranks of the assaulting mass\". Also, this and the batteries on the right and left of it created a deadly crossfire for the upcoming infantry, creating chaos. This 2 gun section was commanded by John W. Mebane, under Liutenant J. W. Phillips. The guns in this section were most likely 12 pound Napoleans, just like the ones that sit here today. ",

    "bodyText": "The Union frontal assault at Pigeon Hill was one of two attempts to break the Confederate defenses along the Kennesaw line on June 27<sup>th</sup>, 1864. While there were not as many casualties here as there were at Cheatham Hill, the assault was still especially difficult. This was largely due to the steep and rocky terrain. The Confederates held the high ground, using the natural defenses to their advantage. It had been raining for nearly 3 weeks prior to the battle, so the Union forces also had the marshy, muddy ground at the foot of the hill to contend with. A portion of the force became lost and began climbing up the draw between Pigeon Hill and Little Kennesaw, right into the face of the cannon positioned there. The only Union victory happened at the foot of the hill, when they drove 7 companies of green Confederate troops from the 63<sup>rd</sup> GA out of their rifle pits during a frenzy of hand- to- hand fighting. This soon turned to disaster, however, as they tried to clamber up the hill itself. The US Army monument (in the open field) was erected to commemorate this small victory. The battered Union troops waited until nightfall and then slipped back to their camps, defeated.<br /> <br /> Pigeon Hill can most easily be accessed by parking in the Burnt Hickory Parking Lot and hiking north across the road. This area can also be reached from the other direction by hiking south from Little Kennesaw Mountain. <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "Pigeon Hill is a small rise or spur just south of Little Kennesaw. Coming from that direction, Pigeon Hill rises gently from a wooded, grassy area and becomes fairly steep and rocky towards it's peak. The smaller rocks give way to large boulders and interspersed smaller trees. The trail over the top of Pigeon Hill winds in and out of these boulders and over several sections of flat rock. The western side of the slope (which was where the Union assault came from) drops steeply off into a heavily wooded area. Also at this location is a Confederate defensive position, marked by a manufactured trench dug in amongst the rocks, providing significant cover. On a clear day, the peak of Pigeon Hill offers commanding views to the south west of Marietta and Lost Mountain, a shadowy peak some 10 plus miles away. Over the flat rock and boulders of the peak, the trail down the southern slope descends steeply but steadily though one more Confederate trench line and eventually ends at Burnt Hickory Road.",

    "bodyText": "According to local tradition, Pigeon Hill was given its name because it served as a roosting site for migrating flocks of passenger pigeons before their destruction in the late Nineteenth Century. Most wartime military reports simply refer to it as the Kennesaw Spur. By 1860 the New Salem community, with its several small farms, Baptist church, saw mill and small school house, stood along the Burnt Hickory Road at the base of Pigeon Hill. The Hardage, York, Wallis, and Kirk families lived, worked, studied and worshipped in this peaceful and thriving agrarian neighborhood. They grew wheat, maize, sweet potatoes, cotton, peas, beans and oats. Generally the livestock consisted of oxen to pull the wagon or plow, a milking cow, some hens to lay eggs, a sheep or two for wool and a few hogs. Most of the families had 40 to 80 acres of land cleared to farm. Wood-frame houses or log cabins provided shelter for the family while various out buildings stood conveniently near within the farm itself. Rough-hewn worm-rail fences snaked around the fields, preventing free-ranging animals from invading crops. Farm life was difficult. The constant labor was physically and mentally exhausting. Sunday, a day for attending services at New Salem Baptist Church, socializing, and resting, offered hard-working families a welcome respite from farm chores. In the summer of 1864 this peaceful way of life was disrupted by the arrival of the two competing armies. The crest and western slope of Pigeon Hill were occupied by Confederate forces under the overall command of General Joseph E. Johnston. Arrayed against the Confederates were elements of the Union army commanded by Major General William T. Sherman. On June 27<sup>th</sup>, 1864, roughly 4,500 Union soldiers would attack the area that you are about to visit.",
    "audioDescription": "At this location, the visitor is standing on a hard-packed dirt trail facing a large open field. The trail snakes off to the right, while the field itself is surrounded by trees on two sides. To the far left of the field is the often busy Burnt Hickory Rd. Pigeon Hill is not visible from this location, but just on the other side of Burnt Hickory Road to the left/north.",

The one-mile hike from the Visitor Center to this point is one of the more popular (and challenging!) trails in the park. Offering commanding views to the north and south, this mountain has been significant for centuries. Native Americans were said to have named it either after a prominent Chief in the area, or from the term ‘Ghaneesah’, which meant ‘sacred place’ or ‘burial place’. Looking to the south, you can see several large skylines, the two most prominent being Buckhead and Atlanta. Looking to the north, you can see the path of Cobb Parkway stretching to the northwest horizon. Also, on a clear day, you can see the distant range of the Allatoona Mountains.</span></span></span>",

The tree line rings the base of this rock. On a clear day, the view to the south shows the Marietta Square, as well as the skylines of Buckhead and downtown Atlanta. You can also see the humped profile of Stone Mountain to the south west. To north, the view is of the major road Cobb Parkway/Highway 41 stretching into the distance, as well as the Allatoona Mountains on the horizon. This was the direction from which Sherman's 3 armies approached the Confederate defensive position at the top of the mountain.",

    "audioDescription": "The quickest, easiest way to access this site is from the trail head at Gilbert Road. From this trail head, you will walk about 1/10 of a mile through a small field, and then into a shaded wood line. The narrow, rocky, well worn path weaves eastward through dense trees, with a large field on your left. Eventually, on your right, is the first evidence of this site's usefulness 160 plus years ago. Barely noticeable to the naked eye, about 50 feet from the trail is a shallow depression. On the side of the depression opposite the trail, are two large mounds. This marks the first of the more than 20 remaining artillery positions from this original battery. When it was operational, the cannon would have sat in this depression with the barrell pointed out between the two mounds (which would have protected the crew and the gun itself). The cannon in this first position is a slim, black, iron cannon known as a 3 inch ordinance rifle. As you continue down the trail, you next pass an interpretive sign detailing the effectiveness of this site during the battle. As you continue, there are three more cannons in the positions of the previous. Two of them are the same slim black ordinance rifles, the third is a shorter, wider cannon, green with patina and age. This cannon would have constructed with bronze instead of the iron of the others, has a lesser range, and is known as a 12 pound Napolean. The trail continues eastward, with the empty artillery emplacements spaced out evenly on the left. Eventually, the trail ends at the picnic area near the Visitor Center. The total one way mileage is 1.5 miles.",

    "bodyText": "The attack on the Confederate position was designed to be a heavy frontal assault. Two brigades were to charge up this very hill in order to break through the earthworks at the top. The obstacles for the Union soldiers were immense. The earthworks at the crest stood up to 8 feet tall and were topped with head logs that protected the Rebels behind them. In addition to that, the Confederates had placed a series of formidable field fortifications directly in the Union path. Colonel Alan Fahnestock of the 86<sup>th</sup> Illinois infantry describes the scene: “They had logs with sharp sticks through the log like hay racks (called Chevalle de Frise), the ends bound together with wire”. These defenses, along with cleverly hidden Confederate artillery, causes the Union assault to falter, and then to stop completely. The fighting at the crest of the hill just ahead became some of the bloodiest and violent of the entire battle. Confederate soldier Sam Watkins of the 1<sup>st</sup> Tennessee Infantry writes “Yet still the Yankees came. It seemed impossible to check the onslaught… a solid line of blazing fire right from the muzzles of the Yankee guns being poured right into our very faces, singeing our hair and clothes, the hot blood of our dead and wounded spurting on us, the blinding smoke and stifling atmosphere filling our eyes and mouths, and the awful concussion causing the blood to gush out of our noses and ears, and above all, the roar of battle, made it perfect pandemonium… Hell had broke loose in Georgia sure enough.”",

The name comes from not only the bloodshed, but also the 'dead space' offered by the angle, meaniing that anyone in this postiion would not be visible to those in the earthworks above. Still visible today, this bulge or 'salient' in the Confederate defenses was where roughly 8 regiments (over 1,000) of Union soldiers concentrated their attack. Making it past the various field fortifications, the Federals make it to the top of the 8 foot tall earthen works and the fighting dissolves into hand to hand combat, with men using their muskets as clubs. Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee Infantry writes \"My pen is unable to describe the scene of carnage and death that ensued in the next two hours...talk about other battles, victories, shouts, cheers, and triumphs, but in comparison with this day's fight, all other dwarf into insignificance.\"<br /> <br /> Despite the 'carnage', the Confederate line held. Lieutenant Thomas Maney of the 1st Tennessee writes 'the word passed down to us to hold the works at all hazards, and it did look as if we would be pushed back by sheer force. But stand we must, and stand we did.\" The Union soldiers attacking both sides of the angle would fall back, but the ones assaulting the angle itself would dig in directly below the works, taking advantage of the 'dead space'. Today, the Illinois Monument marks that position. <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "Walking along a wide dirt path, low earthen mounds run along the left side. At this location, the mounds begin to curve in the opposite direction, creating an 'angle. Directly opposite of the 'angle' is an informational wayside sign describing the location, with a painted depiction of the battle. Just beyond the sign is the 25ft high marble Illinois Monument. This location is located at the peak of a gently sloping hill, which overlooks a large field at the base. Around the trails and field is heavily wooded.",

He was shot about 4 inches below the collar bone, in the right breast, falling outside of the fortifications.” McCook was believed to have been wounded in close vicinity to this location. After his wound, he would be carried to the rear of the action. He was then transported back to his home in Ohio, where he died on July 17<sup>th</sup>, 1864.

Howard said of Harker “The only complaint I ever heard was that if Harker got started against the enemy, he could not be kept back… Whenever anything difficult was to be done, anything that required pluck and energy, we called on Gen. Harker.” Harker’s 3<sup>rd</sup> brigade of seven regiments was ordered to charge this section of the Confederate works. In the early morning hours of the 27<sup>th</sup>, Harker was seen sealing and finishing up several letters home. In what was noted as potentially an eerie premonition, Harker gave a member of his staff his personal papers and said “I shall not come out of the charge today alive”. A few hours later, while at the front of the charge and urging his men forward, a bullet tears through his arm and enters his chest. He would fall near this spot. A private from Illinois would later write “Several of the men nearest him spang up to carry him off the field; of these some were struck down at once, but others filled their places.” A surgeon would declare his wound fatal and Gen. Harker would die by 1:00 pm later that day.",

The united testimony from his commander as to his courage, consistency, and patriotic devotion to his country is in conclusion evidence of the esteem in which he was held by them. …Copernicus was my messmate in many campaign, he and myself have messed and slept together and especially on this last one he and I shared the same tent and bed. On the morning of the 27<sup>th</sup> of June, we rose from our bed beneath our shelter tent and after breakfasting filled our knapsacks and started to the fatal charge. …He fell gloriously on the field.

His remains were moved to this current location in order to be closer to the trail.

His grave sits directly in between in what was both the Union and Confederate lines.<br /> <br /> From an exerpt reflecting on the 'Unknown' by Walt Whitman: \"And everywhere among these countless graves - everywhere in the many Soldiers Cemeteries of the Nation ... - as at the time in the vast trenches, the depositories of slain, Northern and Southern, after the great battles - not only where the scathing trail pass'd those years, but radiating since in all the peaceful quarters of the land - we see, and see, and ages yet may see, on monuments and gravestones, singly or in massess, to thousands or tens of thousands, the significant word..

Ah, but little can a peaceful citizen imagine the horror of war...At this stage our colonel, Will H. Martin, sang out, \"'Boys, this is butchery,\"' and, mounting our head logs, with a white hankerchief, he sang out to the Yanks as well as to our own men, \"'Cease firing and help get out those men.\"' Col.

    "bodyText": "The most concentrated and furious assault would be on the salient in the Confederate line, or the ‘Dead Angle’, just a few hundred yards from this position. Jefferson C. Davis’ 3<sup>rd</sup> Division would lead that charge. Mitchell and McCook’s Brigades would attack from the right and left, while Morgan’s Brigade would hold in reserve in the trench that you see before you. The moments before the actual attack were tense ones, spent in trenches like this one. A war correspondent from the Cincinnati Daily Commercial writes that ‘The minutes passed in muted apprehension. There was no evidence in the movement or bearing of the men that they were so soon to essay ‘the deadly imminent breach’ though they must have been conscious that the task laid out for them was on which none but men hoping to meet death would covet…. no one could have guessed from their undisturbed faces, that all the latent gallantry of their natures could be aroused, and lashed into a fury of heroism during the next ten minutes.” At roughly half past 8 am, the signal gun would sound, and the assault would begin.",
    "audioDescription": "An earthen trench, or ditch sits roughly 20 feet in front of this position and runs horizontally to the right and left off into the woods. Between the trail and the trench is a small wooden sign with the following words painted in white (to be read from top to bottom): Union, 1st Brigade Morgan, 2nd Division Davis, 14th Corps Palmer. The trail that you are standing on is a wide dirt path surround by dense woods and undergrowth.",

    "bodyText": "The far left of the attack on Pigeon Hill would be orchestrated by General Charles C. Walcutt’s Brigade. They would assault the northern slope of Pigeon Hill and the gorge between it and Little Kennesaw (visible to the northwest from this location). Walcutt’s assault would fare no better than Smith’s further south. With the 46th Ohio leading the way as skirmishers, the brigade advanced in two lines of two regiments each. Shot and shell from the heights in their front rained down on the troops as they crossed an open field. Confederate rifle pits 200 yards in front of Little Kennnesaw, manned by soldiers in the 46th Mississippi Regiment, suffered heavy casualties as oncoming men in blue easily overran their position. But Walcutt’s line would meet no more success that day. As John T. Hunt of the 40th Illinois wrote, “[N]earing the base of the mountain, we met a terrible withering fire. …[W]e found it would be a moral impossibility to scale it in the face of an active, vigilant and relentless foe. Some…tried the ascent, and left their lifeless remains as testimonials to futility.” On the crest of Little Kennesaw, Sears helped stem Federal penetration of the gorge by directing his men to fire downward on the men in blue. Now caught in crossfire between the brigades of Sears and Cockrell, Walcutt’s troops were compelled to en-trench and hunker down until nightfall covered their withdrawal. The rest of the Union force assaulting Pigeon Hill would follow suit, thus ending the fighting in this area.",
    "audioDescription": "The terrain here is relatively flat and rocky. A gray sign, about knee-high, reads 'Confederate, Bellamy's Alabama Battery. This indicates that an artillery position was here during the battle. This there are rocks emerging from the ground and a few massive boulders in the immediate area. A moderately steep drop is in your front, to the north facing Little Kennesaw Mountain. Directly behind you, it slopes more gently with light grasses and periodic boulders.",

    "bodyText": "<h3>Stop 1</h3> <h2>The Sonoran Desert</h2> <br /> Welcome to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, the heart of the Sonoran Desert. This desert covers 110,000 square miles (280,000 sq km), an area about the size of the state of New Mexico. The Sonoran Desert is the most diverse desert in North America, home to over 4,000 species of plants and animals. Why is this place so diverse? What makes this desert different from the Great Basin Desert to our north, Mojave to our west or the Chihuahuan to our east? Many factors make the Sonoran Desert unique. Our winters are mostly frost-free, and there are two rainfall periods, one in the winter/spring and another in July and August. The high mountain ranges affect how much rain falls in an area, creating a diversity of<br /> habitats for specially adapted plants and animals to thrive. Everything seems to be related or connected to something else in complex ways.<br /> <br /> Based on plant evidence, scientists believe this is a young desert, only about 10,000 years old, with its ancestry in the tropics. Many of our perennial plants (cacti and other succulents) and animals (such as lizards and snakes) migrated from the tropics or are descendants of tropical species. They prosper in the brief summer storms that occur here. Annual plants, like many wildflowers, rely on the soaking winter rains that help make the Sonoran Desert so diverse. Many plants and animals in the Sonoran Desert have adapted to reproduce or grow after sufficient rainfall in winter or summer. Most animals that live here are either nocturnal or crepuscular (dusk- or dawn-active) to thwart the high daytime temperatures. These adaptations, along with many more, allow the Sonoran Desert life to thrive.<br /> <br /> Welcome to the Green Desert! As you travel down this road, we encourage you to travel slowly, pay attention to details, and discover some of these unique relationships for yourself.<br /> <br />  ",

There are picnic tables and signs describing the geology of arch formation here in the monument, as well as a two-mile round trip trail that leads hikers into the foothills of the high country.

    "bodyText": "<h3>Stop 11</h3> <h2>Wintering in the High Country</h2> <br /> Another higher elevation plant that prospers in cooler weather is the agave, commonly called the century plant. It even grows on the highest peak in the monument, Mount Ajo, which is on your left and marks the boundary between the monument and the Tohono O’odham Nation. Archeologists have discovered agave-roasting pits in the high country of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. These pits are associated with the Hohokam who cultivated agave for ceremonial purposes. Why were the Hohokam at the top of the Ajo Range?<br /> <br /> Archeologists believe that the Hohokam tradition was to move to the high country canyons after fall harvest in the valleys. Canyons, like Estes Canyon below and to your left, served as winter homes and watchmen were located at the tops of mountains to guard the community against raiders. The Tohono O’odham also used these canyons as winter homes. They were likely hunting mammals. These higher elevations also afforded a chance to catch more water. Snow and rain were more likely in the mountains. It is easy to imagine the people of the past making their way on foot up that steep rugged hill. The promise of water in dependable tinajas, natural catchments in the rock that hold rain water, were their only source of water for miles. The Hohokam and the Tohono O’odham adapted to the desert by moving biannually to find food and water. Their migratory routes were always associated with tinajas, springs or other water sources and are still visible in the monument today.<br /> <br /> Ahead is Estes Canyon, the midpoint of the Ajo Mountain Drive. Here you will find a ramada with picnic tables and restrooms. A loop trail leads into Estes Canyon and then climbs onto a ridge. It returns down through the foothills back to the parking area. Halfway around the loop a short spur trail climbs to Bull Pasture, which early ranchers used for their cattle. From the Bull Pasture Viewpoint hikers have a stunning view of Mount Ajo, the highest peak in the monument at 4,808 feet (1466 m). The trail, including the spur, is a fairly rugged 4.1 miles (6.6 km) round trip, with a total elevation gain of 865 feet (224 m). Ask at the Kris Eggle Visitor Center for more information.",
    "audioDescription": "Stop 11, marked by a white road marker sign with the number \"11\" on it, is located on an overlook in the Ajo Mountains. The stop looks down upon Estes Canyon and the Diaz mountains in the distance to the south. To the east, Mount Ajo and its surrounding peaks loom. These mountains are crumbly and bulbous, a result of the slow moving magma that formed into reddish colored rhyolite rock. Organ pipe cacti and saguaros dot the hillsides.",

    "bodyText": "<h3><b>Stop 13</b></h3> <h2><b>The Trees of Life </b></h2> <p> </p> <p>The mesquite tree has long inhabited the land you see before you. The fruit is high in carbohydrates and attracts many different herbivores. The mesquite adapted seed dispersal so that when seedpods were eaten in great quantities, they were dispersed across the land. Rabbits, packrats, javelina and coyote all depend on the seasonal seedpods for food. These animals, and others, help to scatter the mesquite seeds across the desert.</p> <p><br /> In the 1500s, missionaries introduced the cow, which allowed for even greater seed dispersal. Cattle no longer range in the monument but the abundance of mesquite serves as a reminder of their presence. Often called the “Tree of Life”, many desert-dwellers owe their survival to the mesquite tree. The seeds were, and still are, ground into flour used for breads. These seeds have more protein than soybeans and were a major food source for the Tohono O’odham.<br /> <br /> Another tree that sustains life in the desert is the palo verde. With its green trunk and branches, the palo verde has a very clever way of conserving moisture. By not having leaves during the hot season, it can photosynthesize and respire (that is to create energy and breathe) through its trunk, thus conserving water.<br /> <br /> The palo verde can also serve as a nurse tree. Saguaro seeds need shelter from a nurse plant such as a creosote or palo verde tree. These plants protect the young cactus from sunburn, torrential floods and the occasional winter frosts. Nurse trees such as the palo verde, mesquite and ironwood even fertilize the young cacti as the trees fix nitrogen from the air into the soil for themselves. The young cactus is “nursed” as it grows up tall and strong, spreading its shallow root system out to collect rain as it falls. This is not good news for the nurse plant. As the cactus roots spread only 3-4 inches below the surface of the soil, what started as a shelter becomes a battlefield for water. The saguaro proves victorious. Many of the monument’s larger saguaros are surrounded by remains of their dead nurse trees.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3><b>Stop 14 </b></h3> <h2><b>Traveling in the Footsteps of History</b></h2> <br /> In the 1680s, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino arrived with orders to establish missions throughout the region. He worked with the O’odham people, teaching them about cattle grazing and learning human migratory routes in return. Padre Kino’s expedition mapped the region, recording invaluable water sources and ancient pathways. The expedition quickly adapted to the region, learning that trails must be near water, among high mountains and through passes. Without this knowledge, Kino’s expedition and the many people that have come since would surely have perished.<br /> <br /> Many of the maps that Padre Kino created and the names he placed on them are still in use. Looking at a map of the monument today, one can immerse oneself in the history and geology of the region. Bull Pasture gets its name from the monuments’ ranching era; Twin Peaks is named for its double-peaked appearance; Pinkley Peak commemorates Frank Pinkley, Superintendent of Southwestern National Monuments 1923 – 1940. Behind each name is a story.<br /> <br /> The Diaz Mountains are named for Captain Melchior Diaz, leader of a 15 member group in the Coronado expedition 1539-1542. In January 1541, when the expedition was close to here, Diaz suffered a freak accident and was mortally wounded. Diaz’s men had no choice but to abandon any further explorations. During his fourteen months and over 3500 miles of reconnaissance on behalf of the Coronado expedition, Melchior Diaz left a valuable legacy. The information he gathered on the native peoples he encountered offers the modern reader a glimpse into a way of life prior to European contact.",

This plant belongs to the Candlewood Family and is the only representative of this family in the United States. It’s cousin, the boojum tree, grows mainly in Baja California, Mexico, and has been described as looking like an upside down carrot. These plants store water in their roots and stems. In drier times they shed their leaves and resemble long spiny sticks. Once the rain comes they restore just as if there was never a dry spell. Each spring leaves come out and brilliant orange-red flowers bloom at the ends of the stems. These flowers attract hummingbirds to pollinate the plant and are vital to the ocotillo’s survival. The nectar found within each tubular flower is a vital energy source, crucial to the hummingbird’s survival during its long and arduous migration. This mutually beneficial relationship is another example of adaptation to the desert environment.<br /> <br /> These plants are not only beautiful but useful as well. Ocotillos are resilient and have been used for roofs and living fences by the Tohono O'odham.</p>",

They are called chain-fruit because fruit-upon-fruit hang down, creating long chains. The joints of the plant are biologically designed to detach as an animal is walking by within its spiny reach. The spines are barbed and hook into the coat or flesh of the passer-by and the cholla joint is transported to a new location. If the conditions are favorable where it falls, the cholla joint might grow into a new plant. This cactus is sometimes referred to as a “jumping cholla” as the cholla joints seem to jump off the plant and attack unsuspecting passers-by. Reality is they don’t jump; they are just very efficient at picking up a ride. As you can imagine, picking up these hitchhikers is painful. Adapt your habits to the desert by using caution and carrying tweezers to remove any cholla joints when you are out walking.<br /> <br /> You may be surprised to learn that some birds will take up residence in these cacti; the spines prove some defense against desert predators. As you continue, look for cactus wren nests; they resemble football-shaped clumps of weeds with a side hole big enough for the birds to go in and out.</p>",

They get their name because they look fuzzy and cute, but look carefully and you’ll see millions of tiny hooked spines genetically designed to attach to anything that gets too close. These spines are an adaptation to the desert sun; they create shade for the cholla itself, reducing its exposure to the sun. Teddy bear cholla reproduce in the same manner as many chain-fruit cholla; by breaking off joints and rooting them into the ground. This means that all the cacti you see before you may have come from one plant that was dropped off in this area by an animal that brushed by another teddy bear cholla along his path. According to botanists, it is very possible that all the teddy bear cholla in the United States come from a single strain.<br /> <br /> Packrats will take the cholla joints to make a very protective nest called a midden. See if you can find one of these middens. Packrats have been known to make multi-story middens in wood piles or dead cacti. Some very surprising information has been uncovered from these cholla-covered homes. A midden in the Puerto Blanco Mountains records the teddy bear chollas’ arrival here 10,000 years ago! This cactus migrated here when the Sonoran Desert was in its infancy and from the abundance found here at Teddy Bear Pass, it has adapted quite well.</p>",

Some species migrated here, some adapted to or survived the changing climate during the past 10,000 years, but all will need to continue evolving to adapt to this ever-changing environment. Long-term monitoring projects taking place within the monument and nearby wilderness reserves indicate that our climate has begun to change again. Many of the plant and animal species that we associate with the Sonoran Desert are threatened: bighorn sheep, the Spadefoot toad, even our beloved saguaro. How will these species, and others, adapt to survive unforeseen changes? Can they adapt to the changing environment? What new species might move to the monument? What does the future hold for the Sonoran Desert? We are only beginning to understand these questions. This desert is a magnificent living biome with relationships that span the entire space. Plants depend on animals to disperse their seed around the desert by ingestion and digestion or by transport. Animals depend on plants for food and shelter. Even plants depend on other plants for their survival (cacti and nurse trees). Just because you see something dead in the desert, don’t assume that it has no purpose. Death begets life out here in the desert. A dead or dying saguaro may mean that a wood rat or a lizard may take comfort in its shade. The connections all over this incredible land is what makes it the Sonoran Desert.<br /> <br /> We hope you enjoyed your time on this loop drive and that you’ve learned the story of this mysterious Sonoran Desert: that everything is connected and comes full circle, that it is filled with amazing adaptations for survival, that we are just beginning to understand the Sonoran Desert, and that new things are being discovered every day.

    "bodyText": "<h3>Stop 2</h3> <h2>The Desert Smells Like Rain</h2> Decorating the landscape of the Sonoran Desert is the creosote bush. This olive green shrub you see all around you is one of the most drought-tolerant plants in North America. Long after the soil is too dry for most species, creosote still manages to absorb water. Its adaptations allow it to survive without water for two years before completely dying. <br /> <br /> This supple plant sports small yellow blossoms in the spring and summer. It may occasionally bloom during other times of the year if rainfall is sufficient. The seeds are gray fuzzy balls that resemble droplets of water hanging from the branches. The waxy coating on creosote’s leaves protects the plant from excessive water loss. Locals often say that the Sonoran Desert “smells like rain” because of the intoxicating aroma the leaves give off during a rain storm or on a foggy winter morning. <br /> <br /> Creosote is found abundantly, all over the southwest, in three deserts – the Chihuahuan, Mojave and Sonoran. It also is very long-lived, creating clonal colonies; one found in California is believed to be over 10,000 years old and is considered one of the oldest single living organisms on the planet. <br /> <br /> Creosote is useful to many desert species. The kangaroo rat likes to build its nest within the roots of the creosote bush. The seeds are a life source to many jackrabbits. The desert kit fox prefers to make its den within the roots of the creosote. Many cactus species use the<br /> creosote for shelter when the cactus is young and establishing its own root system.<br /> <br /> This unassuming shrub originated in South America but it is clearly one of the most well-adapted plants found in the monument. The creosote has not only made its home in the heart of the Sonoran Desert but in the hearts of many desert natives as well.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<h4><b>Stop 3</b><br />  </h4> <h3><b>A Sonoran Desert Icon</b></h3> <p>You would think that the saguaro cactus, which dominates the landscape, would be one of those well-adapted, hardy desert species. It is certainly the tallest and largest cactus in the United States, growing as high as 50 feet and weighing several tons. It can live to be 200 years old. In Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument we think that these cacti flower for the first time at approximately 65 years of age and might produce their first arms at around 90. Of course there is no way to know exactly how old a saguaro is (it doesn’t create growth rings like a tree). What we know comes from averaging data from hundreds of cacti all across the Sonoran Desert. Cacti living in washes or over by Tucson, where the water is more abundant, grow faster. Cacti growing in the valley flats, where water is scarce, can live their whole lives and never have the resources to support arm growth. A saguaro is entirely dependent on location and rainfall, as well as the ability of its shallow roots to suck up as much rain as possible to store in its spongy flesh.  <br />  <br /> Saguaros have adapted to the Sonoran Desert. They arrived in the region only 8,000 years ago, more recently than humans. Humans living here adapted their lives to include, even revere, the giant cactus. The Tohono O’odham have strong cultural ties to the saguaro. The first saguaro fruit harvest coincides with the Tohono O’odham New Year, when the summer monsoon rains fall on the parched desert floor. The O’odham use woody ribs of dead saguaros to create a tool, called a <i>ku-pit</i>, enabling them to reach the fruit clustered at the tops of the arms and crowns of the cacti.  <br />  <br /> The timing of the fruit ripening is impressive. Flowers appear in May and June when the desert is at its hottest and driest. The nectar is the only moisture in town, attracting important pollinators like birds and bats. The fruits ripen in July, in time for many animals to eat the delicious red fruits and transport thousands of seeds to new homes. Once the seeds are spread and the monsoon rains start, those seeds have the chance to grow into new giant saguaro. <br />  <br /> Even with all of the saguaro’s adaptations to capture and conserve water, without the help of other species it would not survive here at all. It needs animals to pollinate and spread the seeds, and the assistance of other plant species to shelter young seedlings during the first fragile years of their lives. Its appearance as the master of the desert is deceiving. As you travel along what other plants dominate this habitat?</p> <h3> </h3>",

Roosevelt and protects most of the natural habitat of the organ pipe cactus within the United States. While commonly found in the southern sections of the Sonoran Desert, these cacti are rare north of the US-Mexico border but have adapted to life in the monument. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument experiences only a few frosty nights a year, allowing the cacti to stay warm and flourish like their Mexican neighbors. Notice how these plants to your left are standing on the south-facing slopes with little vegetation near them. Organ pipe cacti crave the sun’s heat and do not require nurse plants. At night the rocks surrounding the plant release heat stored during the day, thus keeping the plants from freezing.<br /> <br /> In June and July, flowers and fruits cover the arms of these columnar cacti. The flowers only open at night, closing for good in the early morning light to keep water loss at a minimum. These lavender-tinged white flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract lesser long-nosed bats. Each summer these bats migrate from Mexico to feast on flower nectar and the pregnant females give birth and nurse their young. They congregate at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, roosting within the monument’s caves, buildings and historical structures, such as abandoned mines, rock shelters and old ranch houses. As summer progresses, the mothers and their babies gorge themselves on cactus fruits and distribute the seeds across the desert helping to ensure the survival of the organ pipe cactus.",

Just below the ridge, the upper portion of Diablo Wash emerges from a steep canyon. Looking west from the ridge, the large, dark double summit of Twin Peaks rises above the Kris Eggle Visitor Center. The more distant craggy Cubabi Mountains to the south lie just beyond the town of Sonoyta, Mexico. Behind the Cubabis lies Reserva de la Biosfera El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar or El Pinacate to the locals. This Mexican national park is the sister park to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, meaning the two parks work together on monitoring projects including wildlife migration, climate and weather trends, and human impacts on the park resources.<br /> <br /> As you look across the desert, you are viewing a complex network of migratory routes for many animals that live in the Sonoran Desert. Washes just like Diablo Canyon serve as primary routes of travel for hummingbirds, coyotes and javelina. Humans have traditionally used these pathways as well. Other species, like the endangered Sonoran Pronghorn, prefer the open creosote flats. Biologists from both Organ Pipe and El Pinacate are studying wildlife migration, determining human impacts on wildlife and how the two park sites can better manage wildlife populations. State, federal and Mexican biologists have created the Sonoran Pronghorn Recovery Team, which conducts aerial surveys of pronghorn, provides support to local parklands and operates a captive breeding program.<br /> <br /> This relationship with our sister park allows us to share information across a political boundary, collaborate efforts to protect animals like the pronghorn and to cooperate with each other in preserving and conserving two vividly different wild lands.",

Deep purple fruits called <i>tunas </i>are an important food in many parts of Mexico and among Native Americans. The flat pads are modified stems, functioning in the place of leaves. The prickly pear has adapted to the desert by keeping its pads straight up and thus only receiving sun on its edges, preventing sunburn under the harsh noon sun.<br /> <br /> These cacti are very important to sustaining animals in the desert. They provide food for the javelina who, like goats, will eat anything. Tortoise love to eat the fruit. Prickly pear cacti prove useful to humans, too. The new pads, or <i>nopales</i>, are filled with juices and may be picked to make a great salad or a bittersweet jelly.",

Geologists recognize this landscape as part of the vast basin and range province that includes much of the interior west of the United States and parts of northwestern Mexico as well.<br />  <br /> To understand how this landscape was formed, we need to go back in time 25 million years when forces deep within the earth pulled the land apart. As the land was stretched, vast areas sank and formed broad valleys. These valleys were intersected by uplifted blocks of land, creating today’s Ajo Range. Other mountain chains appeared one after the other as far as the eye could see. As the surface was slowly deformed, volcanoes, lava flows, and falling volcanic ash accumulated and resulted in the colorful layers of rock that are revealed all around you.<br />  <br /> The pink and chocolate-colored rock is rhyolite, formed from solidification of a slow moving, thick lava flow. The light brown or tan rock layers, called tuff, is volcanic ash turned to stone. Over time, the mountains have been worn down and the valleys filled by rock and debris from the powerful effect of water cutting through and carrying away layers of solid rock.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>How to get there</h3> From the Visitor Center, head south on Highway 85 for approximately 5 miles. Look for a turn off on the left hand side of the road with a sign indicating the “Camino de Dos Republicas.” Continue on the Camino de Dos Republicas for 2 miles until you reach the small dirt parking area by Gachado Line Camp. Do not drive beyond Gachado Line Camp onto the border road and please do not approach or touch the border fence. This area is closed to the public. <h3>What’s a line camp?</h3> A line camp is a place on the outskirts of a larger ranch for workers to stay. Line camps may also be located closer to the ranching operations so workers can keep a closer eye on their livestock. In this case, this line camp served Dos Lomitas Ranch run by the Gray family a couple miles to the east. Henry and Abe Gray, the two eldest Gray sons, built this line camp in 1921 and lived here for several years.<br /> <br /> Robert Lee (Bob) Gray bought the Blankenship ranch (now known as Dos Lomitas), wells, water rights, and cattle from Lonald Blankenship in 1919. Bob Gray and his sons built numerous structures and water facilities until their control extended over much of the Organ Pipe area. <h3>Ranching in desert extremes</h3> How were the Grays able to run cattle in a desert with so little grass? With the meager forage and water available, the Grays had to range their cattle over a very large area (over 350 square miles) to sustain their herd of cattle.<br /> <br /> With livestock scattered over such a large area, rounding up all these cattle would have been incredibly time consuming. However, the Grays pioneered a system where they operated a series of wells and water sources surrounded by mesquite corrals. In the dry seasons, cattle had to enter the corrals daily to drink. The gates were specifically constructed so that when they were closed, the livestock could enter the gate with a gentle push but could not exit. After the cattle were trapped in the corrals, they could be easily loaded onto a truck and sent to market.<br /> <br /> This extensive grazing did not come without consequences for the desert. The cattle decimated the sparse vegetation and trampled vast areas, creating erosion and leaving the landscape overgrazed and barren. Even though cattle were removed from the monument in 1978, desert environments take a long time to recover. The damage is still visible in many areas, including those surrounding Gachado Line Camp. <h3>What does “Gachado” mean?</h3> “Gachado” means old twisted mesquite. While the original namesake mesquite is no longer present, the current large tree next to Gachado line camp is actually a nonnative tamarisk tree. Although tamarisks have a reputation of being highly invasive in other parts of the country, this subspecies is sterile and is the only tamarisk tree in the monument. Notice mounds of fine, dark sand underneath the tree. This site used to be an active Mexican Leafcutter Ant colony, and though this colony has long collapsed, several active colonies persist throughout the monument.   <h3>Gachado Line Camp and Restoration</h3> This adobe house exemplifies the resourcefulness of ranchers in the southwest. The building was originally made using mostly native materials. The Grays used ocotillo stems and organ pipe ribs to thatch the structure’s roof. Thick adobe walls were made from mud, grass and reeds found locally, and insulated the structure from the sweltering desert temperatures.<br /> <br /> This is an active restoration site. The foundation is original while the rest is under restoration. While adobe is effective insulation made from readily available materials, it also requires constant maintenance. For the Gray family, adobe upkeep was part of their regular chores. Since monument staff lack the resources to constantly maintain historic adobe, the restored bricks are made using a combination of mud, other natural materials, and Portland cement to hold the bricks together longer.    <br /> <br /> Learn more about the National Park Service’s work to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orpi/learn/photosmultimedia/videos.htm\">restore Gachado Line Camp</a> amidst the challenges of climate change. <h3>The Gray Family and the National Park Service</h3> When the monument was established in 1937, the Grays had been on the land for 17 years and were understandably threatened by its establishment, especially because lacked an official deed to the land.  <br /> <br /> With the support of Senator Carl Hayden, in 1939, the Grays were able to obtain a lifetime permit to graze. The permit allowed them to have 550 cattle on monument lands. When the Park Service surveyed the cattle a couple years later, they found that the Grays had 1,600 cattle on park lands.<br /> <br /> The ecological damage of long-term overgrazing created tenuous relations between the National Park Service and the Grays, and eventually the Department of Interior terminated the Gray’s grazing permit in 1968. Yet the Gray sons continued to run cattle on monument lands without a permit until the death of their last member in 1976.<br /> <br /> When the last of the Gray brothers passed, it marked the end of cattle ranching in the monument. When the cattle were rounded up and removed in 1978, there were 1,700 cattle removed, which greatly exceeded the terms of the grazing permit.",
    "audioDescription": "As one approaches Gachado Line Camp, there are dilapidated wooden fence posts, troughs, and the surrounding area is relatively flat and lacks vegetation. A giant tamarisk tree grows next to the line camp. The actual building is a one-room, rectangular, tan colored, adobe building with several small, square windows and one door. Only sections of the building are covered with an outer layer of adobe, the rest of the building shows exposed brick. Large tree beams stick out of the front of the building. Inside the building are dirt floors and construction equipment from the ongoing restoration. To the south of Gachado is the international border and border fence.",

    "bodyText": "The colorful Pinkley Peak is the highest peak in the Puerto Blanco Mountains, rising 3,146 feet (959 meters) above sea level. This peak is named in honor of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frank-pinkley.htm\">Frank “Boss” Pinkley</a>, who was superintendent of all of the Southwestern national monuments from 1924 until 1939.<br /> <br /> Nestled near the base of the peak are accessible restrooms and a shaded picnic area. Take in the stunning views of the peak and the Ajo mountains in the distance.<br /> <br /> The Puerto Blanco Mountains are a mix of lava flows and hardened volcanic ash created during the volcanic activity of the Tertiary period, 15-25 million years ago. Pinkley Peak is one of the best exposures of these volcanic rocks anywhere in the monument, prominently displaying bands of rhyolite and tuff.   <h3>How to get there</h3> Pinkley Peak picnic area is 4 miles up North Puerto Blanco Drive on the left. The road to Pinkley Peak picnic area is a two-way, graded dirt road, doable in any passenger car. Beyond the picnic area, North Puerto Blanco road is one-way and requires a 4WD high clearance vehicle.<br /> <br /> No official monument trails lead to the top of Pinkley Peak. <h3>Frank Pinkley</h3> <p>(C.E. 1881- C.E. 1940)<br /> Archaeologist, Park Ranger, & NPS Regional Superintendent</p> We name mountains for people of tremendous impact and service. For the National Park Service, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frank-pinkley.htm\">Frank Pinkley </a>was just that. He was a farm boy from Missouri whose doctor ordered him to go to Arizona for six months in 1900 to recuperate from a mild case of tuberculosis. A year later he accepted a government job as caretaker of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cagr/index.htm\">Casa Grande Ruins National Monument</a>, where he lived in a tent and dug his own well.<br /> <br /> He went on to become the superintendent of the Southwestern National Monuments. Pinkley administered 27 national monuments across Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. He was excitedly planning the development of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument at the time of his death in 1940. \"The Boss,\" as Pinkley was affectionately known, left an extraordinary legacy. Pinkley wrote monthly essays and articles to his staff, which were compiled into the collection, <em>Ruminations from the Boss.</em> The interesting, often humorous essays written by Pinkley revealed his uncanny ability to explain, instruct, and entice his fellow Park Rangers in a fatherly way.<br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "Pinkley Peak is a large, triangular-shaped peak formed of rhyolite, a brownish-red jagged rock. The peak a slanted, horizontal layers of tuff, a lighter yellow colored rock. Patches of vegetation and saguaros are visible on the peak. At the eastern base of the peak, about half a mile from the base, is the picnic area. The picnic area has several light colored ramadas (square shaped shade structures) with picnic tables. The picnic area has a vault restroom. To the east there are views of the Ajo Mountain Range, a small, flat, red-tinged mountain range. To the south are views of a double crested peak (Twin-peaks). Surrounding the area are vast swaths of desert plains and washes, dotted with creosote, palo verde, saguaros, organ pipe cacti, and ocotillos.",

    "bodyText": "<h3>A Place of History and Nature</h3> <p>People and animals have a tendency to return to the same place over and over again, generation after generation. Quitobaquito Spring is no different. Some of the artifacts found in the area date back approximately 16,000 years, and Quitobaquito has been occupied ever since by many people and cultures. It is also the home of endangered species and is a place that remains a challenge to manage to preserve and protect the history and habitat that is unique to Quitobaquito.</p> <h3>Getting There</h3> Quitobaquito is located 14 miles west on South Puerto Blanco Drive, which is a two way road that parallels the international border. This is a dirt and gravel road, but is designed for a passenger car. Be aware that road can have some very wash-boarded sections, creating a bumpy ride. Quitobaquito can be reached either from South Puerto Blanco Drive off of Highway 85, or by driving the North Puerto Blanco Drive.  <h3>What's in a Name?</h3> <p>The origin of the name \"Quitobaquito\" has been lost to history. It is thought to be a corruption of the Spanish and O'odham languages. Some possible meanings are <em>small spring</em>, <em>watering place</em>, a reference to the Mexican town of <em>Quitovac</em>, or <em>look out (or get away) little cow. </em>The O'odham people know Quitobaquito Springs as \"A'al Vaipia.\"</p>   <figure><img alt=\"quitobaquito pithouse, circa 1920s\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/orpi/learn/historyculture/images/pithouse2.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"quitobaquito pithouse, circa 1920s\" /> <figcaption>Native American pithouse at Quitobaquito circa 1920s. <p>NPS PHOTO</p> </figcaption> </figure> <h3>The Early People</h3> <p>The area around Quitobaquito is associated with a prehistoric trade route known as the Old Salt Trail. Ancient cultures used this route to obtain salt, obsidian, seashells, and other commodities from the salt beds of Sonora, Mexico.</p> <p>The spring is also part of the historic homeland of American Indians. The Hia C-ed O'odham and the Tohono O'odham both lived at Quitobaquito. Today, the Tohono O'odham have a reservation just east of the Ajo Mountains, approximately 30 miles from Quitobaquito. Their ancestors lived and subsisted here for hundreds and even thousands of years.</p> <p>Prehistoric becomes historic when people start keeping records.</p> <p>In 1698, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino wrote about visiting the spring, which he named San Sergio. After arriving in Mexico in 1683, Father Kino established 24 missions in 24 years, the closest being in present-day Sonoyta, Mexico.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"trading coin from Dorsey's store at quitobaquito\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/orpi/learn/historyculture/images/coin-web.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"trading coin from Dorsey's store at quitobaquito\" /> <figcaption>Trading coin from Dorsey's store at Quitobaquito, circa 1880s. <p>NPS Photo</p> </figcaption> </figure> <h3>Residents of the Oasis</h3> <p>Quitobaquito has had many colorful residents. Andrew Dorsey arrived in the early 1860s, opened a store, dug the pond deeper and built an earthen dam to create a bigger water source. He also dug irrigation ditches to water his pomegranate and fig trees. Dorsey lived in the area until the 1890s. In 1887, a former Texas Ranger named Jefferson Davis Milton was hired to establish a United States customs and immigration station at Quitobaquito.</p> <p>Milton mined for gold and silver in the area and established the Milton Mine that you can visit in the monument today. Around 1903, local rancher Thomas Childs Jr. arrived and rebuilt Dorsey's dam and irrigation ditches. Among other crops, he started to grow watermelons.</p> <p>On April 13, 1937, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the proclamation creating Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Around 1947, the pond at Quitobaquito was approximately 2 feet deep, and covered an area up to a half acre. More than 4,000 feet of irrigation ditches existed, providing water to at least 8 fig trees and 22 pomegranate trees.</p> <p>On July 8, 1957, Jim Orosco sold all remaining private land at Quitobaquito to the National Park Service for $13,000. The Orosco family of Hia C-ed O'odham decent, is believed to be the longest-term resident family at Quitobaquito, living there from 1887 to 1957.</p> <p>In 1961 the National Park Service removed all old structures from the site and drained and deepened the pond. A parking lot and trails were built to accommodate visitors. The area was fenced, and cattle guards were added to discourage livestock grazing.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"researcher holding sonoyta mud turtle\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/orpi/learn/historyculture/images/turtle-1.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"researcher holding sonoyta mud turtle\" /> <figcaption>Researcher holding a baby Sonoyta mud turtle. <p>NPS Photo</p> </figcaption> </figure> <h3>Managing for Today and Beyond</h3> <p>Drought conditions from the mid-1990s to 2006 caused moderate fluctuations in the pond level. In 2007 it was determined that there was also large-scale leakage from the pond. Corrective actions were taken over the next few years including bulrush removal, partial pond and berm renovation. All of these actions were designed to protect and preserve the pond and the habitat of its inhabitants such as the endangered Quitobaquito pupfish.</p> <p>The pond is also the home of the Quitobaquito spring snail, the Sonoyta mud turtle and the desert caper plant. This is the only spot in the United States where these species can be found naturally occurring. The desert caper supports the caper butterfly (<em>ascia Howarthi</em>) that is only found coexisting with the plant. The Quitobaquito spring snails are so small that they are hard to find. You can sometimes spot the snail, about the size of a grain of black pepper, in the spring-fed streams serving the pond. Quitobaquito is also the only place where the Sonoyta mud turtle is found in the United States and has been deemed a candidate for protection under the Endangered Species Act.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A small, shallow pond, about 50 feet long by 25 feet wide. The pond is lined with reeds and a small dirt trail. Further surrounding the pond is a mix of mesquite, palo verde, iron wood, cottonwood trees and other smaller, thorny shrubs. A large cottonwood grows on the northern edge of the pond. Leading into the pond is a skinny, cement channel that runs from the natural spring about 0.1 miles west of the pond. The surrounding area is hilly desert land, with the border wall rising to the south. In the pond live small, 1 or 2 inch long fish called Quitobaquito pupfish. The males are a bright blue color while the females are a duller gray. Small Sonoyta mudturtles bask on small sticks or stick their noses out of the water. A family of American Coots visits and lives in the pond every spring.",

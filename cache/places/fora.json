Here on Roanoke Island a great moment in history occurred when 116 men, women, and children planted the roots of English society on the shore at Fort Raleigh. The colonists' hopes for a better life in the New World, however, clashed with the neighboring Indians. The settlement soon disappeared but the colonists' dreams lived on.<br /> <br /> Since the early 1900s, the residents of Roanoke Island have paid tribute to these early English beginnings by staging events each summer. Success of a 1921 movie about the ill-fated settlement led the the creation of an outdoor drama, <strong>The Lost Colony</strong> .<br /> <br /> Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Green created the semi-fictional script from firsthand accounts. <strong>The Lost Colony</strong> is presented each summer in the outdoor Waterside Theatre by the Roanoke Island Historical Association. To the millions of people who have witnessed the play since 1937, <strong>The Lost Colony</strong> remains a tribute to those who struggled and died colonizing the New World.</p>",

It is a one-story, wooden building with three ticket windows. A walking trail leads past the west side of the ticket office toward the entrance to the Waterside Theatre. Three outdoor exhibits are located directly across the trail from the ticket office. <br /> <br />Immediately left of the three outdoor exhibits stands a small green kiosk with Roanoke Island written at top and The Lost Colony written at bottom. The kiosk posts events occurring on Roanoke Island.<br /><br />Another outdoor exhibit is located immediately left of the ticket office.<br /><br />Across the trail from this exhibit is a display case highlighting portraits of Lost Colony actors (during the summer). The display case is located directly next to a bike rack.<br /><br />The Lost Colony parking lot consists of four rows of parking spaces, with handicapped spaces located closest to the ticket office. Between each row of parking spaces is a grassy area with picnic tables and trash cans.<br /><br />End of message.",

A square window that opens on a hinge to the right is just off center of the building. The window opening is covered with chicken wire to keep wild birds and animals out of the coop. There are three additional windows of the same design, one on the left side and two on the back side. A wooden fence about 15 feet by 20 feet covered with wire fencing creates a yard for the chickens to be outside. The entire run area is covered by a nylon netting. The fence has a gate about 2 feet from the left corner for access to the yard and coop by the staff. The inside of the coop has a roost attached to the back wall as you walk into the building, the right wall is where the 8 nesting boxes are attached.

    "bodyText": "The farmhouse, known as Mount Welby, is the oldest building on the farm, dating to around 1811. <br /> <br /> During the War of 1812, Mary DeButts and her husband Samuel lived at the home. The war was especially hard for the DeButts; unable to access English banks and markets, the British sympathizers (Samuel was from Ireland, Mary from England) struggled to keep their farm. When the British navigated up the Potomac in late summer of 1814, they sailed past Mount Welby; the DeButts later found three Congreve rockets near their home.  <br /> <br /> Today, it is used as the Park's Administrative offices.  <br /> <br />  ",

There are porches on the north and south sides of the house, both porches are the full length of the walls. The south side porch is supported off the ground several feet, a white lattice covers the opening under the porch. A five step stair leads to the porch landing. There are six posts that support the roof of the porch, a white wood railing with vertical pickets surround the porch. The left side of the porch has remains of what used to be an accessible ramp. The wooden entrance door is in the center and above the door is a glass rectangular window. There are two floor to ceiling windows with black shutters in the open position, one of each side of the door. The north side of the building is the same style, full length porch, the height is closer to four or five feet above the ground. The trim on the windows and porches green in color.

To the south, a small bridge crosses the cove and the MGM skyscraper of National Harbor peeks out from the tree line. At the beginning of the trail, there is a small clearing with a picnic table.

    "bodyText": "<p>The sheer immensity of the two Rodman guns at Fort Foote made them objects of curiosity wehn they were first brought to the Fort. Visitors frequently came to see them. The 15-inch Rodmans weigh about 49,000 pounds, and required 300 to 400 soldiers to move them up the bluff from river to fort. The balls fired by the smooth-bore Rodmans weigh 500 to 600 pounds and took about fifty pounds of black powder, a type of gunpowder.</p> <p>It was a special occasion each time the big guns were fired. On February 27, 1864, three shots were fired from the 15-inch Rodman. Crowds of visitors beheld the occasion. Again, on April 1, 1864, a large party from Washington came to witness the workings of the big guns. The Rodman was fired at a 25-degree elevation at a range of three miles. Because the guns put off an intense concussive force, it was noted that observers would raise their toes and open their mouths to lessen the effects.<br /> The cannon closest to the river is of particular importance. Engraved on its 15-inch muzzle is 'No. 1' and the initials 'TJR'. The 'No 1' is in reference to the fact that this cannon was the first produced by Cyrus Alger and Company. The initials are of the individual who inspected the gun, in this case Brigadier General Thomas J. Rodman who also designed the weapon. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Spaced about 70 yards apart two massive cannons point out over the water. Each cannon is roughly 12 ft long and is mounted on a large metal base which raises it to about 15 ft high. The barrel of the cannon is 15 in in diameter. Both Canon and base are painted black. This rests on a half circle mounts made of stone and metal.",

At the building's west side from the parking lot, a door is on the bottom right and one window on the left. The second story features three windows, with the far-right window smaller and about two-feet lower. The third floor three windows are all the same size.<br />Two three-story trees sit on the right, south side of the building.

A small eight-foot tall tree stands to the left of the door.<br />Two small windows sit at the top on the north side of the house, and one small window on the top third level of the south side.<br />A brown metal sign hangs at the third-floor level on the house's east side.

The black and white sign is titled in the top left corner: <br />Abner Cloud House<br />Text below describes the history of the Abner Cloud House:<br />This house witnessed the building of the C&O Canal. Abner Cloud, a miller who had come here from Pennsylvania, built the house in 1801. Cloud's mill was about 200 yards upstream. The basement of the house was used by Cloud to store grain and flour, and the family lived in the upper floors. Restoration was completed in 1976, with much assistance from the Colonial Dames of America, Chapter III. The top two floors are now their headquarters.<br />The full background of the sign is an active scene of a three-story white house sitting alongside a canal. A canal boat passes on the right, two people canoe from the left, and three more people float by on a boat at the canal's far end. Next to them on the path is a donkey-drawn carriage being followed by a dog. A man on a horse walks in front of them, amongst three women in dresses. Other women and girls in dresses with a dog watch from the close side of the canal. Text at the top center reads:<br />This painting of the C&O Canal depicts the Abner Cloud House as a bustling place of commerce and tourism during the mid to late 1800s.<br />In the upper right corner is an image of a man sitting at the front end of a long, thin canal boat floating from right to left. A second man is back in the far end of the boat. Text to the left of them reads: [LINK 3]<br />George Washington's Patowmack Canal, completed in 1802, provided Cloud access to Georgetown markets. Long, narrow boats, called sharpers, transported his flour, entering the Potomac River just upstream from here, near Little Falls.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(506 words)<br />The Abner Cloud Mill is located west of the Abner Cloud House on the C&O Canal in Washington, DC. <br />From the intersection of Canal and Reservoir Roads, NW travel north on Canal Road about one hundred fifty feet, then turn onto the far-left lane side road, to the left of a three-foot tall stone dividing wall. You will pass the three-story white Abner Cloud House on your left. <br />Continue straight over a ten-foot-long bridge and stone tunnel to your right. The gravel road will turn left and descend as you go into a tunnel after about two hundred feet. This portion of the road is poorly deteriorated. <br />Upon exiting the one-hundred-foot tunnel, you will reach an open gravel space about sixty feet long. To the right, in the northwest corner is a two by three-foot wayside. The white sign is titled in the top left corner and reads:<br />Abner Cloud Mill<br />Echos of Milestones<br />Text beneath describes activity that occurred at the mill:<br />Baking bread, frying cornbread and eating \"stick to your ribs\" oatmeal, all have one thing in common: their ingredients started out at a grist mill. Decades before the sounds of lockhorns and mule hooves clopping by, mills were popping up along the Potomac River and the early Patowmack Canal that skirted Little Falls. The area in front of you was occupied by the grist mill, built and operated by Abner Cloud in 1801. Water supplied to this mill came from the Patowmack Company Skirting Canal.<br />Cloud operated the mill until his death in 1812, and his widow, Suzanne, continued to operate it until 1852. The mill changed hands throughout the following decades, at various times known as the Frizzle Mill and Cloud-Edes Mill. The National Park Service uncovered the building remains in 2010. It is speculated that wheat, corn, and oat flour milled here was carried by the C&O Canal boats. As you view the ruins, imagine the sound of the water wheel on the nearby stream pushing the mill stones as they clatter round and round.<br />The sign features a black and white picture in the upper right corner of the ruins of a two-story stone building. Three sets of window or door openings are on the first floor and three window openings line the 2nd floor front. Two more openings are on the first and second floor levels on the side of the building, which stands amongst a dead tree and brush. Text below reads:<br />Cloud Mill ruins, ca. 1914.<br />Photograph from the Rambler Collection, <br />Courtesy Historical Society of Washington, DC.<br />The bottom half of the sign shows a black and white photograph of four canal boats sitting in line in still water on a canal. <br />Six feet to the left of the sign is a thirty-foot wooden bridge with handrails on both sides. The bridge carries over a rushing canal that feeds into the Potomac River. Stone blocks line the inner south wall of the canal and three steel beams span the stream on the north side of the bridge.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Accokeek Creek archeological site (18PR8) is located in Southern Maryland along the banks of the Potomac River. This archeological site is among the most significant sites in the nation because of the impact its excavation had on our modern understanding of Native American societies in the Eastern Middle Atlantic.</p> <p>The site is located within the boundaries of Piscataway Park, which is administered by National Capital Parks-East of the National Park Service. Situated approximately 25 miles downriver from Washington D.C., along Piscataway Creek, the Accokeek Creek site was home to the Potomac Valley’s indigenous inhabitants for thousands of years–dating as far back as 6,000 years ago and through the 1500s. Among the occupants were the Piscataway Indians of Southern Maryland whose ancestors still live nearby today.<br /> <br /> The Accokeek Creek site was excavated in the 1930’s by Alice and Henry Ferguson who purchased land for their home in present-day Piscataway Park in the 1920’s. After excavating tens of thousands of artifacts, the Ferguson’s came to believe that they had rediscovered the site of “Moyaone,” the principal town of the Piscataway chiefdom visited by Captain John Smith in 1608. While the accuracy of the Fergusons’ claim is still disputed today, the excavations yielded a large collection of diagnostic artifacts that have helped form archeologist’s understanding of Native American history and culture in the region.<br /> <br /> Based on analysis of stone projectile points found at the site, archeologists have determined that humans have intermittently called Accokeek Creek home for nearly 6,000 years. The site also contains four ossuaries that appear to have been in use between the 1300’s and European contact in the 1600s. The individuals buried in the ossuaries were interred with elaborate grave goods including copper adornments, shell beads, and clay pipes. These finds indicate that the area was occupied by politically complex chiefdoms by the 1500’s and was the home of the Piscataway chiefdom. The Accokeek Creek excavations indicate that potentially dozens of buildings stood at the site. These structures were enclosed by a series of protective palisades at the edge of the town, indicating that Accokeek Creek’s inhabitants were, at times, living in a violent world.<br /> <br /> Archeologists believe that the predecessors of the Piscataway and other related peoples came to the Chesapeake Bay from the Appalachian Mountains sometime in the 1300’s bringing with them their Algonquian language and material culture. Based on ethnohistoric documents some archeologists and historians believe that the Piscataway group migrated instead from the area that became Maryland’s Eastern Shore in the 1300’s. Whatever the case, archeologists agree that the arrival of the Piscataway and other related people resulted in the creation of complex cultural traditions in the Potomac Valley.<br /> <br /> In 1608, Captain John Smith visited Piscataway Creek on his voyage up the Potomac River and its tributaries. Smith’s 1612 map of the Chesapeake includes the town of “Moyaons” placed in the approximate location of Accokeek Creek. Map symbols indicate that the settlement was home to a werowance, a powerful Native American chieftain who controlled other groups within a geographical area. In 1634, a group of English colonists sailed up the Potomac and met with the leaders of the Piscataway nation at Moyaone. Their leader, Wannas, informed the colonists that the lands of Piscataway Creek were theirs and English settlement could not occur in the vicinity. It is unknown if the archeological site of Accokeek Creek represents this 17th century village or an earlier settlement that the Piscataway nation relocated from. What is known however, is that the territory was a fundamentally important landscape for the Piscataway people from the time of European contact to the present day.<br /> <br /> By the 1690’s, Piscataway land in Prince George’s and Charles Counties had been confiscated by the English colonists and occupied by Maryland planters. Eventually, the Piscataway nation decided to move beyond the borders of the Maryland Colony and dispersed north and west. While many Piscataway migrated outside of Maryland, others decided to stay, forming the ancestors of the current Piscataway inhabitants of the state. The diagnostic artifacts and archeological features present at the Accokeek Creek site have been used to develop and refine a cultural-history of the Mid-Atlantic region. Since its rediscovery in the 1930’s, Accokeek Creek has been one of the most important sites in the nation for understanding the Native American societies of the East Coast.<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"> </span></span></span></p> <h3>Sources:</h3> <p><br /> Colonial Encounters<br /> 2014. Accokeek Creek (18PR8), <a href=\"http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/AccokeekCreekSummary.aspx\">http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/AccokeekCreekSummary.aspx</a><br /> <br /> Colonial Encounters<br /> 2014. Susquehannock Fort (18PR8),<br /> <a href=\"http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/SusquehannockFortSummary.aspx\">http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/SusquehannockFortSummary.aspx</a><br /> <br /> Curry, Dennis C.<br /> 1999. Feast of the Dead: Aboriginal Ossuaries in Maryland, Archaeological Society of Maryland and Maryland Historical Trust Press, Crownsville, MD.<br /> <br /> King et al.,<br /> 2019.

An observation deck ringed with benches overlooks the view to your right, where marsh grass grows in the creek’s delta. When the tide is out, there may be some of the turtles, snakes, and other critters who call the marsh home. To your left the, Accokeek Creek spills into the Potomac river. The park is a popular spot for birders, and on your walk you may find yourself sharing the marsh with ospreys, herons, and falcons as well as the smaller songbirds flitting in the branches. Across the river is the Virginia shore where cars zip along the George Washington Memorial Parkway – another national park site.

The top of the aqueduct has a water way for canal boats and a towpath for mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 15 feet wide and its bottom is about four feet lower than the towpath. To get to the aqueduct start from the Antietam Creek Parking Lot. From the parking lot head towards the wooden pedestrian bridge that passes over a small creek to the towpath. The bridge is at the midway point of the western edge of the lot. The bridge has wooden railings on both sides. Walk across the bridge and turn left onto the towpath. Follow the towpath for three tenths of a mile to reach the aqueduct. Here the towpath narrows to about three feet. On your left is a drop of about five feet to the bottom of the canal waterway. There is no barrier between the towpath and the drop. On your right you can see the Antietam creek flowing into the Potomac River. There is a metal rail between the towpath and the river.",

Designated a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/heritageareas/index.htm\">National Heritage Area</a> in 2019, AFNHA covers sixteen counties in West Virginia (Barbour, Braxton, Grant, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, Morgan, Nicholas, Pendleton, Preston, Pocahontas, Randolph, Tucker, Upshur, Webster) and two counties in western Maryland (Garrett, Allegany). <br /> <br /> Forest heritage is the ongoing story how the forest shapes history and culture, and how both nature and humans shape the forest. The mountains and forests have played a central role in central Appalachian life since the first indigenous inhabitants, and the landscape continues to cultivate local traditions, folkways, language, crafts, dance, music, festivals, and fairs. Logging after the Civil War fueled the industrial revolution and provided an important livelihood for workers, but the demand for timber decimated the forests. Today, scientific forestry and public land holdings have allowed the forests to regrow, providing sustainable forest products while offering an abundance of outdoor recreational opportunities, including hiking, biking, fishing, hunting, camping, climbing, and skiing. The history of the region is represented by its plentiful historical societies, museums, and historic preservation efforts. Forest communities and main streets offer a variety of small town experiences, with arts, shopping, local foods, and a hearty welcome for visitors. <br /> <br /> AFNHA is managed by the grassroots nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.appalachianforest.us/about.htm\">Appalachian Forest Heritage Area, Inc.</a> (<strong>AFHA</strong>). AFHA partners with organizations with shared goals and is developing a management plan to coordinate partnership efforts to conserve the area’s forests and strengthen rural communities through conservation, historic preservation, education, heritage tourism, and sustainable economic development.<br /> <br /> Notable points of interest in the region include:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.appalachianforest.us/DiscoveryCenter/index.htm\">Appalachian Forest Discovery Center</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Canaan_Valley/visit/plan_your_visit.html\">Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/choh/index.htm\">Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park</a> </li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/mnf/\">Monongahela National Forest</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pohe/index.htm\">Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail</a></li> <li><strong>Excursion trains, such as the <a href=\"https://wvstateparks.com/park/cass-scenic-railroad-state-park/\">Cass Scenic Railroad</a></strong></li> <li><strong>Historical societies and small museums</strong></li> <li><strong>State parks and state forests </strong></li> <li><strong>Welcoming rural communities</strong></li> </ul>",

The battle, which lasted two days (July 11-12, 1864) marked the defeat of General Jubal A. Early's Confederate campaign to launch an offensive action against the nation's capital.</p> <p>The Battle of Fort Stevens also gained notoriety as being the only military action in which the commander-in-chief, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">President Abraham Lincoln</a>, came under direct fire from the enemy. With a combined total casualty figure of over 900 killed or wounded during the engagement, 40 of the Union soldiers who fought and died bravely in defense of the capital. Four civilians related to the cemetery's first caretaker were buried after the Civil War. A veteran of the battle was interred in 1936, closing the cemetery to future burials. </p> <p>Battleground National Cemetery, located one-half mile north of Fort Stevens, is one acre in size, and one of our nation's smallest national cemeteries. The entrance to the Cemetery is flanked by two <span style=\"font-size: 14.6666669845581px;\">Civil War vintage</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> 6-pounder, smoothbore guns. Also near the entrance are monuments commemorating those units which fought at Fort Stevens:</span></p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"https://nps.gov/places/000/25th-new-york-volunteer-cavalry-monument.htm\">25th New York Volunteer Cavalry Monument</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/98th-pennsylvania-volunteer-infantry-monument.htm\">98th Pennsylvania Volunteer Monument</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/122nd-new-york-infantry-monument.htm\">122nd New York Volunteer Monument</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/150th-ohio-national-guard-infantry-monument.htm\">150th Ohio National Guard Monument</a></li> </ul> <p>Within the cemetery grounds is a series of cast iron markers containing the words of a poem entitled \"The Bivouac of the Dead,\" written by Theodore O'Hara in memory of those men who perished during the Mexican War. This poem, as well as the words of the Gettysburg Address in bronze found on the side of the caretaker's lodge, are reminiscent of many national cemeteries.</p> <p><span>The center of the cemetery is marked by a central flagpole, surrounded by 41 regulation marble headstones, marking the remains of the honored dead of Fort Stevens. Behind these headstones and to the east, stands a marble rostrum used to conduct yearly Memorial Day services. The four granite pillars are in memory of the four volunteer companies who fought at Fort Stevens.</span></p>",

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. </p>",

Ferry Hill is best known as the home of Henry Kyd Douglas, Confederate Officer and author of his Civil War personal account, \"I Rode With Stonewall.\"<br /> <br /> In the 18th and early 19th century German settlers migrated from Pennsylvania south into Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, where they then farmed the rich soil. These settlers crossed the Potomac using Packhorse Ford and later Blackford's Ferry below Ferry Hill. Come the 1830s the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal crossed this north/south route, tapping the river waters to provide a controlled water transportation route into western Maryland.<br /> <br /> John Blackford who built and resided at Ferry Hill benefited from this crossroads of commerce. Unlike southern plantations, Ferry Hill profited from not just one cash crop, such as tobacco or cotton, but from a variety of crops, including grains, wheat, corn, an orchard, and even lumbering.<br /> <br /> \"I was with the company that set fire to [the bridge], and when . . . I saw the glowing windows in my home on the hill beyond the river . . . I realized that the war had begun.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, 1861<br /> <br /> By 1860, Ferry Hill shifted through marriage into the Douglas family as Reverend Robert Douglas. As the Civil War began in 1861, Reverend Douglas' son Henry Kyd enlisted in the Confederate army where he served under Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson. Both young Douglas and Ferry Hill became fully engaged in the war. Douglas and his unit burned the bridge crossing the Potomac to limit Union forces from entering into Virginia, and Union forces burned the Ferry Hill barn.<br /> <br /> Throughout the war, Boteler's Ford, also known as Packhorse Ford, a mile downstream from Ferry Hill, provided a frequently used crossing for soldiers from both North and South. Due to its strategic location on the border, Ferry Hill was occupied at various times by both armies. During the 1862 Antietam campaign Ferry Hill served as a headquarters, hospital and artillery base for Confederate forces. During the Battle of Antietam residents of Sharpsburg, fled west along the C&O Canal towpath and sought shelter at Killiansburg Cave, waiting for the fighting to pass. One resident noted that the cave \"... was crowded with a variety of people of all classes.\" Following Antietam, the Battle of Shepherdstown played out along the river below the Ferry Hill. As troops moved on to fight elsewhere, Ferry Hill was scarred with it fences burned, livestock gone, and fields trampled.<br /> <br /> \"We encamped near Shepherdstown and I visited my home across the Potomac and saw the desolation of war. My beautiful home was a barren waste and a common, and the blackened walls of the burnt barn stood up against the sky as a monument of useless and barbarous destruction. I felt that it would be hard for me, going into Pennsylvania, to set aside all ideas of retaliation.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, \"I Rode With Stonewall\"<br /> <br /> Then during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, and the Monocacy Campaign in 1864, Boteler's Ford provided a crossing for both Union and Confederate troops. And, Ferry Hill again suffered the impact of the war.<br /> <br /> At the end of the Civil War, Ferry Hill lost its previous grandeur. Henry Kyd Douglas moved to Hagerstown to pursue his career as a lawyer as the site then went into the hands of Henry Kyd's sister, Nancy. In the 20th century, Ferry Hill operated as a pig farm, and by mid-century, as a restaurant. In 1979, the C&O Canal National Historical Park headquarters moved into Ferry Hill and operated here until 2002. For the past ten years, Ferry Hill shifted into a slower period as the house was opened for tours during summer weekends.</p>",

A six-foot long wood bench is set on the north side of the space. Just beyond the sign, to the south six-foot wide gravel and wood steps that leads down to the Crescent Trail pedestrian path below. A few feet north beyond the bench about six black granite blocks lay partially buried alongside the towpath.<br />The yellow sign is titled across a black border on the top that reads: \"Georgetown Incline Plane.\" Text below describes the creation of the Georgetown incline plane:<br />Here, in 1876, an engineering marvel was built. The largest incline plane in the world and the first built in the United States, carried canal boats to and from the Potomac River. The incline plane was used to help clear heavy boat traffic in Georgetown; canal boats often log-jammed while waiting to unload. Boats left the canal through a lock and entered the incline plane's large water filled car; the water from the car was drained as two stone-filled, counter-balancing cars, moving in the opposite direction, lowered the boat 480 feet to the river, and on to its Georgetown port.<br />To the right is a black and white image showing canal boats lined up along the right, A border to the left divides a road on the left. Text below reads:<br />The incline plane helped move boats to Georgetown docks faster.<br />The bottom two thirds of the sign show a color drawing of a ramp with a canal boat to the left and an arrow indicating its movement to the right. At the right side, two rows of four boxes are moving up the ramp to the left. A canal runs across the top of the image from left to right. A point indicates that you are standing at the intersection of the ramp and the canal. In the top left, a second canal boat waits to enter the ramp. At the bottom right, the ramp leads back down into a river.<br />A faded black and white photograph to the right shows a view looking up from the lower end of a ramp. Two boxes are lined up in a row on the ramp. Text to the left reads:<br />The incline plane was one of the structures selected to represent American engineering achievements at the Paris Exposition of 1878.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Water passes through the twenty-five-foot-wide canal from west to east and empties into Rock Creek about two hundred yards to the west.<br />The wood remains of the lock are set along the canal edge, including a twenty-five-foot-long wood beam that runs parallel to the canal. A wood gate resembling a ladder sits on the face of the brick canal on its opposite side. The canal is about fifteen feet deep and shallow water flows slowly at the bottom. Ivy has overtaken much of the lock on the opposite side and hangs over the canal edge.<br />The grass lawn is about twenty-five feet wide and slopes down about five feet from the brick walkway above.

Turn right onto the brick walkway and proceed eighty feet. Set in the ground about ten feet off the walkway on the left, to the south, is a one-foot wide brown sign that reads in white lettering: \"Lock 2\"<br />A brick office building is on the north side of the walkway at this location. To the south, a strip of grass runs about one hundred feet west and fifteen feet south to a one-foot stone border that lines the canal edge. As you face the canal to the south a forty-foot oak tree is ten feet to the left, along canal's edge. Another twenty feet to the left a 29th street bridge goes over the canal.<br />Still facing the canal, about forty feet to the right are two twenty-foot long wood lock beams set above both sides of the canal, connected to wood frames that line the canal walls. The beams are angled upward from west to east above the canal edge. Water in the canal drops from this point about five feet down as it flows from right to left.<br />Further to the right, about twenty wood beams, six feet long each, lay across the canal floor in tall grass, about two feet apart. This is the dry dock. The walkway and canal rise to the west, as they approach a bridge over the canal on 30th street. The canal widens about four feet from east to west after the lock. The walls of the canal arch inward again and narrow about four feet at the bridge underpass to the west under 30th street.<br /> END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(426 words)<br />C&O Canal Lock 3 is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown neighborhood, west of 30th street, NW, east of Thomas Jefferson street, south of M street, and north of K street. <br />From the intersection of M and 30th streets, travel south on 30th street about three hundred seventy feet. Turn right and proceed along the brick walkway about one hundred twenty feet. Lock 3 will be on your left.<br />Lock 3 has been restored and the twenty-five-foot wood beams, gates, components, and stone blocks that line the canal walls all appear new. Two sets of wood lock gates sit about ninety feet apart from each other in the canal. Water cascades down about four feet from the upstream western gate and passes through the downstream eastern gate and under the 30th street bridge.<br />The south side brick plaza of Lock 3 features a two-foot high wood bench that spans about sixty feet along the walkway. Five six-foot tall young trees are set in the plaza along the canal on this side.<br />The north side is situated with four wood benches set about ten feet back from the canal's edge. In front of them is a one-foot wide brown sign that reads: \"Lock 3.\" Behind the benches is a small patch of grass, about twenty by ten feet. A water fountain is at the east end of the lawn. Set at the western end is a bronze bust statue. <br />The bust is about three feet tall and depicts Justice William O. Douglas in open collared dress shirt. It rests on a four-foot-tall, two square foot granite pedestal. Etched on the pedestal front face is written:<br />In Recognition of Justice William O. Douglas for his Contributions Toward the Establishment of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historic Park<br />National Park Service <br />May 17, 1977<br />At the north east corner of 30th street and the canal walkway sits a one square foot bronze plaque with cement base atop a brick platform. An inscription on the plaque reads:<br />Georgetown Historic District<br />Has Been Designated a Registered National Historic Landmark<br />Under the Provisions of the Historic Sites Act of August 21, 1935 This Site Possesses Exceptional Value in Commemorating and Illustrating the History of the United States<br />U.S. Department of the Interior<br />National Park Service<br />1967<br />Towards the west end of the lock, the canal widens about four feet on either side. The walkway rises slightly at an incline towards the west end and a bridge carrying over Thomas Jefferson street, where another wood gate sits underneath the bridge.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(1012 words)C&O Canal Lock 4 is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown neighborhood, east of 31st street, NW, west of Thomas Jefferson street, south of M street, and north of K street.From the intersection of M and Thomas Jefferson streets, travel south four hundred forty feet on Thomas Jefferson street. Turn right along the brick walkway about seventy feet and Lock 4 will be on your left.A red wood railing runs along the edge of the walkway. Just beyond is a one-foot wide brown sign that reads: \"Lock 4.\" A three by four-foot wayside sign sits two feet left along the rail. The sign is titled in the top right corner: \"At All Hours.\" A subtitle in read below reads:It shall be their duty, at all hours, by night as well as by day, to pass all boats and floats presenting themselves at their locks.Charles Mercer, President, C&O Canal CompanyText below describes the operation of the canal lock operators and system:At All HoursIt shall be their duty, at all hours, by night as well as by day, to pass all boats and floats presenting themselves at their locks.Charles Mercer, President, C&O Canal CompanyEvery time his boat passed through a lock, a boat captain put his life and livelihood in the hands of the locktender. The wooden lock gates were a delicate balance between safety and efficiency. They had to be light enough to allow one man to move them, yet strong enough to hold back 140,000 gallons of water. A skilled locktender could judge and adjust the flow of water in or out of the lock to minimize the risk to boat and lock.Locktenders were responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of liftlocks. Neglect or carelessness could mean disaster. In exchange for a small monthly salary, an acre of land and a house, locktenders heeded the horn blast of boatmen even at 2 a.m. or on Sunday. After all, time was money.A black and white picture below shows a canal boat sitting at a lock. A man holds ropes connected to the boat from the towpath on the right. A woman stands behind him further along the towpath.Along the right side of the sign are three drawings with green backgrounds showing a boat as it passes through the blue water of a canal and lock. The top of the column states: How A Lock WorksLift locks raised and lowered boats to overcome changes in elevation.The top image shows a boat entering a lock. The upstream gate is open. Text below reads:A boat heading downstream enters the lock. Mules are unhitched and the locktender closes the upstream gates.The image below shows the upstream gate closed. The boat seems to be sitting lower in the canal. Text reads:The locktender opens the downstream paddles. Water flows out and the boat is lowered.In the bottom image, the boat is leaving the lock area, and continuing down the canal. Text reads:With water levels equal, the locktender opens the downstream gates. The mules are hitched and the boat moves on.The wayside stands between the upstream and downstream lock gates. To the right about twenty feet an oak tree sits along the canal edge. Just beyond it is a wood walkway, about ten feet long, that leads from the brick walkway to the canal's edge. Wood rails line the sides and the space is chained off at the walkway. A six-inch wide cobblestone border lines the walkway edge. Six feet to the right along the path and before a second oak tree is another wayside, titled:Creating a National ParkAn image above shows about ten people walking along a path A man in white hat and shirt is in the center. Text in the top right corner reads:Douglas, in the white shirt, and his companions hiked over 20 miles a day. Few hikers could maintain Douglas's pace.Text below reads:Creating a National ParkIt is a refuge, a place of retreat, a long stretch of quiet and peace at the Capital's back door...William O. DouglasLook around you. The park you stand in exists because people cared. In January 1954, William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court of the United States responded to a Washington Post editorial recommending that the C&O Canal be turned into a parkway. Writing in support of preserving the canal as a national park, Douglas wrote, \"It is a sanctuary for everyone who loves woods - a sanctuary that would be utterly destroyed by a fine two lane highway.\" He invited the editors and other reporters to join him on a hike of the entire canal to enjoy its beauty and better understand his point. Merlo Pusey, who wrote the editorial, and his editor Robert Estabrook accepted the challenge. On March 22, 1954, the hike began near Cumberland. Douglas and his companions invited authorities on the natural and cultural history of the Potomac River and the C&O Canal to join them. The hikers learned about the canal and enjoyed the scenery. After the hike, Estabrook wrote an editorial in the Post supporting setting the canal aside as a national park. The walk, and the news stories it generated, motivated hundreds to fight to save the canal.",

Although majority of the locks lifted and lowered boats about 8 feet, this lock had a 10-foot lift.<br /> <br /> On the other side of the lock is a bypass flume that allowed water to bypass the lock to water the level below.

    "audioDescription": "(328 words) Lock 62 is located along the towpath in Oldtown, Maryland. To access it, go to the Paw Paw Tunnel Drive-in Campground parking area off of MD-51. From the parking lot is a short, 50-foot path with a slight incline that leads up to the towpath. Once on the gravel towpath, make a right to head downstream towards Lock 62. Lock 62 is about 1.9 miles down the towpath but at about a half a mile, you will approach Paw Paw Tunnel. It is 3,118 feet long with wooden railings on the left side and the wall of the tunnel on the right. These are the original railings and contain rope burns from when the canal boats were pulled through the tunnel by mules. At the downstream exit of the tunnel is a wooden boardwalk with railings on the left side. Stay on this for about 0.15 of a mile until getting back on the gravel section of the towpath. Head down another 0.9 of a mile and the lock will be to your left. The lock is about 2 feet from the towpath and runs parallel to it. The lock is about 95 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. Two large walls of stone and treated wood make up the sides of the lock. The upstream and downstream wooden lock gates are missing. A wooden bridge crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Crossing the bridge puts you in a grassy area between the lock and a bypass flume. Across from the lock, on the other side of the towpath are the remains of the stone foundation of the lockhouse. It is about 5 feet away from the towpath. On the downstream side of the foundation is a water pump with potable water and about 100 feet further downstream is a chemical toilet about 5 feet from the towpath on the right.

Turn left to head downstream and walk about half a mile. Lock 67 is located on the left, about 5 feet from the towpath, and runs parallel to it. The lock is about 95 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. Two large walls of stone, treated wood, and concrete make up the sides of the lock. The upstream and downstream wooden lock gates are missing. Across from the middle of the lock, on the other side of the towpath, about 5 feet away, are the remains of the lockhouse. Only a few stones from the lockhouse’s foundation are still present and are partly underground. There is a depression inside of the stone foundation outline where the land drops in a few feet.

It is the 10th of the upper 13 locks that was constructed as a “composite lock”, or a lock made with more than one material. It is made of kyanized (treated) wood and uncut stone. The use of wood created many problems and some sections eventually had to be replaced with concrete. On the other side of the lock is a bypass flume that allowed water to bypass the lock to water the level below.<br /> <br /> The nickname of the lock comes from two generations of the Crabtree family serving as locktenders in the two-and-a-half story lockhouse that is adjacent to the lock.<br /> <br /> At this site, there is also an old steel and wooden bridge that once connected Rt. 51 to a ferry that crossed the Potomac River to South Branch Depot (later known as French Station on the B&O, and then, just South Branch) in West Virginia. The bridge was rebuilt in 1865 and again in 1918. The original was a wood pivot bridge that was destroyed during the Civil War. The current bridge follows a Warren Truss design.<br /> <br /> On the other side of the lock is the Potomac Forks Hiker-Biker Campsite.<br />  ",

The lock is about 95 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. Two large walls of stone, treated wood, and concrete make up the sides of the lock. A wooden bridge crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Crossing the bridge from the towpath also puts you in the 15-foot wide grassy strip in between the lock and the bypass flume. Straight across from the wooden bridge, is another wooden bridge with railings that passes over the bypass flume. On the other side is a camping area. There is a small dirt path that veers to the left for about 15 feet, that then develops into a straighter path that runs parallel to the canal. Straight ahead, about 30 feet, is a picnic table with a small grill right behind it. About 30 feet further is a well pump with potable water. From the towpath, the lock sits about 5 feet away.

In the first row of parking spots, on the side closest to the parking entrance within the circle, is a park bulletin board.

    "audioDescription": "(330 words) Lock 71 is located in Oldtown, Maryland. To access it, go to the parking lot off of Green Spring Road SE. The parking lot is laid out as a circle, but the parking spots don’t start until about 100 feet in from the turn off from Green Spring Road. In the first row of parking spots, on the side closest to the parking entrance within the circle, is a park bulletin board. Just to the left, is a little dirt walkway with a slight incline that veers to the left. This little 20-foot path leads to a grassy area along a watered section of the canal. Once on flat surface, walk about 20 feet forward and the canal will be about 30 feet away from your right. About 50 feet straight ahead is Lock 70. There is a small, 15-foot wooden bridge that crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Once across the bridge, walk about 5 more feet to get to the gravel towpath. Turn right to head upstream and walk 0.34 of a mile. Lock 71 will be to your right. It is about 5 feet from the towpath and runs parallel to it. The lock is about 95 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. Two large walls of stone, treated wood, and concrete make up the sides of the lock. The upstream and downstream wooden lock gates are missing. A wooden bridge crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Crossing the bridge puts you on the other side of the lock on a grassy berm with the remnants of a bypass flume a few feet from the downstream edge of the lock. Across from the lock, on the other side of the towpath, is a two-and-a-half story white framed lockhouse. It is about 10 feet away from the towpath. End of description.",

Two wooden pedestrian bridges span the locks to the towpath and the lockhouse on the other side. The bridges have wooden railings. After going over the first bridge continue straight for about 10 feet to reach the second bridge. About five feet past the second bridge is the towpath, which is parallel to the locks. The lock walls are made of stone blocks. Four walls create two lock chambers that are about ten feet deep each. At the upstream and downstream entrance to the locks are wooden swing gates. Opposite the lock, on the other side of the towpath is lockhouse 44. The house sits parallel to the towpath with the front facing you. The house has two sections. A two-story section with a rectangular base and a one-story section with a square base. The two sections are connected, with the one-story section on the left and the two-story section on the right. The larger, two-story section has the front door and nine windows, two windows on either side of the door and five above. A small over hang sits over the front door.

This is where the entrance road meets the parking lot. Follow the entrance road about two tenths of a mile, until on the left a gravel access trail splits from the road. Follow the access trail for about one tenth of a mile and turn left onto the towpath. Lock 48 and lockhouse 48 are about 40 feet up the towpath on the right. The lock sits about eight feet from the towpath and runs parallel to it. In the distance, beyond the lock and a road, sits lockhouse 48. The house has a rectangular base and is three-stories tall. The structure is made of red bricks. The bottom story is painted white, while the top two-stories are unpainted. The front porch and door sit on the second story, with a small staircase leading up to them. There is a window on either side of the door and three above it. The roof is an A frame roof with two chimneys.",

    "audioDescription": "(179 words)<br />The C&O Canal Mule drink and overflow is located along the C&O Canal towpath in Washington, DC, about one-half mile south of Mile 2 on the towpath.<br />At this location the towpath divides. On the east side, the path becomes four-feet wide cement, and declines about one foot. It runs for about seventy-five feet before inclining again back to the level of the gravel towpath. The cement is lined with ridges at the incline and decline points. <br />On the west side, the path leads to a wood walkway with three-foot high wood rails on both sides. The walkway is supported by seven cement columns that allow for about three feet of space underneath. A one-foot wide cement border lines the east side of the cement path. Further east the ground slopes down slightly about five feet towards the canal. <br />West of the wooden walkway, the ground underneath is an approximately ten-foot wide strip of cobblestone that appears to run most of the seventy-five-foot length of the walkway. Trees and vegetation cover much of the west side of the path.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "The C&O Canal aqueducts are “water bridges” that carried canal boats over the creeks and rivers that flow into the Potomac River. Built in 1832, the Catoctin Aqueduct is the fourth of eleven such “works of art” on the canal.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Catoctin Creek Aqueduct was known as the \"Crooked Aqueduct\" because canal boats had to make a sharp turn to cross it. From its original creation, the Catoctin Creek Aqueduct's structural integrity was questionable. The elliptical arch in the center was not as structurally sound as the semicircle arches on either side. The aqueduct began sagging in the early 1900s. It leaked and was prone to flooding. In 1973, two years after Congress established the C&O Canal National Historical Park, it collapsed, leaving only a small piece standing.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Park Service gathered up the aqueduct’s stones and buried them with the hopes that someday the aqueduct would be restored. Nearly 35 years later, a restoration project gained enough funding to rebuild. The four hundred and fifty-nine stones where uncovered and the engineering crew began to fit the blocks together like a giant 3-demensional puzzle. Each stone was measured, and the crew used those measurements to create foam stones. Historic photos were then used to identify where individual stones were positioned. Missing stones or those in poor condition were replaced. In a little over a year, construction was complete. Today, new viewing areas and waysides allow visitors to learn about the structure and the efforts to rebuild it.",
    "audioDescription": "(268 words) Catoctin Aqueduct is located along the towpath in Jefferson, Maryland. It is 92 feet long with a three-arch construction. This aqueduct has an elliptical center arch with two semicircle arches on either side of the center arch. The top of the aqueduct has a water way for the canal boats and a towpath for the mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 15 feet wide and its bottom is about six feet lower than the towpath. To get to the aqueduct start from the Lock 29 (Lander) parking lot. Head Northwest from the parking lot to reach the road you drove in on. On the road, head Southwest, about 80 feet, or until you reach the wooden bridge. The pedestrian bridge crosses the middle of lock 29 and has two wooden railings. Continue past the lock to where the towpath intersects with the road, about 10 feet past the lock. Turn right onto the towpath and continue six tenths of a mile until the path forks. To the right is access to the aqueduct waterway. To the left is access to the aqueduct towpath. The waterway sits about six feet lower than the towpath. Select a path and walk another 350 feet to the aqueduct. On the waterway path you can see stone blocks forming walls on either side of you that are about 6 feet tall. On the towpath you can look down into the waterway on your right or look to the left at the river. The towpath has a fence on the river side and two-foot bumpers on the waterway side.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Over the course of her lifetime, Clara Barton was a dedicated Civil War nurse, an active women’s rights suffragette, and the founder and first president of the American Red Cross. She lived in the house on the property for a brief time in 1891, and then again from 1897 until her death in 1912. </p> <p>From 1891-97, the house served as an American Red Cross warehouse, and it was the organization’s national headquarters from 1897-1904. The Red Cross continued to use the house as a warehouse for relief supplies, stationery, and Red Cross publications. </p> <p>Inside, the first floor includes a parlor room, dining room, offices, and a kitchen. The second floor was for bedrooms, including Ms. Barton's room at the rear of the house. Look up to the third floor and note the windows with red crosses in them. Some of the interior walls and ceilings are covered with muslin, the same material used in bandages.</p> <p>During her residence here, Barton developed the landscape into a miniature farm that was primarily self-sustaining, including crops, stables, and a chicken coop. This agricultural use of the landscape is no longer evident; development at the Glen Echo amusement park including roller coasters and the modern parking lot built over most of the farming operation. Many of the trees and plants that grow today are not consistent with the historic function of the grounds. However, the Clara Barton House is the most significant building associated with her time at Glen Echo, and it remains intact.</p> <p>In the years following Ms. Barton's death in 1912, her colleague, Dr. Julian Hubbell, replaced the porch with a columned, one-story porch. His twin nieces inherited the house in 1929 and converted the interior to rent-producing apartments, added baths and kitchens, and a garage with screened porches above at the western rear corner. </p> <p>Congress declared the Clara Barton House a National Historic Landmark on January 12, 1965, and in 1974 passed legislation establishing the house and grounds as the Clara Barton National Historic Site. This property was acquired by NPS in April 1975 through a donation from the Friends of Clara Barton. </p>",

    "audioDescription": "The trail follows Quantico Creek, a shallow stream about 10 feet in width. This stop is located in a flat, shaded area in the forest beside the creek. The sign has a black bar at the top with the words \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior\" and an NPS arrowhead symbol on the black bar in the upper right corner. The sign is titled \"Coastal Plain\" and a picture of shallow water flowing over gravel underlies the entire sign. Under the title in the upper left corner of the sign is a short paragraph reading, \"As you walk along the trail, notice that the soil is becoming sandy to your right. You are now entering the Coastal Plain, a relatively flat area consisting of an accumulation of sediments washed down from the uplands and mountains. The Coastal Plain is actually a section of the Atlantic continental shelf that is no longer covered by the ocean.\" On the upper right corner of the sign next to the paragraph is a square image of the entire park map which is a large oval-like area of green with the two branches of Quantico Creek and major roadways and trails in the park. A circular enhanced portion of the map is to right of the square map image on the sign. This enhanced circular image shows the mapped waterway of Quantico Creek where you are currently standing. While the creek has tight curves near the top of the enhanced image (in the Piedmont), the curves start to straighten near the bottom of the enhanced image (in the Coastal Plain). A caption of the map image on the sign reads, \"Remnants of hard upland rock force the waters of Quantico Creek to meander around them.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>C&O Canal aqueducts are \"water bridges\" that carry canal boats over creeks and rivers that flow into the Potomac River. Built from 1833 to 1835, the Conococheague Aqueduct is the fifth of eleven such \"works of art\" on the canal. It consists of three equal 60' arch spans extending 196' between abutments.</p> <p>In August 1863, Confederate soldiers damaged the Conococheague Aqueduct in an effort to stop the canal's transportation of coal to Georgetown where it was used by the Union. Repairs took four days and the canal returned to operation. In April 1920, a canal boat broke through the upstream wall of the aqueduct, falling into the creek below. This shut down the canal for over four months. Repaired with a timber wall, this version of the aqueduct functioned until two 1924 floods closed the canal for good.</p> <p>In 2019, the NPS completed restoration of the Conococheague Aqueduct, reopening this exciting feature on the C&O Canal. The restored Conococheague Aqueduct provides a watered section of the canal to allow for canal boat operations and other public uses between Lock 44 and approximately 450 feet upstream of the existing aqueduct (approx. 0.70 miles). The $10.2 million project took two years to complete, and was funded through federal, state, local and private dollars including national park entrance fees and Maryland's Transportation Alternatives and Bikeways programs. </p> <p>Williamsport is now the only place in North America where visitors can view a variety of canal features in one place, including an operational lift lock and refurbished lockhouse, a railroad lift bridge, a canal turning basin and warehouse, and now a watered aqueduct. </p> <h3><br /> Conococheague Aqueduct Restored </h3> <p>The National Park Service would like to acknowledge and thank those involved for their support with this projects.

The project also restores a significant historic resource and provides unique opportunities for visitors. <br /> <br /> <strong>How can I access the towpath at the Williamsport Visitor Center?</strong><br /> Pedestrians and cyclists are able to cross the canal at the historic railroad lift bridge (adjacent to Rt. 11). Parking is still available by the Cushwa Warehouse. <br /> <br /> <strong>What is the railroad lift bridge? </strong><br /> Originally used to allow trains to cross the canal, visitors are now able to cross the bridge on a newly constructed stairway, which includes a low bike rail. (This is a great spot to get a view of the canal and aqueduct!). <br /> <br /> <strong>Where can I find accessible parking near the towpath?</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Parking is also available close to the towpath at Lockhouse 44 parking lot and from the Bollman Bridge at River Bottom Park. These are the best access points for visitors with bike trailers, strollers, or wheelchairs. Dam 5 is the next closest location along the towpath that also has parking. <br /> <br /> <strong>Who can I contact if I have further questions regarding the restoration? </strong><br /> For more information, please contact the C&O Canal Williamsport Visitor Center by calling 301-582-0813.</p> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "(153 words) The Conococheague Aqueduct is located along the towpath in Williamsport, Maryland. It has three, 60-foot arches and is 168 feet long. The top of the aqueduct has a water way for canal boats and a towpath for mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 12 feet wide and its bottom is about six feet lower than the towpath. To get to the Conococheague Aqueduct, start at the Railroad Lift Bridge. Cross over the bridge to the towpath. Turn right (Northwest) onto the towpath and walk one-tenth of a mile to the aqueduct. Once on the aqueduct you will be walking on the elevated towpath. On your right, the canal waterway sits about six feet lower than the towpath. There is no barrier between the towpath and the drop. On your left you can see Conococheague creek flowing into the Potomac River. There is a metal rail between the towpath and the river.",

On the opposite bank is a hydro-electric gravity dam that is capturing power. It is about 20 feet tall and 800 feet across. The Dam 4 viewing area is in a large field. The towpath, a river walking path, and a lockhouse access trail all intersect in this field. To get to Dam 4, start from the Big Slackwater Parking Lot. From the parking lot, head to where the entrance road enters the lot, the South East edge. Follow the road 100 feet to the towpath on the right. The towpath splits to the right while the road splits to the left. Follow the gravel towpath for one mile. You will come to a large field area and the towpath will split into four directions. To the right is a short path to a Dam 4 viewing space. To the center right is a small water view trail. To the center left the towpath continues. To the left is an access trail to a lockhouse.",

A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location. Lined in front to the north are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One six-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />Set in the grassy hill, equidistant between the two cannons and back to the south about thirty feet, is a bronze plaque atop a cement block. The cement base is about five-feet wide, four-feet deep, and three-feet tall. The bronze plaque measures three by three feet. It features a bas-relief of the fort design as viewed from above, detailing its walls, borders, bunkers and cannon platforms. In the upper right corner is a compass rose.<br />The lower left corner is inscribed to read:<br />Dedicated September 1936<br />In the Memory of<br />The Grand Army of the Republic<br />by the<br />Daughters of Union Veterans<br />of the<br />Civil War<br />1861-1865<br />An inscription in the lower right corner reads:<br />Scale Model of Fort Stevens<br />A measurement ruler is etched below.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Colonel Barton S. Alexander, Chief Engineer of the Defenses of Washington, placed it among the second class of fortifications for purposes of retention in 1865. He believed that it occupied a position, \"Which must be held when the city is threatened by a land attack.\"</p> <p>The work was completed in 1864 and had 12 gun emplacements. Eleven of them were empty, and a single 24-pounder siege gun mounted and set in position (en barbette) was the fort's sole armament.</p> <p>Fort Chaplin had a perimeter of about 225 yards, and was built at the altitude of approximately 180 feet. There were no buildings at the site when the army turned it over to the original land owner, Selby B. Scaggs, in the summer of 1865.</p> <p><span>Fort Chaplin is named after Col. Daniel Chaplin.

Together with Fort Kearney and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-reno.htm\">Fort Reno</a> to the west, it controlled the country roads between Rockville Pike and Rock Creek Valley.</p> <p>It was built in 1861 by the 4th New York Heavy Artillery and named for the regiment's commander, Colonel Gustavus A. DeRussy. Fort DeRussy was sited upon high ground on the west bank of Rock Creek to control movement along and across the valley. The fort coordinated its fire with Fort Stevens on the east and Fort Kearny on the west. It was built originally in the shape of a trapezium, armed with 7 guns, and afterwards expanded to mount 11 guns and mortars, including a massive 100-pounder Parrott rifle located at reshaped northeastern angle</p> <p>The fort was heavily engaged during the Battle of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-stevens.htm\">Fort Stevens</a> on July 11-12, 1864. Fort DeRussy's provided battery support to Fort Stevens to the northeast and also engaged rebel infantry north of the Defenses of Washington.. Altogether, Fort DeRussy had 11 guns and mortars which fired a total of 109 rounds to aid in the defense of Fort Stevens. Its 100-pounder Parrott rifle was the largest piece of artillery in the engagement, and was very effective in checking the Confederates' advance. It had a range that reached nearly all the way to Silver Spring, Maryland, and could destroy large bodies of troops.</p> <p>Fort DeRussy is in a good state of preservation. The parapet which consists of high earth mounds with openings where guns were mounted, and the deep ditch (dry moat) around the parapet, remain in clear and distinct outline. Also, there is visible evidence of where the powder magazines were located inside the fort. Near the fort, on the outside, well-defined rifle trenches extend in each direction.<br />  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fodu/index.htm\">Fort Dupont</a> was erected as part of the Eastern Branch Line Defenses (Anacostia River). Constructiobn commenced between Ocotober and December of 1861, and \"completed\" in the spring of 1862. The fort was built to protect a critical Ridge<br /> Road (Alabama Avenue) intersection and was supported by Forts Meigs and Chaplin to the north and Fort Davis to the south.<br /> <br /> Fort DuPont was a regular hexagonal redoubt, designed for 14 guns, 12<br /> firing through embrasures. Fort Dupont had six sides, each 100 feet long, protected by a deep moat and trees felled side-by-side with branches pointing outward. It was named for Flag Officer Samuel F. Dupont, who commanded the naval victory at Port Royal, South Carolina, in November 1861.<br /> <br /> It was never a strong work and in 1862, a commission studying the Defenses of Washington noted that a deep ravine to the west of the fort should be covered by a blockhouse. At other times, traverses to cover the sally port, magazine and rifle pits to the cover approaches were recommended.</p> <p>In April 1864, Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer, advised the abandonment of Fort Dupont. The army officially abandoned the fort in 1865. The grounds reverted to its original landowner, Michael Caton. </p> <p>Although its garrison and guns never saw battle, Fort Dupont served as a lifeline of freedom. Runaway slaves found safety here before moving on to join the growing community of \"contrabands\" in Washington. The barracks and guns are gone, but the fort's earthworks can still be traced near the picnic area on Alabama Avenue.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the National Capital Planning Commission acquired the old fort and surrounding land for recreation. A golf course was constructed and as the city grew, golf gave way in 1970 to the sports complex along Ely Place that now includes tennis and basketball courts, athletic fields, a softball diamond, and an indoor ice rink.  Once where soldiers viewed farmlands, park visitors now grow fruits and vegetables in the community garden.</p>",

The commision evaluated each of the forts, and made recommendations for improvement. Toward the end of the account, one gap was noted in the defensive arrangement:</span></p> <p>\"The commission furthers their opinion that the Defense of Washington cannot be considered complete without the defense of the river against an enemy's armed vessels. Foreign intervention would bring against us always in superior naval force on the Potomac, and we are, even now, threatened with Confederate iron-clads fitted in English Ports. The Commission believe on Jones' Point near Alexandria, a battery of six guns of the heaviest caliber, say four 200-pounders and two 15-inch guns in casements, and by constructing a battery of ten guns and a covering work on the opposite shore of the Potomac, at the near Roziers Bluff. An examination had been made, revealing a most favorable and strong position on that side, easily communicated with by water. Surveys are in progress.\"</p> <p>The suggestion of the committee was accepted, and the work on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fofo/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Fort Foote</a> began at Rozier's Bluff in 1863. </p> <p>The grand earthwork was first constructed in 1863 by the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, commanded by Colonel William Seward, Jr. The site, together with Battery Rodgers in Alexandria, Virginia, was designed for river defense. Their massive 15-inch Rodman guns (Columbiads) and 200-pounder Parrott rifles possessed the firepower to penetrate enemy ironclad ships. The Federal engineers had perfected earthwork construction around Washington D.C. by this point in the war. Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer Defenses of Washington, described the two sites as \"model works.\"Fort Foote was named in honor of Rear Admiral Andrew H. Foote, who distinguished himself in the actions against the confederate forts on the Mississippi Rivers and died of wounds on June 26,1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote's guns became a tourist attraction for government officials, military officers, and well-connect civilians, who traveled on river transports from the city to the Maryland shoreline to see the 49,000 lbs Rodmans test fired. General Barnard invited President Abraham Lincoln to visit the fort in late 1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote remained an active military installation until 1874. The U.S. Army performed a number of tests and experiments with cannons, carriages, and stone magazines at the site. <br /> <br />  </p> <p><span> </span></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Mahan was constructed at part of the Eastern Branch Defenses (Anacostia River). The earthwork was built to guard the approaches to Benning's Bridge, which crosses the Anacostia River.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was irregularly shaped with nine sides, and a perimeter of 354 yards. This fort was located less than mile east of Benning's Bridge and commanded the approaches to the bridge from Bladensburg via the Eastern Branch Road, and from Upper Marlboro by way of Benning Road.</p> <p>Over the next four years it underwent extensive repair and modification. The major problem with the fort was that it sat atop a rounded hill, and approaches to it were not visible from the parapet. To fix this problem 400 yards of rifle pits were constructed to cover its approaches. Structures were built that would provide a full range on which to attack oncoming troops (bastionets). These structures were projected from three angles of the exterior slope of the ditch (counterscarp) to provide reverse and covering fire for the exterior slopes. After Early's raid in 1864, the engineers laid abatis and constructed rifle trenches toward Anacostia River in order to prevent a flanking movement from that side.</p> <p>Fort Mahan was one of the later forts to be abandoned. At the end of the Civil War, Fort Mahan was named among the 11 works that occupied commanding positions and should be retained for a skeleton defense of the city. However, it was abandoned and reverted back to the Manning family. Mary Manning claimed damages in 1864, and in 1865 bought the abatis around the fort for $31 at public auction.</p> <p>Structures that were built at Fort Mahan included a guard house, at least two barracks, officers' quarters, a mess house, stables and some sheds.</p> <p><span>Fort Mahan was named after Dennis Hart Mahan. who was an American soldier and educator. In 1824, he graduated from West Point. He taught taught civil and military engineering at the Military Academy, and became an authority on military engineering. His works include: Complete Treatise on Field Fortifications (1836), Summary on the Cause of Permanent Fortifications and of the Attack and Defense of Permanent Works (1850), and An Elementary Course of Military Engineering (2 vol., 1866–67). </span></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gwmp/planyourvisit/fortmarcy.htm\">Fort Marcy</a> and nearby Fort Ethan Allen, among other batteries on the northern bank of the Potomac River, were built to protect Leesburg Pike and Chain Bridge. Construction began in 1861. When Fort Marcy was completed, it had a perimeter of 338 feet and mounted 18 guns, a 10-inch mortar and two 24-pounder Coehorn mortars.</p> <p>The hill on which the fort is located was known as Prospect Hill. Originally the fort was called Fort W.F. Smith after Major General William F. Smith, the troops of whose division began construction of the work. His division crossed Chain Bridge on the night of September 24, 1861, and immediately commenced construction of Fort Marcy and Fort Ethan Allen. The 79th New York Highlanders, the 141st Pennsylvania and the Iron Brigade also helped complete the work in the fall of 1862. A force of about 500 contrabands were employed. The 152nd New York worked on the entrenchments, which are still in a very good state of preservation. The site of Fort Marcy is near the location where the famous, but bloodless duel between Henry Clay and John Randolph was fought in 1826.</p> <p>The fort was not entirely completed until the fall of 1862. It is a relatively undisturbed fort and was named in honor of a native of Massachusetts, the Honorable Randolph B. Marcy, a distinguished soldier, father-in-law, and Chief of Staff to Gen. George B. McClellan. Detachments of the 4th New York Heavy Artillery, 3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery and the 130th Pennsylvania infantry were among the troops that performed garrison duty here during the war. An interesting incident of history is that the body of troops, which afterwards became famous, and the \"Iron Brigade\" was originated at this fort in the summer of 1861. It was composed of the 19th Indiana, the 2nd, 6th and 7th Wisconsin Regiments. The 24th Michigan was added to the brigade soon after the battle of South Mountain. These regulars remained together until the close of the war.</p> <p>After the Civil War ended Fort Marcy was returned to its original owners, the Vanderwerken family. The land remained in the Vanderwerken family until after World War II, when the DeLashmutt family purchased the property.</p> <p><span>\"</span>Thoughts on Fort Marcy,<span>\" is a poem written by Lillian Money-Read that was published in the </span><em>The Washington Post</em><span>, April 12, 1936. The poem is an eloquent tribute to not only Fort Marcy, <span>but the other forts in the Defenses of Washington system that have, over time, been covered by deciduous forests of American elm, yellow-poplar, and white ash. <span>Today these remnant earthworks</span><span> are a silent reminder of the protective shield that surrounded the nation’s capital during the Civil War years. </span></span></span></p> <p align=\"left\"><strong> </strong></p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Thoughts on Fort Marcy </strong>by Lillian Money-Read:</p> <p align=\"left\">The woodland drips with sun-warmed April rain,<br /> The trees are colorful with new–oped leaves,<br /> With half-blown buds the dogwood trees are snowed,<br /> The maple-tassels, green with scarlet cleaves.</p> <p align=\"left\">May apple flings its sweetness on the air,<br /> Translucent stemmed, the big dark violet<br /> And pied spring beauty, bride of early morn<br /> Bloom in the vivid moss with shy bluet.</p> <p align=\"left\">My dog bounds down and leaves a darkened trail<br /> Along the silvered hillside, wild with mirth,<br /> His mouth is spread, his limpid eyes a-shine,<br /> His muzzle wet with brown, sweet-smelling earth.</p> <p align=\"left\">On fair Fort Marcy, thus I dream today.<br /> And hear the swollen creek rush to the river,<br /> With muffled roar like a dreadful battle din<br /> Which made, of old, these frightened forests shiver!</p> <p align=\"left\">Ah, bright the ferns that clothe these silent moats,<br /> And sweet the lanes where walked the sentinel,<br /> Yet scarce a flower springs on this haunted ground<br /> But marks the place where some young soldier fell!</p> <p><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Reno was originally named Fort Pennsylvania, and was built during the winter of 1861 shortly after the disastrous defeat of the Union Army at the First Battle of Manassas. Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard, Col. of Engineers, U.S. Army, was in charge of construction of the defenses around Washington. Barnard chose the location of Fort Reno for its strategic importance in guarding the Rockville Pike (present day Wisconsin Avenue). Being the highest elevation in the city (429 feet above sea level), Fort Reno also served as a forward outpost and signal station for detecting enemy movement near the northern part of the city.</p> <p>Constructed by the 119th Pennsylvania Regiment, the fort's name was later changed to Fort Reno in 1863 in memory of Major General Jesse Lee Reno, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of South Mountain, September 14, 1862. <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Originally rather small, Fort Reno was enlarged and strengthened with an advanced battery 300 yards north from the highest ridge, across from what is now Fessenden Street and along 39th Street. This advanced battery had eight 12-pounder guns and a magazine, a covered walkway connected it to the main fort to the south. A double line of rifle trenches was added to strengthen the position.</span></p> <p>Eventually, the fort was the largest and strongest of those defending the capital with a dozen heavy guns, three Parrott siege guns and nine 27-pounder barbette guns. A strength of three thousand men of the First Brigade made Fort Reno the stronghold of the northern defenses of the capital.</p> <p>In July 1864, due to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's insistence that troops be moved from the defenses to reinforce his army at Petersburg, Fort Reno was under-manned, as were all of the defenses around the city. Hearing from spies that the capital was poorly defended, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Gen. Jubal A. Early to attack from the north. Around noon Monday, July 11, 1864 (before the Battle of Fort Stevens), Fort Reno was the first of the defenses to view Early's advance near Rockville, Maryland. The lookouts from the signal tower at Fort Reno saw clouds of dust, and then Confederate army wagons moving toward the city.</p> <p>During Early's assault of Fort Stevens on July 11th and 12th, 1864, the heavy guns of Fort Reno lent little support value, as there was a fear the long range guns would hit the Union Army's advanced pickets. One of the shells that was fired from Fort Reno by a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle traveled 3.5 miles north of the fort, killing four Confederates where the present day Bethesda Naval Hospital is located in Bethesda, Maryland. Due to Fort Stevens being reinforced on July 12, 1864, it was never taken by the Confederate army, nor was the capital city ever reached.</p> <p>During the fighting of July 10-12, 1864, small squadrons of soldiers from Forts Reno and Stevens had advanced into the countryside north of the city to fend off the invaders. A few Confederates were taken prisoner and brought back to camps where they were held until transfer to a central prison. Early's army retreated back across the Potomac River near Leesburg, Virginia, and Washington breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>After the close of the war, the forts (Reno included) were slowly dismantled and abandoned. Most of Fort Reno could be seen as late as 1892, but the fort and battery at the north end were eventually graded down for the construction of a water reservoir. Today the site is bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Fessenden Street, Belt Road, and Chesapeake Street, NW.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>By the 1890s, Union veterans, civic leaders, and community members desired to preserve the remnants of the Defenses of Washington. The earthen citadels that encircled the capital had long been abandoned by Federal soldiers. Peace, posterity, and the ploughshare returned much of the landscape to its pre-war condition, including Fort Stevens, site of the famed battle in July 1864. Early preservation efforts included the installation of a sign marking the spot where President Abraham Lincoln was under fire on July 12, 1864.<br /> <br /> Fort Stevens' eroding earthworks were a lasting testament to the Defenses of Washington as the Brightwood neighborhood developed around it. <br /> <br /> As part of the McMillan Plan, a comprehensive planning document for the development of the monumental core and the park system of Washington, D.C (first written in 1902 by the Senate Park Commission), the proposed Fort Drive Parkway consisted of \"a new drive-way through the suburbs of Washington to be called 'Fort Drive,' and include in its winding ways some of the most important of the fortifications which served as the Defenses of Washington during the rebellion . . .\"<br /> <br /> Rapid urban expansion and budget restraints, including the First World War and Great Depression, affected the full development of the parkway; however the Federal government was able to acquire most of the Fort Drive right-of-way between 1929 and 1932, and the forts/batteries managed by the National Park Service today.<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) accomplished a great deal of work on the fort parks. The CCC established nine camps in the Washington D.C. area, including one, established on October 23, 1933, at Fort Dupont Park. The CCC activities at Fort Dupont included erecting buildings for workers to live and eat in, cleaning up foot and horse trails, performing minor road construction, putting in a sewer, and constructing a two-car garage, carpenter shop, and toilet room. The CCC also performed \"forest protection,\" including cleaning up dead and fallen lumber, burning brush, grubbing stumps, cleaning up the dump, and disposing of trash at forts Stanton, Bunker Hill and Mahan, and doing general cleanup at forts Totten and Foote. At Fort Stevens, the CCC undertook a restoration, reconstruction, and landscape project; costing $25,000. The workers rebuilt the western portion of the fort parapet, using cement \"falsies,\" as one author called them, \"instead of logs and planks,\" because they would last longer.<br /> <br /> The work at Fort Stevens was completed in 1938. It was the only fortification restoration project. Today, Fort Stevens Park is managed by the National Park Service (Rock Creek Park).</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(436 words)<br />Fort Stevens is located in the northern corner of Washington, DC, within the center of a block bordered by 13th Street, NW to the west, Georgia Avenue to the east, Rittenhouse Street to the north and Quakenbos Street to the south.<br />Two fifty-foot tall oak trees stand along the lower south end of the park at street level by 13th Street. The park area rises about thirty feet from street level at 13th and Rittenhouse Streets about two hundred yards to the eastern end where the fort is situated. A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front, to the north of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face. The bunker measures sixty feet across and twenty feet deep. The white door is about seven feet tall and six feet wide and has three metal brackets on the outer sides of each door. The doors overlap in the center. It is set on a cement base that appears to run back into the hill.<br />A cement bunker wall with three-inch-wide log-like vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons on wheels, set on cement platforms and directed out to the north. Five additional cement platforms are set on about three-foot tall grass mounds that lead up to the cement wall.<br />About six feet left of the left cannon, sitting on grass just beyond the cement bunker wall is a stone marker with a bronze plaque displayed on its face. The stone is about five feet tall, four feet wide, and two feet deep. The plaque measures about one and a half feet high by two feet wide. It features a bas-relief and is engraved across the top to read:<br />LINCOLN UNDER FIRE AT FORT STEVENS<br />July 12, 1864<br />The image below is a bas-relief of a man in the center with top hat and long suit coat tending to a wounded man on the right falling with his head thrown back. Another man tries to pull the man in top hat away from the left. A man in the lower left corner watches on while holding a staff.<br />Back towards the flagpole is another bas-relief, atop a cement block base. It features the Fort Stevens design as viewed from above, detailing its walls, borders, bunkers and cannon platforms.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Totten was built was part of the Northern Defenses. It was located between Fort Slocum (West) and Fort Slemmer (East). Construction of Fort Totten began in August 1861 and was completed by 1863. An auxiliary battery connected by earthworks covered the space fronting the main fort. The fort occupied a high point in advance of the Soldiers' Home or Military Asylum, President's Lincoln summer home. It was located in Washington about three miles north of the Capitol, close to Silver Spring, Maryland.<br /> <br /> The fort mounted 20 guns and mortars, including eight 32-pounders. The fort's 100-pounder Parrott rifle provided long-range support to Fort Stevens during Confederate General Jubal A. Early's attack on that fort on July 11 and 12, 1864. Fort Totten was name in honor of Brig. Gen. Joseph G. Totten, Chief Engineer U.S. Army. </p>",

Since this area belonged to the War, Jefferson Davis. Davis agreed to allow a light to be placed with conditions that \" the light shall be placed upon the wharf and not within any of the fortifications; and the light keeper shall be subordinate to the military command of the post and public ground in all that relate to police and discipline. If the care of the light can be placed with the Ordnance Sergeant, it will prevent interference with his present charge of other public property.\" With this permission the Lighthouse Board appropriated $500 for a light. This first light was an 18.5-foot iron post, which was placed November 7,1857. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{215}\" paraid=\"1587903521\">The 1857 light pole remained until the 1870's when growth of the wharf caused obstruction to the light pole. A small 16-foot tower was built closer to the water's edge to replace to light pole. This was considered the first \"real\" lighthouse and a sixth order illuminant lens was placed in the tower. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{221}\" paraid=\"1996703945\">The current tower was built in 1889 as the Fog Bell Tower.  In 1901 the light was moved to the tower, due to the surrounding area overshadowing the “real” lighthouse.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{229}\" paraid=\"1672031331\">In 1954, the light was changed to unmanned automatic flashing red light. During the years that followed the wharf and all buildings associated with the lighthouse were removed. The light/fog bell tower is all that remains of a once active light station. Sometime during the late 1970's the fog bell mechanism broke, ending the bell ringing at Fort Washington. In 2020, the United States Coast Guard, removed the triangle red marker and light to the river, ending a more than a century of active duty. The tower remains standing in its original place.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The 32-foot tower is trapezoidal with the base being 16 feet and the top 4 feet. The wooden tower is painted white and is sitting on four grey brick pillars at the corners that are about 2 feet tall. There is a four-foot chain link fence around the lighthouse. The north and south sides of the light has a “ghost” image of the triangle marker that used to be on the tower and removed in October 2020. The west side of the lighthouse has two small windows on in the middle near the right edge and the other close to the top in the center, below a ridge that is part of the top of the lighthouse. The north side of the light has a small window on the left side of the light about midway up the tower. Above the ridge is a shelf that is attached to the tower that was for the light prior to its removal. There is a stack of wood under the tower, to add support to the structure until it can be repaired.",

Turn left and walk 1/2 of a mile on the towpath to the Olmsted Island trailhead, on your right. Trail is a series of boardwalks and bridges, crossing river channels and the Olmsted Island. Trail is a quarter mile long, with railings on both sides the entire way, and then arrives at Great Falls Overlook. The Overlook is a wooden deck. The Great Falls can be seen from the railing, where the Potomac River falls 60 feet or more. Across the river is Great Falls Park in Virginia. Two benches are along the left side of the deck area. A plaque honoring Frederick Law Olmsted is located on a large rock outcropping in the center of the deck area.",

    "audioDescription": "(621 words)<br />The C&O Canal Lock 5 Parking Lot is located on the west side of Canal Road, NW Washington, DC about one-eighth of a mile north of Chain Bridge Road.<br />The parking lot is a gravel space, about sixty-feet wide and one hundred-feet long. The lot is set immediately off Canal Road and is bordered by gravel at its east entry side.<br />Two portable bathrooms sit at the northeast end of the lot, on the right as you enter from Canal Road, about twenty feet from the roadside.<br />The lot is all gravel and surrounded by trees, including three thirty-foot tall trees located at the south end. A picnic table sits beneath them. <br />As you travel west a three-sided four by three-foot wayside sits at the trailhead in front of the canal and a ten-foot wood bridge that carries over it. The south side is titled at the top: River Warnings! Text below warns about various hazards associated with the Potomac River:<br />River Warnings!<br />The Potomac River is a hazardous force that deserves our constant respect. The 22-mile section of the river from Georgetown to Seneca has four dangerous areas that are unsafe for any type of water related recreation including boating, canoeing, fishbone, swimming, wading or rock hopping. Do not enter the water. This warning applies to the river areas around the Washington Aqueduct Dam, Great Falls, Little Falls Dam, and Little Falls Rapids. Serious and often fatal accidents occur at these locations every year.<br />A map to the right identifies areas too dangerous to enter the river and to avoid. These are Washington Aqueduct Dam, Great Falls, Little Falls Dam, and Little Falls Rapids:<br />Washington Aqueduct Dam:<br />A water supply dam for Washington, D.C. located just above the Great Falls. If this hazardous dam doesn't stop you, the falls just below it will! The Great Falls, MD parking lot is the last take-out before the dam.<br />Great Falls:<br />Where the Potomac River drops 40 feet over a steep jagged rock wall and into a narrow gorge. The falls are impassible. Use the C&O Canal to bypass the dam. You can reenter the river at Rocky Cove below the falls.<br />Little Falls of the Potomac<br />Located just upstream from Chain Bridge, this narrow chute of extremely powerful currents is hazardous. Many boaters and fishermen have drowned here. Take your boat out along the canal in the immediate vicinity of Sycamore Island. You can reenter the river at Fletchers Boat House.<br />Little Falls Dam:<br />Located four miles downstream from Cabin John Bridge, this innocent-looking small vertical drop is deadly. The river flowing over the dam is recycled back toward the dam wall rather than downstream. Trapping any object including people in the backwash. Many who end up in this vicious backwash drown. Stay away! The last take-out before the dam is the C&O Canal in the immediate vicinity of Sycamore Island.<br />The east-facing side of the sign is a map titled at the top to read:<br />C&O Canal National Historical Park - Locks 1 through 25<br />The map shows the C&O Canal in blue, flowing down from Cumberland, MD, around the edge of Washington, DC to Thompson's Boat Center in Georgetown where it enters into the Potomac River. A boxed map to the right identifies C&O Canal National Historic Parks, the C&O Canal, and Canal locks 1-25 from Cumberland to Georgetown.<br />The third side of the sign is titled \"Lock 5\", and shows general information about the C&O Canal, including safety warnings to wear life jackets at all times when boating, rafting, or tubing, a message that pets must be leashed, ice skate at your own risk, fishing licenses are required, canal boat rides are available, and information is available online at www.canaltrust.org.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The one-acre park is on the east side of Georgia avenue, NW between Whittier place to the north and Van Buren street to the south.<br />The Cemetery sits on a terrace approximately five feet above street level. A bluestone wall along the front edge is separated by two sets of three steps that lead up to a wrought-iron black gate at the Cemetery entrance. Set atop stone pillars on either side of the entrance are two six-foot long black cannons, one pointing north and one pointing south. On the face of the columns are black signs in the shape of a shield that both read in white: U.S. National Cemetery.<br />To the left about six feet from the front edge of the cemetery and set in a row across the lawn are four granite monuments, each between six and eleven-feet tall. To the right is a two-story red stone building with brown shutters and a gabled roof. A porch extends out on the west side of the building.<br />Directly back seventy feet from the entrance is a central flagpole, surrounded by forty-one marble headstones. Behind them and the east end of the Cemetery stands a white marble pavilion with four granite pillars.<br />Set to the right of the walkway about six feet from the top of the entrance steps is a two by three-foot wayside sign. Written across the top in black letters it is titled:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />The background of the entire sign is a black and white photograph of a small, one-story building with chimney, two windows on one side and one on another. A white picket fence runs behind the backside of the building. In front is a flagpole surrounded by white gravestones. Text in the lower right corner reads:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />Circa 1865-1870<br />Text in the bottom right corner reads:<br />You can download a podcast of Battleground National Cemetery at www.nps.gov/rocr<br />A smaller four by five-inch picture is set in the upper right corner. It shows a view from across the street at a two-story building set on a raised plot of land bordered by a stone brick wall in front. A staircase leads up through an opening in the wall. Monuments line the left front side of the property. A tall evergreen tree stands over the building, and other trees are set further back in the yard. Text written underneath reads:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />Circa 1930<br />Text written on the left side of the side describes the formation of Battleground National Cemetery:<br />During the late evening of July 12, 1864, 4o Union soldiers that perished while defending Washington, DC from a two-day Confederate attack) known as the Battle of Fort Stevens) were laid to rest here in what was once an apple orchard. President Abraham Lincoln, who attended the burial ceremony, dedicated the land as hallowed ground, making Battleground National Cemetery one of America's smallest national cemeteries.<br />Between the 1870s and early 1900s a Superintendent's Lodge, rostrum, flagpole, and regimental monuments were added to the cemetery to pay tribute to the brave men who sacrificed all to preserve this nation and its capital city. In addition to the fallen soldiers, the cemetery also holds the remains of the wife and three children of Augustus Armbrecht, the original superintendent of the cemetery.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(497 words) Fort DeRussy is located in Rock Creek Park in northwest Washington, DC, bordered by Military Road NW to the south, Oregon Avenue to the west, and Rock Creek to the east. From the northeast corner of the intersection of Oregon Avenue and Military Road, travel two hundred fifty feet north on the east side of Oregon Avenue, along a cement paved path into the edge of a forest. A four by three-foot wayside titled Fort De Russy sits at the right side of the path. Follow the path around the wayside to the right and proceed one-hundred twenty feet east at a slight incline into the forest to a fork in the road with a dirt path to the left. Follow the dirt path four hundred thirty feet where two waysides sit to the left of the path. The left wayside is three by two feet and titled in the top left corner: Fort DeRussy. The sign features an image of men in military dress standing in a circular bunker around a cannon lowered in the circle and on a wheeled turret. Six men stand atop a four-foot-tall wall that encircles the cannon. Eight other men stand within the lowered cannon space. Text below describes the cannon and Fort DeRussy: Built in 1861 to protect the Rock Creek Valley during the Civil War, Fort DeRussy's cannon fired a total of 109 projectiles into the northern countryside as 12,000-15,000 Confederate soldiers attacked the city under the command of Confederate General Jubal Anderson Early on July 11-12, 1864. During this two day battle (known as the Battle of Fort Stevens) Fort DeRussy aided the surrounding forts by providing the main suppressive fire to ensure a Union victory on the battlefield. The largest piece of armament which Fort DeRussy utilized was the 100-Pound Parrott Rifle. This cannon, shown above at nearby Fort Totten, could hurl 100 pound projectiles several miles into the Maryland countryside. During the Battle of Fort Stevens, Fort DeRussy halted the Confederate advance into the city by firing this deadly and accurate cannon a total of 28 times. The top right corner features a black and white photograph of a man standing at attention in a plain coat, pants and boots with a strap across his chest and holding a rifle and bayonet at his right side. Text beneath him reads: Private Samuel Strawser, a member of the 151st Ohio Volunteer Infantry, was stationed at Fort DeRussy during the Battle of Fort Stevens. A black and white oval photograph in the bottom right shows a bearded man in a hat, suit and vest. Text to his right reads: \"On the right was Rock Creek running through a deep ravine which had been rendered impassable...every appliance of science and unlimited means had been used to render the fortifications around Washington as strong as possible\"<br />General Jubal Anderson Early Commander of Confederate forces during the Battle of Fort Stevens You can download a podcast of Fort DeRussy at www.nps.gov/rocr END OF DESCRIPTION",

A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front to the east of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four-feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards (90 meters) across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with six three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />Set at the low-end corner of the block at 13th and Rittenhouse Streets is a four by three-foot wayside. The yellow sign is written in brown letters across the top:<br />Fort Stevens<br />The partial reconstruction of Fort Stevens that you see today was done by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937.

Jubal Early with his force of 15,000 soldiers. Defended by a meager force of convalescents, quartermaster employees and 100 day militia volunteers, Fort Stevens held back an attack by Confederate skirmishers on July 11. Reinforcements from the Union 6th and 19th Corps on the second day checked and turned back the only Confederate threat against Washington, DC, during the war. Late in the afternoon of July 12, President Abraham Lincoln was exposed to Confederate fire while observing this battle where approximately 900 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing.<br />Nearby Battleground Cemetery, which was dedicated by President Lincoln soon after the battle, contains the graves of 40 Union soldiers who died in defense of Fort Stevens.<br />To the right is a map of the top corner of Washington, DC, showing the locations of Civil War forts.

    "bodyText": "<p>Georgetown became a port city soon after its 1751 founding. Located on the Potomac River, it was a logical choice for the canal's terminus. Canal activity further spurred Georgetown's economic growth. By the late 1800s, it was a bustling industrial port, with loads of cargo transferring between ocean-going ships, smaller boats, and wagons. On the canal, mule-drawn coal boats sidled up alongside Georgetown's warehouses to unload their freight. After their week-long journey down the 184.5 mile canal, canal families looked forward to the sights and sounds of Georgetown.<br /> <br /> Construction of the canal began in 1828. Thousands of men, primarily immigrants, performed the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging and blasting through soil and rock. The skilled laborers, including stonemasons, carpenters, and blacksmiths created the dams, locks, culverts, aqueducts, and the Paw Paw Tunnel. Though each section of the canal started operating as it was completed, the entire route between Cumberland and Georgetown officially opened on October 10, 1850. After years of decreasing profits and devastating floods, operation of the canal ceased in 1924.</p> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "(1224 words)The Georgetown visitor center is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown neighborhood, at the northeast intersection of Thomas Jefferson Street, NW and the C&O Canal.The location is a two-story end unit row house, set at the northwest corner of Lock 3 of the C&O Canal. The red-brick building's front door is located on Thomas Jefferson Street. Four brick steps lead up to the white painted front door. An alcove with three windows is on the right, and three windows line the second floor. The visitor entrance is located on the southern, canal side. Two swinging glass windows are above on the first floor, and a single window sits on the top level. Four other windows and a door with an iron gate are set along the south side. A two by four-foot brown sign sits on the south, canal side that reads: \"Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park.\" The visitor entrance is set in a ten square foot alcove area lined with a two-foot high wood ledge bench. To the right of the door is a glass sign featuring Georgetown Visitor Center information. Along the northern side of this area are three white signs, about six feet tall set from ground level. The left sign features on its top third a brown and white picture of an industrial waterfront. Smokestacks and iron riggings are visible from across a wide river. The bottom of the sign features a timeline which spans all three signs. This portion covers 1825 to 1865. Noted at the top is \"1828 Ground Broken for Canal\" and \"1861-65 Civil War.\" The below are three photographs. The left picture, beneath the year 1825, shows men with horses on a wide and barren dirt landscape. Text above them reads: The canal was initially envisioned by its supported as a trade route between east and west. However, by the time the canal reached Cumberland, plans to extend it to the Ohio River at Pittsburgh had been abandoned for financial reasons. The middle picture, beneath the year 1850, shows a horse drawn carriage next to a railroad track in a dirt trench along a river above. A white house sits at the river's edge and smoke billows from machinery along the riverbank to the left. Text above reads. The canal was most active and profitable between 1865 and 1900. Over five hundred boats carried nearly one million tons of cargo annually between Cumberland and Georgetown. More than 90% of the boats arrived in Georgetown filled with coal. The final picture of the right shows an image of a canal crowded with nine canal boats sitting in the water. Text above them reads: The canal stretched 184.5 miles between Georgetown and Cumberland. Rising 605 feet in elevation along the journey, the canal averaged 60 feet across, six feet deep, and included seven dams, 11 aqueducts, and 74 lift locks. The middle sign is titled at the top: The Canal through Georgetown Below is map showing the canal as it passes from Rock Creek on the right, across the sign to the Aqueduct and Key Bridge on the left. The map shows locks one through four on the right side, and an arrow indicates your location between locks three and four. A dark blue line indicates the canal, and a brown line laid next to it shows the towpath. The bottom third of the sign is a continuation of a timeline that runs through all three signs. Represented here are:1890 B&O Railroad Takes Over Canal1914-18 World War 11924 Floods Close Canal Three black and white pictures line the bottom of the sign. Furthest left, below the year 1875, is an image of a canal, full of water and lined with four story brick row houses and buildings. A building with two tall smokestacks sits along the canal's right side. Text above reads: Georgetown grew to accommodate the canal's business. New wharves supported the distribution of coal, stone, and timber. Flour, paper, and cotton milling became successful industries in the town, using the canal as a new source of water power. The middle picture, under the year 1900, shows a canal scene crowded with canal boats lined up in the water. A man sits on the boat in the left foreground, and two girls stand along the towpath on the right. Text above reads: The Georgetown section of the canal includes four locks. As boats approached Georgetown and lined up to unload cargo, they created traffic jams on the canal. Boat crews sometimes waited days to unload before they could begin the return trip. The right-side picture, under the year 1925, shows a man in overalls and boots turned and facing away as he stands atop a boat in a canal. A boy and girl are at his sides, also facing away. He holds their hands as they float down the canal. Text above reads: Canal families eagerly anticipated their arrival in Georgetown. After a week on the boat, traveling through rural country and small towns, parents would allow their children to go up the city's streets to buy candy, ice cream or see a movie. The right sign has along its top third a black and white image of a man in hat and suspenders walking along a canal towpath with three horses.",

Turn right and follow the parking lot to the south about eight hundred feet. <br />At the end of the parking lot a pedestrian bridge leads left over the Potomac River. To the right is a curved stone wall, about two feet tall. One-foot thick and thirty feet long. Set about ten feet south of the stone wall, just beyond a row of black, arched bicycle racks is a two by three-foot wayside.<br />The tan sign is titled across the top in black letters:<br />American Indian Villages and Captain John Smith<br />In the center of the sign is a sketched map dotted with trees, winding rivers, and tributaries. Written in large letters on a scroll at the top is: \"VIRGINIA.\" In the bottom left corner is written: \"The Virginian Sea.\" Identified toward the center of the map in white letters are:<br />Tuscan Cross<br />Namassingakent<br />Assaomeck<br />Namoraughquend<br />Text below the map reads:<br />Captain John Smith's Map of Virginia (above), first published in 1612, is one of the best known maps of colonial America. The three seasonal fishing camps that Smith recorded are identified above. The Tuscan cross marks the Great Falls - the farthest limit of Smith's exploration.<br />If the map appears \"sideways\" it is because \"up\" is west rather than north. In the 1600s, mapmakers customarily drew maps from the perspective of a sailor approaching land from the sea.<br />Text along the left side of the sign describes Captain John Smith's exploration of the Potomac River:<br />On June 16, 1608, Englishman Captain John Smith and fourteen other men from the Jamestown colony entered the Potomac River aboard a two-ton open barge in search of a glistering metal the [natives] told us they had from Patowmeck. They explored upriver as far as the Great Falls. Along the way, Smith recorded many American Indian villages, which he later included on his map of Virginia.<br />The first three villages below the falls, on the right bank of the Potomac, were located on lands now part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The names of these villages, as heard by Smith and spelled in Elizabethan English, were Namoraughquend, Assaomeck, and Namassingakent. Translated from Eastern Algonquian into English they mean \"fishing place,\" \"middle fishing place,\" and \"fish-plenty of.\" The village of \"fishing place\" was probably between present-day Theodore Roosevelt Island and the Pentagon.<br />From late winter through August, anadromous fish (that live in salt water but spawn in fresh) like herring and sturgeon, swam upriver to the falls. When Smith first observed these three villages it was late June, after the native peoples had planted their crops. Very likely, the villages were seasonal fishing camps and not more-permanent agricultural towns.<br />The top right column features a color drawing of four Native Americans is a canoe. Two men row with long paddles at either end. Two other men stand in the water above while fish swim around them. An image at the bottom of the column shows two fish grilling on a wooded rack above an open fire as two other fish dry on sticks to the right of the grill.<br />Text between these two images reads:<br />In 1584-85, Englishman John White, a member of the Roanoke Colony, drew a series of watercolors depicting the life of the North Carolina Algonquians, who shared a culture similar to that of their linguistic cousins of the Potomac River. The image above depicts Indians fishing from a dugout canoe, including a fish weir for trapping fish (shown in the background).<br />The image below shows how they broiled fish over an open fire.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "Star Spangled Banner National Historic Trail<br /> <br /> \"The garrison to our great surprise, retreated from the fort and a short time afterward Fort Washington was blown up, which left the Capitol of America and the populous town of Alexandria open to the squadron without the loss of a man.\"<br /> <br /> Self-Destruction<br /> <br /> Explosions at Fort WashingtonAugust 27, 1814 surprised British and Americans alike. A British squadron slowly making its way up the Potomac expected resistance from the well-positioned fort. Alexandrians, fearing they were next after Washington's fall three days before, expected protection from the fort.<br /> <br /> Samuel Dyson, U.S. Army captain in command decided his 45-man garrison would be no match for the British. He ordered the fort destroyed and was later court martialed for his decision.<br /> <br /> Defenseless Alexandria negotiated surrender, and the British confiscated tobacco and other property. As the enemy withdrew down the Potomac with their prizes, angry Americans shot from shore and dispatched fire-ships with little effect.<br /> <br /> Welcome to Fort Washington's Waterside Trail<br /> <br /> Living where the land meets the water gives us everything we need: shelter in the woods, food to eat, and clean water to drink. Our climate promises a good life for the 15 million people and the more than 3,000 types of plants and animals that live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Certain soils and plant roots soak up much of the 30-40 inches of rain we receive each year. Leaves also absorb water, and forests slow a hard rain’s fall to earth. Woodlands shade the streams, and their roots hold stream banks in place. Pine trees and hardwoods layered over flowering shrubs, berry bushes, and wildflowers provide food and shelter for birds, mammals, insects, and turtles- just to name a few. In the clean, cool water nearby, fishes and shellfish feast on aquatic plants, and become food for larger fish, birds- like the Bald Eagle -and people.<br /> <br /> When rivers flood, or when rain hits land without woodlands, fast running water takes everything in its path to the bay. Pollutants from our homes, yards, cars, and work also flow into the bay. To protect the water, plants, and animals that live here, ribbons of waterside (or riparian) buffers of forests line the rivers and streams. These waterside woodlands slow the erosion of soil and absorb extra nutrients, while also providing shelter and food for wildlife. Preserving even small sections of riparian habitat helps protect our largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay. <br /> <br /> As a river meets the ocean, a dynamic world of daily and seasonal changes in saltiness and temperature becomes the home to unique plants and animals. The rhythmic tidal changes work like an engine producing food, and decomposing matter. Winter storms tear wetland plants into food for fishes and all microscopic life. These tiny aquatic plants and single-cell animals grow in abundance when nutrients churn up from the bay floor and flow off the land. In the spring, many different types of ocean fishes swim up rivers to eat and lay eggs, and then return again to the salty ocean. In the warm waters of summer, crayfish and shellfish find food, and become food. Throughout the fall, millions of migratory birds come to the Atlantic Flyway to feed on the plants, nutrients, fishes, and shellfish. Throughout the year, each part of the ecosystem depends on another in a powerful dance of life. Walking on this trail, you will see some of the plants and Animals that make their home in waterside woodlands.",

A black Rodman Gun sits on a gray concrete foundation dug into the earth. The gun is about 15 feet long by 8 feet tall, or 5 meters long by 2 and a half meters tall. The reddish-brown dirt is cut away to show the underground supporting structure. The gun consists of a large horizontal carriage with a bottle-shaped cannon on top. The gun points to the left, toward the river. Below ground, are stacked gray counterweights to balance the gun for raising and lowering it. On the right, four soldiers stand at the base of the gun, ready to push it up and over the fort wall to fire. On the left, two soldiers stand on top of the fort wall. The fort wall is built of upright logs and topped with green grass. One soldier points towards the river. Over the color illustration, is a ghosted illustration of the Rodman Gun in firing position. To fire, the soldiers pivot the enormous gun on its mount to raise it over the fort wall. At the same time, the counterweights below drop into a deep pit. After firing, the gun’s recoil slides it back down the mount to its resting position. [End of message]",

In metric, that is about 2 meters long by a quarter meter wide by a half meter tall. Ahead of you, is a dense forest. A color illustration fills the panel. The illustration shows a busy fort, the Potomac River with many ships, and Alexandria in the distance. On the left, is the six-sided earthen fort. The fort is longer than it is wide. To the right, is a grassy landscape with several buildings. The buildings are labeled with white text on green backgrounds. From left to right, are the hospital, horse trough, barracks, and officers’ quarters. Around the horse trough and barracks, horses pull covered wagons with supplies. A dirt road runs from the bottom left corner of the panel, up and to the right, and past the fort. It ends at a rectangular dock on the top right edge of the landscape. Across the middle of the panel, is the light blue Potomac River. The other side of the river is Virginia, which was Union occupied.

On the right side of the panel, is a color photograph of where you are now. A pencil sketch layers a historic scene over the contemporary photograph. The sketch shows what this entrance gate would have looked like in the mid-1800s. Tall logs line the path and lead to a metal arched gate. On the top of the gate, is the word “FOOTE.” Several Union soldiers walk toward and away from you. The soldiers wear dark caps, dark coats, light pants, and dark boots. Each soldier carries two small bags across their bodies and holds a musket. On the left, is yellow and white text on a dark blue background: Reporting for Duty.

Attached to the panel, is a table 3 feet wide by 1 and a half feet deep, and 3 feet off the ground. This table supports a bronze model of the fort. The panel is at the edge of the parking lot. Ahead is a dirt path, that leads to the fort. The background is a red map of Washington, DC, and the surrounding area. At the top, is the text quoted in this entry's body text, in yellow and white. Under the text, is a black-and-white photograph of 9 Boy Scouts sitting or standing on a Rodman Gun, lying in the grass. Students and scouts used the site in the early 1900s. The National Park Service took over the fort in 1931, changing the fort’s mission from defense to recreation and conservation. At the right, is a large black-and-white portrait of a standing Union Rear Admiral Andrew Hull Foote. He is bearded and dressed in military uniform, with prominent epaulettes, or decorative fringe, on his shoulders. His left arm wraps around his sword hilt. He died in 1863. He is known for his heroic actions on the Mississippi River. Across the bottom of the panel, is a black-and-white photograph of the fort under construction in 1863-1864. In the center, is a large earthen mound with wooden footings. To either side of the mound, is a flattened path. On the outer sides of the path, are earthen walls and wooden structures. Most of the structures are finished with round, earthen roofs, but some are still being built. The surrounding area is devoid of trees, unlike today. Across the bottom, is a transparent yellow banner. Within the banner, on the right, is the quote by Alfred Seelye Roe in red text. The other side of the panel is filled with a blue, green, and off-white map. Virginia is at left, Maryland is at right, and the Potomac River is in between. Washington, DC is at the top. Several National Parks Service sites are located in this region along the river. On the map, they are shaded green and labeled by name. The map shows hiking trails, off-road bicycle trails, on-road bicycle routes, food services, marinas, boat ramps, and canoe or kayak launches. Across the bottom, is a color photograph of a farm. This is Oxon Hill Farm at Oxon Cove Park, which is 4 and a half miles, or 7 kilometers, north of Fort Foote. At left, are 2 brown cows lying on green grass. In the background, at right, is a red barn with a gray roof. A red hay loader sits in front of the barn. In top left corner of the photograph, is white text: Your Adventure Continues End of Text At the right end of the photograph, is the image caption in white text on a green background. On the left side, in the middle, is a color photograph of Fort Washington Park. The fort is a gray stone and concrete building on a grassy hill. It was built on the east bank of the Potomac River.

    "bodyText": "The C&O Canal aqueducts are “water bridges” that carried canal boats over the creeks and rivers that flow into the Potomac River. Built between 1836 and 1838, the Licking Creek Aqueduct is the seventh of twelve such “works of art” on the canal. It was the first single arch aqueduct to be built on the canal. The Canal company described the 90-foot aqueduct as “one of the longest, if not the longest aqueduct arch” in the United States. It was later surpassed by the 297-foot arch of the Cabin John aqueduct at mile 7.6.",
    "audioDescription": "(211) The Licking Creek Aqueduct is located along the towpath in Big Pool, Maryland. It has a single, 90-foot arch. The top of the aqueduct has two parts, a water way for the canal boats and a towpath for the mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 11 feet wide and its bottom is about four feet lower than the towpath. To get to Licking Creek Aqueduct, start at the Handcock Visitor Center parking lot (about 6.5 miles from the aqueduct). From the parking lot, walk about 80 feet to the east and turn left (South) onto the towpath access road. Follow the road about 300 feet, until the path meets the towpath. Turn left (east) onto the towpath. The lock is 6.5 miles down the towpath. Once on the aqueduct, you will be walking in the canal waterway. On your right, the wall that makes the side of the waterway sits about 4 feet tall. On top of the wall is the original towpath. A metal fence sits on the far side of the towpath, between the path and the drop to the creek. On the left, the canal wall no longer exists, giving an unobstructed view of Licking Creek. There is no barrier between the path and the drop.",

Four centuries later Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia were still arguing over their mutual boundary.<br />Alexander's Island was one controversial site. It was known for its \"bogs and swamps and frogs.\" At low tide the island was attached to - and claimed by - Virginia. At high tide the Potomac River encircled it, making it part of the District of Columbia<br />Tensions over Alexander's Island exploded in 1904. A group of enraged men carrying axes and sledgehammers raided the Alexander Island Race Track in an attempt to close it. The District of Columbia did not permit race track betting, while Virginia did.<br />In 1915 the Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the Potomac River. In the process they completely removed the swampy landmass that was Alexander's Island. In its place they created the Boundary Channel, which runs beneath this footbridge, and Columbia Island, which is visible across the channel from you.<br />In 1934 Congress determined that, while Alexander's Island had once definitely been part of Virginia, its destruction shifted the shoreline of the Potomac River. The Boundary Channel became the new official border for Virginia, and the man-made Columbia Island was unquestionably part of Washington, D.C.<br />On the right side of the sign is a map of the Potomac River along the southern point of Washington, Boundary Channel, Columbia Island and an area across the river in Virginia labeled \"Arlington Canyonment.\" Text below reads:<br />The Boundary Channel and Columbia Island on a World War II map.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Three trees grow in the grass center of the loop, and more trees dot the grassy lawns that surround the road. To the west is a short white brick building, approximately 25 by 15 feet, with a black roof and a chimney. To the north are the ruins of a red brick house. Two walls, approximately 60 feet long, with five rectangular windows face the road. They are capped on either end by shorter walls, approximately 30 feet long, and bisected by a third. Each of the short walls has a chimney in the center. The house is one and a half stories tall with no roof. The ruins are enclosed by a 100 x 115 foot chain link fence that is covered in vines and bushes. To the right of the road is an open field with picnic benches and a cemetery.",

    "audioDescription": "Mockley Point juts out into the Potomac to form the mouth of Piscataway Creek. The shore is lined with medium sized broken rocks that protect against the erosion of the Point’s sandy beaches, which are visible at low tide. There are often small rocks and driftwood dotting the beaches. A thin line of trees grows between the beaches along the Potomac and the marshes further inland. Fort Washington is situated across the mouth of Piscataway Creek and may be visible, depending on the day and season. Just over six miles to the north is the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. Across the Potomac is the George Washington Memorial Parkway nestled along the wooded shoreline of Virginia.",

    "bodyText": "The C&O Canal aqueducts are “water bridges” that carried canal boats over the creeks and rivers that flow into the Potomac River. Built from 1829 to 1833, the Monocacy Aqueduct is the third of twelve such “works of art” on the canal. With just one glace, visitors are struck with the magnitude of this marvelous seven arched structure. The glistening white and pink quartz sandstone structure is the longest aqueduct along the C&O Canal measuring in at 516 feet. At the time of the Civil War, during the Maryland Campaign of 1862, the Monocacy Aqueduct was nearly destroyed by Confederate General D.H. Hill. However, concerned Lockkeeper Thomas Walter persuaded the Confederate troops that destroying Lock 27 would be far more impactful in their pursuit. Today, the Monocacy Aqueduct still stands thanks to restoration work that was completed in 2004 and continual preservation of this structural gem.  ",
    "audioDescription": "(337 words) The Monocacy Aqueduct is located along the C&O Canal Towpath in Dickerson, Maryland. This granite stone bridge is 516 feet long and spans the Monocacy River. It has seven arches and each arch spans a distance of approximately 54 feet. The base of the arches, called piers, are six feet wide. There are six piers. The top of the aqueduct has a water way for the canal boats and a towpath for the mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 20 feet wide and its bottom is about six feet lower than the towpath. The walls on either side of the aqueduct are about 8 feet wide. To get to the aqueduct start from the Monocacy Aqueduct Parking Lot. From the parking lot head back toward the road you drove in on, near the northern edge of the lot. Once back on the road, head northwest about 100 feet toward the gravel access path. The path forks about 60 feet down the access path. To the right is a path that leads to picnic tables and a scenic view of the aqueduct. To the left the access path continues to the towpath. Continue down the access path on the left another 220 feet. The access path will dead end into the towpath. Once on the towpath turn right toward the aqueduct. About 200 feet down the towpath is a fork in the path. To the right is access to the aqueduct waterway. To the left is access to the aqueduct towpath. The waterway sits about six feet lower than the towpath. Select a path and walk another 200 feet to the aqueduct. On the waterway path you can see stone blocks forming walls on either side of you that are about 6 feet tall. On the towpath you can look down into the waterway on your right or look to the left were the Monocacy River meets the Potomac River. The towpath has a fence on the river side and two-foot bumpers on the waterway side.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Believed to have been originally built in the last quarter of the 18th century, the Laurel Branch house was a simple one-story two-room dwelling of modest dimensions and appearance. Deeper than wide, room behind room, and exterior chimneys at one end the house was typical of an architectural style popular in lower Southern Maryland from the second half of the 18th century well into the first half of the 19th century. Homes of this style and construction were often owned by tradespeople or small landowners of modest means. As typical as this house is it is also in many ways atypical.</p> <p><br /> What makes this home more interesting is the way it was constructed. Much of it is far less “sophisticated” than one might think. Its sills and joists were laid without any support and riven clapboard of less than ideal dimensions were used in the construction of the roof and attic partitions. There is evidence that the ceiling rafters and joists were made from improperly dried wood and warped shortly after construction. No doubt other homes were built using these shortcuts, and no wonder only one, Laurel Branch, survived.<br /> If there is one aspect of the house that is the most interesting and helps us date it more precisely it is the two small, cater-cornered fireplaces. Laurel Branch is the only example of this room behind room plan with such fireplaces recorded in Charles County or as far as is known, in all of Southern Maryland. This design of corner fireplaces was common in the area between 1740 and 1770 and given all the other data the house is generally agreed to have been built circa 1770.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The tobacco barn which now stands at the National Colonial Farm is arguably one of the most significant known remaining pieces of agriculturally related 18th-century architecture in eastern North America. This tobacco barn was originally the property of William Hall of southern Anne Arundel County. He had two such barns, and they were the largest and most important structures on his property. Built well, these barns survived all manner of weather, but one of the barns, at last, was endangered by development plans. Efforts by the National Park Service and the Accokeek Foundation secured the relocation of this tobacco barn to the National Colonial Farm. The barn features fascinating construction techniques and was carefully reconstructed to preserve early agricultural messages. The original designers had made use of pieces from earlier barns. The basic construction technique is known as “Tidewater framing” and consists of plates, rafters and corner braces connected by pinned mortise and tenon joints. Hand adzed oak, walnut and chestnut timbers predominate. The roof is steeply pitched at about 54 degrees, and the eves rest on a false plate (where the soffit would normally fit) allowing for increased ventilation.</p> <p> </p> <p>The frame was covered with clapboard siding in approximately 4-foot lengths. The open spaces, where clapboards have been left off, serve to increase ventilation as well.  All siding and roofing were secured with completely hand-forged nails made in the 18th century. The tobacco barn is capable of housing 12,000-18,000 lbs of tobacco. At a time when most people have lost connection to land and agricultural roots, visitors are invited to enter the tobacco house, stand under the curing leaf and weathered beams and experience the rhythms of our agricultural past that continue to inform the present day.  </p>",

    "audioDescription": "(840 words)The Netherlands Carillon is located south of the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial and north of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.From the intersection of 14th Street North and North Meade Street, travel east into the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial grounds and follow the pedestrian path south about seven hundred fifty feet.The Netherlands Carillon sits on a hill approximately one hundred feet above the Potomac River, and offers a scenic view of the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, Post Office Tower and United States Capitol. The structure is an open steel tower reinforced by steel plates. It stands approximately one hundred twenty-seven feet high, twenty-five feet deep, and thirty-six feet wide. Three rows of bells hang from a top section of the tower. It sits on a quartzite plaza ninety-three feet square and enclosed by a one-foot high, three-foot wide lava stone wall. An engraving on the front base of the structure reads:FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE NETHERLANDS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICATwo bronze lions guard the plaza front steps. A rectangular staircase leads to an observatory platform from which a small circular staircase winds up to the glass-enclosed playing cabin eighty-three feet above the ground. Planted on the surrounding grounds to the east are thousands of tulip bulbs and other flowers grouped in beds. A grove of trees lines the back area to the west.An engraving on the right back of the structure reads:CONSTRUCTED BY PETIT & FRITSEN AARLE-RIXTELTHE NETHERLANDSAn engraving on the inside panel of the back wall reads:BELLS FOUNDED BY H.T.& A.H. VAN BERGENB. EIJSBOUTSPETIT 7 FRITSENTHE NETHERLANDSA brown sign on the left side of the tower's stairwell reads in white letters:CARILLONNEUR OF THE DAYFifty feet northeast of the tower are two three by four-foot waysides. The left sign, titled: \"Modern Liberation,\" features an overhead photograph of the tower along the left side. A circular pattern of colorful flowerbeds set in front of the tower is displayed in the center of the sign. Text across the tower reads:From the People of the Netherlands to the People of the United StatesAlong the right is an image of a lion statue taken from behind as it faces east towards the Lincoln Memorial. Text above details the dedication of the Netherlands Carillon:The Netherlands Carillon was dedicated on May 5, 1960, on the 15th anniversary of the Netherlands' liberation from Nazi Germany. In gratitude for American aid received during and after World War II, the Dutch people rallied to support the memorial proposed by the Dutch government. This democratic cooperation reflected our two nations' solidarity behind democratic principles, especially as the Cold War grew in intensity.Dutch architect Joost W.C. Boks designed the 127 foot tower on contrast to older European architecture that some considered to be fascist. The tower's abstract design, with its Piet Mondrian-like rectangular shapes, raised some eyebrows because it was the first modernist steel memorial associated with the otherwise classical stone architecture on the National Mall. Today the Netherlands Carillon-in view of the Capitol, Washington Monument, and Lincoln Memorial - stands as an exclamation point on the symbolic lines of Washington, D.C.The right sign is titled: \"Harmony of Friendship.\" On the right side is a closeup image of a curved piece of steel engraved with figures and symbols along the top, a Dutch message across the middle, and designs of lions, shields, and V-shapes crossed with vines and berries. Below, a man sits at a wooden structure with a series of levers. Text beneath reads:Edward M. Nassor, volunteer carillon director, plays the bells with his hands on the clavier â€˜batons' and feet on the pedals.On the right is a black and white image of a seated woman in fur coat waving next to a smiling man in rimmed glasses. Text below reads:In 1952, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands presented a silver bell to President Truman as a promise of the carillon.Text on the left describes the gift of the carillon from Queen Juliana:With the gift of a carillon Queen Juliana of the Netherlands presented something truly Dutch to the American people. The fifty bells are inscribed with a verse from a poem and an emblem representing each of the Dutch provinces and different aspects of Dutch society. Describing the gift, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands said,So many voices in our troubled world are still unheard. Let that be an incentive for all of us when we hear the bells ringing.The Dutch royal family guard the Carillon bells in the form of two bronze lions made by Dutch sculptor Paul Philip Koning. The flower beds shaped like musical notes took root with 10,000 tulips donated by the people of the Netherlands in support of Lady Bird Johnson's beautification efforts in 1964.Text at the bottom of the sign reads:For concert schedules and more details on the Netherlands",

When the British navigated up the Potomac in late summer of 1814, they sailed past Mount Welby; the DeButts later found three Congreve rockets near their home.  <br /> <br /> Today, it is used as the Park's Administrative offices.  <br /> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "The Paw Paw Tunnel is one of the most significant engineering features on the Canal. To save building six miles of canal along the river, the C&O Canal Company decided to construct a tunnel through a steep topographic ridge now called Tunnel Hill. When work began on the tunnel in 1836, the builders estimated the project would be completed within two years. The tunnel ultimately required 14 years to complete due to labor issues and violence, funding shortfalls, work stoppages, and the challenges of digging a 3,118-foot tunnel through the hard, loose shale. The tunnel opened in October 1850 with rockslides continuing to be a challenge throughout the tunnel’s history. <br /> <br /> Today, when you plan your visit to the Paw Paw Tunnel, bring a flashlight and discover the weep holes, rope burns, rub rails, as well as brass plates marking every 100-feet that bring the tunnel’s history to life. Following your travels through the tunnel, enjoy the two-mile long Tunnel Hill Trail where you can discover breathtaking views of the Paw Paw Bends.  <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "(142 words) Paw Paw Tunnel is located along the towpath in Oldtown, Maryland. To access it, go to the Paw Paw Tunnel Drive-in Campground parking area off of MD-51. From the parking lot is a short, 50-foot path, with a slight incline that leads up to the towpath. Once on the gravel towpath, turn right and at about a half a mile, you will approach Paw Paw Tunnel. It is 3,118 feet long with wooden railings on the left side and the wall of the tunnel on the right. The tunnel contains the original railings and contain rope burns from when the canal boats were being pulled through the tunnel by mules. Along the wall are circular, brass plates that mark every 100 feet. At the downstream exit of the tunnel is a wooden boardwalk with railings on the left side. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "At the edge of the North Valley Trail is a shaded, slanted sign in the forest. The hillside behind the sign holds rectangular cracked concrete building foundations covered in moss that sit about 2-3 feet above the ground. The sign has a black bar at the top with the words \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior\" and an NPS arrowhead symbol on the black bar in the upper right corner. The background image underlying the text on the sign is a black and white photo of several large wooden buildings on a hillside with 5 tubes extending from them down the hillside and stream shooting from the roofs of some of the buildings. The background image is captioned in the lower left corner of the sign, \"The Cabin Branch Pyrite Mine consisted of more than 70 buildings and had 250 employees.\" The sign is titled \"Pyrite Mine and in the upper part of the sign under the title paragraphs read, \"'Before I will give you another penny, I will let the shafts fill up with water and the frogs jump in,' the mine superintendent told workers who were seeking a raise of 50 cents per day. Unbeknownst to the workers, a cheaper but higher grade of pyrite had been discovered in Spain. So, the superintendent shut down the Cabin Branch Pyrite Mine that was located here along Quantico Creek. From 1889 to 1919, miners from nearby communities used dynamite to extract pyrite from shafts more than 1,000 feet below the surface. The ore was mined for its sulfur, which industries used to make soap, fertilizer, paper, medicines, and explosives.\" To the right of these paragraphs in the upper right corner of the sign is a black and white historical image of 5 stacked paper money coupons for the mine store labeled \"5 Cents on this page.\" The image is captioned, \"In 1919 miners received $3.50 to $4.25 per day. Some of their pay consisted of coupons redeemable only at the company store.\" In the bottom right corner of the sign is a warning reading, \"Do not disturb or remove any historic features or natural features, including rocks.\"",

    "bodyText": "Standing on this viewing platform, look through the trees across the creek and you can see the hillside site where the old milling buildings were contrusted and operated by the Cabin Branch Mining Company from 1889-1920. Milling the pyrite ore and sorting it by quality and size was an essential part of the mining operation. After sorting by size, the ore would be spread out and hammered until it could pass through a 2 1/2 inch ring. Smaller pieces were ground between wheels and screens until fine. It was then sent down the hill via the vertical structures show on the sign image and put into railway cars.<br /> <br /> When the mine closed down in 1920, the buildings were abandoned and many of the mine tailings were left exposed. Sulfur from the pyrite started to leach into the creek and raised the acidity of the water. While reclamation of the mine land was ongoing since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1970, the largest reclamation project took place in 1995, capping mineshafts, burying mine tailings with lime, building storm-water channels to divert run-off, and planting trees and shrubs.",

In 1995 the National Park Service and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy started a project to reclaim the site, because the land could not heal itself. They built storm-water channels to divert surface water, capped mineshafts with cement, buried mine tailings with lime and soil to reduce acidity, and panted 5,000 trees and shrubs.\"",

    "bodyText": "In 1896, just eleven years after the completion of the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., the United States War Department placed an obelisk as a monument at the site thought to be George Washington's birthhouse. <br /> <br /> The monument stood 50 feet tall, almost exactly 1/10th the size of the one in Washington D.C. To protect the monument, it was surrounded by an iron ornamental fence and a gate.<br /> <br /> The monument became a destination visit for many travelers. Thousands of visitors, from America, Europe, and Asia paid their respects to George Washington by visiting the monument. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt came down from Washington, D.C. on a day visit. Roosevelt noted:<br />   \"...I spent about four hours ashore, taking [my] lunch and walking up to the monument which marks where the house stood in which Washington was born. It was a simple shaft.\"<br /> <br /> In the late-1920s, the Wakefield National Memorial Association formed to commemorate the landscape at George Washington's birthplace. The group decided to build a house as a memorial to Washington on the same spot where the monument stood. Many complained that moving the monument would be too costly, since the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, and that moving the monument from the original birthhouse location would lessen its importance.<br /> <br /> Despite the objections, in 1931, the monument was removed from its original base. It was transported in pieces by carts and reinstalled at the park entrance on a new base which added five feet to the overall height of the monument. The original design was also changed with the words \"Washington's Birthplace\" and the years of its installation removed from the monument.<br /> <br /> The monument is now the first landmark that visitors to the park see. ",

Even early on it was evident that the Log House could not generate enough revenue to cover its expenses. As the park was not a final destination for most visitors, they did not stay the night. <br /> <br /> Financial losses led the Association to close the Log House. Today, it is used as a meeting and conference space. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "In June of 1923, a group of public-spirited women met in the home of wealthy socialite Josephine Wheelwright Rust, a descendant of the Washington Family, to discuss plans to develop George Washington's birthplace for the anniversary of his 200th birthday in 1932. During this meeting, the Wakefield National Memorial Association (WNMA) was born and Rust became the group's president. As president, Rust's vision was to build from scratch a \"Memorial House\" at the place of Washington's birth and surround it with the appearances of an 18th century plantation environment. This romantic, but unrealistic vision would create a series of challenges to the entire development of the Memorial Area and the Memorial House Museum.<br /> <br /> Rust initiated her plan by approaching Congress for funding to build the house. Congress agreed to the request and sent instructions to build a house as close as possible to the originial design. With no surviving images of Washington's birthhouse to use as inspiration, it is rumored that Rust decided to base the house on the architecture of local colonial structures that she had known growing up, including her childhood home, Twiford, still located in Westmoreland County today. Rust's \"Memorial House\" would not resemble the birthhouse of George Washington as it would be much larger and grander than the 1732 home. <br /> <br /> Rust was determined to place the Memorial House at the same location of the monument the War Department had placed in 1896. Although the monument stood on grounds that were reputedly the location of the birthhouse, there were many who doubted that it was the actual location. Moving the monument was also costly, and seemed to some to be a frivolous expense, considering the nation was in the midst of the Great Depression. Nonetheless, Rust perservered. The funds to move the monument arrived, and it was removed from its existing base, loaded on carts in pieces, and installed on a new base at the entrance to the park. <br /> <br /> With the arrival of the National Park Service (NPS), who arrived after the creation of George Washington Birthplace National Monument in January 1930, Rust found challenges with her ideas for not only the Memorial House, but the Colonial Revival Garden, and the buildings and layout of the Memorial Area. <br /> <br /> Rust's plans for the Memorial House Museum went forward, and the house was completed in the summer of 1931, in time for the Bicentennial of Washington's birth. On June 26, 1931, Rust died, only four days after turning over the deed for the property to the National Park Service. A tribute service was held for her on February 11, 1932, in the Memorial House Museum with many WNMA members in attendance. On May 14, 1932, the Memorial House Museum was officially opened by the National Park Service. ",

    "bodyText": "<p>One of the more unique features at Thomas Stone’s plantation of Haberdeventure is the curved five-part house. While parts of the house are original to Thomas Stone’s lifetime, fire damage, renovation, and modernization have changed the structure.</p> <p>Thomas Stone purchased the 442-acre property from his uncle, Daniel Jenifer, on December 13, 1770. Construction of the house's brick Central Block began in the spring of 1771. The following year, Thomas and his family likely took up residence even though the work was incomplete.</p> <p>The Central Block’s first floor comprises the Center Passage along with the East and West Rooms. The second floor had two large rooms that would have served as bed chambers.</p> <h4>Center Passage</h4> <p>Upon entering the Center Passage, guests could see a large and attractive stairway, expensive portraits, and decorative rooms to the left and right, which provided clues to the wealth and status of the Stones. With doors at each end, this breezeway may have been one of the house's most comfortable rooms during the spring, summer, and fall.</p> <h4>West Room</h4> <p>The West Room is believed to be the Master Bedchamber. Ornate first floor bedchambers in colonial era homes often served the dual purposes of being daytime or informal parlors. In the case of Margaret Stone, who developed a debilitating case of arthritis that often turned her into an invalid, she likely did not receive many guests but could converse with her family on her better days.</p> <p>While there is no supporting evidence, the lifestyles of slave owning gentry of the time suggests that an enslaved African American may have slept either on the floor of the West Room or in the adjacent Center Passage, to be readily available to care for the family's needs both night and day.</p> <h4>East Room</h4> <p>It is evident this room was used for entertaining. Contrary to modern and romanticized visions of colonial era homes, most were not elegant and pristine. Few colonial homes had rooms as beautiful as Thomas Stone's East Room. The expensive furnishing and window coverings and the well crafted woodwork were designed to impress guests, and even though this woodwork is a reconstruction of the original it still shows the detail that was put into the work.</p> <p>Aside from its beauty, the East Room may have served a more important function. With only one doorway, the room could provide privacy for Thomas Stone as he performed his legal and political duties along with directing county defense activities during the American Revolution. In Maryland’s heavily class-based society, the elegance of the East Room emphasized the importance, power, and success of Thomas Stone and justified his role as a leading figure in the community.</p> <h4>Second Floor</h4> <p>The purpose of the second floor was to serve as bed chambers, not just for Thomas and Margaret Stone’s three children. Upon Thomas's father's and eldest brother's deaths in 1773, Thomas permitted some of his younger brothers and sisters to live in the home. Also, as a host to law clients, political allies, several siblings and their families, distant relations, and countless friends, Stone was expected to provide places for everyone to sleep. </p> <p>Crowded homes were quite common in the colonial era. Rooms were hot and stuffy in the summer and drafty and cold in the winter. Privacy by modern standards barely existed. Even George Washington referred to his mansion of Mount Vernon as a “well-restored tavern.”</p> <h4>West Hyphen</h4> <p>The adjoining West Hyphen was built during Thomas Stone’s ownership to connect to the West Wing, which served as a kitchen for the Stones. This Hyphen may have served as a multi-use space with easily moved furnishings to allow dining, indoor chores and crafts, entertaining, and possibly to serve as a guest chamber.</p> <h4>West Wing</h4> <p>The original West Wing kitchen space is believed to have been a small and relatively unadorned structure designed for the function of cooking, cleaning, and other household chores by enslaved workers. The current West Wing, which partially rests upon the original foundations, dates from the mid-1840s. There are two rooms on the first floor and a steep stairway that leads to two more rooms above. In 1846, William Briscoe Stone remarked in a letter to his daughter Mary that the West Wing was, “…much enlarged improved & amended. I am certain you will be surprised and pleased with the change.\"<br /> <br /> During the 20th-century, the residents redesigned the West Hyphen to create a connective hallway between the second floor of the Central Block and the West Wing. This modernization was removed by the National Park Service to help return the mansion to a more historical design.</p> <h4>East Hyphen</h4> <p>The East Hyphen was a unique space. Its primary function was to serve as a protective cover for the full cellar that existed beneath the Central Block. It is not connected in the same way as the West Hyphen is connected. In order to gain access to the space, one would have to go outside the house and enter from the outside. </p> <h4>East Wing</h4> <p>Architectural historians believe that the East Wing is the oldest part of the house. It was likely a wholly separate and independent structure moved from some other location on the plantation to serve as the East Wing. Like the East Hyphen, there was no internal connection from the Central Block to the East Wing. One had to exit the mansion, walk across the lawn, and then enter the East Wing. </p>",

    "bodyText": "Beginning in the late 17th century, the Washington Family Burial Ground, near John and Anne Washington's Bridges Creek home, was the final resting place for generations of Washington family members. But by the late 19th century, the old \"family vault\" had become a decayed ruin, with the burial vault sunken into the ground, and worn and broken gravestones surrounding it.<br /> <br /> Restoration and preservation efforts at the burial ground began in 1906, ten years after the obelisk was placed to honor the birth site of George Washington. Funded by the Virginia chapter of the Society of Colonial Dames of America, Washington descendants cleaned up the gravestones and enclosed them with a block wall and an ornate iron gate. <br /> <br /> By the time the Wakefield National Memorial Association formed in 1923, the burial ground was again in disrepair. One of the group's primary goals was to \"...rescue from decay and preserve the old family vault and burial ground which is in a most neglected condition.\"<br /> <br /> The burial ground restoration effort became another place of contention between the Association, their architect, and the National Park Service. Concerned that the Association's plan for the burial ground was contemporary and expensive, the NPS wanted to pay homage to the ancestors in a \"...simple, typical Colonial graveyard.\" In the end, the design chosen came down to cost, with the National Park Service's cheaper option being selected. Restoration appears to have been completed in 1931, just before the official opening of the park. <br /> <br /> Today, the burial ground stands silent; as a reminder of the efforts to remember the lineage of George Washington at the place of his birth. ",

    "audioDescription": "(543 words)<br />The Theodore Roosevelt Memorial is located on the north end of Theodore Roosevelt Island, an eighty-eight-acre natural area on the Potomac River between Virginia and Washington, D.C.<br />Travel north on George Washington Memorial Parkway about one-third of a mile from the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge. Turn right to enter the parking lot and follow it to the south about eight hundred feet. <br />At the south end of the parking lot a pedestrian bridge leads left about three hundred feet over the Potomac River. At the end of the bridge turn right and proceed about two hundred feet along a gravel trail. Stay left at the fork and continue another two hundred feet, staying left again at a second fork in the gravel trail. Set at the north end of an open clearing in the forest is the seventeen-foot high bronze statue of Roosevelt.<br />The Roosevelt statue stands with his right hands raised high above his head, and his left hand is extended slightly forward with his palm open. He wears a vest and long coat, mustache and rimmed glasses.<br />A thirty-foot granite monolith stands behind the statue, and four twenty-one-foot-tall slabs inscribed with quotes line the plaza area behind him.<br />Inscribed at the front base of the bronze statue is:<br />THEODORE ROOSEVELT<br />1858 and 1919 are inscribed in the top corners, separated by flower medallions, which also bracket Roosevelt below.<br />A brick and granite plaza one hundred thirty feet long, one hundred ten feet wide leads up to the statue from the entrance at the south end. Benches are set along either side. The plaza is flanked by two circular pools set with fountains in bowls. The bowls are each supported by four spheres engraved with an eagle with spread wings holding olive branches and arrows and a shield across its chest. <br />A water-filled moat surrounds the entire memorial. Two cobblestone lined arched bridges carry over the moat at either side of the Roosevelt statue at its north end. Four areas set with manicured bushes sit in the corners of the plaza.<br />Lush forest surrounds the entire area and a two by three-foot wayside stands at the right side of the memorial entrance. Titled Making the Memorial, it features a picture of Roosevelt speaking to a crowd from a platform, and a background image of the construction of the memorial. Text above reads:<br />Construction on the memorial progressed from 1964 to 1967. The 18-foot-high-bronze state sculpted by Paul Manship shows President Roosevelt with one arm raised in his familiar pose.<br />Text on the left side describes the development of the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial:<br />In 1931 the Roosevelt Memorial Association purchased this island to create a living tribute to the former president. Congress designated funds for the project in 1960, and architectural designs were approved in 1961. President Lyndon B. Johnson dedicated the memorial on Roosevelt's birthday in October 1967. <br />Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Plaza features the only monument in Washington, DC, dedicated to the 26th president of the United States. Flanked by four 20-foot-high monoliths inscribed with quotations from Roosevelt, the oversized centerpiece captures the larger-than-life spirit of the conservationist leader.<br />\"It is true of the Nation, as of the individual, that the greatest doer must also be a great dreamer.\"<br />- Theodore Roosevelt, 1905<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Built by the Army Corps of Engineers from 1853 to 1863, it was a monumental engineering achievement. Its designer, Army Engineer Montgomery C. Meigs, supervised the project until 1861, when he was appointed Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army. The construction and successful operation of the Washington Aqueduct symbolizes the Army Corps of Engineers importance in the field of public works and reflects the military influence on life in antebellum America. The Washington Aqueduct, constructed over 150 years ago, still supplies the nation's capital with public water today.<br /> <br /> In the 1850s, the growing population of Washington and the memory of two devastating fires forced Congress to acknowledge that the nation's capital required more than wells and springs to provide its water. In 1853, Congress commissioned a public water system. One year later, construction of the Washington Aqueduct began in Great Falls, Maryland. Meig's plan was to divert the water from the Potomac River into a large, underground conduit. Gravity, and later pumping stations, directed water through the conduit to reservoirs where it could then be pumped into the city's pipelines.<br /> <br /> To accomplish this feat, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a masonry dam across the Potomac, a control gatehouse at Great Falls, a twelve-mile conduit, eleven tunnels, six bridges, several pipelines, and two reservoirs. By 1863, the Corps had completed three resevoirs. Wagons and boats on the C&O Canal brought supplies like cast iron, sand, concrete, brick, and Seneca sandstone to the construction sites. The initial dam reached halfway across the river. In 1890, in order to meet the District's increasing demand for water, it was extended to the Virginia side. Meigs designed the dam to be anchored to the river bottom, not to block its flow but to divert it.<br /> <br /> Although no longer in service, the first gatehouse still stands next to the historic Great Falls Tavern along the C&O Canal in Maryland. Inside was a system of 20 small cast iron slide gates that filtered the largest debris from the water.<br /> <br /> The conduit stretches almost twelve miles downriver from the intake at Great Falls to the Georgetown Reservoir. The underground, circular tube, built of brick, stone, and mortar, is 9 feet in diameter. A road ran parallel to the conduit to facilitate cleaning, repairs and inspections. The road was originally named Conduit Road; today it is MacArthur Boulevard.<br /> <br /> As part of the original Washington Aqueduct water system, workers constructed six bridges to carry the conduit over streams and creeks. Only three, Bridge #3, Cabin John Bridge (also called Union Arch Bridge) and Rock Creek Bridge, remain today. Cabin John Bridge, built of granite and sandstone, held the record as the world's longest masonry arch structure (220 feet) for 40 years. Today, Rock Creek Bridge’s 200-foot arch is still one of the longest unsupported metal pipe arches in the world. <br /> <br /> Aqueduct water spilled into two reservoirs, Dalecarlia Reservoir at the District line and the Georgetown Reservoir two miles downriver. By allowing the murky river water to stand in these reservoirs, debris settles to the bottom before distribution throughout the city. However, the process never successfully removed all of the sediment and thus, Washington City's public water had a muddy-yellowish color until the installation of a rapid-sand filtration system in 1928. Today both reservoirs have been completely modernized.<br /> <br /> Several inscriptions at various places honor the engineers who designed and built the Aqueduct. Meigs had his own name and his assistant’s name, Alfred L. Rives, engraved on the Cabin John Bridge. When Rives quit the US Army to join the Confederate Army in 1861, Meigs replaced his name with the Latin phrase <i>Esto Perpetua</i>, or “Let It Stand Forever.\" After former US Secretary of War Jefferson Davis became the president of the Confederacy, his name was removed from the bridge as well. In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt ordered it be re-engraved.<br /> <br /> While building the Washington Aqueduct, Meigs was also Chief Engineer for the extensions and new dome of the U.S. Capitol, and the enlargement of the General Post Office Building. Both of these buildings are now National Historic Landmarks. After his work with the new aqueduct, Meigs served as Quartermaster General of the United States Army, both during and after the Civil War. During this tenure, he designed the Pension Bureau building, now the National Building Museum (also a National Historic Landmark). During the Civil War, Meigs helped establish Arlington National Cemetery, where he is buried.<br /> <br /> In the twentieth century, the aqueduct’s capacity was expanded many times. As of 2017, it produces 300 million gallons of filtered water per day, has a storage capacity of 44 million gallons, and serves 1.1 million customers. The aqueduct provides public water for all of Washington, DC, Arlington County, and Falls Church City in Virginia. The continual effectiveness of the historic water system is a testament to Meig’s design and the professional work of the Army Corps of Engineers who continue to operate it today. A portion of the aqueduct runs through the Cheasapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, where you can see the originial engineer's house and gatehouse. </span></span></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"> </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Sources:<br /> <span style=\"color:null;\">\"The Washington Aqueduct System.\"</span> National Park Service.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Ways, Harry C. <em>Washinton Aqueduct: 1852-1992.</em> US Army Corps of Engineers.</span></span></span></p>   <p> </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"http://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=6d960253-5f0c-4d15-a2a2-84735ea482f2\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmark Nomination</span></a> of the Washington Aqueduct.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</span></a> are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

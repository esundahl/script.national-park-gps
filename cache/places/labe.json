Named after a brush-covered rough lava area just to the north— “it is big and it is nasty!” From the Mammoth Crater/Hidden Valley pullout, the trail starts along the crater rim. Turn left from the Mammoth Crater Trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Due to the impacts of the 2021 Antelope Fire we ask that visitors stay on the marked trail. </strong></p> <p>Lava Beds has twelve hiking trails. The most popular trails are short, but lead to interesting historic sites and geological features. Due to resource concerns, <strong>pets and bicycles are not permitted on any park trails, on in non-developed area or caves.</strong> All trails cross or enter the non-developed backcountry, while the long trails are primarily in designated wilderness areas. The trails in this bulletin are arranged by their distance from the visitor center. <strong>Carry plenty of water</strong> regardless of trail length—no surface water exists at Lava Beds. Watch for <strong>rattlesnakes </strong>and wear <strong>sunscreen </strong>and a hat in summer. Be prepared for sudden weather changes any time of year.</p> <p><strong>Pets, bicycles, hunting, and motorized vehicles are not permitted </strong>in wilderness areas. No person may camp in a non-developed or wilderness area with a group size of more than twelve, including horses and pack animals. Due to the dry nature of Lava Beds, especially in summer, <strong>open fires are not allowed at any time</strong> in the backcountry. Gas stoves are permitted. Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected. Please store your food securely and do not share your lunch with any wild animals.</p>",

Try as well to imagine the fear Army soldiers must have felt launching an assault on this virtual fortress of lava. <strong>Hospital Rock</strong>, one of the sites from which the Army attacked, is also visible from high points within the Stronghold. It can be visited along the road just to the east. It took the Army five months to drive the Modoc from the Stronghold, and soon after from their entire homeland.

Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected. Please store your food securely and do not share your lunch with any wild animals.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Catacombs Cave</strong> (6,903 ft / 2,104 m) One of the <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000;\">\"Most Challenging Caves.\"</span></strong> This very long cave is easily entered, but gradually increases in difficulty. It is possible to walk upright for approximately 800 ft (244 m) to the stairway, after which the ceiling rarely exceeds 3 ft (0.9 m). A few places exist where the ceiling height is less then 12 in (30 cm). A cave map is highly recommended for any group planning to explore the entire cave, as multiple levels and numerous side passages can be confusing. This cave is not recommended for inexperienced cavers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>6,903 feet. <br /> Cave has stairs/steps. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must crawl in some places if you go through the whole cave. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center: </strong>Cave Loop. <br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

Imagine the sights and sounds of up to six million birds here before the early 1900’s when lake drainage for agriculture began. You may encounter many other species of mammals, terrestrial birds, and reptiles throughout the Monument, especially if you journey away from roads and developed areas early or late in the day. Drive the nearby the <strong>Tulelake National Wildlife Refuge’s Wildlife Tour Route</strong> along the edge of modern-day Tule Lake for a more in-depth birding experience.</p> <p><strong>A Haven For Waterfowl</strong></p> <p>Up to a million migratory birds find shelter each year at Tule Lake and other wetlands within the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges. Situated in the middle of the Pacific Flyway, these protected areas are critical resting and feeding grounds for migrating ducks, geese, and shorebirds.</p> <p>In millennia past, the vast lowlands you see before you were covered with water and marshes­. Imagine the sights and sounds of over six million birds here, where Modoc Indians once hunted from tule reed boats. By the early 1900s, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had drained thousands of wetland acres for farming, and hunters had killed massive numbers of birds. Although crops grown on refuge lands are a source of food for waterfowl, less than 25 percent of historic wetlands exist today. Migratory waterfowl and year-round Klamath Basin residents depend on these remaining wetlands for their survival.</p> <p><strong>To Learn More About Waterfowl</strong><br /> • Visit the Klamath Basin Refuges Visitor Center on Hill Road  for information about Basin waterfowl.  <br /> • Visit the Lava Beds Visitor Center to obtain a bird list and  explore other protected upland habitats that host a variety  of raptors, ground-dwelling birds, and songbirds. <br />  </p>",

The most popular trails are short, but lead to interesting historic sites and geological features. Due to resource concerns, <strong>pets and bicycles are not permitted on any park trails, on in non-developed area or caves.</strong> All trails cross or enter the non-developed backcountry, while the long trails are primarily in designated wilderness areas. The trails in this bulletin are arranged by their distance from the visitor center. <strong>Carry plenty of water</strong> regardless of trail length—no surface water exists at Lava Beds. Watch for <strong>rattlesnakes </strong>and wear <strong>sunscreen </strong>and a hat in summer. Be prepared for sudden weather changes any time of year.</p> <p><strong>Pets, bicycles, hunting, and motorized vehicles are not permitted </strong>in wilderness areas. No person may camp in a nondeveloped or wilderness area with a group size of more than twelve, including horses and pack animals. Due to the dry nature of Lava Beds, especially in summer, <strong>open fires are not allowed at any time</strong> in the backcountry. Gas stoves are permitted. Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected. Please store your food securely and do not share your lunch with any wild animals.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>From April through June 1873, Army soldiers were stationed here during the <strong>Modoc War</strong>. From this command post, the <strong>U.S. Army</strong> directed part of a frustrating campaign against a small group of Modoc Indians. Determined to defend their homeland, the Modocs consistently outmaneuvered the Army, who at times outnumbered them ten to one. Just over <strong>six months</strong> of battles and surprise attacks, interspersed with long periods of waiting, resulted in the Modoc’s defeat. Significant Modoc War sites are located and interpreted throughout the park</p> <p>For seven weeks in the spring of 1873, <strong>Gillem’s Camp</strong> served as temporary quarters for up to 600 troops. Many enlisted men were new recruits with little training. Isolation, poor food and medical supplies, and the constant threat of attack in an unfamiliar landscape made life here difficult.</p> <p>Walk the easy guided trail around this area and discover why ancient Modoc, the Army, the <strong>Civilian Conservation Corps</strong>, and <strong>National Park Service</strong> rangers alike cherished its location on the shores of old Tule Lake. You can also hike to the top of <strong>Gillem Bluff </strong>(known as Sheepy Ridge to the Modoc and settlers) along the route the Army used to bring supplies to Gillems Camp. The view from the top provides a great perspective of Lava Beds’ volcanic landscape. Generations of Modoc once netted waterfowl here as they flew low over the ridge, and a fence still stands from the attempted reintroduction of bighorn sheep in the 1980’s. You can also look down on Canby Cross, the site where a Modoc War peace meeting ended in tragedy. Visit the cross at the next stop heading east.</p>",

The trails in this bulletin are arranged by their distance from the visitor center. <strong>Carry plenty of water</strong> regardless of trail length—no surface water exists at Lava Beds. Watch for <strong>rattlesnakes </strong>and wear <strong>sunscreen </strong>and a hat in summer. Be prepared for sudden weather changes any time of year.</p> <p><strong>Pets, bicycles, hunting, and motorized vehicles are not permitted </strong>in wilderness areas. No person may camp in a non-developed or wilderness area with a group size of more than twelve, including horses and pack animals. Due to the dry nature of Lava Beds, especially in summer, <strong>open fires are not allowed at any time</strong> in the backcountry. Gas stoves are permitted. Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected. Please store your food securely and do not share your lunch with any wild animals.</p>",

Though greatly outnumbered, Modoc warriors had easily defeated the Army in the first battle for the Stronghold in January. Soldiers had waited through the winter while peace talks dragged on. At last, the restless troops were moved to <strong>Hospital Rock</strong> and <strong>Gillem’s Camp</strong>, much closer to the Modocs.</p> <p>At midday, soldiers spotted three Modocs crossing the lava beds, waving a white flag. When two officers approached them, the Modocs opened fire. Moving the camps had driven the Modocs to act. This offensive would spark the second battle at <strong>Captain’s Jacks Stronghold</strong>.</p> <p>At the time of the attack, the Modocs had been living for months in the Stronghold caves instead of their usual warm winter dwellings. In spring when they saw the Army camps moving closer, some became concerned. They called for an end to negotiations. It seemed apparent that the Modocs would never be granted their wish to be left alone in their homeland.</p> <p>Lieutenant William Sherwood was mortally wounded; he died several days later at the crude field hospital that gave Hospital Rock its name. An urgent message warning of treachery was sent to the peace commissioners meeting nearby. Unfortunately, it arrived too late —they too had been attacked.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Juniper Cave</strong> (2,362 ft / 720 m) One of the <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000;\">\"Most Challenging Caves.\"</span></strong> Juniper Cave and Hercules Leg Cave were connected by the removal of debris in a collapse pit, and together make one long excursion with an entrance and exit. The Hercules Leg portion has generally high ceilings and smooth floors. The connection to Juniper cave involves crossing rocky floors with a passage height of 2.5 ft (0.8 m), and several low sections thereafter.<br /> <br /> <strong>Typically Closed: </strong>mid-October to mid-April. <br /> <br /> <strong>Length: </strong>2,362 feet. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must duck-walk in some places. <br /> Most people must crawl in some places if you go through the whole cave. <br /> <strong>Distance from visitor center:</strong> Cave Loop. <br /> <br /> The caves found here were created by flows of smooth lava 10,500 to 65,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, caves formed and created homes for unique cave life to thrive. These fantastic underground worlds can be visited on your own or by guided tour in the summer. Please “take only pictures, leave only footprints” so others have a chance to discover what you have during your trip.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p>Certain caves are closed to protect bats. Please check with a ranger for current closures.<br /> <br /> <strong>You Can Help Protect Bats!</strong><br /> Learn about white-nose syndrome and get screened before you enter caves.<br /> Lava Beds provides critical habitat throughout the year for large, stable populations of at least 14 species of bats. During the summer, some caves are closed to protect maternal bat colonies where mothers raise thousands of tiny, vulnerable bat pups on the ceiling. Other caves may contain groups of hibernating bats in winter, which can die if awakened often.<br /> <br /> <strong>What to Do if You See Bats?</strong><br /> Stop talking, shine your light away from the bats, and leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible. Note about how many bats there are and where they are, so you can tell a Ranger. Your information will help us better protect these important, fascinating animals.</p> <hr /> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cave Softly</strong><br /> Please care for these fragile, amazing environments and cave life by following these rules during your visit:<br /> • Stay on available trails<br /> • Leave no trace of your visit behind—do not eat, drink, smoke, or leave trash<br /> • Do not use caves as bathrooms, use a “wag bag” and pee bottle<br /> • Formations made of lava, calcite, and ice can be permanently damaged—<br /> cave slowly and carefully and do not touch<br /> • Do not touch hydrophobic bacterial mats—they are easily damaged and take decades to regrow<br /> • Use electric flashlights, not carbide or gas lamps<br /> • Do not touch paintings or cultural artifacts, as they are easily damaged<br /> • Observe closures to protect bats, and do not disturb any cave life you see<br /> • Pets are not permitted in caves<br /> <br /> <strong>Cave Safely</strong><br /> • Wear Appropriate Safety Gear - Prevent injury by wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toed shoes or boots. Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Between thirty and forty thousand years ago, through a series of eruptions, a torrent of red-hot lava flowed out of this crater. More than any other vent Mammoth Crater had the greatest impact on the monument’s landscape—over seventy percent of the surface area of Lava Beds is covered by basalt that originated here. From this crater, lava ran downhill, forming braided streams of lava up to ten miles long. These lava streams later formed most of the caves along Cave Loop Road.</p> <p>The remarkable amount of lava that poured from the earth here created the highest known concentration of lava tube caves in the continental United States. To learn more, visit Mushpot Cave near the Visitor Center.</p> <p>A short trail meanders along the rim of <strong>Hidden Valley</strong> under <strong>Ponderosa pines</strong>. Enjoy the rare shade this area provides in summertime, and observe the impressive results of lava that flowed through from <strong>Mammoth Crater</strong>. The short trail to Mammoth Crater begins across the road at the parking area and leads up to the rim. Imagine lava flowing in multiple episodes from this massive crater about 30,000 years ago. It created all the lava tube caves in the <strong>Cave Loop</strong> area, and many more farther north. To explore the rocky, forested landscape of Lava Beds’ southern end further, continue around the <strong>Big Nasty Trail</strong> or hike the nearby trail to <strong>Heppe Cave</strong>.</p>",

The trailhead parking lot is on top of a short rise across from the trail entrance.

Please <strong>do not attempt to hike to the top from the west</strong> side of Petroglyph Point. A social trail there has caused severe erosion and passes too close to nesting sites.</p> <p>Lava Beds has twelve hiking trails. The most popular trails are short, but lead to interesting historic sites and geological features. Due to resource concerns, <strong>pets and bicycles are not permitted on any park trails, on in non-developed area or caves.</strong> All trails cross or enter the non-developed backcountry, while the long trails are primarily in designated wilderness areas. The trails in this bulletin are arranged by their distance from the visitor center. <strong>Carry plenty of water</strong> regardless of trail length—no surface water exists at Lava Beds. Watch for <strong>rattlesnakes </strong>and wear <strong>sunscreen </strong>and a hat in summer. Be prepared for sudden weather changes any time of year.</p> <p><strong>Pets, bicycles, hunting, and motorized vehicles are not permitted </strong>in wilderness areas. No person may camp in a nondeveloped or wilderness area with a group size of more than twelve, including horses and pack animals. Due to the dry nature of Lava Beds, especially in summer, <strong>open fires are not allowed at any time</strong> in the backcountry. Gas stoves are permitted. Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected. Please store your food securely and do not share your lunch with any wild animals.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>One reason Lava Beds is such a special place to contemplate cultural history is that it contains two types of rock art, or rock imagery— carved petroglyphs and painted pictographs. All of the monument’s rock imagery is located in the traditional territory of the Modoc people and their ancestors or predecessors.</p> <p>It is hard to determine the age of rock art. This is especially true of petroglyphs, since material was removed in their creation, not added. It is possible that some of these images at Lava Beds were made more that 6,000 years ago. Estimating the age of an individual petroglyph based on weathering is complicated by the number of times it may have been inundated in water as Tule Lake rose and fell around the island that later became known as Petroglyph Point. Interestingly, some of the geometric patterns found in the rock imagery here appear on household items up to 5,000 years old from nearby Nightfire Island. Could some of the same people have carved those same patterns into the rocks at Petroglyph Point? With over 5,000 individual carvings, this site is one of the most extensive representations of American Indian rock art in California—it is possible that dozens or even hundreds of generations of artists paddled out in canoes, sharp sticks or stones in hand, to leave their mark here in the soft volcanic tuff.</p> <p><strong>What Do They Mean?</strong></p> <p>Unlike rock art in other areas of the West, images here seem to be dominated by geometric patterns instead of depictions of people and animals. Looking at the images at Lava Beds, most visitors can’t help but imagine what such patterns might mean. Unfortunately, historic events in this area have made gathering information difficult. Before the Modoc War caused tribal fracturing and the removal of the Lava Beds’ band of Modocs to Oklahoma, no ethnographic study was ever done with Modoc peoples to record their stories about images they may have been familiar with or their beliefs about images left behind by even earlier peoples. Today, it is probable that some knowledge surrounding the rock imagery of the lava beds is not shared with those on the outside.</p> <p>Still, many visitors to rock art sites come away feeling they are very special places, places that perhaps even reach across time and culture to speak to universal human experiences. Petroglyph Point is the center of a Modoc creation story, while other sites with pictographs hold traditional significance for some modern Modoc and Klamath people. Were only individuals holding important positions in the tribe permitted to create rock art at some places on certain occasions? Were other images created in association with special activities to mark important points in a a person’s life? Though each observer can imagine in his or her own mind what circumstances and meaning might have led to the creation of each image, only each original artist, long gone, knows for sure.</p> <p><strong>Help Protect Rock Art!</strong></p> <p>Visitors to the rock art sites of Lava Beds may notice that these places have not always been respected in modern times. Vandalism significantly mars some sites, especially Petroglyph Point. This type of activity unfortunately reflects the disrespect of a few for a cultural history that belongs to us all— a history that the National Park Service is mandated to protect.</p> <p>Though a chain-link fence was installed in the 1930s at Petroglyph Point to provide some protection to the images, pictographs at other sites depend upon the personal responsibility of each visitor to look but not touch. The oil on our hands can cause damage to the delicate images. You can help protect these treasures by reporting any inappropriate activity you see at rock art sites to a ranger or other law enforcement officer as soon as possible.</p> <p>You may also notice painted markings left in lava tube caves by early explorers and even a few Japanese characters carved into the boulders at Petroglyph Point by interned Japanese-Americans during World War II. Though visitors may wonder why some markings are protected and others are considered graffiti, consider that hundreds of thousands of people now visit here annually! What would Lava Beds look like if each person left their mark— and what would remain of ancient rock art? Though someday nature will reclaim each image left behind by the Modoc and earlier peoples, each of us has the opportunity not only to open our minds to their wonder and mystery, but also to do our part to protect this heritage for future generations. We thank you for appreciating and respecting these very special places and for helping others do the same.</p> <p><strong>A Haven For Raptors</strong></p> <p>High out of reach of predators and humans, the pocketed cliff face of Petroglyph Point provides an ideal perch for raptors and other birds. From early spring through early fall, look for large nests and droppings that indicate the presence of young falcons, hawks, and owls. You can also spot cliff swallow chicks peering from clusters of small, round mud nests.</p> <p>From the wetlands of Tule Lake to Ponderosa pine forests along Lava Beds’ southern boundary, the area’s diverse range of habitats offer excellent hunting opportunities for highly adapted birds of prey. A prairie falcon might fly ten miles per day on streamlined wings to hunt smaller upland birds, while a barn owl uses offset ears and silent feathers to locate and catch grassland rodents at night.</p> <p>Protected lands in this area provide both temporary and year- round homes for rare and threatened raptors. Hundreds of bald eagles winter here, and an occasional peregrine falcon stops to rest along its epic migration between North and South America.</p>",

The most popular trails are short, but lead to interesting historic sites and geological features. Due to resource concerns, <strong>pets and bicycles are not permitted on any park trails, on in non-developed area or caves.</strong> All trails cross or enter the non-developed backcountry, while the long trails are primarily in designated wilderness areas. The trails in this bulletin are arranged by their distance from the visitor center. <strong>Carry plenty of water</strong> regardless of trail length—no surface water exists at Lava Beds. Watch for <strong>rattlesnakes </strong>and wear <strong>sunscreen </strong>and a hat in summer. Be prepared for sudden weather changes any time of year.</p> <p><strong>Pets, bicycles, hunting, and motorized vehicles are not permitted </strong>in wilderness areas. No person may camp in a nondeveloped or wilderness area with a group size of more than twelve, including horses and pack animals. Due to the dry nature of Lava Beds, especially in summer, <strong>open fires are not allowed at any time</strong> in the backcountry. Gas stoves are permitted. Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected.

Gloves and kneepads are recommended in difficult caves.<br /> • Protect Your Head - Use bicycle, construction, or other types of helmets. Bump hats are sold at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Bring Enough Light - Each person should carry at least one flashlight with extra batteries (and bulbs if available). Three flashlights per person are ideal. Flashlights are loaned free of charge during hours of operation at the Visitor Center.<br /> • Wear Warm Clothing - Most caves are about 55 °F (13 °C) year-round. Caves with ice are colder.<br /> • Know Yourself and Your Group - Choose caves suitable for everyone in your group. Don’t push beyond anyone’s limits. Children and seniors should be able to walk safely on their own. Caves are not appropriate places for infants.<br /> • Explore as a Group - Tell a friend or family member where you are going and when you expect to return. If you must go alone, choose easier caves and carry three flashlights.<br /> • Know Your Route - Be observant, and look back at junctions and landmarks to make mental notes. A book of cave maps can be purchased in the Visitor Center—learn to read map symbols before you go. Using a compass will help you use the maps.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Ambush at Midday—The Thomas-Wright Battle of April 26, 1873<br /> Forced to flee the Stronghold, the Modoc took cover amid the craggy lava features in this area. A group under Scarfaced Charley watched from the Schonchin Flow as Army troops marched from Gillems Camp toward their concealed position.</p> <p>Officers Thomas and Wright were leading an artillery reconnaissance patrol to Hardin Butte. The soldiers were unenthusiastic and ill-prepared for an encounter. When the patrol stopped for lunch in the depression before you, a few scouts were sent out, but most soldiers rested. Fearing discovery by this group double their size, the Modoc opened fire from high, protected places such as this outcropping. About two-thirds of the patrol was killed or wounded in the battle; the Modoc suffered no casualties.</p> <p>A soldier not involved in the battle described the outcome:<br /> “At the first fire, the troops were so demoralized that the officers could do nothing with them. Wright was severely wounded . . . and his company, with one or two exceptions deserted him and fled like a pack of sheep; then the slaughter began.”</p> <p>Scarfaced Charley halted the battle, showing mercy for the few surviving soldiers:<br /> “All you fellows that ain’t dead had better go home. We don’t want to kill you all in one day.”</p> <p>This <strong>1.1 mi (1.8 km)</strong> trail leads to the site of a <strong>Modoc </strong>ambush on an <strong>Army </strong>reconnaissance mission during the <strong>Modoc War</strong>. Interpretive signs at the beginning and end of the trail explain the battle and its aftermath. The main trail follows the edge of the lava flow from <strong>Black Crater</strong>. A short side trail just past the trailhead also leads onto Black Crater itself, a large spatter cone. Look for tree molds, made when a living tree was burned away by fresh lava and left the imprint of its bark inside. If you are interested in exploring more geologic features, be sure to stop at pullouts in the <strong>Devils Homestead</strong> lava flow, just north on the main road.</p>",

It is 8.7 miles (14.0 km) long.</p> <p>Lava Beds has twelve hiking trails. The most popular trails are short, but lead to interesting historic sites and geological features. Due to resource concerns, <strong>pets and bicycles are not permitted on any park trails, on in non-developed area or caves.</strong> All trails cross or enter the non-developed backcountry, while the long trails are primarily in designated wilderness areas. The trails in this bulletin are arranged by their distance from the visitor center. <strong>Carry plenty of water</strong> regardless of trail length—no surface water exists at Lava Beds. Watch for <strong>rattlesnakes </strong>and wear <strong>sunscreen </strong>and a hat in summer. Be prepared for sudden weather changes any time of year.</p> <p><strong>Pets, bicycles, hunting, and motorized vehicles are not permitted </strong>in wilderness areas. No person may camp in a nondeveloped or wilderness area with a group size of more than twelve, including horses and pack animals. Due to the dry nature of Lava Beds, especially in summer, <strong>open fires are not allowed at any time</strong> in the backcountry. Gas stoves are permitted. Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected. Please store your food securely and do not share your lunch with any wild animals.</p> <p>Horses and pack animals are only permitted on the Three Sisters, Lyons and Whitney Butte trails. <strong>All wilderness rules apply to horse and rider.</strong> Ride at a slow pace; the terrain is rough. Horse riders should carry plenty of water. Summer days are hot and there is no surface water for animals to drink from. Leg protectors are recommended for horses and riders. Be alert for rattlesnakes on the trail. Horses should be sprayed completely, especially on the legs, with a fly and tick spray.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Stop at the <strong>East </strong>and <strong>West Wildlife Overlooks</strong> to view migratory and resident birds on the waters of <strong>Tule Lake</strong> in any season. <strong>Waterfowl </strong>are especially abundant here in the spring and fall as they pass through on their journey along the <strong>Pacific Flyway</strong>. Imagine the sights and sounds of up to six million birds here before the early 1900’s when lake drainage for agriculture began. You may encounter many other species of mammals, terrestrial birds, and reptiles throughout the Monument, especially if you journey away from roads and developed areas early or late in the day. Drive the nearby the <strong>Tulelake National Wildlife Refuge’s Wildlife Tour Route</strong> along the edge of modern-day Tule Lake for a more in-depth birding experience.</p> <p>During fall, as many as a million migrating ducks, geese, and shorebirds stop here at Tule Lake, and at other protected areas within the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges, to feed and rest.  Imagine the sights and sounds of over six million birds here in millennia past. Imagine Modoc Indians hunting birds from tule reed boats, and water that once covered all the lowlands you see before you. </p> <p>In the early 1900’s, white hunters killed massive numbers of birds, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation altered thousands of wetland acres for agricultural use.  Though crops grown on refuge lands provide a source of food for waterfowl, today less than 25 percent of historic wetlands exist. The remaining wetlands are critical to the survival of waterfowl migrating along the Pacific Flyway—three quarters of those who travel this corridor stop somewhere in the Klamath Basin.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>From Merrill Cave parking area to the west boundary of the monument, this trail crosses the wilderness in an east-west direction, curving around Whitney Butte. Enjoy an impressive view of Mount Shasta and the Callahan Lava Flow. This trail is 3.3 miles (5.3 km) one way.<br /> <br /> <strong>Due to the impacts of the 2021 Antelope Fire we ask that visitors stay on the marked trail. </strong><br /> <br /> Lava Beds has twelve hiking trails. The most popular trails are short, but lead to interesting historic sites and geological features. Due to resource concerns, <strong>pets and bicycles are not permitted on any park trails, on in non-developed area or caves.</strong> All trails cross or enter the non-developed backcountry, while the long trails are primarily in designated wilderness areas. The trails in this bulletin are arranged by their distance from the visitor center. <strong>Carry plenty of water</strong> regardless of trail length—no surface water exists at Lava Beds. Watch for <strong>rattlesnakes </strong>and wear <strong>sunscreen </strong>and a hat in summer. Be prepared for sudden weather changes any time of year.</p> <p><strong>Pets, bicycles, hunting, and motorized vehicles are not permitted </strong>in wilderness areas. No person may camp in a nondeveloped or wilderness area with a group size of more than twelve, including horses and pack animals. Due to the dry nature of Lava Beds, especially in summer, <strong>open fires are not allowed at any time</strong> in the backcountry. Gas stoves are permitted. Other restrictions may apply during extreme fire conditions—please check with a ranger. <strong>Camping in or within 50 yards (46 km) of caves or in the vicinity of chimneys is not permitted</strong>. Camping within 0.25 miles (0.4 km) of roads, trailheads, and parking areas is also prohibited. Check at the visitor center for current weather information. <strong>Carry first aid supplies and let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return</strong>. <strong>Off-trail hiking is not recommended</strong>, as lava terrain is very rough. Please remember to leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out. Leave what you find. All historic and prehistoric objects, plants, animals, and rocks are protected. Please store your food securely and do not share your lunch with any wild animals.</p> <p>Horses and pack animals are only permitted on the Three Sisters, Lyons and Whitney Butte trails. <strong>All wilderness rules apply to horse and rider.</strong> Ride at a slow pace; the terrain is rough. Horse riders should carry plenty of water. Summer days are hot and there is no surface water for animals to drink from. Leg protectors are recommended for horses and riders. Be alert for rattlesnakes on the trail. Horses should be sprayed completely, especially on the legs, with a fly and tick spray.</p>",

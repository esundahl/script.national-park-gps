    "bodyText": "<p>Many of the park’s ungulates spend the winter in Yellowstone’s northern range. The area provides critical winter habitat for elk, bison, deer, and pronghorn.</p> <p>Elevations are lower and the area receives less snow than elsewhere in the park. Often the ridge tops and south-facing hillsides are clear of snow, a result of wind and sun.</p> <h2>Managing Elk Populations</h2> <p>Until the mid-1960s, park managers actively managed the elk and bison of Yellowstone. Elk population limits were determined according to formulas designed to manage livestock. When elk reached those limits, park managers “culled” or killed the animals to reduce the population. Bison were likewise heavily managed.</p> <h2>Modern Management</h2> <p>In 1963, an advisory group made of prominent scientists released a report recommending national parks “maintain biotic associations” within the context of their ecosystem based on scientific research. The recommendations, known as the Leopold Report, established the framework for park management still used today throughout the National Park System. By adopting this management philosophy, Yellowstone went from an unnatural managing of resources to “natural regulation”—today known as Ecological Process Management.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A Wildlife Paradise<br />263 words<br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (143 words)<br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled \"A Wildlife Paradise.\" Featured on the panel is a large color photo of several large dark bison grazing in a grassy landscape. To the right of the photo on the panel's right side is a 4-ringed flipbook with a similar photo of grazing bison on its cover. This wayside stands alongside the expansive landscape overlooking the Yellowstone River. Text below the wayside title reads:<br /><br />\"Yellowstone's vast northern range is home to an amazing array of mammals. This wildlife community is one of the largest and most diverse of any on Earth!<br /><br />\"While visiting Yellowstone, you may see some of these animals. Remember, they are wild and free to roam--no one knows exactly where they will be.<br /><br />\"View wildlife from your car or by using a powerful lens. Never approach a wild animal.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (102 words)<br /><br />Text below the book, which opens from right to left, reads: \"Turn the pages to learn about some of Yellowstone's wildlife.\" Inside the book are color photos and short descriptions of the following animals: Elk (Cervus elaphus); Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus); Coyote (Canis latrans); Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes); Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis); Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana); Grizzly Bear (Ursus arctos); Black Bear (Ursus americanus); Uinta Ground Squirrel (Spermophilus armatus); Yellow-bellied Marmot (Marmota flaviventris); and, on the book's back cover, Bison (Bison bison).<br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "audioDescription": "Artists’ Paintpot Trail 1,318 words There are 6 sections in this description. Section 1 (241 words) Standing at the entrance to the Artists’ Paintpots trail is a wayside exhibit entitled “Artists’ Paintpots,” which features a simple map drawing superimposed over a large color photo of the area. Artists’ Paintpots is located nearly 4 miles south of Norris Geyser Basin. Text below the title tells us: “This is a one-mile (1.6 kilometer) trail that enters a partially burned lodgepole pine forest, then winds across a wet meadow on a boardwalk. The hydrothermal area within the short loop at the end of the trail contains colorful hot springs, mudpots and small geysers. Caution for flying mud! “The lower portion of this hydrothermal area is wheelchair accessible. The upper trail to the mudpots is steep and rough. It is not recommended for visitors using wheelchairs. “Remember to stay on the trail and boardwalks.” A white arrow labeled with the words “You are here” indicates your position at the start of the trail, which is located at the end of a short road running southeast from Grand Loop Road. Further south and east from the trail entrance is a dotted line representing the wheelchair accessible boardwalk loop surrounding the “hydrothermal area.” It is also noted that Grand Loop Road leads to Norris to the north and Madison Junction to the south. A small color photo in the exhibit’s bottom left corner shows the various hydrothermal features along the trail--pools, mudpots, and geysers. A caption reads: “A colorful and other-worldly landscape.” Section 2 (252 words) You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled “Change is the Only Constant.” Featured on the exhibit’s left side is a color photo of several thermal features including a steaming blue pool surrounded by white mineral deposits and evergreen trees. Text below the title reads: “Thermal features were here long before the constraints of barriers and boardwalks. They may be under your feet anywhere in any thermal basin and new ones are constantly breaking through the crust and changing while old ones are drying up or maybe only going dormant for a year, a decade, a century. They exist in their own time and place. “For visitors this means that we have to always be careful where we step. Keep a lookout for your own safety. A new hot spring may have erupted so recently that there has been no time to post warnings. “Always stay alert around thermal features.” A color drawing on the exhibit’s right side shows a bright fuchsia, or deep pinkish-purple, landscape striped with areas resembling black ribbons and yet other rounded areas colored neon blue and yellow with smaller sections of green, red, and white. A colored thermometer to the right of the drawing shows black and purple at the bottom of the thermometer at temperatures at 22.8 and 29 through 30.6 respectively. The center of the blue section above is labeled 52; green is 60.7; yellow is 69.5, and the red section ranges from 74 to 84.5. The thermometer’s white tip is labeled 97.8. Section 3 (159 words) You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled “Blood Geyser,” which features a large color photo of a geyser nestled at the base of a hillside streaked with rust-colored rock. A low mound of water and a thin cloud of steam erupts from the geyser’s pool. Text below the title tells us: “While the name of this geyser evokes images of a gruesome event, the reality is much tamer. The high concentration of iron oxide in the water precipitates out, staining the surrounding rocks a rich red. It has been busily erupting since it was first recorded in 1882. This geyser can erupt up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) and discharges 150 gallons (567 liters) a minute.” More text in the exhibit’s bottom right corner reads: “Unusual Feature. Red flakes of iron oxide will precipitate from a sample of this water after only a few minutes. There are very few features in Yellowstone where this will happen.” Section 4 (137 words) You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled “Inspiration in a Paintpot,” located at the top of the trail overlooking the hydrothermal basin containing Artists’ Paintpots. The exhibit features a painting of the panorama before you, where thermal features include many mudpots and colorful hot springs. Several patches of pine forest dot the landscape as well. Text below the title tells us: “Artists' Paintpots is a good place to let your mind absorb the smells, colors, and sounds that surround you. Feel the heat of the sun, the cool of the breeze, and the steam from a hot pool. Let your imagination run free with the shapes and colors, as you have before you.” A caption in the bottom right corner reads: “At Foot of Paint Pot Hill, John Henry Renshawe, topographer for 1883 expedition.” Section 5 (314 words) You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled “From Soup to Stew.” Text below the title tells us: “The hydrothermal system at Artists’ Paintpots operates",

The surrounding area is covered in hard sinter and a few other smaller steaming vents. Before an earthquake in 1983, Aurum was actively boiling but eruptions were rare. Now, eruptions are irregular, ranging from 22 hours to over 2 weeks. Erupts 20 feet (6 m) for 70 seconds.</p> <p>Aurum Geyser has an average temperate of 199.4°F (93°C), an average pH of 8.6, and an average conductivity of 1761 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "audioDescription": "Aurum Geyser 333 words There are 2 sections in this description. Section 1 (134 words) You are now facing Aurum Geyser, a small geyser pool with a low, flat-topped rim. A wayside located along the boardwalk overlooking the site is entitled “Aurum Geyser” and features a large color photo of the erupting geyser. Text below the title reads: “Aurum is Latin for \"gold.\" The geyser was named for the color of iron oxide deposits lining the vent's rim. During eruptions, which occur every 2.5 to 5 hours, water and steam are ejected to heights often exceeding 20 feet.” Three “Fast Facts” highlighted with bullet points read: “Aurum Geyser is a cone-type geyser. “Eruptions last about a minute. “Prior to an earthquake in 1983 Aurum Geyser rarely erupted.” A smaller color photo with the caption “Crater of Aurum Geyser” shows the gold-colored rock lining the rim of Aurum’s circular vent. Section 2 (181 words) Below the smaller photo is more text entitled “Geyser Types”: “Geysers are hot springs that periodically erupt. Beyond this broad similarity, they can be grouped into two categories: cone geysers (Old Faithful is the most famous of this type) and fountain geysers like Sawmill or Grand geysers.” A color drawing on the exhibit’s right side shows the difference between the two geyser types. The blue water erupting from the cone geyser forms a higher tower than that rising from the fountain geyser. Text below the drawing tells us: “Fountain Geysers. The wide openings or vents of fountain geysers are often mistaken for hot springs. Water collects in the vent before and during eruptions, and erupting water and steam pass through the pool. “Cone Geysers. Cone geysers have narrow openings, or vents. Under pressure, this opening can act like a \"nozzle,\" spouting a steady column of water. Over long periods of time, sinter (silica) builds around the vent opening creating the cone.” A notation in the exhibit’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a grant from The Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Back Basin<br />654 words<br />There are 4 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (168 words)<br /><br />You are standing in front of a wayside panel entitled \"Norris Geyser Basin.\" This geyser basin, which is located outside the northwest edge of Yellowstone Caldera, consists of three areas-Porcelain Basin, Back Basin, and One Hundred Springs Plain. Norris Geyser Basin is known as the hottest and most changeable thermal area in Yellowstone.<br /> <br />Below the title is a color photo providing a panoramic view of a wide landscape, or basin, dotted with thick stands of evergreen trees; towers of water or steam rise from various hydrothermal features scattered throughout this basin. Below the photo is the subtitle \"Back Basin\" and text that reads:<br /><br />\"Tucked into the woods, Back Basin is full of surprising sites [sic], sounds, and smells-it is alive with heat and gases from the Yellowstone Volcano. <br /><br />\"Geysers and hot springs frequently change here. They may be different from descriptions you have heard or read about or they may have changed since a previous visit-evidence that the volcano is very much alive below ground.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (234 words)<br /><br />On the panel's right side is a drawing of a map with Back Basin labeled in its center; the smaller Porcelain Basin lies to Back Basin's north, at the top of the map.<br /><br />A red dot with the words \"You Are Here\" indicates your position just north of Emerald Spring on the eastern periphery of Back Basin. You are standing at the entrance to a boardwalk that leads south to Steamboat Geyser and then Echinus Geyser at the bottom of the map; additional boardwalks and dirt or paved trails loop west and then north past other hydrothermal features including Cistern Spring, Arch Steam Vent, Puff â€˜n Stuff Geyser, Black Hermit Caldron, Green Dragon Spring, Blue Mud Steam Vent, Yellow Funnel Spring, Porkchop Geyser, Pearl Geyser, Vixen Geyser, Veteran Geyser, Palpitator Spring, Fearless Geyser, Monarch Geyser and Minute Geyser.<br /><br />Located just northeast of you are the Norris Geyser Basin Museum and Bookstore. The elevation at the museum is labeled as 7,560 feet, or 2,304 meters. Directly to your east is a paved road with 3 parking areas; there are also 3 sets of restrooms. A red line leading north from the Norris Geyser Basin Museum into Porcelain Basin indicates \"Stairs, steep grades, or uneven ground.\" A black line in the map's top right corner is labeled \"Trail to Norris Campground and Museum of the National Park Ranger\" with an arrow pointing northeast from the basins.<br /><br />Section 3 (115 words)<br /><br />At the bottom of the panel are two color photos. The photo on the left is labeled \"Monarch Metamorphosis\" and pictures a pale green geyser pool. A caption below the photo tells us: <br /><br />\"Monarch Geyser can be quiet for years at a time. Eruptions reach as high as 200 feet, and hurl muddy water in all directions.\"<br /><br />The second photo is labeled \"Echinus Transformations\" and shows this geyser's yellowish-brown crater. The caption reads:<br /><br />\"Echinus Geyser has sometimes been known for regular eruptions, but this beautiful geyser has also had many periods of irregular activity.\"<br /><br /><br />A notation in the sign's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />Section 4 (111 words)<br />Standing near this wayside is a brown sign with white lettering; there is also one white arrow pointing left and another arrow pointing right. Text accompanying the left-facing arrow reads: \"Back Basin, 1.6 miles (2.6 kilometers) loop, 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) loop. Steamboat Geyser, .25 mile.\" The arrow pointing right is labeled \"Porcelain Basin, .6 mile (1 kilometer) loop.\"<br />A few feet to the right of the sign is a trail box, about 3 feet high, where you can obtain a pamphlet about the site by lifting the lid. A $1.00 donation is requested or return after use; money can be inserted in the slot on the front of the bin.<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) inspection required for all watercraft including boats, float tubes, and stand up paddle boards. Felt soles prohibited. Riding and Packing. Proof of negative Coggins test within last 12 months required. Food Storage and Camping. These regulations apply to ALL backcountry users. Sleep 100 yards (91 m) from your food storage and cooking areas. Do not leave food, trash, toiletries, backpacks, coolers, water bottles, or any potential attractant unattended. Store food in an approved bear resistant container or hang on a food pole 10 feet (3 m) above the ground and 4 feet (1 m) from sides. Carry a minimum of 35 feet (11 m) of rope. Campfires allowed only in designated campsites within established fire rings. Extinguish campfires completely before leaving site. Follow LEAVE NO TRACE travel and camping techniques. Enjoy the backcountry and help keep it clean for others to enjoy. Bury human waste and toilet tissue in a 6–8 inch (15–18 cm) deep “cat hole” at least 100 feet (30 m) from water and trails. River Crossings. Park waters are swift and cold. Swimming in park rivers is not recommended. River crossings are hazardous. Lightning Safety. During thunderstorms, descend to lower elevation, avoid open areas and isolated tall trees. Assume lightning position: feet together, crouch on foam pad or sit on pack, hands over ears. Regulations. Leave What You Find: Do not collect anything from the park. No Pets: No pets on trail. Obtain service animal regulations at backcountry offices. No Hunting: No hunting or discharge of firearms. No Motorized Vehicles: No motorized vehicles on trails. Wheeled Vehicles Restricted: No bicycles, strollers, or wheeled vehicles (except wheelchairs), except where specified. In an emergency, dial 9-1-1 or contact the nearest ranger station. Animals are Dangerous. Do not approach or feed any animal. Bison and elk have injured people. Stay 100 yards (91 m) from bears and wolves. Stay 25 yards (23 m) from all other animals. Be Prepared for a Bear Encounter. Grizzly and black bears inhabit all of Yellowstone National Park. Be Alert. Watch for signs of bear activity: scratches in trees, tracks, scat, or dig sites. Avoid dead animals. Make Noise. Avoid surprising a bear by calling out and clapping your hands at regular intervals to make your presence known. Carry Bear Spray. Carry bear spray and know how to use it. Keep it immediately available, not inside your pack. Hike in Groups. Travel in groups of 3 or more is recommended. Stay with your group at all times. What to do if you encounter a bear. Stay calm, do not run. Quietly detour or back away; stop if this seems to agitate the bear. Stay at least 100 yards (91 m) from bears. Do NOT feed bears or other animals. What to do if a bear charges you. Stand still, do not run. Stand your ground and use your bear spray. Spray when the bear is 60 feet (18 m) away or closer. If a bear charges, it may be a bluff charge. What to do if a bear makes contact. Drop to the ground; play dead. Lie face down and clasp your hands over the back of your neck; stay still and silent. Wait several minutes after the bear leaves before getting up and leaving the area.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Stop and listen. Bearclaw Geyser makes a gurgling noise while it erupts. Its eruptions are small, with water only bubbling a few inches up into the air. As with many geysers in the area, this geyser appears to be linked to the eruptions of Fountain Geyser.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Beauty Pool shows its brightest colors when its water is hottest and is closely related to neighboring Chromatic Pool. During periodic energy shifts, the level of one spring rises as the other lowers. These pools were initially named due to their clear, hot, bright waters. In years since, most noticeably since 2002, the pools have cooled dramatically and colors have changed. Beauty Pool still quietly steams, but the shallow outer parts of the pool are filled with orange thermophiles that can thrive in the cooler waters.</p> <p>Beauty Pool has an average temperate of 135.6°F (57.5°C), an average pH of 8.8, and an average conductivity of 2042 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

Beehive Geyser has an average temperate of 198.5°F (92.5°C) and an average pH of 8.3.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system.

    "audioDescription": "Beehive Geyser 457 words There are 2 sections in this description. Section 1 (154 words) You are now facing a wayside exhibit entitled “Beehive Geyser.” A large color photo on the exhibit’s left side shows a sky-high tower of water and mist erupting from this relatively small cone geyser. Also pictured is a colorful rainbow arcing upward and across the mist from the ground beside the geyser. Text below the title tells us: “This geyser, named for its 4-foot high cone, resembles an old fashioned beehive. Though its cone is modest by comparison to others in the Upper Geyser Basin, Beehive is one of the most powerful and impressive geysers in Yellowstone. The cone acts as a nozzle, directing a column of steam and water to heights of 200 feet.” Two “Fast Facts” highlighted with bullet points tell us more: “Typically, Beehive's activity is not predictable, but when eruptions cycles start, intervals between eruptions can range from 10 hours to 5 days. “An average eruption lasts approximately 5 minutes.” Section 2 (285 words) On the exhibit’s right side is a color drawing showing a cross-section of the feature’s underground structure. Text accompanied by an arrow pointing to the geyser’s narrow vent reads: “Water cools near the vent's surface. This cooler water \"caps\" the hotter water below. Eventually, superheated water (water heated above the boiling point by pressure) flashes to steam, expanding and lifting the water above the vent in an eruption.” Another arrow points to the wide cone layer, or sinter, on one side of the vent. Text tells us: “Silica is dissolved from volcanic rock (rhyolite) and precipitates as sinter, which forms the geyser cone.” To the left of the cone, the label “Beehive's indicator” indicates a thin blue line, or water channel, leading from the Earth’s surface deep into the ground alongside the base of the geyser. More text reads: “Side channels often release pressure within thermal systems. At times, they function as indicators of when a primary feature may erupt. Usually, Beehive's side channel is a reliable indicator that the geyser will erupt.” Text accompanying another arrow pointing to the vent’s thinnest point, several feet below the ground, reads: “Sinter is deposited on the walls and acts like a throttle in the vent by constricting water circulation and allowing pressure to build up.” Other labels include, from the bottom of the vent and moving upward, “Recharge of superheated (above boiling) water;” “Superheated water;” and “High pressure area caused by expanding water and steam.” A caption at the bottom of the drawing tells us: “Geysers are hot springs that erupt periodically. In Yellowstone National Park, all of the ingredients needed for geyser activity are present: heat, water, and underground rock hard enough to withstand intense pressures.” END OF MESSAGE",

It last erupted in 1991. Sapphire remains one of the most beautiful blue pools in the park.

The trail, which is part of the Continental Divide Trail, ascends the hillsides overlooking the Upper Geyser Basin and the Firehole River. Both Summit Lake and the Smoke Jumper Hot Springs Thermal Area are about midway along the trail.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps downs several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color and Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Trail has a wheelchair-accessible overlook at Wall Pool.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "audioDescription": "Biscuit Basin and Sapphire Pool 816 words There are 3 sections in this description. Section 1 (177 words) Biscuit Basin is part of Upper Geyser Basin and is located 3 miles north of Old Faithful. Here you will find several gem-colored hydrothermal features including Jewel Geyser, named for the shiny deep-blue sinter beads surrounding its vent; Rusty Geyser, named for the orange-red basin surrounding its funnel-shaped vent; Shell Spring, with its the pale gold crater; and the deep yellow Mustard Spring. Sapphire Pool, so named for its luminous deep blue water, is also located here. There is a 1/4-mile boardwalk trail that loops around Biscuit Basin. To get to the start of the loop, you must first cross a wood footbridge spanning the Firehole River. The bridge has railings on both sides; portions of the boardwalk itself have either no railings or a railing on one side only. There is also a bench on the side opposite the railing. Small signs remind us that it is “unlawful to throw objects into pools” and that the walkway--with a total distance of ½ miles--is open to foot traffic only. Bicycles and pets are not allowed. Section 2 (438 words) There are two wayside exhibits beside the paved trail leading from the main road to the bridge. The first wayside’s title--“Biscuit Basin”--is located below a large map filling the panel’s top third. Text below the title reads: “This thermal basin is particularly volatile, unpredictable. On August 17, 1959, an earthquake recorded at 7.5 on the Richter scale had its epicenter just a few miles to the northwest. “Four days later, Sapphire Pool began to erupt violently, blowing away the large rock biscuits around the crater. Biscuit Basin was named for those biscuit-shaped mineral formations.” To the right of this text is a color photo showing several thin, branchless trees dotting the barren landscape that surrounds a meandering stream of blue water. The trunks of the mostly gray trees are white at their base, as is the ground around them. A caption to the left of the photo tells us: “Other transformations occur here in slow motion. As you walk the 1/4 mile loop, notice how the shifting runoff pattern kills forests, creating \"bobbysox\" trunks saturated with silica.” The map above this text shows several winding trails, which are represented by dashed black lines. A white arrow labeled “You are Here” on the map’s far right side indicates your location at the entrance to the foot bridge crossing the Firehole River, which is represented by a blue line running north to south. Also on the map’s right side is a black line representing the road leading to Madison Junction to the north and Old Faithful to the south; this road crosses the Firehole River south of Biscuit Basin. Biscuit Basin trail loop is located west of the river and is part of the dashed line marked “Summit Lake Trail.” This trail continues west then veers southwest before ending on the panel’s left edge. Just above the map’s center, the Summit Lake Trail joins another trail loop--significantly larger and wider than the small Biscuit Basin loop--which winds to the north and west before looping back south and east. The top leg of this loop is labeled “Fairy Creek Trail.” Toward the top of the map, there is a scenic overlook located on Fairy Creek Trail. A thinner blue line labeled “Little Firehole River” runs from west to east across the map before ending at Firehole River. “Mystic Falls” is located on Little Firehole River toward the bottom of the larger trail loop. A notation at the bottom of the map reads: “From the boardwalk loop, longer trails climb out of Biscuit Basin and explore other features: Mystic Falls, Observation Point, Summit Lake, and Fairy Creek Trail.” Section 3 (179 words) The second wayside exhibit is entitled “Dangerous Ground.” At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder--who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the exhibit warns us: “In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred. “Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal. “Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.” The wayside exhibit text also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Black Dragon's Caldron<br />126 words<br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit overlooking a large oval mudpot. The wayside, entitled \"Black Dragon's Caldron,\" is made entirely of wood and painted brown with text painted in white. Text below the title tells us:<br />\"This mudpot roared into existence in 1948, blowing trees out by roots and forever changing this once quiet forested hillside. A park interpreter named the new feature for its resemblance to a darkly colored \"demon of the backwoods.\" For several decades, it erupted in explosive 10- to 20-foot bursts of black mud. Over the years, it has moved 200 feet to the southeast and become relatively quiet. However as change is constant in Yellowstone, the black dragon may one day roar back to life.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Black Sand Basin 577 words There are 2 sections in this description. Section 1 (379 words) You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled “Black Sand Basin,” which includes a large pictorial map of water features found in the surrounding area. Located toward the top of the map’s lower left quadrant, a yellow arrow labeled “You Are Here” indicates your position to the left of the short boardwalk that leads visitors through the site. Moving clockwise around the map from its bottom left corner--a paved road leading to a parking area located alongside the first two legs of the boardwalk; Cliff Geyser, located directly across from the parking lot; Emerald Pool, located toward the top of the map; Rainbow Pool, found to the right of Cliff Geyser; and blue Sunset Lake, located in the map’s lower right quadrant. Text below the map tells us: “Black obsidian (volcanic glass) \"sand\" gives this geyser basin its name. Oranges, greens, and other colors in and around the hot springs come from thermophiles (heat-loving microorganisms). While you walk the trail, watch for one of Cliff Geyser's frequent eruptions. The fully accessible trail is about 1/4 miles (0.4 kilometers) long.” A list of warnings and instructions highlighted with bullet points follows: “Leaving the boardwalk is dangerous and illegal. “Pets are not allowed. “Keep your children close to you at all times. “Do not smoke. “Do not bring food or beverages on the boardwalk.” Another list follows under the separate heading “Help preserve Yellowstone for the future:” “Features are fragile and some are thousands of years old. Do not touch. “Do not throw coins or other objects into any of the features. “Colorful mats contain millions of microorganisms--do not touch or otherwise disturb them.” Written in larger red letters at the bottom of the exhibit--“Stay on the Boardwalk.” To the right of this text is a smaller map with various features labeled in red. Starting at the map’s top left corner and moving clockwise down and across the map, these features include Mammoth Hot Springs, Tower-Roosevelt, Canyon Village, Fishing Bridge, Lake Village Bridge Bay, Grant Village, Old Faithful, Madison, and Norris. A yellow arrow located nearly a half of the way up on the map’s left side points to Midway Geyser Basin, located approximately equidistant from Madison to the north and Old Faithful to the south. Section 2 (180 words) A second wayside exhibit, entitled “Dangerous Ground,” stands to the right. At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder--who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the panel warns us: “In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred. “Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal. “Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.” The text also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. END OF MESSAGE",

Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

You are responsible for your safety. As such, please remember these safety tips:</p> <ul> <li>Never touch any hydrothermal waters—they can scald you.</li> <li>Observe safe distances from all wildlife.</li> <li>Stay behind fencing, guard rails, and ledges.</li> <li>Use caution when around park waters—they are cold and fast.</li> <li>Show patience and courtesy to other people.</li> </ul> <h2>Aquatic Invasive Species</h2> <p>Red-rimmed melania, a small snail imported by the aquarium trade starting in the 1930s, was discovered in the Boiling River swimming area in 2009.</p> <p>An aquatic invasive species disrupts ecological processes because it is not indigenous to the ecosystem. Invasive organisms can cause species extinction, with the highest extinction rates occurring in freshwater environments.</p> <p>Red-rimmed melania is unlikely to survive downstream of the Boiling River during the winter, but it could become established in other thermal water in the park.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>The first 50 yards of the compacted soil trail is accessible.

    "audioDescription": "Boiling River<br />821 words<br /><br />There are 3 sections in this description.<br /> <br />Section 1 (368 words)<br />At the edge of a gravel parking lot, just beyond the wheelchair accessible parking bordered by a rough curb of protruding rocks and a signpost indicating no parking after 9 am and no camping, is a wayside exhibit kiosk. The heavy, round log posts of the sturdy kiosk are bound together by heavy metal straps. It is shaded by a gable roof.<br /><br />On the left side of the exhibit, the title \"Boiling River\" is painted in large white letters on the wood above a panel entitled \"Boiling River Trail: Endangered Stream.\" Text below the title reads:<br />\"This stretch of river runs warmer than most mountain streams. A half mile up the trail, underground discharge from Mammoth Hot Springs enters the current and creates a year-round climate for water birds, trout, and aquatic plants. Over the years, delicate travertine terraces have formed along the thermal channel.<br />\"With as many as 200 visitors a day, Boiling River is threatened by popularity. Trail traffic has collapsed several terraces; soap has polluted the water and killed fish and grasses. Little can grow in the heavily-compacted ground.<br />\"Regulations are designed to prevent further degradation of the area while allowing use. The trail is open dawn to dusk with the following regulations: no bicycles or other wheeled vehicles except wheelchairs are allowed; no pets; no food or drink; no camping; no nudity; no soap, including biodegradable. The thermal runoff channel is always closed to swimming or wading.\"<br />Below this text is a color photo of water tumbling over a series of terraces, or flat expanses, resembling wide stone steps. Also on the panel's right side is a map drawing with a blue line representing \"Gardner River\" running from top to bottom, or north to south. A dotted black line representing the \"Boiling River Trail\" runs alongside the right side of Gardner River starting at the bottom of the map until the map's center, where another trail branches off to follow \"Boiling River\" to the west and Dude Hill and Mammoth Campground to the northeast.<br />A black dot labeled \"You Are Here\" indicates your position near the beginning of the trail, just south of one of two parking areas at the bottom of the map.<br />Section 2 (130 words)<br />Note that a wood panel on the exhibit's right side provides the hours for water use and may also include laminated sheets listing various safety warnings. <br />A map of the Gardiner River shows the boiling river swim area with thermal channel closure and notes, \"Swimming, wading, bathing, soaking or in any way entering objects in the Boiling River Thermal Channel prior to its confluence with the Gardner River is prohibited. 36 CFR Section 1.5 (a)(2).\"<br />More text painted in large white letters on the panel reads:<br />\"Regulations Prohibit:<br />\"Food and Beverages<br />\"Indecent Exposure<br />\"Entering Boiling River<br />\"Defacing Thermal Features<br />\"Walking Off-Trail.\"<br />At the bottom of the panel, three icons with diagonal red lines running through them indicate that camping, pets, and bicycles are not allowed in this area.<br />Section 3 (214 words)<br />On the opposite side of the exhibit is another panel entitled \"Perpetual Summer.\" A large color painting depicts three trout swimming around grass-like plants growing among the rocks and pebbles covering a riverbed. The fish are mostly tan with white bellies; white-ringed black speckles dot their upper bodies, fins, and heads. One fish is about to eat an insect. Text below the title reads:<br /> <br />\"Ignore the calendar: this stretch of river creates its own season. In subzero weather summer-green grasses sway in the current, algae colonize pebbles, and waterfowl sometimes appear at the riverbend.<br /> <br />\"The source is geothermal. Discharge from Mammoth Hot Springs percolates underground and enters the Gardner River upstream. In the tropical microclimate of plants and algae, insects feast and swarm near the surface, attracting ducks and dippers. Brown trout spawn here in December.<br /> <br />\"Along rivers throughout the park, look for breaks in winter's pattern-islands of life in the ice-locked stillness.\"<br /> <br />In the panel's top right corner is a small color photo of a white and pale gray bird standing in shallow water. A caption below the photo reads:<br /> <br />\"Here the dipper, or water ouzel, can been seen year-round. Dippers depend on open water: they feed on larvae and small fish by walking upstream underwater, using their wings for stability. Stay quiet and still, and dippers will remain nearby.\"<br /><br />Above this panel is a routed wood plaque acknowledging the Yellowstone Park Foundation for restoring the Boiling River trail in memory of Claire Elizabeth Suh, 2002.<br /><br />On the right side of this exhibit, another routed wooden sign says, \"Swim only in Gardner River. Beware of river currents, they can be strong. In case of emergency, dial 9-1-1.\" <br /><br />Below this are the same three icons with diagonal red lines running through them indicating that camping, pets, and bicycles are not allowed in this area.<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE<br />...",

For example, dead standing trees provide nesting cavities for many types of animals; fallen trees provide food and shelter for animals and nutrients for the soil. However, park managers will remove dead or burned trees that pose safety hazards along roads or in developed areas.</p> <h2>How Does Fire Benefit Yellowstone?</h2> <p>Fires are a natural part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and vegetation has adapted to fire and in some cases may be dependent on it.</p> <p>Fire promotes habitat diversity by removing the forest overstory, allowing different plant communities to become established, and preventing trees from becoming established in grassland.</p> <p>Fire increases the rate that nutrients become available to plants by rapidly releasing them from wood and forest litter and by hastening the weathering of soil minerals. This is especially important in a cold and dry climate like Yellowstone’s, where decomposition rates are slower than in more hot and humid areas.</p> <p>Additionally, natural fires provide an opportunity for scientists to study the effects of fire on an ecosystem.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Burned Trees<br />498 words<br /><br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br /><br />Section 1 (246 words)<br /><br />You are standing in front of a wayside panel entitled \"Winds of Change.\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"Before 1988, a large stand of Douglas-fir grew here. Armed with thick bark, Douglas-fir often survive surface fires.<br /><br />\"But the Fires of â€˜88 were driven by fierce wind-wind that drove flames up through brush and branches. Many Douglas-fir succumbed to intense crown fire.\"<br /><br />Below this text are three color photos arranged one above the other. The top photo depicts smoking grass at the base of a tree. The text accompanying this photo reads:<br /><br />\"Surface Fire. Surface fires clear underbrush and deadfall, and add valuable nutrients to the soil by fertilizing it with ash.\"<br /><br />The next photo shows the sky above a forest aglow with orange flames streaked with dark smoke. The text tells us: <br /><br />\"Crown Fire. Crown fires burn the forest canopy, or treetops. Crown fires burn more<br />intensely, travel more quickly, and burn more thoroughly than surface fires. Like surface fires, they fertilize the soil with ash.\"<br /><br />The last photo shows several spindly evergreens standing against a pale gray sky. One tree is engulfed in flames. The text here reads:<br /><br />\"Ladder Fuel. Fires climb ladder fuel-brush and branches. When fanned by wind<br />in dry conditions, surface fires can quickly turn into crown fires by climbing ladder fuel.\"<br /><br />A color drawing to the right of the photos shows a single sprig of dark pink blooms. A caption reads: \"By 1989, native fireweed grew abundantly here.\" <br /><br />Section 2 (234 words)<br /><br />In the panel's center is a small map drawing identifying various landscape features by color only. A black line links the words \"You Are Here\" to a pale pink area at the top of the map. These areas represent \"Douglas-fir forest.\" A caption tells us: \"Douglas-fir grow in moist areas of northern Yellowstone.\"<br /><br />The rest of the map is largely green, representing \"Lodgepole pine forest.\" Several splotches of yellow represent \"Whitebark pine forest,\" and a few smaller areas colored white indicate \"grassland, sagebrush, thermal basins, and meadows.\" Many of these white areas are dotted throughout the Douglas-fir forest. Mauve, or dark pink, areas in the map's bottom left corner represent \"Spruce-fir forest.\" <br /><br />Another color drawing shows a cross-section of a log or tree trunk with two arrows labeled \"Fire Scars\" pointing to two darkened areas circling amid the tree's many growth rings.<br /><br />Finally, a large color photo on the panel's right side shows three firefighters wielding a water hose across scorched ground. Towering above them to their right is one solitary tree with a tall trunk; branches reach out from roughly the top two-thirds of the tree only. The caption reads:<br /><br />\"This stately Douglas-fir (above) survived when fire raced through here in 1988. Flames scarred the trunk, but did not reach the branches.\"<br /><br />A notation in the panel's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

The short, easy trail follows the canyon rim opposite this overlook.<br /><br />\"To reach the trailhead, turn right (north) at Tower Junction and park at the picnic area 0.5 mile beyond (east of) the bridge.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (338 words)<br /><br />A second wayside panel overlooking this site is entitled \"History in Stone.\" This panel features a large color photo showing a pale brown vertical cliff flanked by evergreen trees. Directly below the cliff's top edge-also pale brown- is a darker band of rock spanning across the cliff face. This darker band is marked with deep vertical striations, or ridges. Text on the panel tells us:<br /> <br />\"About fifty million years ago, volcanoes in Yellowstone and surrounding areas started to erupt, burying the land under volcanic rock. These ancient Eocene volcanoes left their mark with the darker vertical cliffs that stretch up from the river. The volcanoes erupted for about ten million years and then all was quiet as wind, water and ice eroded the ancient volcanic rocks for millions of years.<br /><br />\"Approximately 1.3 to 1.5 million years ago, there was another tremendous volcanic eruption to the south of here. The volcano released a flood of lava that followed the course of an ancient river bed as it flowed. The rapid cooling of this lava resulted in the tall straight columns that resemble a crooked picket fence.<br /><br />\"Capping this columnar basalt is an icing of glacial till deposited by a melting ice cap from the last cooling period approximately 13,000 to 14,000 years ago.<br /><br />\"Finally as the ice melted, the Yellowstone River settled into its current course and began to carve the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.\"<br /><br />On the panel's right side are three smaller color photos, arranged one above the other, each with a yellow line linking it to three specific areas on the cliff face shown in the larger photo. <br /><br />The top photo, which is linked to the cliff's thin top layer, depicts white glacial till, or sediment. The middle photo depicts flowing orange-red lava and is linked to the dark band below the glacial till. The bottom photo is linked to the slightly darker rock face jutting out about halfway up the cliff. This image features pale gray rock resembling a head of jagged cauliflower florets. <br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery.

Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>A wheelchair-accessible trail to this view of the spring is available.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Windproof, hooded outer layer</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool or other insulated garments underneath</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool or synthetic trousers</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool or synthetic long underwear</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</span></p> <h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winter Hazards</span></h2> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather.

This large structure is possibly due to trees growing in the area years prior that became coated in sinter and allowed the height to build up. Layers of geyserite cascade in step-like terraces from the geyser vent and continues to cover the surrounding area. Due to this amount of fragile sinter and the height of the cone, the water is inaccessible for scientific measurements. The western side of Castle Geyser appears smoother than the sinter steps on the east side. As the story goes, thermophile mats use to live on the cone but were peeled off by visitors, permanently damaging the cone structure. Now the water flows down the east side and no thermophiles are visible.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape.

    "audioDescription": "Castle Geyser 270 words You are now facing the site of Castle Geyser, a cone geyser in the Upper Geyser Basin. Castle Geyser is named for the particularly large geyserite sinter deposits forming its tall cone, which now give the geyser the appearance of a gray-walled castle with rounded protrusions on its top edge. When the geyser was first named in 1870, however, the crenellated, or notched, top edges of the structure resembled multiple towers. A wayside overlooking the site is entitled “Castle Geyser” and features a large painting of the erupting Castle Geyser, whose powdery white walls tower over a handful of people standing to its side. To the left of the geyser, in the painting’s foreground, is a large blue pool. Text below the title reads: “The massive cone is a sign of old age. Eruption after eruption, probably for thousands of years, scalding water has deposited this silica mineral formation. By contrast, Old Faithful's fledgling cone may be only a few hundred years old. “Castle Geyser has dramatically changed its surroundings. By flooding the area with hot, silica-rich water, the geyser has devoured part of a pine forest and turned it into a thermal desert. Tree skeletons are entombed within the cone. “Castle Geyser's eruptions are predictable; two per day are typically recorded.” More text tells us: “Thomas Moran painted this watercolor in 1872. Vandalism has since destroyed some of Castle Geyser's original symmetry.” Also on this exhibit is a small gray-and-white drawing depicting a massive geyser cone topped with turret-like formations. A caption reads: “Walter Trumbull, a member of the Washburn expedition, sketched Castle Geyser in 1870.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Cavalry Units and New Guardhouse 251 words Viewed from across a road is a small symmetrical building with central staircase and two windows on each side of a door, framed by a porch. The side of the building are cream stucco and roof is made of red-tile shingles. The wayside exhibit is titled “Crime in Wonderland.” “From poachers to stagecoach robbers, soldiers were kept busy enforcing the law in Yellowstone. “There were five stagecoach robberies in Yellowstone, with the last occurring in 1914. What is often considered the greatest stagecoach robbery of the twentieth century occurred on August 24, 1908, about three miles east of Kepler Cascades, when a single robber held up 17 coaches with 174 passengers. He netted a total of $2,094.20 in cash and jewelry and was never caught.” Below this text is a large black-and-white photo of a dark-suited man sitting on a grassy hillside picking through a bag with items scattered on the ground around him. The caption reads: “Stagecoach robber Ed Trafton sorts his loot from the last holdup on July 29, 1914. Photo was taken by stagecoach passengers who had just been robbed.” In the panel’s upper right corner is a printed sign offering a “$1,000 Reward” for the arrest and conviction of the man responsible for the 1908 stagecoach robbery near Keppler Cascades. The sign includes a description of the robber, who carried an automatic rifle. A notation in the exhibit’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>Celestine Pool is a hot spring with an average temperature of 183.4°F (84.1°C), an average pH of 8.3, and an average conductivity of 2000 uS/cm. It has been known to has small eruptions of superheated water. When Silex Spring exhibited geyser eruptions, Celestine Pool was also active.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins.

    "audioDescription": "Chapel 343 words From the sidewalk, you face a stone chapel with high-peaked roof made of slate shingles with a chimney near the rear. Triple-pane windows with leaded glass sit between stone buttresses covered in lichen on the side of the building. The front doorway, to the right, is made of massive white, wooden doors. A wing extends from the rear of the building with an entrance. Large, black iron metal hinges occur on both the entrances. The wayside exhibit facing the chapel has a large black and white photo from 1920 featuring the interior of the chapel. A wayside exhibit titled “A Sense of Community.” The large black-and-white photo shows a high-ceilinged chapel with several wood pews facing a wood-carved altar on its back wall. A large American flag with 48 stars hangs above this woodwork. A single window situated on the wall to the left of the altar bathes the chapel in soft light. Other objects in the chapel include a pedestal holding a metal sculpture of an eagle with its wings slightly spread and two leafy bouquets. Text below the exhibit title tells us: \"The last of the structures built by the army (completed in 1913), the chapel added a finishing touch to the fort and was considered by far its most beautiful structure. The community held religious services in the troop mess hall, the post exchange, or in a private residence until the chapel was built. In 1914, Katherine Piercy Edmunds and Captain Albert Ady King of the First U.S. Cavalry became the first couple to be married here. “In the decades since, the chapel continues to serve the community. Thoughtful design has given it a timeless splendor that complements its wilderness setting.” A notation in the panel’s bottom left corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.” Use caution as you proceed to the next stop. Follow a sidewalk going slightly uphill. Just before reaching the stop, you will need to cross a residential street. There are some uneven seams between surfaces. Please use caution. END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Chittenden Road<br />298 words<br />The Chittenden Road is a two-way dirt road about a mile and a half long. There is a large parking area where the road stops; from here you may continue the journey to the peak of Mt. Washburn on foot via a 2.8-mile hiking trail, or 5.6 miles round trip. <br />A wayside exhibit at the trailhead to Mt. Washburn features a color drawing of 5 bighorn sheep standing beside a yellow station wagon stopped alongside a mountain road. A family of smiling tourists sits inside the vehicle; the woman in the passenger seat holds out food in her outstretched hand to 2 sheep who have approached her open window. A red circle with a diagonal red line running through its center encircles the 2 sheep and the vehicle. The large title at the top of the exhibit reads: \"Do Not Feed Wildlife. Keep Yellowstone's Wildlife Wild.\" Text on the right side of the drawing cautions us:<br />\"Human food harms wild animals. They abandon their natural feeding habits and become beggars, easy targets for cars and predators.<br />\"All park animals are dangerous no matter how tame they may appear. They can bite or scratch you and can spread disease. Large animals may charge or gore you if you approach them too closely. In fact, some people who have ventured too close to wildlife have been seriously injured or killed.\"<br />A list of regulations below the drawing instructs us: <br /><br />\"Never feed any animal.<br />\"Stay at least 100 yards away from bears.<br />\"Stay at least 25 yards away from all other animals.<br />These regulations also appear in German, French, Spanish, and Japanese.<br />A notation at the bottom of the panel reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant to the Yellowstone Park Foundation from the GE Fund.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Chromatic Pool 534 words There are 4 sections in this description. Section 1 (127 words) You are facing Chromatic Pool, which is connected to nearby Beauty Pool. Both pools are located in the Upper Geyser Basin. These pools, or hot springs, share similar colors--yellowish-brown on their wide periphery with deep bluish-green centers. Standing to the side of the boardwalk leading in front of the two pools is a wayside entitled “Beauty and Chromatic Pools.” Text below the title tells us: “Living Color. The vivid colors of Beauty Pool's basin and runoff channels are created by microscopic lifeforms. Incredibly, these organisms survive and thrive in an environment that would be lethal to us and most other living creatures. Scientists are just beginning to understand these lifeforms; amazingly, hot spring environments may sustain a diversity of organisms rivaling that of terrestrial rain forests.” Section 2 (135 words) The first of two color photos below this text is captioned “Chromatic Pool” and shows a round dark bluish-brown pool surrounded on all sides by ground dusted with white geyserite. The second photo is captioned “Beauty Pool” and features a more oval-shaped pool, yellowish-brown on its periphery with a darker blue-gray center. A title below the photos reads: “Thermal Feature Color Gradient.” The corresponding text tells us: “In the geyser basins with alkaline or neutral pH (Upper, Midway, Lower, West Thumb, and Mammoth Hot Springs), color is primarily a function of what lives and grows in a feature. The graph to the right represents the upper environmental temperature limits for life and the corresponding colors (which vary over the course of a year as a consequence of seasonal changes) in the features or runoff channels.” Section 3 (107 words) The graph shows bright blue on its leftmost end, followed by white, bright yellow, green, pale brown, and dark brown. Text accompanied by an arrow pointing to the blue section reads: “Blue and clear waters are extremely hot and at times may exceed the boiling point (199 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Centigrade) at this elevation.)” Other arrows pointing to the remaining colors--also representing water that decreases in temperature from 163 degrees to finally 60 degrees Fahrenheit as we move toward the far right end of the graph--indicate that various organisms such as fungi, algae, protozoa, mosses, crustaceans, insects, and trout can live in these pools. Section 4 (139 words) To the right of the photos is a drawing showing the underground water circulation here at the two pools, with a black arrow pointing downward into Chromatic Pool and another arrow pointing upward from inside Beauty Pool. A title below this drawing is “Hidden Connections.” Text below the title reads: “Beauty Pool shares an underground link with Chromatic Pool (to your immediate left). When Beauty Pool is full, Chromatic Pool's water level is much lower; sometimes the reverse may be observed. Many other features in the Upper Geyser Basin have demonstrated similar behavior. The factors affecting such exchanges of function are many and may include phenomena such as earthquakes and continuing mineral accumulations in each feature's underground ‘plumbing.’\" A notation in the exhibit’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system.

Its waters deposit as much as half and inch of sinter a year. Look at the trees around and below this spring. The silica-rich water of Cistern Spring has killed many of them.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color and Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Norris Geyser Basin</h2> <p>Norris Geyser Basin is one of the hottest and most acidic of Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. It is outside of the most recent Yellowstone caldera, but inside the first and largest caldera. It sits on the intersection of three major faults and is a very active earthquake area.</p> <p>Each year, new hot springs and geysers appear while others become dormant. Geologic events trigger many of these changes. Even small earthquakes can alter hydrothermal behavior. This sudden activity is known as a “thermal disturbance” and can last a few days, or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to “normal.”</p> <p>No one fully understands why this happens. Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. The water chemistry changes as the water levels of underground hot water reservoirs fluctuates.</p> <p>Although Norris is known for its acid features, it also have alkaline hot springs and geysers. As underground water and chemistry shift suddenly, they could contribute to dramatic changes in minerals and pH.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

The wayside is entitled \"Norris Geyser Basin: Underground Network.\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"Imagine a network of water-filled channels below you-Norris Geyser Basin's uncharted â€˜plumbing system.' Geysers and hot springs reveal clues about their underground connections.<br /><br />\"After a major eruption, Steamboat Geyser ejects a massive steam column well beyond the treetops for many hours. Typically, nearby Cistern Spring drains, then refills several days later.\"<br /><br />At the top of the panel is a small color photo showing a tall column of steam rising from a distant geyser. The caption reads:<br /><br />\"Steam phase following Steamboat Geyser's major eruption on May 2, 2000.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (298 words)<br /><br />On the panel's right side is a map drawing with Back Basin labeled in its center and the smaller Porcelain Basin located to Back Basin's north, at the top of the map. A red dot with the words \"You Are Here\" indicates your position alongside Cistern Spring on the eastern periphery of Back Basin. You are standing at the junction of two boardwalks, one that leads northeast to Steamboat Geyser and the other leading due west toward Veteran Geyser.<br /><br />Additional boardwalks and dirt or paved trails lead past other hydrothermal features including Echinus Geyser and Arch Steam Vent to the southeast and southwest respectively, before continuing further west to Puff â€˜n Stuff Geyser, Black Hermit Caldron, and Green Dragon Spring at the bottom of the map. <br /><br />The trail to the north of Green Dragon Spring leads to Blue Mud Steam Vent, Yellow Funnel Spring, Porkchop Geyser, Pearl Geyser, Vixen Geyser, Palpitator Spring, Fearless Geyser, Monarch Geyser and Minute Geyser; at the top of Back Basin the trail loops around to reach Emerald Spring, located due north of your position at Cistern Spring.<br /><br />Note that there are 3 sets of restrooms located in the parking areas serving Norris Geyser Basin Museum. The museum is located north of Emerald Spring. <br /><br />Finally, on the bottom of the panel are two color photos entitled \"Cistern Spring.\" The photo on the left shows a crater only three-quarters full of water. The photo of the right shows an empty crater. The captions read:<br /><br />\"Cistern Spring began draining when Steamboat Geyser erupted on May 2, 2000.<br /><br /><br />\"On the following morning, Cistern Spring was empty, exposing sinter-coated tree roots in the bottom of the spring.\"<br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

Travertine builds up rapidly here and causes the features to change quickly and constantly.</p> <p>Some vents will clog completely, new vents may form, and old vents may reopen. Sometimes the water is concentrated in a few springs while at other times it may spread across many outlets.</p> <p>In every case, water follows the path of least resistance, which could be above ground or underground. Scientists estimate that, at any given time, about 10 percent of the water in the Mammoth Hot Springs system is on the surface; the other 90 percent is underground.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "audioDescription": "Cleopatra Spring<br />552 words<br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (383 words) <br />You are now part way up the Mammoth Hot Springs Terraces hillside, at a junction in the boardwalk near Cleopatra Terrace and Mound Terrace. <br />A wayside exhibit features a large color topographical map of a vast landscape encompassing travertine terraces and hot springs. In the map's center, a white dot accompanied with the words \"You Are Here\" indicates your position just south of Cleopatra Terrace, and north of Mound Terrace. Jupiter Terrace and Main Terrace are both located further south, on the left side of the map. Located downhill from you is Minerva Terrace. <br />Also labeled throughout the pale and largely non-forested terraces in the map's foreground are Canary Spring, Palette Spring, and Liberty Cap. Opal Terrace lies furthest east, at the bottom of the map. \"Bunsen Peak,\" \"Terrace Mountain,\" and \"Clagett Butte\" are labeled from left to right at the top of the map. <br /><br />The trail running past Cleopatra Terrace is represented by a dashed yellow line, indicating \" boardwalk or trail with steep grades or stairs.\" Other trail sections winding throughout the terraces are represented with a dashed red line, indicating \"wheelchair accessible boardwalk or trail.\" Four trailheads are marked with a \"self-guiding trail\" icon, including three trailheads at the bottom of the hill, and one trailhead at the top. On the far right side of the map, northwest of Hymen Terrace, a hiking trail is marked \"Beaver Ponds Trail: five-mile loop\" with an arrow pointing north, or away from the terraces. <br />Pictured at the bottom of the map, and located to your east, is a road that runs south, curving west to Upper Terrace Loop Drive, or north, curving east to the visitor center. There are three restrooms: one is located just north of the terraces, its photograph pictured on the map. Restrooms can also be found in the Albright Visitor Center in Mammoth. Both of these restrooms are wheelchair accessible. The third restroom is an outhouse located in the parking lot near the entrance to the Upper Terrace Loop Drive. <br />There are also five parking areas located throughout the site-four along the road to your east and one alongside Upper Terrace Drive. Wheelchair icons appear at three of the parking areas along the road to your east, alongside the origin of the three trails leading into the terraces.<br /><br />Section 2 (151 words)<br />Below the map, in the panel's bottom left corner, is a small color photo showing a wide fissure in cracked earth. The photo is captioned \"Fragile Ground.\" More text tells us: \"The ground is fragile. For your safety, stay on the boardwalk or paved trail.\"<br />To the right of the photo is a subtitle \"Stay Safe and Protect Resources\" followed by these five instructions highlighted with bullet points:<br />\"Hot springs can burn you! Please do not touch the water.<br />\"Stay on the boardwalk or paved trails at all times. The ground is fragile, and hot water may be hidden below.<br />\"Expect steep grades and stairs.<br />\"Do not smoke, litter, or takes pets on trails.<br />\"Hot spring vents can easily become clogged. To protect them, never throw anything into the springs.\"<br />A notation in the panel's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>This nearly constant performer splashes from several vents and its steam can be seen throughout the Lower Geyser Basin. Its name is Greek for water clock, and was given because the geyser used to erupt regularly every three minutes. Since the 1959 Hebgen Lae Earthquake, however, Clepsydra erupts almost without pause. Sometimes it quits during Fountain Geyser's eruption.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "audioDescription": "Congress Pool<br />235 words<br />There is a paved trail leading to the Geyser Basin Museum. Below the museum, on the way to Congress Pool, the pavement turns to boardwalk, then a dirt trail. The boardwalk resumes near Congress Pool, so named in 1891 for that year's Fifth International Geological Congress. It is but one of many geothermal features located in the Norris Geyser Basin. <br />With the exception of the boardwalk's first few feet, there are wood railings on both sides. Take care as you step from the trail onto the boardwalk, however, as the transition may be uneven. A small sign affixed to the railing as you stand facing the pool reads simply: \"Congress Pool.\"'<br />Also standing near the boardwalk is a wayside exhibit entitled \"Solfatara: Unstable Ground.\" Text below the title reads:<br />\"This hillside is venting. As sulfuric acid, gases, and steam escape, they create a barren and very dangerous landscape called a solfatara: scalding mud and steam are often barely covered by hot, crumbling, decomposed rock. Unlike other geothermal features, this solfatara's high concentration of sulfuric acid breaks down the surrounding rock making a confined \"plumbing system\" unlikely--the gases and steam escape less dramatically.\"<br />To the right of the text is a color photograph of a jagged gray mountain. The caption below the picture tells us:<br />\"Sometimes a solfatara has larger, well-defined vents like those at Roaring Mountain (just north of Norris Junction).\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Crested Pool 298 words You are now facing Crested Pool, a hot spring named for the whitish-gray mineral deposits that surrounds its dark-blue pool. A wayside overlooking the pool is entitled “Crested Pool: Superheated Waters” and features a large color drawing of the pool’s underground structure--narrow at the bottom with a wide mouth. Text below the title reads: “Hot springs are the most numerous type of thermal feature in Yellowstone. More than 10,000 are scattered across Yellowstone's 2 million acres, but few are as hot and as intensely colored as Crested Pool. Water temperatures within the pool often exceed the boiling point (199 degrees Fahrenheit or 93 degrees Celsius at this elevation) and reach superheated temperatures of 201 to 202 degrees Fahrenheit (94 degrees Celsius). The spring's intense blue color results when sunlight passes into its clear waters. Blue, from the rainbow of colors in visible light, is scattered the most and, therefore, is the color we see.” Labels on the drawing include the white sinter crest surrounding the pool both above ground and below; a triangular ray of sunlight with all seven colors of the rainbow that strikes the pool’s surface; short arrows representing the cooler water moving downward into the pool; and longer arrows indicating superheated water rising from the pool’s center. There are also three short blue arrows pointing into the sky from the point where the sunlight hits the pool. More text to the right of the drawing tells us: “At times, fierce, boiling waters within Crested Pool can explode to heights of 7 feet, acting like a geyser. It is believed, however, that no constrictions block the flow of water to the surface. The spring's wide mouth and 43-foot depth provide a natural conduit for superheated water to circulate continuously to the surface.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Daisy Geyser 375 words Daisy Geyser is one of several water features located in Yellowstone’s Upper Geyser Basin. As you approach the geyser, please take care as the wood boardwalk running alongside the site does not have handrails. Standing to one side of the boardwalk is a wayside exhibit entitled “Daisy Geyer.” Text below the title reads: “Daisy Geyser is part of an interconnected group of geysers and hot springs. Underground cracks and fissures allow water and heat to circulate between the various features in this group. When the activity of one feature affects the behavior of another, it is called an exchange of function. Daisy Geyser is usually quite predictable, but when nearby Bonita Pool overflows excessively or when Splendid Geyser erupts, Daisy Geyser can become irregular.” Below this text--and superimposed over a black-and-white aerial photograph of the region--is a map indicating the location of Daisy Geyser between Brilliant Pool, Splendid Geyser, and Comet Geyser to the west and Bank Geyser, Radiator Geyser, and Bonita Pool to the east. A small black arrow labeled “You Are Here” points to your position on the boardwalk that runs from east to west below these sites; Daisy Geyser is located several yards straight in front of you. Below and to the left of the map are two “Fast Facts” highlighted with bullet points: “Daisy Geyser erupts to heights of 75 feet or more. “On average, the duration of Daisy Geyser's eruptions are 3 to 5 minutes.” Filling the left half of the panel is a color photograph of a wide pool from which a tower of water shoots at a slight angle several feet into a deep blue sky. A caption under the photo tells us: “An eruption of Daisy Geyser starts with boiling water splashing from one of several vents in the thick sinter ledge partially surrounding the geyser's crater. This eruption indicator means that a full eruption is about to occur. Boiling water soon pours over the crater's edge, and the splashing increases. Suddenly, bursts of water angle into the sky, reaching heights of 75 feet and lasting from 3 to 5 minutes.” A notation in the panel’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

Further, each of the 14 other national parks established in the late 1800s and early 1900s was separately administered, resulting in uneven management, inefficiency, and lack of direction.</p> <h2>Setting the Stage</h2> <p>The management of Yellowstone by the Army helped set the stage for the creation of an agency whose sole purpose was to manage the national parks. Promoters of this idea gathered support from influential journalists, railroads likely to profit from increased park tourism, and members of Congress.</p> <p>In 1916 when Congress created the National Park Service, the Army turned Fort Yellowstone over to the new agency. Local resistance made this transition difficult, and the Army returned in 1917. The park was fully under National Park Service control in 1918, and the Army departed.</p> <p>Fort Yellowstone is reminder of the role veterans of the US Army served in protecting and preserving Yellowstone National Park for future generations.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-tour-fort-yellowstone.htm\">Explore the Fort Yellowstone Historic District</a></li> </ul>",
    "audioDescription": "Double Cavalry Barracks 382 words A wayside exhibit is situated at the corner of a three story stone building with wide railed, wooden porch on the second and third floors. At ground level, stone columns support the porch, flanked by wings with five windows. On the same wings, three windows are on the second and third levels. The wayside exhibit is titled “From Soldier to Ranger.” “The National Park Service Act was signed on August 25, 1916. About one month later on September 30th, twenty-three soldiers were discharged from the army to be hired by the civilian agency as the first rangers in Yellowstone. Included with the soldiers were some of the old-time civilian scouts who had led the soldiers in patrolling the backcountry for poachers. These first rangers, like modern rangers, took pride in the ability to \"do it all\" including fighting wildfires, investigating accidents, controlling traffic, providing park visitors with information and patrolling the backcountry.” A large black-and-white photo shows four rows of 11 to 16 dark-uniformed men either standing or sitting in front of the building in front of the porch. Included among them are two men dressed all in white with white caps. One soldier holds a pole flying a small white flag adorned with a dark letter “F.” A caption below the photo reads: “The Army's legacy is visible in wood and stone, and in the very survival of Yellowstone as one of the world's great symbols of the National Park idea.” The first of two smaller black-and-white photos in the panel’s top right corner shows a bearded man wearing a wide-brimmed hat pinned at two points to the crown. Beneath the outer coat is another layer with a popped collar. The caption tells us: “Harry Yount was gamekeeper in Yellowstone from 1880 to 1881 and is considered the first ranger.” The second photo depicts a woman wearing a dark ranger uniform with jodphur pants. Her hand rests on the wheel of a stagecoach that reaches nearly as tall as her head. A ranger hat is in her other hand and a badge hangs from her breast pocket. She has a short haircut. The caption reads: “Ranger Herma Albertson, circa 1925.” A notation in the exhibit’s bottom left corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p> <h2>Mud Volcano Area</h2> <p>The Mud Volcano area has many mudpots and hillsides strewn with trees cooked by steam. The hydrothermal features here are some of the most acidic in the park.</p> <p>Mud Volcano is near the greatest uplift and sinking of the Yellowstone Caldera floor. Many faults converge here and earthquakes are common.</p> <p>The areas surrounding the Mud Volcano vent and the other major vent near Old Faithful are called resurgent domes. Resurgent domes are active ground deformation, where the land moves up or down with the fluctuation of the magma chamber below. Scientists monitor these domes closely for information about ongoing volcanic activity.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

You can see the result when you drive over Dunraven Pass or through other areas of the park with Absaroka rocks.

The rings on horns can be used to determine age, though it is easier to count the rings on a ram.</p> <p>Ram skulls have two layers of bone above the brain that work as a shock absorber.

    "bodyText": "<p>Ear Spring is a truly hot spring, with surface water temperatures often above the boiling point of 198°F (92°C) at this elevation. True to its name, this pool is shaped somewhat like an ear.</p> <p>Very rarely, Ear Spring erupts. The last eruption happened on September 15, 2018 (14 years since the last known eruption). This eruption proved to be historic, for it actually ejected old coins, cans, a cement block, and even a baby pacifier along with the usual water and steam. This is a good reminder to never toss anything into thermal features, as they can damage the features, sometimes to the point of plugging the vents completely. Thankfully, it appears that the major of objects ejected from Ear Spring were historic rather than contemporary objects.</p> <p>Ear Spring has an average temperate of 197.1°F (91.7°C), an average pH of 8.4, and an average conductivity of 1889 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

    "audioDescription": "Elk in Mammoth Hot Springs<br />639 words<br /><br />There are 4 sections in this description.<br /><br />Section 1 (215 words)<br /><br />You are standing in front of two wayside exhibits at the side of a wide lawn edged by sagebrush. This area was Fort Yellowstone's Parade Ground: a gathering place, training ground, and the site of parades and ceremonies. The wayside on the left is entitled \"Calving Season: New Life in the Elk Herd.\" It pictures a large color photo of three young elk--one standing and two lying down--in a grassy field. <br /><br />On the panel's right side are three smaller color photos arranged one above the other, each showing a cow and her young calf. The photos are entitled \"A Few Minutes Old\" and \"Motherly Instinct.\" They are captioned:<br /><br />\"Cow elk give birth in May or June. In less than an hour, a newborn calf stands for its first meal.<br /><br />\"Newborns cannot keep up with the herd. A cow keeps her calf safe by hiding it, then grazes or rests nearby. Like its mother, the newborn uses instinct, lying still until its mother returns.<br /><br /><br />\"Cow elk are very protective of their calves.\" In bold, \"A cow may charge if you venture near her young, even if you do not see a calf. Stay alert!\"<br /><br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Park Foundation.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (203 words)<br /><br />The wayside exhibit on the right is entitled \"Elk Rut: The Sound of Autumn.\" At center is a photo of a bull elk with wide antlers and a stocky body. It stands next to a young cow; the photo is just above a wider image of three elk in a field of golden grasses--an elk on the right keeps a watchful eye on two cows to the left. Text below the title reads:<br /><br /> \"As the days grow short and temperatures dip, bull elk feel the nudge of autumn. Instinct and experience guide them. Ready to compete, bulls pierce the air with bugling-their distinctive mating calls.\"<br /><br />More text below the subtitle \"Gathering and Guarding a Harem\" reads:<br /><br />\"Robust bulls rely on more than muscle to compete in the rut. Herding skills and a spirited attitude are vital, along with a stout pair of antlers. A bull must defend his harem of cows-sometimes to the death-or risk losing them. <br /><br />\"While two bulls battle, other bulls sneak in to whisk cows away. Unattended females often wander, only to be herded again. For more than a month, mature bull elk have very little time for food or rest. The rut demands full attention.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (78 words)<br /><br />Under the subtitle, \"Bugle Calls in the Fort\":<br /><br />\"Long before soldiers arrived to protect Yellowstone's wonders, or built Fort Yellowstone, or graced the parade grounds with bugle calls, bull elk sounded their own bugles.<br /><br />\"Elk are wild and unpredictable. They roam freely in the park today, as they did in 1886 when soldiers first matched into Mammoth Hot Springs.\"<br /><br />Illustrating the text is a black and white photo of Army soldiers standing near here in the late 1800s. <br /><br />Section 4 (117 words)<br />The next subtitle is, \"Too Close!\"<br /><br />The first photo is a bull elk lying on grass next to a danger sign--\"do not approach\"--with a man standing close taking its picture. The photo is captioned: \"During the rut, bull elk are agitated and extremely dangerous, even when resting.\"<br /><br />The next photo illustrates this, showing a bull elk chasing a man running away from it. It is captioned: \"Elk are quick and powerful. Keep your distance.\"<br /><br />The exhibit reminds us in bold letters, \"Stay at least 25 yards (23 meters) from elk at all times.\"<br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Park Foundation.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

This hot spring's bright green color resembles that of the gemstone with the same name. <br /><br />A wayside exhibit affixed to the boardwalk railing overlooking this feature is entitled \"Emerald Spring: The Secret is Sulfur.\" Text below the title tells us:<br />\"A hot spring's color often indicates the presence of minerals. In a clear blue pool, the water is absorbing all the colors of sunlight except one--blue, which is reflected back to our eyes. Here in Emerald Spring's pool, another factor joins with light refraction to give this spring its color. The 27-foot-deep pool (8 meters) is lined with yellow sulfur deposits. The yellow color from the sulfur combines with the reflected blue light, making the hot spring appear a magnificent emerald green.\"<br /><br />A color photo to the right of the text shows the yellow sulfur deposits--resembling prickly vegetation--lining the pool. A caption below the photo reads:<br /><br />\"Hot spring water and steam can dissolve and transport sulfur from underground.

    "audioDescription": "Excelsior Geyser Crater<br />670 words<br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (310 words)<br />The Excelsior Geyser Crater is one of several features located in the Midway Geyser Basin. Excelsior Geyser's eruptions are very rare. The 200-by-300-foot crater we see today is rimmed by short jagged cliffs and is known for the pool of steaming blue-green water contained within. <br />To reach the Excelsior Geyser Crater from the trailhead parking area, you will walk across a wooden bridge spanning the Firehole River to access the half-mile boardwalk that loops through the basin. For most of the boardwalk there are wood railings on both sides. There is a small sign marked \"Excelsior Geyser Crater\" affixed to the railing overlooking the crater site.<br />A wayside exhibit entitled \"Excelsior Geyser\" features a large black-and-white photograph of a wide mass of water and steam erupting hundreds of feet into the sky. Text below the title reads:<br />\"In the 1880s Excelsior Geyser erupted in bursts 50 to 300 feet high. The thermal violence formed the jagged crater and apparently ruptured the geyser's underground system, causing eruptions to cease after 1890.<br /><br />\"On September 14, 1985, Excelsior roared back to life with forty-seven hours of major eruptions. It is impossible to predict when this dormant but powerful geyser's next eruption will occur.\"<br /><br />Text in the photo's top right corner tells us:<br /><br /><br />\"Frank J. Haynes photographed this eruption in 1888. Like most geysers, Excelsior is unpredictable, with no discernable pattern to its eruptions.\"<br /><br />In the exhibit's bottom right corner is a color aerial photo showing the Excelsior Geyser Crater as it appears today. Both the circular crater in the photo's center and the river running above and below the crater are filled with churning water. Text to the left of the photo explains:<br /><br />\"Though its eruptions have been erratic, the geyser's outflow is nearly constant, pumping more than 4,000 gallons of boiling water per minute over the crater rim into the Firehole River.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (342 words) <br />Nearby, another wayside exhibit overlooks Excelsior Geyser. It is entitled \"Buried Alive.\" This exhibit features a color photo of a large jagged-edged crater filled with a thin cloud of white steam. Text below the title reads:<br />\"Excelsior Geyser's rugged crater was created by rare massive geyser eruptions. Surprisingly, it also preserves a record of past life.<br /><br />\"For thousands of years, microbes have grown in the runoff channels extending from nearby Grand Prismatic Spring. These vast communities were buried alive as the flowing hot water deposited a crust of silica minerals. The resulting deposit, called sinter, preserved the shape of the microbial mat it entombed. As new mats grew, more layers developed. Today's formation is the result of this interplay between its living and nonliving components.<br /><br />\"Yellowstone's hydrothermal features provide a glimpse into the distant past when intense volcanism was widespread on the young Earth. The life forms found here help scientists understand the type of life that likely arose and diversified billions of years ago on our planet.\"<br /><br />On the exhibit's right side, two yellow arrows point from the geyser's inner wall to a round photo located above and to the left. This smaller photo, circled in yellow, depicts a close-up view of the gray layers comprising the wall. A caption below the photo tells us: <br /><br />\"Layers of sinter (above) form the geyser wall and are the preserved remains of ancient microbial communities.\"<br /><br />At the bottom of the exhibit is a bright yellow box entitled \"Life Beyond Earth?\" Following the title are three sentences marked with bullet points:<br /><br />\"Formations that entomb microbes in Yellowstone's geysers and hot springs may offer clues in the search for life on other worlds.<br /><br />\"Volcanic hot spring systems are believed to have existed on other planets in our solar system.<br /><br /><br />\"If similar formations are found, they may contain evidence that life existed elsewhere in the universe.\"<br /><br />A notation in the bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant to the Yellowstone Park Foundation from the NASA Astrobiology Institute and Lockheed Martin Space Operations.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

There were sports as well. Baseball was viewed as the national pastime, and games were played with tourists to cheer the soldiers on.” The large black-and-white photo featured on this exhibit shows a large residential dining room where five people-two clean-shaven young men, a young woman with upswept black hair, and two older men with a bushy mustache and white beard respectively-sit around a cloth-covered table. A potted plant sits in the table’s center; the coffee cups and dishes holding the diners’ meals are made of fine china. A caption reads: “Dinner at the residence of Acting Superintendent (1891 to 1897), Captain George S. Anderson.” There is also a quote by Bessie Hayes Arnold: “A great deal of calling always among army people. Calling on newcomers, calling if anyone had a house guest and people always called when they were leaving for a new post.” A notation in the exhibit’s bottom left corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

The trout also spawn here. For these reasons, Fishing Bridge was closed to fishing in the early 1970s, with the support of angler groups.</p> <p>Although there are more than 141 tributaries that enter Yellowstone Lake, its only outlet, the Yellowstone River is located here. The Yellowstone River flows north and discharges 2,000–9,000 cubic feet per second.</p> <h2>Fishing Permits</h2> <p>Although fishing is prohibited from Fishing Bridge, it is allowed in other locations. Fishing permits are required in Yellowstone, state-issued fishing permits are not valid within the park.</p> <p>Permits are available at visitor centers, ranger stations, general stores, and other locations outside of the park.</p> <p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/fishing.htm\">nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/fishing.htm</a> for more information.</p> <h2>Think Safety, Act Safely</h2> <p>From burning hot hydrothermal features, to unpredictable wildlife, to steep terrain, Yellowstone is a dangerous place. You are responsible for your safety. As such, please remember these safety tips:</p> <ul> <li>Never touch any hydrothermal waters—they can scald you.</li> <li>Observe safe distances from all wildlife.</li> <li>Stay behind fencing, guard rails, and ledges.</li> <li>Use caution when around park waters—they are cold and fast.</li> <li>Show patience and courtesy to other people.</li> </ul> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Wheelchair users may require assistance because the surface of the historic bridge is rough and narrow.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Fishing Bridge<br />490 words<br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (189 words)<br />You are standing in front of two wayside exhibits near the entrance of Fishing Bridge, which overlooks Yellowstone Lake. The exhibit on the left is entitled \"Off the Hook. Historic Fishing Bridge. \" It features a large color photo of dozens of people crowding the bridge; most hold fishing poles over the timber railing lining the bridge's side. A caption at the bottom of the photo reads: \"Fishing Bridge in 1962.\" Text at the top of the panel below the title reads:<br />\"Before Fishing Bridge closed to fishing in 1973, visitors fished here elbow to elbow--their hooks snagging each other as well as passing motorists. Regulations were changed when park managers realized that fishing from this bridge was decimating the trout population.<br />\"Now this spawning area, vital to both river and lake fish, is recovering. Watch for white pelicans--their huge yellow beaks ready to catch a meal--and other fish-eating birds. After an absence of many decades, they have returned!\"<br />A smaller photo at the top right of the panel shows three large white birds with long necks and bright yellow beaks. The caption reads: \"White Pelican.\"<br />Section 2 (283 words)<br />The wayside exhibit on the right is entitled \"Cutthroat.\" On the bottom half of the panel is a color drawing of two sleek fish swimming through blue-green water. The fish are pale yellow and tan with small dark spots dotting both their skin and fins; their mouths are open to accept food. Both water and fish are cast in a gentle glow from sunlight above. Text below the title reads:<br />\"After the ice sheet on Yellowstone Lake breaks up in May and grinds downstream beneath Fishing Bridge, you can witness a spawning frenzy. Cutthroat trout lay millions of eggs in the riverbed gravel within sight of the bridge. Spawning season has a powerful effect on other wildlife in the Fishing Bridge area, as a variety of birds and animals are drawn to the feast.<br />\"Ospreys dive for immature cutthroats less than 13 inches long; pelicans take adult fish. Looking for seasonal protein, grizzly bears snatch spawning trout.\"<br />To the right of this text is a color photo of a bald eagle in flight, a long fish clutched in its talons. A caption below the photo reads:<br />\"So much depends on a healthy, spawning population of cutthroat trout.\"<br />The walking bridge itself is about 5 feet wide with a timber railing on the side facing the river and a line of wooden benches separated by low wood columns on the side abutting a 2-lane roadway. Take care when walking on the bridge's uneven and slightly sloping stone surface.<br />A sign at the top of the wood stairs leading from the sandy beach beside the parking lot up to the bridge reads: \"Cutthroat Trout Spawning Ground. Do not fish from bridge. Do not feed fish.\" <br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Open daily December 15, 2023 – March 15, 2024.</strong></p> <p>During the winter season, come inside to warm up and get out of the cold. The following amenities are available:<br /> <br /> <strong>Staff available: </strong>Yes (9am - 3pm)<br /> <strong>Light Snacks: </strong>No<br /> <strong>Water: </strong>No<br /> <strong>Restroom: </strong>Yes<br /> <strong>Operating Hours: </strong>24 hours a day</p> <hr /> <h2><strong>Winter Preparedness</strong></h2> <p>Winter is a wonderful time to experience Yellowstone. Before venturing into Yellowstone’s winter wonderland, make sure you have properly planned and are prepared for the challenges brought on by extreme cold and deep snow.</p> <ul> <li>Let friends or family know your itinerary.</li> <li>Do not travel alone.</li> <li>Evaluate your party’s and equipment's capabilities.</li> <li>Be prepared to make repairs.</li> <li>Carry and drink plenty of water, and bring high energy food.</li> <li>Be prepared to set up an emergency shelter.</li> <li>Bring a first-aid kit, space blanket, extra clothing, and headlamp.</li> <li>Carry and know how to use a map and compass.</li> <li>Use sunglasses or ski goggles and sunscreen.</li> </ul> <h2><b>Clothing and Gear</b></h2> <p>Even in severe winter temperatures, you can be comfortable and safe if you dress properly to prevent chilling and overheating. Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</p> <ul> <li>Windproof, hooded outer layer</li> <li>Wool or other insulated garments underneath</li> <li>Wool or synthetic trousers</li> <li>Wool or synthetic long underwear</li> <li>Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</li> <li>Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</li> <li>Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</li> </ul> <p>Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</p> <p>Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</p> <h2>Winter Hazards</h2> <p>Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</p> <p>Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</p> <ul> <li>Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</li> <li>Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</li> <li>Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Stay dry and learn how to recognize the signs of hypothermia and frostbite—they can set in quickly.</li> <li>Bears may be active at any time of year—be alert for signs of bear activity.</li> </ul> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <ul> <li>Do not walk on snowshoe or ski trails.</li> <li>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</li> <li>Yield to faster skiers or those going downhill.</li> <li>Detour around wildlife—never approach.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails and boardwalks.</li> <li>Keep children close at hand.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</li> <li>Keep your food secure—never feed wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Snowmobile Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>All snowmobilers must be led by a guide authorized by the National Park Service (NPS) to operate in Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>All snowmobiles must meet NPS sound and emission requirements.</li> <li>Snowmobile operators must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license in possession. Learner permits are not sufficient.</li> <li>Roads are open only 7 am to 9 pm. Snowmobiles are not allowed to operate in the park between 9 pm and 7 am.</li> <li>Maximum speed limit is 35 mph for snowmobiles, 25 mph for snowcoaches, or less where posted or as conditions warrant.</li> <li>Use hand signals when turning or stopping.</li> <li>Allow enough distance between snowmobiles when traveling.</li> <li>Pass only when safe.</li> <li>If you turn around, stay within the road width.</li> <li>Drive in single file, on the right side of the road even if the road is rough.</li> <li>When stopping, pull to the far right and park in single file.</li> <li>Do not idle your machine more than three minutes.</li> <li>Stay on designated roads. Side-hilling, berm-riding, or any off-road travel is prohibited and carries a fine of up to $5,000.</li> <li>Report accidents to a ranger.</li> <li>Operating a snowmobile while intoxicated is illegal. Possession of open alcoholic beverage containers, including bota bags, is illegal.</li> </ul> <p><b>Wild animals have the right of way.</b> If bison or other wildlife are on the road, stop at least 25 yards away (100 yards for wolves or bears). Pull your machine as far as possible to the opposite side of the road and give them a chance to move off the road.</p>",

To the right of the map is a subtitle, \"Welcome to the Trail.\" Text below this subtitle reads:<br /><br />\"Forces of the Northern Range Self-Guiding Trail is a 1/2-mile accessible loop. Benches along the trail provide a place to rest and enjoy the view. Please preserve the area by staying on the boardwalk.\"<br /><br />Below the map is another subtitle, \"A Special Place.\" Text below this subtitle tells us:<br /><br />\"Yellowstone's northern range is home to a large variety of plants and animals. It is unique-different from other areas in the park. What makes it so different?\"<br /><br />A list of four sentences highlighted by bullet points follows:<br /><br />\"Elevations are 5,200 to 7,000 feet-lower than anywhere else in Yellowstone.<br /><br />\"Annual precipitation is less than 15 inches-drier than the rest of the park.<br /><br />\"Soils formed from many kinds of rock--rhyolitic soils are found elsewhere in Yellowstone.<br /><br />\"Winter wind and sun reduce snow depths in this open landscape-winter grazing is easier here.\"<br /><br />More text tells us: <br /><br />\"Sagebrush, shrubs, and grasses grow abundantly in these conditions. This habitat is perfect for large grazing animals, whose presence supports a variety of predators.\"<br /><br />Also on the panel is a color photo of a young girl with a camera suspended from a cord around her neck. With one bent knee resting on the boardwalk and the other leg bent, she appears to be examining pink fireweeds with green leaves growing alongside the trail.<br /><br />At the bottom of the panel is a large topographical map drawing of the boardwalk trail, depicted as a pale brown path looping through a pale blue-green landscape dotted with sparse vegetation. A small black square with the words \"You Are Here\" shows your location at the beginning of the trail, located near the map's bottom left corner. <br /><br />A notation in the panel's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>This part of the boardwalk takes you through the edge of a lodgepole pine forest, the main type of forest found in the park. Below the pines are several wetland seeps. Seeps like these can provide habitat for rare plants.</p> <h2>Lodgepole Pine</h2> <p>The lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) is by far the most common tree in Yellowstone. Early botanical explorers first encountered the species along the West Coast where it is often contorted into a twisted tree by the wind, and thus named it <i>Pinus contorta var. contorta</i>. The Rocky Mountain variety, which grows very straight, is <i>Pinus contorta var. latifolia</i>. Some American Indian tribes used this tree to make the frames of their tipis or lodges, hence the name “lodgepole” pine.</p> <p>Lodgepoles are the only pine in Yellowstone whose needles grow in groups of two. The bark is typically somewhat brown to yellowish, but a grayish-black fungus often grows on the shady parts of the bark, giving the tree a dark cast. The species is shade intolerant; any branches left in the shade below the canopy will wither and fall off the tree. Lodgepoles growing by themselves will often have branches all the way to the base of the trunk because sunlight can reach the whole tree.</p> <h2>Wetlands</h2> <p>Approximately 38% of the park’s plant species—including half of the rare plants—are associated with wetlands and 11% grow only in wetlands. Wetlands provide essential habitat for Yellowstone’s rare plants, thermal species, reptiles and amphibians, and for numerous insects, birds and fish.</p>",

To protect the park’s natural features and wildlife, the U.S. Army was dispatched to Yellowstone in 1886, establishing Camp Sheridan. After enduring five cold, harsh winters in temporary frame buildings at the foot of the Mammoth Hot Springs, Congress appropriated $50,000 for a permanent post (later known as Fort Yellowstone), which served as the headquarters for the U.S. Army until their departure in 1918. During their time in Yellowstone, through carrying out day-to-day administrative tasks, the military commanders promulgated rules and regulations that constituted a philosophy of conservation, defining the nature, characteristics, and management of national parks.<br /> <br /> In 1888, two years after the U.S. Army arrived in Yellowstone, the Fort Yellowstone Cemetery received its first burial. At least 54 people were buried in the cemetery between 1888 and 1916, most of them military personnel, civilian employees of the army, and their relatives.<br /> <br /> At the time, life in a remote and rugged place like Mammoth Hot Springs was demanding, isolating, and had its challenges. Known causes of death of the individuals buried in the cemetery included natural causes; infections like pneumonia and scarlet fever; environmental causes such as drowning, falling, avalanche, hypothermia, or exposure; and from injuries caused by animals (including horses and a grizzly bear). <br /> <br /> In 1915, the cemetery was expanded and delineated by a fence of galvanized pipe built into concrete posts and a decorative gate, all of which still stand today. In 1917, 19 individuals (soldiers and civilian employees) were disinterred by the U.S. Army and transported and reburied in the Custer National Cemetery in the Little Bighorn National Monument in south-central Montana. Civilian employees of the army and relatives of military and civilian personnel were not relocated and are still buried in the Fort Yellowstone Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Learn more about the history and other structures of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-tour-fort-yellowstone.htm\">Fort Yellowstone</a>.</p>",

The trail takes approximately 45 minutes at a leisurely pace.</p> <p>The exhibits describe life in Fort Yellowstone when the US Army administered the park from 1886 through 1918.

Do not approach wildlife.</b></p> <p>Many buildings along the trail are employee residences and are not open to the public. Please respect the privacy of residents by staying on the paved route and treating living areas with courtesy.</p> <p>The trail begins at the Albright Visitor Center, which was the bachelor officers' quarters, completed in 1909. It had an officer's mess or club, kitchen, sitting room, and apartments for six single officers.</p> <h2>Yellowstone's First Ten Years</h2> <p>For the first decade after Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872, the park was under serious threat from those who would exploit, rather than protect, its resources.</p> <p>Poachers killed animals. Souvenir hunters broke large pieces off the geysers and hot springs. Developers set up camps for tourists near hot springs, along with bath and laundry facilities in the hot springs.</p> <p>In response, civilian superintendents were hired to preserve and protect the new park. Their experience and intentions varied, and they were all under-funded and under-staffed.</p> <p>Word reached Congress that the park was in trouble, but legislators refused to appropriate money for the park's administration in 1886.</p> <h2>The Army Arrives</h2> <p>The Secretary of the Interior, under the authority given by Congress, called on the Secretary of War for assistance. In 1886, men from Company M, First United States Cavalry, Fort Custer, Montana Territory, came to Yellowstone under the command of Captain Moses Harris.</p> <p>Over the next 32 years, the Army strengthened, posted, and enforced regulations in the park. Troops guarded the major attractions and evicted troublemakers, and cavalry patrolled the vast interior.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>The route has some potential hazards where the concrete sidewalk has buckled (up to 1.5\" high) or has large gaps at expansion joints.</p> <p>The concrete sidewalk is cracked or deteriorated in some places.</p> <p>Side slope may be up to 6% in places along Officer's Row. The sidewalks between the Albright Visitor Center and the Administration Building (originally double cavalry barracks) have 10-12% slopes.</p> <p>The audio description describes the wayside exhibit.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Fort Yellowstone National Historic Landmark 395 words Facing the Albright Visitor Center, at the right-most sidewalk, is a wayside exhibit panel and trail guide box. The panel is entitled “Fort Yellowstone National Historic Landmark.” One foot to the right is a trail box, about 3 feet high, where you can lift the lid to obtain a pamphlet entitled Fort Yellowstone Historic District Walking Tour. A $1.00 donation is requested or return after use; money can be inserted in the slot on the lower front of the bin. Text on the panel introduces: “A stroll along the sidewalks of the fort takes you back to when the West was being tamed, the national park idea was new, and visitors travelled the dusty roads in horse-drawn carriages. “Enhance your tour by purchasing the self-guiding publication available here or in the visitor center. “Allow 45 minutes for a leisurely stroll along the route. “Approximate distance is .3 mile (.5 kilometer). “Tour route is entirely paved and wheelchair accessible.” A Special Note in orange-salmon is featured: “The Albright Visitor Center in front of you is open to the public year-round (hours are posted on the door).” “However, most other structures in Fort Yellowstone are employee residences and are not open to public use. Please respect the privacy of residents by staying on the paved tour route and treating their living areas with respect.” A large map illustrates the location of the fort buildings during the army’s administration. The names are listed in approximately the order of circling around the Fort, counterclockwise from bottom left. 1. Bachelor Officers’ quarters 2. Captains’ quarters 3. Field Officer quarters 4. Double Officer quarters 5. Post Headquarters 6. Guardhouse 7. Hospital (demolished) 8. Morgue (demolished) 9. Hospital Steward quarters 10. Hospital Annex 11. Chapel 12. Hospital (demolished) 13.

At top right, an inset quote from Major John Pitcher, Acting Superintendent, 1901-1907: “This is the only point in the park where an extensive transformation of natural conditions by the work of man has been permitted. Yet, it was unavoidable here, and in yielding to this necessity the effort has been made to provide a substitution that would be in harmony with the natural surroundings, and would itself be a feature of interest.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fountain Geyser looks like a placid blue pool as its water slowly rises. This geyser gives little warning of its pending eruption, but when it does blow, it is one of the most beautiful geysers in the park. It erupts 10–50 feet (3–15 m) into the air for 20 minutes or more, with an eruption interval in the 3.5–11 hour range. Many other geysers in the area appear to be linked to Fountain Geyser, with activity that occurs before or after an eruption of Fountain Geyser. It has an average temperate of 182.1°F (83.4°C), an average pH of 8.5, and an average conductivity of 2000 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins.

    "audioDescription": "Fountain Paint Pot 1,005 words There are 4 sections in this description. Section 1 (131 words) Fountain Paint Pot is a mud pot, or bubbling mud pool, an acidic hot spring with low water, named for the reds, yellows and browns of the mud found in this area. A wooden boardwalk will lead you to Silex Spring. Please use extreme care on the boardwalk because portions of the boardwalk do not have railings. Hot water and dangerous ground are on both sides of the boardwalk. At Silex Spring, you will encounter a steep grade leading down to the boardwalk trail that loops around Fountain Paint Pot. There are restrooms located alongside the parking area before you reach the boardwalk entrance. There are some railings on the boardwalk, which overlooks many other hydrothermal features found along this trail. Wood benches are placed at various spots on the boardwalk. Section 2 (419 words) Standing to the right of the boardwalk is a wayside exhibit entitled “Fountain Paint Pot,” which features a large map of the looping Fountain Paint Pot Trail. This boardwalk trail leads north from a white rectangle representing the parking lot located at the bottom of the map. It then leads past Celestine Pool about halfway up the map, to Fountain Paint Pot, Red Spouter and finally Leather Pool, located near the map’s top edge. Fountain Paint Pot and Red Spouter are encircled separately by the trail which continues to the left, or west, toward several geysers located in the map’s top left corner--Twig, Fountain, Morning, Clepsydra, and Spasm--before looping back to join the first leg of the trail at a point just north of Celestine Pool. Also on the map is a line leading right, or east, from the parking lot to the yellow Grand Loop Road, which runs from south to north alongside the right side of the trail. Arrows indicate Old Faithful to the south and Madison Junction to the north. The word “Caution” appears in red letters in the map’s bottom left corner. We are told: “Thin crust and scalding water. It is illegal to leave boardwalk.” Text beside a small wheelchair logo located inside the longest trail loop approaching the geysers tells us: “Trail is wheelchair accessible except for steep section with stairs (marked in red).” The trail area marked red is located west of Fountain Paint Pot before you reach Twig Geyser. A small color photo in the panel’s bottom left corner depicts Clepsydra Geyser erupting steam into a deep blue sky. Text to the right of the photo reads: “The half-mile (.8 kilometers) Fountain Paint Pots trail takes you through one of the most complex and dynamic hydrothermal areas in Yellowstone. Here you will find geysers, hot springs, fumaroles, and mudpots. The geysers in the Fountain Group exhibit a variety of eruption patterns and intervals. In the spring, the mudpots are thin, soupy, and splash a lot. As the year goes on and there is less water, they become thick and gurgly. As you explore Fountain Paint Pots, please remember to be safe and stay on the boardwalk.” A few feet to the right of this map exhibit is a trail box, about 3 feet high, where you can obtain a pamphlet about the site by lifting the lid. A $1.00 donation is requested or return after use; money can be inserted in the slot on the front of the bin. Section 3 (154 words) You are now standing at a wayside exhibit overlooking Red Spouter, which is located north of Fountain Paint Pot. The exhibit is entitled “Earthquake’s Offspring: Red Spouter.” Text below the title reads: “As you stand here, imagine traveling back in time to August 17, 1959. You would find yourself on a grassy knoll. Red Spouter did not exist! “Shortly before midnight, a major earthquake rocked Hebgen Lake, Montana, approximately 25 miles northwest of here. Jolts rippled through Yellowstone. In the aftermath, Red Spouter was born.” A color photo to the right of the text shows a small steaming hot spring. The caption reads: “Red Spouter, eight months old.” More text in a small tan box below the photo reads: “Some Like it Hot! Even seething hot springs support life. Heat-loving microorganisms called \"thermophiles\" thrive in Red Spouter. They live on gases like hydrogen sulfide, the cause of the rotten-egg odor you likely smell here.” Section 4 (275 words) To the left of the box is a small map depicting an area of Yellowstone National Park--a section of Wyoming with the Montana border drawn to the north and the Madison and Idaho Rivers flowing in from the west. A red dot labeled “You Are Here,” also in red letters, indicates your position at Fountain Paint Pot, located just left of the map’s center. There is another red dot just north of Hebgen Lake, to the left of the Wyoming border in the state’s northwestern corner. The dot is labeled “1959 Earthquake Epicenter.” Two bullet points to the left of the map tell us: “The ’59 Quake...measured magnitude 7.3 on the Richter scale” and “was the most powerful to strike the area in recorded history.” At the bottom of the panel",

The exhibit is entitled \"Fumaroles: High Heat and Low Water\" and features two color photos. Text below the title reads:<br />\"The hottest of Yellowstone's geothermal features are fumaroles (steam vents). Fumaroles in Norris Geyser Basin have measured up to 280ËšF (138ËšC). A plentiful water supply would help cool these features; however, steam vents are usually found on hillsides or higher ground, above the basin's water supply. They rapidly boil away what little water they contain, releasing steam and other gases forcefully from underground.\"<br />Located to the right of the text, the larger of the two photos shows a burst of white steam billowing upward from what appears to be a fissure in a hillside of striated brown rock. A caption above the photograph tells us:<br /> \"The hillside in front of you has been a hot and volatile area for many years, and may look different if you visit again.\"<br />The smaller photo, located below the text, shows a thin veil of steam rising from what appears to be two deep holes in an area of rocky ground.

    "audioDescription": "Gardiner Basin1,019 wordsThere are 5 sections in this description.Section 1 (285 words)You are standing in front of the first of two wayside exhibits overlooking Gardiner Basin, located to the north of the Heritage and Research Center. The first wayside exhibit is entitled \"Gardiner Basin: In the Rain Shadow.\" It features a large aerial photo of the tan-colored basin and surrounding mountains. Text below the title reads:\"The Madison and Gallatin mountains to the west and the Absarokas to the east shelter this valley. The Madison and Gallatin ranges stand tall against westerly winds, capturing moisture-laden clouds on the windward side of the mountains. Rain falls heavily there, leaving little moisture for the Gardiner Basin, where less than 10 inches of precipitation falls each year.\"Also labeled on the photo is the deep blue \"Yellowstone River,\" which appears to zigzag away from you on the photo's right side and a thin horizontal line below the mountain foothills in the photo's center indicating \"Reese Creek-Park Boundary.\" A thin brown line running alongside the river on its left side is labeled \"Old Railroad Bed.\" A black dot and the words \"You Are Here\" indicate your position alongside the Old Railroad Bed, just right of the photo's center.In the panel's bottom left corner is a small drawing of a white-tipped mountain peak colored green on its left side and gray on its right side. Four small arrows labeled \"Prevailing winds\" point upward alongside the green slope, where a white cloud-like area labeled \"Cool air rises and condenses\" appears to rain down on the mountain. A smaller white area hanging directly over the mountain peak is labeled \"Cold air.\"Two arrows labeled \"Dry air advances,\" \"Hot air,\" and \"Rain shadow\" point downward alongside the gray, or right side slope.Section 2 (244 words)On the panel's right side are three black-and-white photos entitled \"A Place for People.\" Text below the title reads:\"Can you hear voices of the first people here? Native American ancestors entered this valley about 11,000 years ago after the last glacier receded. They found fish, game, and shelter from deep snow. The first pioneer homesteader arrived in 1871. By the turn of the century, homesteads dotted the basin. Imagine farmers plowing fields, or cowboys hollering as they round up cattle. Maybe the wind whispers stories of Cinnabar before that colorful town fell silent forever. The Gardiner Basin is rich with tales of people who discovered a haven in this arid valley.\"The top photo, which is not captioned, shows a group of conical teepees standing in a field. The middle photo depicts a man riding a horse-drawn mower through a field of low grass; a mountain rises in the distance. Two captions read:\"Electric Peak looms over a farmer mowing hay in the 1920s.\"Irrigated fields burgeoned with alfalfa and oats until the land was added to the park in the 1930s for winter wildlife habitat.\"The bottom photo shows a line of buildings, including a hotel and a store, standing alongside the rail tracks at the base of the mountains. A caption tells us:\"Cinnabar sprang to life in 1883 at the terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad. When tracks reached Gardiner in 1903, Cinnabar died and quietly disappeared from the landscape.\"Section 3 (125 words)The second wayside is entitled \"Restoring the Range: A Place for Plants.\" It features a large color photo of a vast field filled with rows of low green plants resembling clumps of grass; a label appearing in white letters on the field reads: \"Barley Cover Crop.\" Beyond the barley crop and standing at the base of distant foothills is a fence that spans nearly the field's entire width. Another label in white letters reads: \"Exclosure Fence.\" Text below the wayside title tells us:\"A restoration project is underway here. The nearby fenced area is a temporary exclosure to keep ungulates such as deer, elk, bison, and pronghorn out. When newly seeded native plants take root and flourish inside the exclosure, the fence will be removed.\"Section 4 (180 words)In the panel's bottom left corner is an image of an index card with the title \"Recipe for Restoration,\" followed by text that reads: \"1. Build a strong exclosure to keep animals out.\"2. Treat exotic plants inside fence with herbicide.\"3. Plant cover crop to restore organic matter to soil and prevent wind erosion.\"4. Collect native seeds for reseeding.\"5. Seed with native species. Do not water or fertilize.\"6. Continue weed control. Reseed if necessary. \"7. Nurture plot until four â€˜Ps' of restoration (planning, persistence, patience, precipitation) pay off in native plants.\"To the right of the recipe card is a smaller color photo showing a large tractor pulling a seed spreader, traveling in a field alongside an exclosure fence. Except for sparse rows of thin yellow plants, the field appears nearly barren. Text below the photo reads:\"Each spring and fall Yellowstone National Park's revegetation team plants cover crops inside",

    "audioDescription": "Giant Geyser 402 words There are 2 sections in this description. Section 1 (134 words) Giant Geyser, located in the Upper Geyser Basin, is the namesake for the Giant Group of geysers, which includes Bijou and Mastiff Geysers. From your position on the boardwalk overlooking the geyser, you are facing the open side of its 12-foot-tall cone, which is pale whitish-yellow in color. Carved into a wood sign attached to the boardwalk railing in front of you are the words “Giant Geyser, Last Eruption.” Text on a small plaque with a plastic face located on the sign’s right side tells us: “Last Eruption. September 28, 2015. Giant can erupt over 50 times a year (2007) or once a year (2010). Splashes in the cone are common.” Note that the date “January 2010” has been crossed out and that “September 28, 2015” has been written in with black marker below. Section 2 (250 words) There is also a wayside exhibit overlooking this site. Entitled “Giant Geyser,” the panel features two large photos of Giant--one showing it erupting high into a deep blue sky, the other, providing a close-up of the craggy-edged cone’s steaming vent. Text below the title tells us: “When active, Giant Geyser is one of the largest in the world. Historic accounts describe Giant's eruptions soaring to heights of 250 to 300 feet. However, recent eruptions have ranged from 200 to 250 feet. “Giant Geyser displays cycles of activity and dormancy. The unpredictability of Giant is due, in part, to interconnections between it and the geysers and hot springs of the nearby Grotto Group.” A second title--“Fast Facts”--is followed by three sentences highlighted with bullet points: “Giant is a cone-type geyser. “When active, Giant's eruptions may reach heights of 200 to 250 feet. “Giant's eruptions can last from 1 to 1.5 hours and expel more than a million gallons of water.” Text below another title--“Shrouded in Antiquity”--tells us: “The large sinter shroud surrounding Giant's vent may be an indication of the geyser's great age. The slow accumulation of mineral (1 to 2 inches every 100 years) indicates that Giant could be thousands of years old.” Also pictured on the exhibit is a black-and-white image of the erupting geyser. The caption reads: “1870s woodcut of Giant Geyser.” A notation in the exhibit’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Gibbon Falls884 wordsThere are 4 sections in this description.Section 1 (218 words)A wide paved pathway situated alongside the Grand Loop Road leads to the overlook of Gibbon Falls. The side overlooking the falls has a stone wall with an uneven top edge; there is a waist-high metal railing lining portions of the pathway's opposite side. Please take care as there are also some large boulders situated in the center of this pathway as you approach the overlook. There are two wayside panels located at this site. A wayside exhibit entitled \"Road Builders\" lies sheltered inside a small open structure with a roof supported by rough-hewn logs. Text below the title reads:\"To visit spectacular scenes of geysers, wildlife, and waterfalls, Yellowstone travelers have long depended on roads. Rough cut and rough to ride, roads in the 1800s carried modest traffic. Through the years, more people arrived-with larger, heavier vehicles. By the 1920s, newer, bigger, stronger roads were needed.\"In 1928, a five-mile road section through Gibbon Canyon was reconstructed. In spite of breakdowns, a \"great deal of rain,\" and October snows, work was completed in 118 days.\"A map drawing shows a blue line running from left to right representing a section of the Gibbon River. A red dot and the words \"You Are Here\" indicate your position by Gibbon Falls just right of this river section's midpoint.Section 2 (233 words)More text on this panel includes a subtitle-\"Solid as Stone\"-followed by this information:\"Road construction through Gibbon Canyon demanded solid rock and sturdy manpower. Tons of rock were quarried, then fashioned into walls by stone masons. Hand-placed support, laid stone by stone, kept steep embankments from collapsing. Upstream, \"rip rap,\" or loose rock, prevented washouts.\"Text following another subtitle-\"Crew and Camp\"-reads: \"Two camps provided temporary homes for the Morrison-Knudsen Company crew. At Gibbon Meadows, an existing building was adopted as a mess hall. It \"proved very satisfactory\" as a joint office and sleeping quarters. One telephone was installed for business and personal calls.\"The panel also provides several black-and-white photos of the Gibbon River, Gibbon Falls, and the construction-and eventual completion-of the road overlooking these features. One caption tells us: \"In 1998 archeologists found clues of 1928 camp life-tobacco cans, Mason jars, horseradish and cold cream bottles-even a label from a can of cherries.\" Another caption reads: \"With the help of 30 teams of horses, 110 men build a splendid canyon road.\"Also of interest is a list of pay rates for workers at the site. This per-day rates range from $4.50 for a common laborer to $8.00 for a foreman.A notation in the panel's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant to the Yellowstone Park Foundation from ConocoPhillips.\"Section 3 (218 words)The wayside exhibit at the end of the trail features a large black-and-white photo offering a panoramic view of the scene located in front of you-a river, a ribbon-like waterfall, and the tall partially forested hills surrounding these features. The panel is entitled \"Gibbon Falls: Cascading to the Caldera.\" Text below the title tells us:\"This frothy veil of water plunges 84 feet (26 meters), then tumbles toward the Yellowstone Caldera about 1/4 mile (.4 kilometer) downriver. As Gibbon Falls erodes the rock below, the waterfall forever grows higher and migrates farther from the rim of the caldera.\"Three hills-on the photo's bottom left and right sides and also at the upper right- are labeled \"Lava Creek tuff.\"A subtitle located to the right of the photo reads \"Cradled by Tuff.\" More text tells us:\"Volcanic history surrounds you. When the Yellowstone Volcano erupted about 640,000 years ago, untold volumes of volcanic ash spewed forth. Intense heat welded the mountains of ash into rock called Lava Creek tuff.\"The Gibbon River rushes toward you through a canyon of Lava Creek tuff. Tuff formed the hillsides high above the river. The road behind you cuts through a wall of tuff strewn with rocks that were deposited by the Yellowstone ice cap around 14,000 to 16,000 years ago.\"Section 4 (189 words)A color topographical map shows Teton Range at top center and Caldera Rim-indicated by a dotted black line-curving across and then downward on Teton Range's right . Yellowstone Lake is situated below Teton Range, and a black arrow indicates Gibbon Falls' location on a portion of the Caldera Rim located below and to the right of Yellowstone Lake. Another upward-pointing arrow in the map's upper left corner is labeled \"S\" for south. Text below the map reads:\"You cannot clearly see the caldera that formed when the Yellowstone Volcano erupted. Subsequent eruptions of underground magma oozed through cracks, spreading lava over the earth's surface. Lava flowed and cooled for millennia, partially filling the caldera to create the landscape you see now.\"Another subtitle-\"Where Are You?\"-",

    "audioDescription": "Glacial Boulder<br /><br />467 Words<br /><br />If you wish to visit the glacial boulder wayside exhibit, turn left onto a curved spur trail or continue to stop 5. Follow the spur trail to a large boulder on the left side of the boardwalk with a low weathered wooden bench. You can touch the boulder from the bench. On the right side of the boardwalk is the exhibit. The boardwalk continues to curve to another bench situated at a 90 degree angle. The second bench is positioned so you could lean back on the boulder.<br /><br />A large boulder covered in lichen next to a bench is to the left of a wayside exhibit. Sagebrush covers a gently sloping valley with mountains in the far distance.<br /><br />Section 1 (126 words)<br /><br />On the left two-thirds of the exhibit panel, titled, \"Glacial Boulder,\" is a background photo of another large boulder covered in lichen, surrounded by sagebrush and grasses with large hills in the midground and a snow-capped mountain reaching into the sky in the background. Text on the sky reads, \"The large boulder beside you was left by a glacier--the glacier that sculpted the broad valley you are standing in.\"<br /><br />Next to the boulder in a paragraph, \"A Cold Ride\":<br />\"How did this boulder get here? Like many others scattered across Yellowstone, it was scraped from the mountains by a glacier, then carried by the ice to a new site. This granite boulder traveled from the northeast for many miles before settling here when the glacier melted.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (215 words)<br /><br />On the right side of the panel is \"Frozen Landscapers.\" A small photo of a glacier fills the space between two mountain peaks. Text to the right, \"Glaciers, like those in Alaska today--and Yellowstone thousands of years ago--form in frigid climates where more and more snow accumulates and turns to ice. These massive \"rivers of ice\" carve the land as they slowly advance downslope.\"<br /><br />The next heading is, \"Yellowstone's Icy Past.\" <br /><br />\"As you look at Yellowstone's beautiful mountains and valleys, imagine ice and snow in every direction. Thousands of years ago, the ice was so thick that only the highest mountain peaks rose above the frozen landscape. The glaciers that buried Yellowstone shaped the mountains that you see today.\"<br /><br />An illustrated elevation map of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem shows Yellowstone's boundary within a large blue area covers what is now Grand Teton National Park and expands beyond both park boundaries fully surrounding mountain valleys. It is labeled, \"Yellowstone icecap.\" Mountains and valleys surround the icecap: Absaroka, Gallatin, and the Tetons.<br /><br />The illustration is captioned, \"Approximate boundaries of Yellowstone's most recent icecap about 20,000 years ago and earlier glaciation about 140,000 years ago.\"<br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.\"",

    "audioDescription": "Golden Gate<br />344 words<br />Within the Golden Gate Canyon a wayside exhibit kiosk built with heavy logs and a shingled roof overlooks falls far south and opposite of a canyon view. A small river passes below. The rocks have a golden hue. To your left, a narrow bridge forming a portion of the Grand Loop Road appears to hug the canyon wall on the left; tall evergreens stand at the base of the steep rocky slope to the right.<br />The wayside is entitled \"The Golden Gate.\" Text in the center of the panel reads:<br />\"Bridging the Golden Gate Canyon was one of the most difficult and expensive challenges engineers faced when building the first roads through the park. The first bridge was built in 1885. Twelve hundred seventy-five pounds of explosives were needed to remove 14,000 cubic yards of solid rock which was hauled off in the dump trucks of the day--horses and wagons.<br />\"This bridge was dangerously unstable by 1900. Heavily-laden stagecoaches crossed the bridge many times a day with the possibility of a fatal drop into the chasm if the wooden trestle failed. The bridge was rebuilt in 1900, 1933, and 1977 using newer materials and engineering each time.\"<br />A black-and-white photo on the left side of the panel depicts a man riding a horse along the wooden bridge with railing that once stood on this site. A few yards behind him, a horse-drawn wagon passes a tall jagged stone pillar on the railing side. A caption reads: <br />\"Traveling through the Golden Gate in 1885.\"<br />The uppermost of two sepia photographs on the panel's right side features the large stone pillar on the open edge of the same bridge, now without the side railing. A caption for this photograph tells us:<br />\"'Walk your horses' is good advice on a one-lane bridge.\" <br />An inset photo shows a closeup of a historic sign that reads, \"Walk Horses. Golden Gate.\"<br />The photo in the bottom right shows a later version of the curving bridge. The caption here reads: \"Widening bridge, 1933.\"<br />END OF MESSAGE",

Grand Geyser's large pool is virtually flat with a low gray rim on its opposite side only. The rim is located at the base of a grassy bank sloping down toward the geyser; this gentle slope is dotted with evergreen trees on its crest. There is a long recycled plastic bench placed lengthwise on the boardwalk running alongside the geyser, where there are no railings on either side. A small sign overlooking the geyser tells us on what days and between which hours it is most likely to erupt. <br />Also overlooking the site is a wayside exhibit entitled \"Grand Geyser,\" which features a large color photo of the erupting geyser as well as a small color photo providing a close-up view of the gray rocks surrounding its vent. Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"World's Tallest Predictable Geyser. Known for the height and beauty of its eruptions, Grand Geyser's activity is linked with that of nearby geysers. An intricate sequence of events that takes place over 7 to 15 hours culminates in explosions of boiling water and steam from Grand's pool.

A small crack left of Turban's sinter shoulder is Vent Geyser. These three geysers share a subterranean source of hot water.<br /><br />\"Turban Geyser erupts more frequently than the other two. Grand will erupt just before or after Turban erupts. The water level in Grand fluctuates with each Turban eruption, usually dropping noticeably. As an eruption of Grand Geyser nears, boiling water surges over the rim of its pool. Within seconds, Grand will erupt. Finally, Vent Geyser comes to life, jetting water to heights of 75 feet. Though Grand's eruptions last only about 10 minutes, Vent and Turban can continue to erupt for an hour or more.<br /><br />A drawing below the text shows Vent Geyser on the left, Turban Geyser in the center, and Grand Geyser on the far right.

    "audioDescription": "Grand Prismatic Spring918 wordsThere are 2 sections in this description.Section 1 (429 words)You are facing Grand Prismatic Spring, also located in the Midway Geyser Basin. Encompassing approximately 1 Â½ acres--and with a depth of more than 120 feet deep--Grand Prismatic Spring is Yellowstone's largest hot spring.There are two wayside exhibits located along the boardwalk at this site. The first exhibit is entitled \"Grand Prismatic Spring: Prism of Light, Spectrum of Life\" and features a large color photo of a steaming pool of bright blue water surrounded on all sides by feathery orange-brown channels. The water in the center of the pool appears to be dotted with particles colored an even darker blue; a thin yellow line rims the pool itself. Text in a box below the title tells us:\"Grand Prismatic Spring is the largest and one of the most brilliant of Yellowstone's many colorful hot springs. Its massive expanse stretches approximately 200 feet (61meters) across. The high temperature of its water--160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius)--ensures that the spring is often cloaked in steam.\"Deep beneath us, magma from an active volcano heats water that rises to the surface through fissures in the rocks. The result is a hot spring that pours almost 500 gallons of hot water each minute into the Firehole River. Minerals dissolved in the hot water are deposited and gradually build the gracefully terraced shoulders of this feature.\"In a black box spanning the bottom of the exhibit is the title \"Did You Know?\" followed by three sentences marked with red bullet points:\"Prismatic means brilliantly colored.\"The intense blue color in the center of this hot spring is due to sunlight being scattered by fine particles suspended in the water.\"The yellow, orange, and brown colors encircling the hot spring and lining the runoff channels are caused by thermophiles--heat-loving microorganisms. These microbes contain colorful pigments that allow them to make energy from sunlight and thrive in the harsh conditions of hot springs.\"To the right of this text are two smaller photos showing microscopic views of the bacteria found around the spring. The photo on the left resembles small black squiggles crowded on a dark-gray background; the right-hand photo resembles a brown caterpillar with long yellowish hairs. A caption below both photos reads:\"Billions of thread-like filaments and sausage-shaped cells (left) of the thermophilic cyanobacteria Phormidium (for-MID-e-um) and Synechococcus (sin-e-ka-KAK-us) and Calothrix (KAL-o-thrix; right) build colorful orange and brown mats lining the runoff channels from Grand Prismatic Spring.\"A notation in the bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Park Foundation.\"Section 2 (471 words)The second wayside exhibit is entitled \"Life on the Edge\" and features a large color photo of a wide brown channel marked with bright yellow particles and thin wavy yellow lines. At the top of the photo--behind the brown channel filling the foreground--is a glowing blue pool. Text in a white box below the title reads:\"The billions of colorful microorganisms lining this hot spring's runoff channels are called \"extremophiles\" because they live in conditions that were once thought to be too extreme to host life. Extremophiles that live in hot springs are called \"thermophiles\"--heat-lovers.\"Below this photo, more text in a black band tells us: \"Yellowstone National Park is one of the most accessible places to study extreme environments and the organisms that inhabit them. Understanding life forms here provides clues for scientists searching for life elsewhere in the universe.\"Because conditions on other planets in our solar system are harsh, if life exists elsewhere it is probably as some form of microscopic extremophile.\"To the right of the large photo is a second title, \"Miniature Forests,\" followed by additional text, which reads:\"Within the rainbow of orange, brown, and red colors, some microorganisms live in communities of thick mats. Like miniature forests, these mats have a vertical structure and stratified functions. Microbes that live on or near the top of the mat (similar to a forest canopy) use sunlight to perform photosynthesis, which fuels the mat community. Organisms living deeper in the mat (similar to a forest understory) derive energy from chemicals produced by the surface microbes.

    "bodyText": "<p>Private and commercial paddling excursions launch from the Grant Marina.</p> <p>During late summer, Yellowstone Lake becomes thermally stratified with several water layers having different temperatures. The topmost layer rarely exceeds 66 degrees F, and the lower layers are much colder. Because of the extremely cold water, survival time for anyone in the lake is estimated to be only 20 to 30 minutes. In winter, ice thickness on Yellowstone Lake varies from a few inches to more than two feet with many feet of snow on top of the ice.</p> <h2>Yellowstone Lake</h2> <p>Yellowstone Lake is the largest high-elevation lake (above 7,000 ft) in North America, covering 286 square miles, with an average depth of 138 feet, and just over 12,000,000 acre-feet of water. The lake is covered by ice from mid-December to May or June.</p> <h2>Swimming and Soaking</h2> <p>Swimming is not recommended in Yellowstone, and is occasionally prohibited, because most lakes and streams are dangerously cold. Firehole Canyon, near Madison Junction, has a swimming area popular in summer.</p> <p>Soaking in hot springs and other thermal features is prohibited and features are very fragile. You may soak in bodies of water fed by runoff from hydrothermal features, such as Boiling River.</p> <h2>Anticipate Potential Hazards</h2> <p>From burning hot hydrothermal features, to unpredictable wildlife, to steep terrain, Yellowstone is a dangerous place. You are responsible for your safety. As such, please remember these safety tips:</p> <ul> <li>Never touch any hydrothermal waters—they can scald you.</li> <li>Observe safe distances from all wildlife.</li> <li>Stay behind fencing, guard rails, and ledges.</li> <li>Use caution when around park waters—they are cold and fast.</li> <li>Show patience and courtesy to other people.</li> </ul> <p><b>Think Safety, Act Safely</b></p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Boat launch is wheelchair-accessible.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Grant Marina<br />289 words<br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit overlooking the Grant Marina area of Yellowstone Lake. At the top of the exhibit is a color photograph of a wide section of the deep-blue lake, its choppy waves topped with small whitecaps on their breaking crests. The title and text below this photograph reads:<br />\"Dangerous Waters--Boating on Yellowstone Lake. Waves build rapidly on this wide expanse, making capsizing a real danger. Once in the water, your chances of survival are poor. The lake remains exceptionally cold year-round; survival time is an estimated 20 minutes.\"<br />Below and to the right of this text is a color drawing of a brown-haired man, his head flung back and eyes closed, as he floats lifeless in the water. His only clothing is a pair of blue shorts; he also wears a red life vest strapped to his shirtless torso. Text appearing in a small box to the left of the drawing reads:<br />\"For your safety, read and follow park boating regulations carefully, and get the latest weather forecast before launching. Always keep within easy reach of the shore.\"<br />A caption below this box reads:<br />\"Never go boating without a PFD (a personal flotation device) for each passenger.\"<br />A wood ramp with railing on its left side and a low curb on its right leads from a wide gravel area on shore out several feet over the water. A sign with a white wheelchair logo is attached to this railing. To the left of this ramp is a shorter boat ramp, or slipway, with metal railings on shore only. Two more signs--white with diagonal red stripes--issue warnings to watercraft users stand beside another railing overlooking the docking area.<br />END OF MESSAGE",

Great Fountain Geyser takes 10-14 hours to rebuild to an eruption. The pool slowly fills, then begins to overflow 70-100 minutes before the eruption.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/geyser-activity.htm\">View all geyser predictions</a></p> <p>Like most geysers, Great Fountain Geyser experiences periods of irregularity. For the most part, it is dependable. While waiting for its display, watch for the eruptions of White Dome Geyser.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "bodyText": "<p>A popular performer, Grotto Geyser splashes 15 feet (5 m) from 1.5 hours to a day. The weirdly shaped cone may have resulted from siliceous sinter covering trees. Situated on the bank of the Firehole River, Riverside Geyser is one of the most picturesque and predictable geysers in the park.</p> <p>During its 20-minute eruptions, a 75-foot (23 m) column of water arches gracefully over the river. Eruptions are about six hours apart. Watch for water flowing over the edge of the cone beginning 90-120 minutes before an eruption. Grotto Geyser has an average temperate of 200.1°F (93.4°C), an average pH of 9.1, and an average conductivity of 2300 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",
    "audioDescription": "Grotto Geyser 260 words You are facing Grotto Geyser, a large fountain-type geyser also located in the Upper Geyser Basin. Grotto’s wide multipart cone is so named for its resemblance to a cave-like formation; the cone is 8 feet high at its tallest point with rounded tops on each of its protruding sections. A wayside exhibit entitled “Grotto Geyser” features a large color photo showing a spray of water erupting only a few feet above the top of Grotto’s central cone section. Text below the title reads: “Grotto is perhaps the most unusual of Yellowstone's geysers. Geologists believe that hundreds (or thousands) of years ago, Grotto Geyser emerged in a stand of dead or dying trees and, through time, deposited layer upon layer of siliceous sinter (silica) over the stumps and branches.” Two “Fast Facts” tell us: “Grotto's initial eruption can reach heights of more than 40 feet, but then generally subsides to about 15 feet. “The duration of Grotto's eruption can vary from about 50 minutes to more than 24 hours.” Also on the wayside is a black-and white-woodcut showing Grotto Geyser with two simultaneous eruptions--one towering high into the sky and the other shooting downward toward the ground. The caption reads: “The unusually shaped cone of Grotto Geyser has long captured the imagination of explorers, artists, and visitors. This woodcut illustration was developed for Nathaniel P. Langford's second article on Yellowstone in Schribner's magazine in June, 1871.” A notation in the exhibit’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>The guardhouse, completed in 1891, was one of the first buildings of Fort Yellowstone. It could hold 15 prisoners and 10 guards. Every visitor had to check in at the building after entering the park from Gardiner, Montana. A new guardhouse was built in 1911.</p> <p>The most persistent menace to Yellowstone came from poachers, whose activities threatened to exterminate animals such as bison.</p> <p>Any poachers or tourists caught committing a serious violation were marched to Fort Yellowstone on foot, escorted by mounted soldiers. Their possessions were often left at a different entrance so that the criminal had to travel around the outside of the park to retrieve their belongings.</p> <h2>New Laws</h2> <p>In 1894, soldiers arrested a man named Ed Howell for slaughtering bison in Pelican Valley. The maximum sentence possible was banishment from the park.</p> <p>Emerson Hough, a well-known journalist, was present and wired his report to Forest & Stream, a popular magazine of the time. Its editor, renowned naturalist George Bird Grinnell, helped create a national outcry.</p> <p>Within two months, Congress passed the National Park Protection Act, which increased the Army's authority for protecting park treasures. This law is known as the Lacey Act, and is the first of two laws with this name. Ed Howell was the first person arrested and punished under the new act.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-tour-fort-yellowstone.htm\">Explore the Fort Yellowstone Historic District</a></li> </ul>",
    "audioDescription": "Guardhouse 412 words There are 2 sections in this description. Section 1 (271 words) In front of you is the corner of a wood-sided, building with a front porch and red-tiled roof. It is at the end of a long line of more cream-colored wood-sided homes with porches on a street lined by cottonwood trees. You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled “Guard Duty.” Featured on this exhibit is a large black-and-white photo of several clapboard fort buildings lining one side of a dirt road. Standing beside a small cannon positioned on the porch of the building closest to us is a solitary soldier. The soldier, who appears to be gazing toward us, rests his rifle on his right shoulder. Two small signs attached to one of the building’s thin porch columns read “Fort Yellowstone” and “Registration Office.” A caption below the photo reads: “Guard duty, 1903. Note the bars on the window far right of photograph-the guardhouse was designed to hold fifteen prisoners.” More text on the exhibit tells us: “Protecting Yellowstone's wildlife and natural wonders was the primary aim of the army. An important part of this duty was managing the growing visitation to the park and watching for ‘shady characters.’ “Park roads were once aligned so that the guardhouse controlled traffic into Yellowstone from the north. Here, soldiers contacted each party and entered the name of the driver, passengers, and type of rig into a large ledger. Guns not held at the guardhouse were sealed on the spot. They were checked at each outpost enroute, where soldiers certified on a form that the seal remained intact. Before visitors left the park, the form was scrutinized at an exit station.” Section 2 (126 words) In the exhibit’s bottom left corner is a small black-and-white photo of a wide-eyed man with a thick mustache. His name-George Broadbent-is hand-written in white letters on a sign hung with cord around his neck. Text under the photo reads: \"‘Mug shot’ of George Broadbent, arrested in 1907 in the southwest corner of the park for poaching. It took six days to travel the 127 miles to Fort Yellowstone for trial. George served three days in the guardhouse and paid his fine.” A notation in the exhibit’s bottom left corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.” As you walk south to the next exhibit, the sidewalk is adjacent to a busy road, separated by a narrow strip of grass.

    "audioDescription": "Hayden Valley - Overlook at Yellowstone River1,019 words There are 3 sections in this description.Section 1 (369 words)Three wayside exhibits overlook the rolling Hayden Valley of the Yellowstone River. The first exhibit, entitled \"Hayden Valley,\" features on its left side a large color photo of a winding blue river surrounded by both flat grassland and a slope dotted with thin evergreens and sparse plants. Lying on the slope and facing us in the photo's bottom left corner is a massive bison with thick brown fur; the animal's short curved horns are black. Text below the title reads:\"Where the Buffalo Roam. The American bison (Bison bison) symbolizes the spirit of the West. Few other animals inspire such awe and reverence. Hayden Valley, with its broad expanse of grasses and sedges, has been a home to bison for thousands of years. Nearly driven to extinction in the 1800s by homesteaders, hunters, and the United States government, bison thrive here today. Protected in Yellowstone, they stand as an imposing icon of American conservation.\"A small photo in the panel's top right corner depicts a small light-brown bison--a calf--walking alongside an adult bison more than 4 times its size. Text below this photo reads:\"Rhythms of Life. Bison are born in Hayden Valley. They live and die here. While three seasons are sublime, only the strongest, furriest, and fattest bison can survive a bitter Hayden winter. Instinct guides them every year to decide whether to stay in the valley or migrate to lower elevations in search of food. Bison that migrate will head home to Hayden in spring to begin the cycle anew.\"Below this text is a topographical map with a green area toward the top labeled \"Northern Range\" and a blue area just below center labeled \"Yellowstone Lake.\" Text below this map tells us: \"Though wolves prey upon Hayden Valley bison, their greatest enemy is weather. The bison tread traditional migration routes to seek food during harsh winters. Most of them head toward Yellowstone's west boundary, but a quarter of the adult bison herd migrates north to the Northern Range.\"A notation in the panel's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant to the Yellowstone Park Foundation from the Patrick Family.\" This text also appears on the other two waysides.Section 2 (347 words)The second wayside, entitled \"Rut in Hayden,\" features a large close-up color photo of two shaggy-furred bison locking horns on one side. The bison on the left, his head cocked and nostrils flared, appears to be looking straight at us. Text below the title reads:\"Bison Romance. Grunts, rumbles, and roars vibrate the air. The summer day sizzles with energy as hundreds of bison mill restlessly. It seems chaotic, but there is a reason for the agitation. One of nature's most spectacular reproduction rituals is in motion. Adult bull bison chase after a lone cow, determined to be the one she chooses to mate. Young bison hang around the perimeters, watching and learning. Though it happens every year, the bison rut never ceases to be an extraordinary season in Hayden Valley.\"At the bottom of the panel are three smaller photos arranged from left to right. The first photo shows two bison, one slightly larger than the other, standing side by side. A title to the right of the photo reads: \"This cow is mine.\" Additional text tells us:\"A bull tends a cow by shielding her from other bulls until she allows mating. A challenging bull bellows to get the cow's attention. The tending bull roars back. Sometimes, a brutal battle occurs.\"The middle photo shows a reddish-brown calf lying in low grass. Text to the right of the photo reads:\"Rusty red babies polka-dot the valley in April and May. An adult female bison births a calf every one to two years and nurses it for a year. A baby bull born early in the spring often becomes a larger, more dominant adult.\"The photo on the far right shows two large bison veiled behind a cloud of white dust rising from the ground. The title on the right reads: \"Shake, wallow, roll.\" Additional text instructs us: \"Look for clouds of dust rising in the air. Bison wallow in dusty pits to dislodge biting flies and other insects from their fur. Big bulls might paw the dirt and horn the wallows in displays of aggression.\"Section 3 (281 words)The last wayside exhibit, entitled \"Looks Can Be Deceiving,\" features a large close-up color photo of one shaggy-furred bison standing in yellow grass. Text below the title reads:\"Bison seem lazy and docile grazing in the sun. They are massive and look as if they can hardly move. Do not be fooled. They are wild animals. They can spring to their feet in an instant if they feel threatened. They can leap over fences and run 35 miles per hour. They can hurl you high in the air with one toss of a horn. The bison know where you are, so be aware of their personal space at all times. Do not frighten them or give them a reason to be angry. They are dangerous and unpredictable. People have",

    "audioDescription": "Hayden Valley at Alum Creek<br />255 words<br /><br />You are standing in front of a wayside panel featuring a large color photo of an adult Canada goose floating in the shallow water at a river's edge. The goose is largely brown with a white belly; its long neck and head are black, and there is a patch of white feathers on its cheek. With its neck bent forward, the goose dips its black beak into the water, where it grasps a small plant. Five small furry brown goslings stand on shore while a sixth gosling swims toward the goose. The panel is entitled \"River Feast.\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"This bend in the river attracts water birds year-round. Here the Yellowstone is broad, slow-moving, and shallow-a place where trout and aquatic vegetation can thrive. Bald eagles, pelicans, and osprey catch fish here; mallards and Canada geese bob for underwater plants.<br /><br />\"The birds are extremely sensitive to human disturbance. Except for two short stretches open to catch-and-release fishing, the Yellowstone River is closed to fishermen throughout Hayden Valley.\"<br /><br />To the right of this text is a smaller color photo of a large white bird standing alongside the water. The bird has a thick black bill and black webbed feet. The caption reads:<br /><br />\"In winter, watch for trumpeter swans along this ice-free section. Thermal discharge warms the river enough to keep it open all year.\"<br /><br />The Yellowstone River is located beyond this panel, and a few feet in front of you. <br />A thick evergreen forest stands in the distance. <br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>Heart Spring was named by park geologist George Marler around 1959, apparently because its shape resembles a human heart. It is 7-1/2 feet (2.3 m) by 10 feet (3 m) at the surface and 15 feet (1.5 m) deep. Heart Spring is a deep, clear, blue pool with colorful orange and yellow thermophiles in the outwash channel. Hard sinter lines the edge of the pool just at the ground surface.</p> <p>Heart Spring has an average temperate of 184.8°F (84.9°C), an average pH of 8.6, and an average conductivity of 2021 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

Before venturing into Yellowstone’s winter wonderland, make sure you have properly planned and are prepared for the challenges brought on by extreme cold and deep snow.</p> <ul> <li>Let friends or family know your itinerary.</li> <li>Do not travel alone.</li> <li>Evaluate your party’s and equipment's capabilities.</li> <li>Be prepared to make repairs.</li> <li>Carry and drink plenty of water, and bring high energy food.</li> <li>Be prepared to set up an emergency shelter.</li> <li>Bring a first-aid kit, space blanket, extra clothing, and headlamp.</li> <li>Carry and know how to use a map and compass.</li> <li>Use sunglasses or ski goggles and sunscreen.</li> </ul> <p><b>Clothing and Gear</b></p> <p>Even in severe winter temperatures, you can be comfortable and safe if you dress properly to prevent chilling and overheating. Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</p> <ul> <li>Windproof, hooded outer layer</li> <li>Wool or other insulated garments underneath</li> <li>Wool or synthetic trousers</li> <li>Wool or synthetic long underwear</li> <li>Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</li> <li>Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</li> <li>Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</li> </ul> <p>Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</p> <p>Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</p> <h2>Winter Hazards</h2> <p>Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</p> <p>Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</p> <ul> <li>Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</li> <li>Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</li> <li>Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Stay dry and learn how to recognize the signs of hypothermia and frostbite—they can set in quickly.</li> <li>Bears may be active at any time of year—be alert for signs of bear activity.</li> </ul> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <ul> <li>Do not walk on snowshoe or ski trails.</li> <li>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</li> <li>Yield to faster skiers or those going downhill.</li> <li>Detour around wildlife—never approach.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails and boardwalks.</li> <li>Keep children close at hand.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</li> <li>Keep your food secure—never feed wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Snowmobile Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>All snowmobilers must be led by a guide authorized by the National Park Service (NPS) to operate in Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>All snowmobiles must meet NPS sound and emission requirements.</li> <li>Snowmobile operators must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license in possession. Learner permits are not sufficient.</li> <li>Roads are open only 7 am to 9 pm. Snowmobiles are not allowed to operate in the park between 9 pm and 7 am.</li> <li>Maximum speed limit is 35 mph for snowmobiles, 25 mph for snowcoaches, or less where posted or as conditions warrant.</li> <li>Use hand signals when turning or stopping.</li> <li>Allow enough distance between snowmobiles when traveling.</li> <li>Pass only when safe.</li> <li>If you turn around, stay within the road width.</li> <li>Drive in single file, on the right side of the road even if the road is rough.</li> <li>When stopping, pull to the far right and park in single file.</li> <li>Do not idle your machine more than three minutes.</li> <li>Stay on designated roads. Side-hilling, berm-riding, or any off-road travel is prohibited and carries a fine of up to $5,000.</li> <li>Report accidents to a ranger.</li> <li>Operating a snowmobile while intoxicated is illegal. Possession of open alcoholic beverage containers, including bota bags, is illegal.</li> </ul> <p><b>Wild animals have the right of way.</b> If bison or other wildlife are on the road, stop at least 25 yards away (100 yards for wolves or bears). Pull your machine as far as possible to the opposite side of the road and give them a chance to move off the road.</p>",

Standing beside the lake is a large wayside exhibit in a wooden kiosk. The structure has a stone base, and it is shaded by a shingled gable roof. Two panels are placed side by side in the kiosk. The panel on the left is entitled \"Backbone of a Continent\" and features two color maps, one above the other. Text below the title fills a large orange area representing Canada found at the top of the first map. It reads:\"The Continental Divide is marked by simple roadside signs merely hinting at the enormity of the boundary they represent. This imaginary line winds its way through the mountains from Alaska to Mexico, separating the waters that flow into the Pacific Ocean from those that flow into the Atlantic Ocean.\"Today we look forward to the meandering drive and ultimate arrival at the summit of the divide. But what about the continent's early travelers? This tangled, beautiful stretch of mountains rose up before them, posing an immense challenge that required days or even weeks of travel.\"Below Canada and in the center of the map is the United States, colored pale green. Near the northern border in the western United States is Yellowstone National Park, located just east of the Rocky Mountains. An arrow points to Isa Lake, situated in the Rockies alongside a river, represented by a thin blue line winding west toward the Pacific Ocean and southeast to the Gulf of Mexico, both also blue. The stretch of river to the west of Isa Lake is labeled \"Isa Lake, east drainage flowing west \"; the river to the east is labeled \"Isa Lake, west drainage flowing east.\"The mountains of the Rockies continue north through Canada and also south into Mexico--orange like Canada--where they are then labeled \"Sierra Madres.\" Also represented in blue are the five Great Lakes located to the east on the U.S.-Canadian border.Section 2 (181 words)The second, and smaller, world map shows the continents and oceans, labeled from west to east: Pacific Ocean, North America and South America, North Atlantic Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Africa, Europe, Indian Ocean, Asia, Australia, and again, the Pacific Ocean. The Arctic Ocean is labeled at the top of the map; the Southern Ocean is labeled above Antarctica at the map's bottom edge.A key on the map's left side shows a small yellow box representing \"The Great Divide,\" a white box representing \"Major continental divides,\" and a pale gray box representing \"Endorheic Basins.\" Thin yellow and/or white lines snake through all continents but Antarctica; gray areas indicating endorheic basins appear on nearly all the continents as well. A title above the map reads: \"A World Divided.\" Text below the title tells us: \"Every continent except Antarctica has a continental divide, and a few have more than one. While water from these divides normally flows to an ocean, it sometimes becomes trapped in a basin where it can only escape through evaporation or seepage. These areas are known as endorheic basins.\"Section 3 (101 words) The left-hand panel on the wayside exhibit is entitled \"Big Deal for a Little Lake.\" Text below the title tells us:\"Other than the brief summer months spent carpeted by beautiful yellow pond lilies, this sliver of water seems rather insignificant. Looks can be deceiving!\"As spring runoff empties into Isa Lake, the water swells and overflows its tiny borders. When this happens, the lake does something extraordinary. Not only does it empty into two oceans, but it does so backwards. The east drainage flows into the Pacific, while the west drainage makes the long trek to the Gulf of Mexico.\"Section 4 (277 words)A pictorial map to the right of the text shows long and skinny Isa Lake flanked by a forest of green evergreens on both sides. The light blue lake runs diagonally across the map with the Continental Divide, represented by a dashed yellow line, crossing in its center. The gray road running alongside the lake also crosses at this central point. Above the yellow Continental Divide line and near the top end of the lake, a red dot labeled \"You are here\" indicates your position beside a paved area that loops off the main road. There are two gray arrows leading off both ends of the lake; the arrow curling upward at the bottom is labeled \"west drainage,\" and the arrow looping downward at the top of the lake is labeled \"east drainage.\"A second map below and to the right shows Yellowstone National Park in the northwestern corner of Wyoming with Montana to the north and Idaho to the west. A key on the map's left side shows a small blue box representing \"Isa Lake drainages,\" a yellow box representing the \"Continental Divide,\" and a red bo",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Lamar Buffalo Ranch occupies a significant place in the history of American wildlife conservation and management. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>The extermination of bison throughout the west in the 1800s nearly eliminated them from Yellowstone. Even after the park was established in 1872, poachers faced few deterrents. With only 25 bison counted in the park in 1901, Congress appropriated $15,000 to augment the herd by purchasing 21 bison from private owners. As part of the first effort to preserve a wild species through intensive management, these bison were fed and bred in Lamar Valley at what became known as the Lamar Buffalo Ranch.</p> <p>As the herd grew in size, bison were released to breed with the park’s free-roaming population. Bison from the ranch were also used to start and supplement herds on other public and tribal land. Today the Yellowstone bison population numbers in the thousands. It’s one the largest populations in North America and among the few that is genetically pure because it has not been interbred with cattle.</p> <p>A program to raise bison like domestic cattle in Yellowstone may seem incongruous and unnecessary in retrospect, but the buffalo ranch stands as a reminder that today’s well-intended wildlife management policies may have unintended consequences and be overturned by changing values and advances in ecological knowledge.</p> <p>As listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Lamar Buffalo Ranch Historic District includes five buildings: a ranger station, constructed in 1915 as the buffalo keeper’s residence; a pole fenced corral built and rebuilt from 1915 to the 1930s; a log barn for hay and horses (1927); a bunkhouse (1929); and a residence used for the assistant buffalo keeper that was moved to the ranch in 1938 from Soda Butte (where it had probably been a ranger station). The vegetation around the ranch is mostly sagebrush and nonnative grasses that were planted during the period of hay cultivation. Remnants of irrigation ditches, fencing, and water troughs remain throughout the ranch.</p> <h2>Education & Sustainability</h2> <p>Today <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/expeditionyell.htm\">Expedition Yellowstone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.yellowstone.org/\">Yellowstone Forever Institute</a> use the Lamar Buffalo Ranch as a base camp for educational field classes and seminars. In keeping with its rustic character, the Lamar Buffalo Ranch remains off-the-grid. Thanks to partnerships with <a href=\"https://www.yellowstone.org/\">Yellowstone Forever</a>, Sharp, and Toyota, a 44 kw photovoltaic array provides power to the ranch. The solar panels are tucked out of site so as not to affect Lamar Valley’s panoramic views. As a pilot project, Toyota provided 208 used hybrid car batteries to store power on site. It's hoped this technology will provide a new alternative for delivering power to remote locations throughout the world.</p> <p>These partnerships enable the National Park Service to use the buffalo ranch as a model for environmental stewardship. Future plans call improving the energy efficiency of the historic buildings with things like low-flow water fixtures, on-demand hot water, and more energy-efficient windows (all while preserving the integrity of the original structures). Eventually, we hope to remove all propane appliances so the ranch can operate entirely free of fossil fuels.</p> <h2>The Future of Bison Management</h2> <p>The protection and recovery of bison in Yellowstone is one of the great triumphs of American conservation. Efforts centered at the Lamar Buffalo Ranch succeeded in bringing this species back from the brink of extinction. Today we face the challenge of maintaining a wild, migratory population of bison in a modern landscape.

    "audioDescription": "Lamar River Bridge<br />301 words<br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit located alongside a road at one end of a paved two-lane bridge. The wayside is entitled \"Not for the Faint of Heart\" and features a large black-and-white photo of a timber bridge spanning a narrow river. The railings on either side of the bridge and the pillars, or piers, supporting it from below are also constructed from wood timbers. A caption below the photo reads: \"First Lamar River Bridge 1897 to 1918.\" Text below the title tells us:<br />\"Before paved roads and sturdy bridges were constructed, a journey through the park was filled with thrills and frustrations. Imagine traveling in a bouncing, swaying stagecoach or hand-cranked auto over narrow dirt roads with blind curves, steep drop-offs and no bridges. When it rained, you would have been stuck up to the axle in deep ruts on slick, muddy roads. And when it was dry, you would have choked on dust that clogged eyes and nose and coated you from head to toe.\"<br /><br />A smaller black-and-white photo located in the panel's bottom left corner shows a bridge with square stone support piers and metal railings, perhaps of iron or steel. A caption identifies this as \"Second Lamar River Bridge 1920 to 1939.\"<br /><br />A small color photo in the panel's bottom right corner depicts the concrete bridge as \"Third Lamar River Bridge 1940 to 2012.\"<br /><br />Above this photo are two more small black-and-white photos. The top photo, captioned \"Stagecoach fording the Lamar River,\" shows four horses pulling a covered stagecoach through water as high as their bellies. The next photo shows an early 20th-century vehicle tilted slightly to one side at the end of a muddy road marked with numerous deep ruts.

    "audioDescription": "Lamar Valley - Predators and Prey<br />640 words<br />There are 3 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (276 words)<br />You are facing the first of two wayside exhibits standing in front of a low timber fence overlooking Lamar Valley. This wayside is entitled \"Food for the Masses.\" Featured on the panel is a large painting depicting two wolves and three birds of different sizes gathering around a downed elk. A tall bear watches from afar. Text below the title reads:<br /><br />\"Share and share alike? Not exactly...though hard won and not easily surrendered, a wolf-kill provides food for numerous species. Some arrive almost as the prey falls. Others are content to wait their turn rather than risk confrontation. The wolves simply eat as much as they can as fast as they can while a community of scavengers assembles.<br /><br />\"The leftovers are well used. Nutrients leach into the soil, increasing the fertility of this grassy valley. Even antlers are gradually consumed by rodents who gnaw on the calcium-rich bone.\"<br /><br />Four dark insects-two with wings and two without- are pictured in the painting's upper right corner. More text tells us:<br /><br />\"The arrival of invertebrates transforms the wolf-kill into its own ecosystem. Some insects consume the remains, while others feast on the fly eggs and larvae that have colonized the carcass.\"<br /><br />Painted in the panel's bottom right corner are a \"common raven (Corvus corax)\" and a<br />\"grizzly bear (Ursus arctos).\" Text below the raven reads:<br /><br />\"Smarter than your average bird! Ravens follow wolf packs knowing that this will eventually provide a meal. Dozens arrive at a wolf-kill within minutes.\"<br /><br />Text below the grizzly bear tells us:<br /><br />\"Wolves and grizzlies frequently collide at wolf-kills. Unwilling to pass up an easy meal, grizzlies have little trouble taking over the carcass.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (170 words) <br />The second wayside is entitled \"A Range of Complexities.\" A painting in the panel's center depicts two large brown bison and one small calf standing in low prairie grass. Text in the panel's top left corner tells us:<br /><br />\"The only constant is change. Sometimes called â€˜America's Serengeti,' Yellowstone's northern range has been at the heart of decades of discussion about resource preservation. Early management focused on artificially altering the landscape. Predators were removed to facilitate larger herds of hooved animals. Herd sizes grew quickly as a result. Believing the range was overgrazed, the National Park Service acted the part of predator by reducing the size of those herds. Live animals were trapped and shipped to reserves across North America. Thousands were killed in the park to limit population size and reduce disease. Public outcry halted these control actions in the 1960s.<br /><br />\"The policy of natural regulation was then adopted. Predation, winter mortality, and other ecological processes-along with science-based management when needed-<br />would now regulate wildlife populations within park boundaries.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (172 words)<br /><br />To the right of this text is a map painting showing \"Yellowstone National Park\" in yellow and \"Yellowstone's northern range\" in green. <br /><br />Painted in the panel's bottom left corner is a single elk with large antlers. Painted to the right is a group of various grazing animals. More text reads:<br /><br />\"Spreading the Wealth. Once thought to be damaging grasslands on the northern range, hooved animals actually enhance grassy vegetation growth. As ungulate herds drift across the range, their hooves stimulate the soil, and their waste quickly cycles nutrients back into the ecosystem.\"<br /><br />Painted in the panel's bottom right corner are a \"North American Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana)\" and a \"Coyote (Canis latrans).\" Text below the pronghorn tells us:<br /><br />\"Pronghorn are the fastest land mammal in North America. Their oversized windpipe, heart and lungs allow them to sustain sprints of up to 50 miles per hour.\"<br /><br />Text below the coyote reads:<br /><br />\"Coyote have adapted to numerous changes in the past and always find a way to thrive. They are one of Yellowstone's great adapters!\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

Text below the title reads:<br /><br />\"The reintroduction of wolves brought change to an ecosystem that evolved without them for almost 70 years. Although wolves do not directly affect all life around them, their effects possibly tumble down the entire food chain. This hypothesis is called a trophic cascade.<br /><br />\"As predators disappeared from the landscape decades ago, the park's elk population swelled. Unnaturally large herds were more likely to suffer from poor nutrition, and included many old, weak animals. Wolves and other restored predators preyed on the most vulnerable animals and quickly became a factor in creating smaller, stronger herds.<br /><br />\"Elk now linger far less along streams where they once browsed heavily. Willows, aspens, and cottonwoods are growing taller, providing habitat for a multitude of species at streamside areas.\"<br /><br />More text in the panel's bottom left corner tells us:<br /><br />\"Taller willows allow for greater diversity of bird species. Birds nest and forage at different heights, making it possible for many species to coexist.\"<br /><br />Additional text near a beaver dam spanning the water in the painting's center reads: <br /><br />\"Beaver recolonizing the northern range feed almost exclusively on willow.

This wayside is entitled \"Watching the Wildlife.\" Text below the title tells us:<br />\"Yellowstone's northern range offers visitors the unique opportunity to observe one of the most diverse populations of free-roaming large animals in North America. Along with this opportunity comes the responsibility of respecting the animals and their habitat. By not disturbing wildlife, we are able to experience them â€˜being wild.'\"<br /><br />Below this text are color drawings of a brown bison and a pair of binoculars. More text tells us:<br /><br />\"View wildlife responsibly. Use binoculars or a telephoto lens to watch Yellowstone's wildlife. Keeping your distance allows you to observe an animal's normal behavior.<br /><br />\"If you see wildlife while driving, find the next pullout, park safely, and watch from inside your vehicle or from a safe distance.<br /><br />\"Do not stop or block any portion of a roadway while viewing wildlife.\"<br /><br />A subtitle \"Maintain your distance\" is followed by more text, including 4 sentences highlighted with bullet points:<br /><br />\"Stay at least 100 yards (91 meters) away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards (23 meters) away from all other wild animals. <br /><br />\"If an animal moves within that range, you must move to maintain the appropriate distance.<br /><br />\"Do not surround or crowd an animal.<br /><br />\"If other visitors put you or wildlife in danger, leave the scene and notify a park ranger.<br /><br /><br />\"Animals are dangerous. Never feed or approach.\"<br /><br /><br />Section 2 (208 words)<br /><br />On the panel's right side are two more color drawings showing a black-and-white bird labeled \"magpie\" and a small brown mammal, or \"Uinta ground squirrel.\" Text beside these drawings reads:<br /><br />\"Never feed wildlife, including small mammals and birds. Human food is unhealthy for them. Feeding wildlife can make them lose their natural fear of humans. This behavior may ultimately lead to the death of the animal.\"<br /><br />Below this text is an information box entitled \"Prohibited activities within Yellowstone.\" Three activities are highlighted with bullet points:<br /><br />\"Remaining near or approaching wildlife within any distance that disturbs them. If you cause an animal to alter its behavior then you are too close.<br /><br />\"Viewing wildlife with lights (spotlighting).<br /><br />\"Imitating wildlife calls.\"<br /><br />Along the panel's bottom edge are other small drawings showing, on the far left, a park visitor peering into a camera's long lens and, on the far right, a wolf and a bear. An elk and a bison are pictured just left of the panel's center. A dotted line and arrow running from the visitor to the elk and bison is labeled \"Minimum viewing distance: 25 yards/23 meters;\" a dotted line and arrow running from the visitor to the wolf and bear is labeled \"Minimum viewing distance: 100 yards/91 meters.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (299 words)<br /><br />The title of the second wayside exhibit is split into two parts, with the partial title \"Stop, look\" followed by ellipses in the panel's top left corner and the remaining \"and listen\" located at the bottom of the panel. The exhibit features large color drawings of three animals-a \"Gray Wolf (Canis lupus);\" a \"Coyote (Canis latrans);\" and a \"Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes).\" <br /><br />The \"Height at shoulder\" is noted for each animal, with the wolf's measurement being the tallest at 26 to 36 inches (66 to 91 centimeters). The grayish-brown coyote's shoulder height measures 16 to 20 inches (41 to 51 centimeters), and the smaller red fox measures 14 to 20 inches (36 to 51 centimeters). Text accompanying an arrow pointing to the fox's long bushy tail reads: \"Field note: ALWAYS a white tip on the red fox tail!\"<br /><br />In the panel's upper right corner are drawings of the three animal's paw prints; each has four toes with claw marks above the foot pad. The smallest foot pad-that of the fox-is thin and chevron-shaped, while the other animals' foot pads are larger with rounded lobes. Notations beside each print tells us that the Gray Wolf's foot measures 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) long and the coyote and red fox's prints measure 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) and 2 Â½ inches (6.4 centimeters) respectively.<br /><br />Below the paw prints are three color photos, one each of a lone red fox walking through snow, a howling gray-brown coyote, and a pack of several howling gray wolves. <br /><br />Finally, text below the \"and listen\" portion of the title tells us: <br /><br />\"Yellowstone's canids have very distinct sounds. Wolves and coyotes both howl, but coyotes' howls are higher pitched and usually include yips and yelps. Foxes bark, and generally leave the howling to their larger cousins.\"<br /><br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

Text to the left of the photo reads:<br />\"Each year, the breeding female makes one of the most important decisions for the pack-she selects the denning site. The den acts like the hub of a wheel during the summer, as the pack spreads out from it like spokes. If she does not choose wisely, the pups may not survive.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (258 words)<br />The second wayside is entitled \"Life Begins Underground.\" Featured on this panel are two large color photos-one of a wolf peering down into a den flanked by fallen trees, the other showing several wolves milling about in a grassy field. Text superimposed over the first photo tells us:<br /><br />\"In early spring the focus of the entire pack revolves around one thing: the den. Inside its dark confines, helpless newborn pups curl up against their ever-present mother and alternate between sleeping and nursing.<br /><br />\"Around two weeks of age, the pups anxiously approach the entrance of the den. As they emerge, the pups are immediately greeted by nearby adults. Lifelong emotional bonds are formed with the pack at this moment.\"<br /><br />Text below the photo of the wolf pack reads:<br /><br />\"Stepping Out. Development continues at a rendezvous site. Here, adults alternate between hunting and watching over the pups. Hungry pups swarm adults returning from the hunt, and are rewarded with a meal, reinforcing the pack's bonds. As fall turns to winter the pups begin to grow to adulthood, and take up the arduous task of simply being a wolf.\"<br /><br />A smaller color photo in the panel's bottom left corner depicts one adult wolf surrounded by several pups. Text to the right of the photo tells us:<br /><br />\"As the pups grow, play becomes an important part of their development. They stalk, ambush, and chew on patient pack members. These mock battles develop the pups' strength and coordination. They also separate the leaders from the followers, and possibly establish the future alphas.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Lamar Valley at Crystal Creek<br />771 words<br />There are 4 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (250 words)<br />You are standing in front of the first of two wayside exhibits located near Crystal Creek. This wayside is entitled \"A History of Persecution.\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"As the wave of settlers swept across the Western United States in the 1800s, little room was left for the wolf. With their prey decimated by market hunters and the United States Army, some wolves were forced to dine on the most abundant prey left: domestic livestock. All-out war on wolves began.<br /><br />\"By the mid-1900s, wolves resided in only five percent of their original range. They had been one of North America's most abundant predators, but only a few hundred remained.<br /><br />\"Wolves were not safe within Yellowstone National Park. Park managers at the time saw them as a threat to elk and other hooved animals. Like their brethren outside the park, they were hunted. The National Park Service killed the last known Yellowstone wolf in 1926.\"<br /><br />Featured on the panel is a large map drawing of the United States. Most of the country-in all but parts of the southeast- is colored solid orange. According to the map key, this orange area represents \"Gray wolf range in the 48 contiguous states before European Settlement.\" There is also one small orange and yellow striped section due west of Lake Superior, about a third the size of the lake itself. This represents \"Gray wolf range at time of listing under the Endangered Species Act (1974).\" Yellowstone National Park is marked in green.<br /><br />Section 2 (153 words)<br /><br />In the panel's bottom left corner are three black-and-white photos. In one photo a uniformed man carries a newly killed wolf over one shoulder; in another photo, a man stands holding a dead wolf upright on the ground. In the third photo, a man stands in front of a rows of wolf pelts nailed to boards. The caption reads: \"Hunters with wolf carcasses and pelts.\"<br /><br /><br />On the panel's right side is a large close-up photo of a dark gray wolf with yellow eyes appearing to stare right at us. Below the photo, to the right of a triangular hazard symbol, more text tells us:<br />\"The war against the wolf was fought with more than bullets and traps. Strychnine and cyanide were used to lace carcasses, indiscriminately killing countless mammals and birds. Sarcoptic mange was intentionally introduced into the Northern Rockies by state wildlife veterinarians in 1909 in an attempt to control carnivore populations.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (161 words)<br /><br />The second wayside exhibit is entitled \"Return of the Native.\" Text below the title reads:<br /><br />\"They were once among the most abundant predators in North America, perhaps numbering two million. Yet in the span of two centuries, gray wolves were wiped from over 95% of their range in the contiguous states. Possibly only hundreds remained. By 1926, when the National Park Service ended its predator control efforts, no gray wolf packs were left in Yellowstone National Park.<br /><br />\"In the 1960's Yellowstone adopted a new policy to allow ecological processes, such as predation, to influence wildlife populations. Many felt this form of natural regulation was impossible without the restoration of the wolf. This idea because a reality between 1995 and 1997, when 31 wolves from Canada, and 10 from Northwest Montana, were released in Yellowstone National Park. The wolf had finally come home. In the years since, their descendants have shown the great ability of wolves to succeed when given a chance.\"<br /><br />Section 4 (184 words)<br /><br />A photo in the panel's top left corner shows two people carrying a large crate with a square door pierced with evenly spaced holes. A caption below the photo reads:<br /><br />\"United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbit and Director of the United States Fish & Wildlife Service Mollie Beattie help carry the first reintroduced wolf to its relocation pen on January 12th, 1995.\"<br /><br /><br />A large color photo in the panel's center depicts a gray wolf standing in profile alongside a wire mesh fence; a wide black collar circles the animal's sturdy neck. In the panel's bottom left corner, handwritten text accompanied with an arrow pointing to the color reads:<br /><br />\"Why the collar? Collars are an essential tool for continued study by Yellowstone scientists. The park offers a unique opportunity to study many aspects of wolves' lives, from distribution and prediction, to reproduction and mortality.\"<br /><br /><br />One final color photo in the panel's bottom right corner shows several bystanders facing a truck parked near a large square-topped arch. The caption reads:<br /><br />\"Bringing reintroduced wolves into Yellowstone through the Roosevelt Arch at the park's north entrance.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "LeHardys Rapids<br />341 words <br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit overlooking the LeHardys Rapids, which is a cascade on the Yellowstone River. The wayside is entitled \"Leaping the Rapids.\" Text below this title reads: <br />\"In June and July these rapids fill with cutthroat trout heading upstream to spawn near the lake outlet. Spawning is a life-and-death event; here at LeHardys Rapids you can witness the fierce energy it takes for the species to survive. Watch pools at the base of the rapids. A fish jumps every ten to fifteen seconds during peak spawning season in July.<br />\"Crowded with leaping fish, this stretch of river hints at what America's primitive fisheries must have been like.\"<br />To the right of this text is a color photo of a single trout with its body rotated slightly, leaping upstream over a waterfall of rushing whitewater. A caption to the left of this photo reads:<br />\"To vault rocky ledges, a mature cutthroat cocks its body, then explodes three to four feet into the air--a height up to five times its length.\"<br />A black-and-white drawing spanning the bottom of the panel shows two trout swimming underwater as they approach the shallow rapids. Four arrows--three curling upward and one pointing below the first fish--indicate the motion of water after it descends the falls. A caption above this drawing tells us: <br />\"The force of backwash beneath the falls helps propel fish up and over. At steep ledges many trout appear to fail, but with repeated jumping most of them make it upstream. Far more fish are making the spawning run unseen underwater.\"<br />A wood boardwalk gives you access to the whitewater rapids, which span the entire width of the river. The surface of the boardwalk, which is about 5 feet wide with railings on both sides, alternates between flat and sloping sections as it winds several yards down toward the river. There is a long wood bench placed along the left railing a few feet before your reach a viewing platform beside the rapids.<br />END OF MESSAGE",

Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "bodyText": "<p>Liberty Cap is 37 feet (11 m) tall. It was created by a hot spring that was active in one location for a long time. Its internal pressure was sufficient to raise the water to a great height, allowing mineral deposits to build slowly and continuously for perhaps hundreds of years.</p> <p>Liberty Cap was named in 1871 by the Hayden Survey because it resembled the peaked knit caps symbolizing freedom and liberty during the French Revolution.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Lion Geyser actually has a series of eruptions within a single eruption cycle.</p> <p>Little Cub Geyser was the most frequent erupter of the group, and comes out of the cone on the southern side of the mound. Since 2004, however, the frequency has increased in variety, from anywhere from every hour up to nearly two days later.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the center of the group are Lioness Geyser and Big Cub Geyser. Both rarely erupt, but when they do, they reach up to 50 feet (46 m) into the air. Goggles Spring, North Goggles Geyser (no eruptions since 2004), and the unofficially named \"Kitten Geyser\" round out the major thermal features of the Lion Geyser Complex.</p> <p>Lion Geyser Complex has an average temperate of 197.1°F (91.7°C), an average pH of 8.8, and an average conductivity of 1979.33 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape.

    "bodyText": "<p>Forests cover roughly 80% of Yellowstone and lodgepole pine comprises nearly all of that canopy.</p> <p>Some American Indian tribes used this tree to make the frames of their tipis or lodges, hence the name “lodgepole” pine. The log walls of the Old Faithful Inn are made with lodgepole pine.</p> <p>The volcanic rocks beneath much of Yellowstone form nutrient-poor soils. These areas generally have extensive stands of lodgepole pine, which are drought tolerant and have shallow roots that take advantage of the nutrients in the soil.</p> <p>Lodgepoles are the only pine in Yellowstone whose needles grow in groups of two. They can be up to 75 feet tall. Lodgepole pine trees have very thin bark and can be killed by ground fires.</p> <h2>Fire Rejuvenates Forests</h2> <p>Wildland fire is an integral, dynamic process. Fires rejuvenate forests on a grand scale. Some species of plants survive the intense burning to re-sprout. Some cones of lodgepole pines pop open only in heat generated by fires, spreading millions of seeds on the forest floor.</p> <p>After fire sweeps through an area, mammals, birds, and insects quickly take advantage of the newly created habitats. Fires recycle and release nutrients and create dead trees or snags that serve a number of ecological functions, such as the addition of organic matter to the soil when the trees decompose.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Lodgepole Pines <br />551 words<br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (199 words)<br /><br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit located alongside a forest. The wayside, entitled \"Life at the Blowdown: A Flourishing Forest,\" features a large color photo showing many fallen or uprooted trees lying on ashy ground. A caption on the left side of the photo reads: \"The blowdown, after burning in the Fires of '88 (background photo).\"<br /><br />More text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"Peering into the forest today, you may see signs of raging storms. Ravaged by wind and later by the Fires of '88, the forest here looked devastated. But lodgepole pines are well suited to Yellowstone's harsh climate and volcanic soils. The evidence grows each year.\"<br /><br />To the right of the text is a color drawing of two thin lodgepole pine branches, each holding a single cone. One pine cone is longer than the other, with scales that are tightly sealed and greenish in color. A caption reads: <br /><br />\"Many lodgepole cones are serotinous-tightly sealed by sticky resin.\"<br /><br />The scales of the second and more-rounded cone are brown and slightly spread apart. A caption tells us:<br /><br />\"Fire melted the sticky resin in this serotinous lodgepole cone, allowing it to open and spread abundant seeds.\"<br /><br /><br />Section 2 (334 words)<br /><br /><br />On the panel's right side are four smaller color photos arranged one above the other. The top two photos are entitled \"Beneath Stormy Skies.\" The first photo is labeled \"1984\" and shows an aerial view of a deep green forest with one wide lighter green area in its center. A caption below the photo reads:<br /> <br />\"A violent wind shear uprooted and toppled thousands of trees here. Seedlings emerged the following spring.\"<br /><br />The next photo is labeled \"1988\" and depicts a charred and smoky landscape where only a few branchless tree trunks remain standing. A caption tells us:<br /><br />\"Four years later, the Fires of '88 roared through Yellowstone, more fierce and uncontrollable than the wind that drove them. When fire reached the blowdown, flames rapidly engulfed tinder-dry logs-and opened cones to release millions of seeds.\"<br /><br />The bottom two photos are entitled \"Seeds of Renewal.\" The first photo, labeled \"1989,\"<br />shows a handful of visitors walking down a boardwalk trail that passes through a charred landscape. To the left of this photo is another smaller photo offering a close-up view of several red berries hanging from a vine. A caption below the photos reads:<br /><br />\"Lodgepole seedlings, strawberries, and grouse whortleberry emerged the following spring.\"<br /><br />The second photo, labeled \"1998,\" shows the same area but now with small green lodgepoles growing among the downed tree trunks. A caption tells us:<br /><br />\"By 1998, ten-year-old saplings had already grown several feet high.\"<br /><br />One final color photo in the panel's bottom left corner shows a forest of lodgepole pines, their thick branches blanketed with snow. Below the photo is the title \"Lodgepole Life Cycle,\" followed by text that reads:<br /><br /><br />\"Born in the Fires of '88, the lodgepole pines here are thriving in ash-enriched soil. With serotinous cones on their branches, the trees are prepared for a fiery day in the future-<br />and will then bear a new generation.\"<br /><br />A notation in the panel's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Lower Terraces - Palette Spring 587 words There are 2 sections in this description. Section 1 (418 words) You are now part way up the Mammoth Hot Springs Terraces hillside, overlooking Palette Spring. The panel features a large color topographical map of a vast landscape encompassing travertine terraces and hot springs. On the map’s right side, a white dot accompanied with the words “You Are Here” indicates your position overlooking Palette Spring. Palette Spring is located southwest of Hymen Terrace and due west of Liberty Cap. Cleopatra, Minerva, Mound, Main, and Jupiter Terraces are all located to the south, in the center or left side of the map. Opal Terrace lies to the southeast, at the bottom of the map. Also labeled in the pale and largely non-forested terraces in the map’s foreground are Overlook above, or to the west of, Mound Terrace and Canary Spring to the south of Main Terrace. “Bunsen Peak,” “Terrace Mountain,” and “Clagett Butte” are labeled from left to right at the top of the map. The trail to the left, or south, of this Palette Spring overlook is represented by a dashed red line, indicating “wheelchair accessible boardwalk or trail.” The trail to the right, or north, is represented by a dashed yellow line, indicating “boardwalk or trail with steep grades or stairs.” Although other trail sections winding throughout the terraces are represented with a dashed red line, the majority of the trails are yellow. Four trailheads are marked with a “self-guiding trail” icon, including three trailheads at the bottom of the hill, and one trailhead at the top. On the far right side of the map, northwest of Hymen Terrace, the hiking trail is marked “Beaver Ponds Trail: five-mile loop” with an arrow pointing north, or away from the terraces. Pictured at the bottom of the map, and located to your east, is a road that runs south, curving west to Upper Terrace Loop Drive, or north, curving east to the visitor center. There are three restrooms: one is located just north of the terraces, its photograph pictured on the map. Restrooms can also be found in the Albright Visitor Center in Mammoth. Both of these restrooms are wheelchair accessible. The third restroom is an outhouse located in the parking lot near the entrance to the Upper Terrace Loop Drive. There are also five parking areas located throughout the site—four along the road to your east and one alongside Upper Terrace Drive. Wheelchair icons appear at three of the parking areas along the road to your east, alongside the origin of the three trails leading into the terraces. Section 2 (151 words) Below the map, in the panel’s bottom left corner, is a small color photo showing a wide fissure in cracked earth. The photo is captioned “Fragile Ground.” More text tells us: “The ground is fragile. For your safety, stay on the boardwalk or paved trail.” To the right of the photo is a subtitle “Stay Safe and Protect Resources” followed by these five instructions highlighted with bullet points: “Hot springs can burn you! Please do not touch the water. “Stay on the boardwalk or paved trails at all times. The ground is fragile, and hot water may be hidden below. “Expect steep grades and stairs. “Do not smoke, litter, or takes pets on trails. “Hot spring vents can easily become clogged. To protect them, never throw anything into the springs.” A notation in the panel’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Lower Terraces - South Parking Lot 725 words There are 4 sections in this description. Section 1 (106 words) You are standing in front of a wayside panel entitled “A Changing Landscape: Mammoth Hot Springs Terraces.” Text below the title reads: “Scattered across this unusual landscape are hot springs--hot springs that are reshaping the mountain. Water, heated deep underground, rises to the surface. As it rises, the water percolates through buried limestone, dissolving calcium carbonate. Above ground, the hot spring water deposits the calcium carbonate, building travertine terraces. “If you were here in the past, you may notice many changes. The terrain you see today will likely look different in the future. In this rapidly changing landscape, you can glimpse a moment in time.” Section 2 (240 words) The panel features a large color topographical map of a vast landscape with “Bunsen Peak,” “Terrace Mountain,” and “Clagett Butte” labeled from left to right at the top of the map and various terraces and springs located in the pale and largely non-forested basin in the map’s foreground. A white dot accompanied with the words “You Are Here” indicates your position in a parking area at the bottom of the map to the left, or south, of center; this parking area lies alongside Upper Terrace Drive, which leads into the basin from the south. Other labeled features include Liberty Cap, Hymen Terrace and Palette Spring to the far north and northwest, Opal Terrace to the northeast and the remaining areas--Minerva Terrace, Cleopatra Terrace, Overlook, Main Terrace, Jupiter Terrace and Canary Spring--also located to the northwest. Your location is closest to Jupiter Terrace and Canary Spring. A map key lists small icons which indicate restrooms located southwest of Main Terrace and a visitor center that can be reached by driving to the northeast. Various pathways looping throughout these terraces are colored either yellow to indicate “boardwalk or trail with steep grades or stairs” or brown to represent “wheelchair accessible boardwalk or trail.” Several sections of trail are also marked with a “self-guiding trail” icon. Your current location represents one of five parking areas marked on the map; “wheelchair accessible” icons are placed either at or near each parking area. Section 3 (173 words) More text in a green box at the bottom of the panel is entitled “Changing Course.” The text reads: “Underground channels sometimes shift or clog, causing the water to change course on its journey to the surface. Above ground, springs may slow down or stop. New springs may bubble up, or dormant springs may flow again.” “At any time, boardwalks and trails may be rerouted or closed due to changes in the hot springs.” Another subtitle--“Stay Safe and Protect Resources”--is followed by 5 instructions highlighted with bullet points: “Hot springs can burn you! Please do not touch the water. “Stay on the boardwalk or paved trails at all times. The ground is fragile, and hot water may be hidden below. “Expect steep grades and stairs. “Do not smoke, litter, or take pets on trails. “Hot spring vents can easily become clogged. To protect them, never throw anything into the springs.” A notation in the panel’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.” Section 4 (180 words) Another wayside panel at this site is entitled “Dangerous Ground.” At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder--who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the panel warns us: “In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred. “Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal. “Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.” This safety warning also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. END OF MESSAGE",

Section 1 (130 words) You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled “A Changing Landscape: Mammoth Hot Springs Terraces.” This exhibit is located at the top of the Mammoth Hot Springs hillside, overlooking the various terraces and hydrothermal features found in this site. Text below the title reads: “Scattered across this unusual landscape are hot springs—hot springs that are reshaping the mountain. Water, heated deep underground, rises to the surface. As it rises, the water percolates through buried limestone, dissolving calcium carbonate. Above ground, the hot spring water deposits the calcium carbonate, building travertine terraces. “If you were here in the past, you may notice many changes. The terrain you see today will likely look different in the future. In this rapidly changing landscape, you can glimpse a moment in time.” Section 2 (291 words) The panel features a large color topographical map of a vast landscape with “Absaroka Range,” “Mount Everts,” and “Washburn Range” labeled from left to right at the top of the map. Also labeled throughout the pale and largely non-forested area in the map’s foreground are the site’s terraces and numerous springs. A white dot accompanied with the words “You Are Here” indicates your position near a parking area in the map’s bottom center; this parking area lies alongside Upper Terrace Drive, which leads into Mammoth Hot Springs from the southeast. This location also overlooks “Main Terrace” directly to your right. Note that Main Terrace is the largest area on the map. Other labeled features, moving clockwise from your location, include Overlook, Cleopatra Terrace, Hymen Terrace, Liberty Cap, Palette Spring, Opal Terrace, Minerva Terrace, Mound Terrace, and Canary Spring. A map key lists small icons which indicate wheelchair accessible restrooms located just north of Liberty Cap and a visitor center that you can reach by following the road east. Various trails looping throughout these terraces are colored either yellow to indicate “boardwalk or trail with steep grades or stairs” or brown to represent “wheelchair accessible boardwalk or trail.” The trail system that you can access from this trailhead is marked with a “self-guiding trail” icon. You are currently at the top of the trail system; trails from here go downhill. Your current location represents one of five parking areas marked on the map; two of these—east of Main Terrace and north of Liberty Cap—are marked with “wheelchair accessible” icons. Wheelchair accessible restrooms are located at the parking area north of Liberty Cap, and at the visitor center. You can reach the visitor center by following the road to the east.

    "bodyText": "<p>At Madison Junction, the Gibbon River joins the Firehole River to form the Madison River.</p> <p>The Gibbon River flows from Grebe Lake through the Norris area to Madison Junction. The Firehole River starts south of Old Faithful and flows through the park’s major hydrothermal basins north to Madison Junction. The Madison joins the Jefferson and the Gallatin rivers at Three Forks, Montana, to form the Missouri River.</p> <p>The cliffs you see are the rim of the Yellowstone Caldera, plus lava flows. National Park Mountain is actually part of the lava flows. Some of these lava flows come down to the road through Firehole Canyon, approximately one mile south of Madison Junction. Gibbon Falls, four miles north of the junction, drops 84 feet (0.3 m) over a remnant of the caldera rim.</p> <h2>Swimming in Yellowstone</h2> <p>South of Madison Junction is the entrance to the Firehole Canyon Drive, a one-way route that follows the Firehole River. Along this route are views of the Firehole Falls and a swimming area where the water is influenced by thermal activity below the surface.</p> <p>Swimming is undertaken at your own risk. Please note that climbing the cliffs around the swimming area erodes the thin topsoil and damages area habitat. Jumping from the cliffs is very dangerous and is forbidden.</p> <h2>Seven Mile Bridge</h2> <p>Seven Mile Bridge is located midway between (and seven miles from both) the West Entrance and Madison Junction. This landmark serves as a convenient reference point and separates the rugged lava-lined Madison Canyon east of the bridge from gentle hills to the west.</p> <h2>National Park Mountain</h2> <p>The legend, which you can read about at the Madison Information Station, tells of explorers camping here in 1870 and deciding Yellowstone should be set aside as a national park. It is a wonderful story, but it isn’t true. Explorers did camp at the junction in 1870, but they apparently did not discuss the national park idea.</p> <p>They camped in a location where people have camped for centuries. Archeologists have found campfire remnants, obsidian flakes, and bone fragments dating back at least 10,000 years.</p> <h2>Think Safety, Act Safely</h2> <p>From burning hot hydrothermal features, to unpredictable wildlife, to steep terrain, Yellowstone is a dangerous place. You are responsible for your safety. As such, please remember these safety tips:</p> <ul> <li>Never touch any hydrothermal waters—they can scald you.</li> <li>Observe safe distances from all wildlife.</li> <li>Stay behind fencing, guard rails, and ledges.</li> <li>Use caution when around park waters—they are cold and fast.</li> <li>Show patience and courtesy to other people.</li> </ul>",

Before venturing into Yellowstone’s winter wonderland, make sure you have properly planned and are prepared for the challenges brought on by extreme cold and deep snow.</p> <ul> <li>Let friends or family know your itinerary.</li> <li>Do not travel alone.</li> <li>Evaluate your party’s and equipment's capabilities.</li> <li>Be prepared to make repairs.</li> <li>Carry and drink plenty of water, and bring high energy food.</li> <li>Be prepared to set up an emergency shelter.</li> <li>Bring a first-aid kit, space blanket, extra clothing, and headlamp.</li> <li>Carry and know how to use a map and compass.</li> <li>Use sunglasses or ski goggles and sunscreen.</li> </ul> <p><b>Clothing and Gear</b></p> <p>Even in severe winter temperatures, you can be comfortable and safe if you dress properly to prevent chilling and overheating. Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</p> <ul> <li>Windproof, hooded outer layer</li> <li>Wool or other insulated garments underneath</li> <li>Wool or synthetic trousers</li> <li>Wool or synthetic long underwear</li> <li>Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</li> <li>Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</li> <li>Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</li> </ul> <p>Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</p> <p>Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</p> <h2>Winter Hazards</h2> <p>Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</p> <p>Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</p> <ul> <li>Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</li> <li>Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</li> <li>Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Stay dry and learn how to recognize the signs of hypothermia and frostbite—they can set in quickly.</li> <li>Bears may be active at any time of year—be alert for signs of bear activity.</li> </ul> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <ul> <li>Do not walk on snowshoe or ski trails.</li> <li>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</li> <li>Yield to faster skiers or those going downhill.</li> <li>Detour around wildlife—never approach.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails and boardwalks.</li> <li>Keep children close at hand.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</li> <li>Keep your food secure—never feed wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Snowmobile Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>All snowmobilers must be led by a guide authorized by the National Park Service (NPS) to operate in Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>All snowmobiles must meet NPS sound and emission requirements.</li> <li>Snowmobile operators must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license in possession. Learner permits are not sufficient.</li> <li>Roads are open only 7 am to 9 pm. Snowmobiles are not allowed to operate in the park between 9 pm and 7 am.</li> <li>Maximum speed limit is 35 mph for snowmobiles, 25 mph for snowcoaches, or less where posted or as conditions warrant.</li> <li>Use hand signals when turning or stopping.</li> <li>Allow enough distance between snowmobiles when traveling.</li> <li>Pass only when safe.</li> <li>If you turn around, stay within the road width.</li> <li>Drive in single file, on the right side of the road even if the road is rough.</li> <li>When stopping, pull to the far right and park in single file.</li> <li>Do not idle your machine more than three minutes.</li> <li>Stay on designated roads. Side-hilling, berm-riding, or any off-road travel is prohibited and carries a fine of up to $5,000.</li> <li>Report accidents to a ranger.</li> <li>Operating a snowmobile while intoxicated is illegal. Possession of open alcoholic beverage containers, including bota bags, is illegal.</li> </ul> <p><b>Wild animals have the right of way.</b> If bison or other wildlife are on the road, stop at least 25 yards away (100 yards for wolves or bears). Pull your machine as far as possible to the opposite side of the road and give them a chance to move off the road.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Transitions from asphalt walkways to boardwalks may require assistance. Some sections of boardwalk are wheelchair-accessible. See the Mammoth Hot Springs Trail Guide map. The rest of the area has stairs or steep grades due to terrain.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",
    "audioDescription": "Lower Terraces - Mound Spring 541 words There are 2 sections in this description. Section 1 (372 words) You are now part way up the Mammoth Hot Springs Terraces hillside, at a junction in the boardwalk near Minerva Terrace to the north and Mound Terrace to the south. A wayside exhibit features a large color topographical map of a vast landscape encompassing travertine terraces and hot springs. In the map’s center, a white dot accompanied with the words “You Are Here” indicates your location at a junction just north of Jupiter Terrace, south of Minerva Terrace, and east of Mound Terrace. Also labeled throughout the pale and largely non-forested terraces in the map’s foreground are Canary Spring, Palette Spring, and Liberty Cap. Opal Terrace lies furthest east, at the bottom of the map. “Bunsen Peak,” “Terrace Mountain,” and “Clagett Butte” are labeled from left to right at the top of the map. The trail running below Mound Terrace is represented by a dashed yellow line, indicating “ boardwalk or trail with steep grades or stairs.” Other trail sections winding throughout the terraces are represented with a dashed red line, indicating “wheelchair accessible boardwalk or trail.” Four trailheads are marked with a “self-guiding trail” icon, including three trailheads at the bottom of the hill, and one trailhead at the top. On the far right side of the map, northwest of Hymen Terrace, a hiking trail is marked “Beaver Ponds Trail: five-mile loop” with an arrow pointing north, or away from the terraces. Pictured at the bottom of the map, and located to your east, is a road that runs south, curving west to Upper Terrace Loop Drive, or north, curving east to the visitor center. There are three restrooms: one is located just north of the terraces, its photograph pictured on the map. Restrooms can also be found in the Albright Visitor Center in Mammoth. Both of these restrooms are wheelchair accessible. The third restroom is an outhouse located in the parking lot near the entrance to the Upper Terrace Loop Drive. There are also five parking areas located throughout the site—four along the road to your east and one alongside Upper Terrace Drive. Wheelchair icons appear at three of the parking areas along the road to your east, alongside the origin of the three trails leading into the terraces. Section 2 (151 words) Below the map, in the panel’s bottom left corner, is a small color photo showing a wide fissure in cracked earth. The photo is captioned “Fragile Ground.” More text tells us: “The ground is fragile. For your safety, stay on the boardwalk or paved trail.” To the right of the photo is a subtitle “Stay Safe and Protect Resources” followed by these five instructions highlighted with bullet points: “Hot springs can burn you! Please do not touch the water. “Stay on the boardwalk or paved trails at all times. The ground is fragile, and hot water may be hidden below. “Expect steep grades and stairs. “Do not smoke, litter, or takes pets on trails. “Hot spring vents can easily become clogged. To protect them, never throw anything into the springs.” A notation in the panel’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

The post office lobby has walls of travertine from a private quarry.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Midway Geyser Basin 577 words There are 2 sections in this description. Section 1 (272 words) You are standing in front of two wayside exhibits located at the beginning of a bridge that crosses the Firehole River and leads to Midway Geyser Basin. Several streams of steaming water pour from the smooth sloping terrace above into the Firehole River below. There is a chest-high railing separating you from the exhibits and basin; this railing runs across the bridge and along most of the boardwalk. A portion of the boardwalk has no handrails on either side. There is one wooden bench placed on a widened area of this open boardwalk. The exhibit on the left is entitled “Dangerous Ground.” At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder--who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the panel warns us: “In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred. “Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal. “Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.” This safety warning also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. Section 2 (287 words) The exhibit on the right is entitled “Midway Geyser Basin” and features a large color map with Grand Prismatic Spring labeled at the top and, from left to right, Excelsior Geyser, Turquoise Pool and Opal Pool labeled below. A smoky blue river crosses the map in its bottom third, where a “You Are Here” notation accompanied with a yellow arrow points to a spot on the river’s closest bank. Text below the map reads: “Discover Grand Prismatic Spring--Yellowstone's largest hot spring--and other hydrothermal wonders along this fully accessible 1/2 mile (0.8 km) trail.” A list of bulleted instructions follows: “Leaving the boardwalk is dangerous and illegal. “Pets are not allowed. “Keep your children close to you at all times. “Do not smoke. “Do not bring food or beverages on the boardwalk.” To the right of these are more instructions under the heading “Help preserve Yellowstone for the future.” “Features are fragile and some are thousands of years old. Do not touch. “Do not throw coins or other objects into any of the features. “Colorful mats contain millions of microorganisms--do not touch or otherwise disturb them.” Written in larger red letters at the bottom of the panel: “Stay On the Boardwalk” A smaller map to the right includes various features labeled in red. Starting at the map’s top left corner and moving clockwise down and across the map, these features include Mammoth Hot Springs, Tower-Roosevelt, Canyon Village, Fishing Bridge, Lake Village Bridge Bay, Grant Village, Old Faithful, Madison, and Norris. A yellow arrow located nearly a half of the way up on the map’s left side points to Midway Geyser Basin, located approximately equidistant from Madison to the north and Old Faithful to the south.

    "audioDescription": "Minerva Terrace 301 words You are standing in front of a wayside panel entitled “Minerva Terrace: A Living Sculpture.” A large black-and-white photo provides a close-up view of pale rock formations resembling a series of wide jagged steps. Text below the title reads: “The delicate travertine formations around you were all created by hot spring water. Heated by Yellowstone's volcano, water travels through buried limestone, then bubbles to the surface to deposit travertine.” A smaller color photo depicts a panoramic view of these same orange-brown travertine formations; a pale spring flows among the rocks. A caption below the photo tells us: “Named in the late 1800s for the Roman goddess of art, Minerva Spring sculpted Minerva Terrace. The spring sometimes flows abundantly, as shown in this 1977 photograph. At other times it is completely dry, illustrating the changing nature of Mammoth Hot Springs.” On the panel’s right side is another small color photo and the subtitle “Shifting Springs.” The panoramic view in this photo shows a low hill—labeled Terrace Mountain— on the far left and Minerva Terrace below a taller hill on the far right. More text tells us: “Terrace Mountain, located about two miles from here, is capped by more than one hundred feet of travertine. Shaped by ancient hot springs, the mountaintop is now at rest, but new springs are reshaping neighboring hills.” More text follows a second subtitle “Underground Mysteries”: “Flowing through a complex network of underground channels, hot spring water often changes course. New channels form and others become blocked as minerals accumulate or dissolve. Earthquakes also open or close cracks in the system. “Mammoth Hot Springs is constantly changing. New springs flow—or old springs may flow again—as others become dry. But for more than a century, the general level of activity has remained consistent.” END OF MESSAGE",

Leave What You Find: Do not collect anything from the park. No Pets: No pets on trail. Obtain service animal regulations at backcountry offices. No Hunting: No hunting or discharge of firearms. No Motorized Vehicles: No motorized vehicles on trails. Wheeled Vehicles Restricted: No bicycles, strollers, or wheeled vehicles (except wheelchairs), except where specified. In an emergency, dial 9-1-1 or contact the nearest ranger station. Animals are Dangerous. Do not approach or feed any animal. Bison and elk have injured people. Stay 100 yards (91 m) from bears and wolves. Stay 25 yards (23 m) from all other animals. Be Prepared for a Bear Encounter. Grizzly and black bears inhabit all of Yellowstone National Park. Be Alert. Watch for signs of bear activity: scratches in trees, tracks, scat, or dig sites. Avoid dead animals. Make Noise. Avoid surprising a bear by calling out and clapping your hands at regular intervals to make your presence known. Carry Bear Spray. Carry bear spray and know how to use it. Keep it immediately available, not inside your pack. Hike in Groups. Travel in groups of 3 or more is recommended. Stay with your group at all times. What to do if you encounter a bear. Stay calm, do not run. Quietly detour or back away; stop if this seems to agitate the bear. Stay at least 100 yards (91 m) from bears. Do NOT feed bears or other animals. What to do if a bear charges you. Stand still, do not run. Stand your ground and use your bear spray. Spray when the bear is 60 feet (18 m) away or closer. If a bear charges, it may be a bluff charge. What to do if a bear makes contact. Drop to the ground; play dead. Lie face down and clasp your hands over the back of your neck; stay still and silent. Wait several minutes after the bear leaves before getting up and leaving the area.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Morning Geyser seldom erupts, but when it does it is one of the park's largest geysers. It last erupted in 2013. When it does erupt, it sends water 150–200 feet (46–61 m) up into the air and out 60–100 feet (18–31 m) around its vent. It has an average temperate of 167.8°F (75.5°C), an average pH of 7.7, and an average conductivity of 1833.33 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "audioDescription": "Morning Glory Pool 775 words There are 3 sections in this description Section 1 (328 words) Morning Glory is one of several pools located in Upper Geyser Basin. This round pool is dark green in its center with a yellowish cast appearing at its edges. At the time Morning Glory was named in the 1880s, its pool was bright tropical blue, giving it the appearance of the flower with the same name. A wide wood boardwalk with railings on both sides leads to Morning Glory. The boardwalk ends just beyond the pool, creating a viewing platform where there is also a long wood bench. A wayside exhibit overlooking the site is entitled “Fading Glory” and includes a large drawing depicting a man tossing a beverage can into a pale aqua cone-shaped pool. Text below the title reads: “Morning Glory Pool is losing its brilliant color. Through ignorance and vandalism, people have tossed objects into the hot spring, clogging its vent and lowering the temperature. Brown, orange, and yellow algae-like bacteria thrive in the cooler water, gradually turning the vivid aqua-blue to a murkier greenish-brown. “All thermal features are at risk. Hot springs and geysers have fragile, complex plumbing that takes centuries to develop. Morning Glory's future is uncertain; you can help by immediately reporting any vandalism.” There are two color photos to the right of the text. The topmost photo shows a man in work clothes and tall black boots manning a thick hose lowered into the pool’s grayish-blue water. The hose’s opposite end connects to a large cylindrical tank on the back of one of several trucks parked on the pool’s opposite side. The caption tells us: “Every year park personnel remove hundreds of rocks, coins, and other objects from Morning Glory Pool.” The second photo highlights the pool’s varying colors--blue-green around the vent in its center, surrounded by first a thin yellow band and finally a much wider brown band at the pool’s outer periphery. The caption reads: “Brown, orange, and yellow algae-like bacteria thrive when the hot spring's temperature drops.” Section 2 (248 words) A second wayside exhibit entitled “Upper Geyser Basin” provides a map of this area. Biscuit Basin is located at the top, or northernmost location on the map, and Black Sand Basin is located directly south near the map’s bottom left corner. A blue line running roughly north to south represents the Firehole River. A red dot accompanied with the words “You Are Here” lies approximately midway between the two basins, alongside Morning Glory Pool. A small icon indicates that there are restrooms at your location. Other locations shown on this map include Old Faithful Geyser, the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center and various lodging facilities--all found in the map’s bottom right corner--as well as numerous other thermal features, roads, and trails. A small color photo to the right of the map shows a speckled brown fish with a red belly and tail. The photo is labeled “Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). A caption tells us: “This non-native has been a popular catch since managers introduced it in the early 1900s.” A message at the bottom of the exhibit tells us: “Stay Safe and Protect the Park “Always stay on boardwalks and maintained trails. The ground is fragile and dangerous. “Do not litter, throw objects into pools, deface formations, or collect specimens. “Do not feed wildlife. Stay 100 yards (91.4 meters) from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards (22.8 meters) from all other wildlife.” This message is also displayed in Spanish, Mandarin, French, Japanese, and German. Section 3 (177 words) Another wayside exhibit is entitled “Dangerous Ground.” At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder--who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the panel warns us: “In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred. “Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal. “Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.” This safety warning also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. END OF MESSAGE",

Mound Terrace was inactive for decades but began flowing again recently.</p> <p>Its weathered travertine shows new patterns where chunks of the soft rock have broken or fallen.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Jupiter Terrace flowed heavily and overtook boardwalks several times.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Its peak elevation is 10,219 feet (3,115 m) and panoramic views for about 20 to 50 miles (32 to 80 km). At the top, check out interpretive exhibits inside the base of a fire lookout and enjoy the view.</p> <p>Hike to the top via two trails that ascend Mount Washburn on a wide path with spectacular views. The trails start at the Dunraven Pass Trailhead and at the Chittenden Road parking area. Bicycles may use the trail from the Chittenden Road parking area.</p> <p>During July, wildflowers carpet the slopes. Visitors often see bighorn sheep near the trail.</p> <h2>Fire Lookout</h2> <p>Mount Washburn is one of three fire lookout stations in Yellowstone. It is continuously staffed from mid-June until the fire season ends. Fire lookouts are staffed by firefighters trained to detect and locate fires, monitor fire activity, and report significant changes. They spend the summer living alone, watching for signs of fire.</p> <h2>Forming a Mountain</h2> <p>This peak can be seen from many locations in the park. It is a remnant of an extinct volcano from the Absaroka Volcanics of about 50 million years ago. The volcano was literally cut in half by a volcanic eruption 631,000 years ago. Only the northern part of the original volcano is still visible.</p> <h2>Bighorn Sheep</h2> <p>Bighorn sheep are often seen along the slopes of Mount Washburn near Dunraven Pass.</p> <p>All bighorn sheep have horns. The rings on horns can be used to determine age, though it is easier to count the rings on a ram.</p> <p>Ram skulls have two layers of bone above the brain that work as a shock absorber. This is an adaptation for the collision of head-on fighting that is used to establish dominance between rams of equal horn size, especially during mating.</p> <h2>Animals are Dangerous</h2> <ul> <li>Do not approach or feed any animal.</li> <li>Bison and elk have injured people.</li> <li>Stay 100 yards (91 m) from bears and wolves.</li> <li>Stay 25 yards (23 m) from all other animals.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think Safety, Act Safely.

    "audioDescription": "Mud Volcano<br />671 words<br />There are 2 sections in this description. <br />Section 1 (474 words)<br />From the paved parking area, a short wood boardwalk with railings on both sides leads to Mud Volcano, so named for the cone-shaped mud that once covered this feature. Today Mud Volcano appears as a mud cauldron measuring 27 feet by 36 feet and with a depth of 17 feet; the thick mud within its crater walls is generally quiet with occasional churning due to rising gases. <br /><br />A wayside exhibit entitled \"Mud Volcano: Explosive Change\" is affixed to the boardwalk railing overlooking Mud Volcano. The exhibit features a large color photo of the steaming mud pool we see today; superimposed over this photo on the panel's left side is a black-and-white drawing depicting both a huge cloud of steam and a massive tower of mud bursting from a cone-shaped mud dome. Several spindly evergreen trees, as well as two people pictured in the drawing's bottom left corner, appear dwarfed by the sky-high eruption. Text below the exhibit title and to the right of this drawing tells us:<br /><br />\"In 1870, explorers stood in awe as Mud Volcano spewed mud into the treetops, shaking the ground with each eruption. Two years later it was a pool of bubbling, muddy water. Mud Volcano had blown itself apart!\"<br /><br />Pictured below the drawing is a yellowed magazine clipping from Scribner's Monthly. The article, entitled \"The Wonders of the Yellowstone,\" includes a drawing of several men in brimmed hats, some on horseback, climbing a narrow mountain pass. Text in a pale yellow box to the right of the clipping reads:<br /><br />\"While returning by a new route to our camp, dull, thundering sounds, which General Washburn likened to frequent discharges of a distant mortar, broke upon our ears. We followed their direction, and found them to proceed from a mud volcano, which occupied the slope of a small hill, embowered in a grove of pines. Dense volumes of steam shot into the air with each report, through a crater thirty feet in diameter. The reports, though irregular, occurred as often as every five seconds, and could be distinctly heard half a mile. Each alternate report shook the ground a distance of two hundred yards or more, and the massive jets of vapor which accompanied them burst forth like the smoke of burning gunpowder. Nathaniel P. Langford, 1870.\"<br /><br />A caption below this excerpt tells us: <br /><br />\"In May 1871, Scribner's Monthly published explorer N.P. Langford's astonishing description of Mud Volcano. Artist Thomas Moran, although not present on the 1870 expedition, was commissioned to illustrate the article.\"<br /><br />To the right of the magazine article is a small color photo of the orange-tinged earth surrounding Mud Volcano's mud pool, which is largely obscured by a cloud of white steam. A caption under the photo reads:<br /><br />\"As you look at Mud Volcano's crater-shaped walls, you are viewing part of the interior of its once tall cone.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (179 words)<br /><br />At the top of another pale yellow box filling the right side of the exhibit is a color photo of the crackled orange-brown crater surrounding Mud Volcano. A thick cloud of white steam wafts upward toward several people gathered on the boardwalk overlooking the site. A caption below the picture reads: <br /><br />\"For many decades, visitors have been intrigued by Mud Volcano's powerful odor and the yellow sulphur that is most common in late summer.\"<br /><br />Below the photo is the title \"Sulphur is the Source,\" followed by three headings offering explanations highlighted with bullet points:<br /><br /><br />\"The Smell. Hydrogen sulfide gas rising from Yellowstone's magma chamber causes the rotten-egg smell.<br /><br />\"The Mud. Microorganisms, or thermophiles, use this gas as a source of energy, and then help turn the gas into sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid breaks down the rock and soil into mud.<br /><br />\"The Colors. Many of the colors you see are vast communities of thermophiles, but some of the yellow is pure sulphur.<br /><br />\"When iron mixes with sulphur to form iron sulfide, gray and black swirls sometimes appear in the mud.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Mud Volcano Trail 1,092 words There are 4 sections in this description. Section 1 (252 words) On the edge of a large parking lot, at the northern of three boardwalk trailheads are three wayside exhibits. The setup is the similar for the middle and south trailheads. The first wayside is entitled “Dangerous Ground.” At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder—who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the panel warns us: “In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred. “Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal. “Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.” This safety warning also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. Beside this wayside is a trail box, about 3 feet high, where you can obtain a pamphlet about the site by lifting the lid. A $1.00 donation is requested or return after use; money can be inserted in the slot on the front of the bin. Section 2 (354 words) You are standing in front of another wayside exhibit entitled “Mud Volcano Area.” Featured on the exhibit is a large map drawing showing the locations of Mud Volcano and several other hydrothermal features. A yellow arrow accompanied with the words “You Are Here” is located just right of the map’s center; this indicates your position alongside the rightmost of three entrances to a trail looping past these features. As shown on the map, this north trailhead lies below and to the left, or east, of Dragon’s Mouth Spring. Text below the exhibit title reads: “Pungent sulphur smells hint at the seething, muddy hydrothermal wonders you will encounter on this trail. Total distance: 2/3 mile (1 kilometer). “Hint: The trail is less steep if you walk in the direction of the arrows (clockwise). “Across the road, you can view Sulphur Caldron, one of the most acidic springs in Yellowstone.” Note that all three trail sections originate at a parking area alongside the road leading to Fishing Bridge to the left, or southeast, and Canyon to the right, or north. Small black arrows pointing clockwise around the trail begin with the south trailhead to your far left. Here the trail takes you past Mud Geyser, Mud Caldron, Cooking Hillside, Sizzling Basin, Churning Caldron, Black Dragon’s Caldron, and Sour Lake before heading northeast toward Grizzly Fumarole, Mud Volcano, and again to the north toward Dragon’s Mouth Spring. The middle and north trails leading to Mud Volcano and Dragon’s Mouth Spring, as well as trail portions between Sizzling Basin and Grizzly Fumarole at the top of the map, are marked pale gray to indicate “improved trail, accessible with assistance.” The south trail before Sizzling Basin and the middle trail west of Mud Volcano are marked red to indicate “stairs or steep grade.” Small icons indicate two sets of restrooms, one set each flanking the parking lot entrance to your left. The blue Yellowstone River is pictured below the road at the bottom of the map. One final thermal feature—Sulphur Caldron—is located near the map’s bottom right corner, between the river and the road leading toward Canyon. Section 3 (161 words) Below the map, the word “DANGER!” appears in red upper-case letters, followed by several sentences highlighted with bullet points: “Leaving the boardwalk is dangerous and illegal. “Bison are dangerous—do not approach within 25 yards; turn back if you have to. “Pets are not allowed. “Keep your children close to you at all times. “Do not smoke. “Do not bring food or beverages on the walkways. “Help preserve Yellowstone for the future: “Features are fragile and some are thousands of years old. Do not touch. “Do not throw coins or other objects into any of the features. “Colorful mats contain millions of microorganisms—do not touch or otherwise disturb them.” To the right of this text is a smaller map with a yellow arrow pointing toward “Mud Volcano,” located between Fishing Bridge and Yellowstone Lake to the southeast and Canyon Village to the northwest. A final caution in red letters at the bottom of the panel reads: “Stay On the Walkways.” Section 4 (307 words) The last wayside exhibit, entitled “Looks Can Be Deceiving,” features a large close-up color photo of one shaggy-furred bison standing in yellow grass. Text below the title reads: “Bison seem lazy and docile grazing in the sun. They are massive and look as",

    "audioDescription": "Museum of the National Park Ranger Overlook<br />284 words<br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit located alongside an open field. Standing in the distance is a log building surrounded by evergreen trees. Entitled \"Cavalry in Yellowstone,\" the exhibit features a large black-and-white photo of a one-story log cabin with two shed dormers on its shingled gable roof. Four uniformed soldiers-two standing against a fence running alongside the path leading to the structure, and two standing on the building's porch-pose for the camera. This same building is part of the structure that houses the Museum of the Park Ranger existing today. Text below the title reads:<br /><br />\"The log cabin is Norris Soldier Station, a U.S. Army outpost when cavalry had the responsibility for protecting the park. Their only war was against fire and poaching. In 1887 the troops had their first success when they caught a teamster trapping beaver on the Gibbon River and expelled him from the park.<br /><br />\"In 1916 the National Park Service was created and the new park administrators relieved the Army at Yellowstone. The cabin at Norris continued to function as a ranger station until the earthquake of August 17, 1959, when the kitchen chimney collapsed, breaking several rafters.\"<br /><br />A caption above the photo tells us:<br /><br />\"When the Army arrived in Yellowstone in 1886, one non-commissioned officer and two or three privates patrolled the Norris Basin area from a small cabin. The need for year-round occupation led to improvements over time; the larger, more comfortable station was built in 1908.\"<br /><br />In the panel's top right corner is another black-and-white photo showing 7 men walking in single file across a snowy landscape. The caption reads: \"U.S. Army troops with captured poacher in 1894.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<h3>The Corps of Discovery and the Nez Perce</h3> <p>Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and their Corps of Discovery traveled through Nez Perce country in the fall of 1805. After some initial apprehension, the Nez Perce embraced the expedition and provided help when the party was nearing starvation. After journeying further west, Lewis and Clark returned in the spring of 1806. They spent more time with the Nez Perce than any other tribe encountered during their expedition.</p> <p>Lewis and Clark engaged in a diplomatic exchange with Nez Perce chiefs. The captains sought to establish trading posts and intertribal peace in the region. The Nez Perce were willing to cooperate as long as guns and other weaponry were provided to the tribe.</p> <p>Like their Shoshone neighbors, the Nez Perce were without guns or ammunition. This left them vulnerable to their enemies who could obtain weapons from Canadian traders and also hampered their ability to hunt buffalo. The Nez Perce were known for their horsemanship and breeding, especially the Appaloosa horses, which provided a great advantage in traversing long distances in order to hunt and fish.</p> <h3>The Flight of 1877</h3> <p>Chief Joseph’s father refused to sign the 1863 Treaty. On June 15, 1877, The Wallowa Band of  Nez Perce (Nimíipuu) fled their homelands in Wallowa Valley in northeastern Oregon to escape being forced to move to the reservation in Idaho. They hoped to evade violent engagements with settlers and the United States Army and find a more peaceful existence living according to their traditions. An estimated 750 to 800 men, women and children and 250 warriors were pursued by military which included the 7th Infantry and 7th Calvary of the U.S. Army. They set off near Wallowa Lake in eastern Oregon and traveled a circuitous 1,170 miles over five months through Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. The Tribe planned to ally with the Crow for security, but when the Crow refused aid, the Tribe headed toward the Canadian border.</p> <h3>Route through Yellowstone National Park</h3> <p>They entered Yellowstone National Park on August 23. Only a small part of the route taken by the Nez Perce who fled from the US Army in 1877 went through Yellowstone (established in 1872), and they largely eluded their pursuers while there.</p> <p>During their time here, the Nez Perce encountered about 25 visitors in the young park, some more than once. Warriors took hostage or attacked several of these tourists, killing two. The group continued traveling through the park and over the Absaroka Mountains into Montana. </p> <h3>Nez Perce Commemorative Sites in Yellowstone</h3> <p>Although none of the officially designated historic sites associated with the Nez Perce are located in Yellowstone, the historic trail goes through the park, and it is considered a sacred place by many Nez Perce who have continued to honor their ancestors and carry on their memories through ceremonies conducted in the park.</p> <h3>End of the Flight</h3> <p>Leaving Yellowstone, the Nez Perce continued their flight to Canada. Along the way, the Nez Perce warriors valiantly fought U.S. military and citizen volunteers across a series of battles. But starved and exhausted from the journey and persistent clashes, the brave Chief Joseph surrendered following a battle near Bears Paw Mountains in Montana, less than 40 miles from the Canadian border. It is here that it is believed the flight ended and Chief Joseph said, “From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.”<br /> <br /> Led by Chief White Bird, nearly 300 Nez Perce men, women and children managed to escape the battle at Bears Paw and make their way into Canada where they joined Sitting Bull and the Lakota near Fort Walsh. Following surrender, the Nez Perce were sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and eventually to reservations in Oklahoma, where deplorable conditions led to the death of most babies born on the Indian Territory. Today, the trail represents a sacred journey, connecting the surviving Nez Perce people to the past, present and future.</p> <h3><strong>Auto Tours:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Travelers can retrace the Nez Perce National Historical Trail by car along more than 1,500 miles of federal, state and county roads narrated by the Auto Route, with trail signs along the way.</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/maps-pubs/?cid=fsbdev3_055663\">Auto Tour Pamphlets </a>with maps, history and points of interest of all eight segments of the trail</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=45.890008,-116.828613&spn=1.911731,3.295898&hl=en&msa=0&z=8&source=embed&ie=UTF8&mid=zv7KavdVnCwU.kid9pjyMdX-c\">Google Map </a>of Nez Perce Historic Trail Auto Tour</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Hiking/Horseback Tours</strong></h3> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.discovernw.org/store_1877-nez-perce-flight-nez-perce-nee-me-poo-national-historic-trail-map_18998.html\">Trail Map </a>with modern-day travel routes and sites to visit along the trail.</li> <li>Essential Trail Companion: Following the Nez Perce Trail, A Guide to the Nee-Me-Poo National Historic Trail with Eyewitness Accounts by Cheryl Wilfong</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPwhQoY6BdkOyoCAPkATlA!/?ss=110199&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=null&navid=151120000000000&pnavid=151000000000000&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&ttype=main&pname=Nez%20Perce%20National%20Historic%20Trail-%20Outdoor%20Safety%20&%20Ethics\">Outdoor Safety & Ethics </a>&<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/npnht/home/?cid=stelprdb5245913\"> FAQs</a></li> <li>Each summer, the Nez Perce Trail Foundation offers a week-long driving, hiking and camping <a href=\"http://nezpercetrail.net/summer-educational-trail-tour/\">educational tour </a>of the trail, visiting sites that include Wallowa Valley, Lolo Trail, Nez Perce National Historical Park, Big Hole Battlefield and Tamkaliks Celebration & Friendship Feast.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Quick Facts:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Bear Paw Battlefield is the site of the final conflict of the Nez Perce War and Flight of 1877.</li> <li>Beartooth All-American Road: Lush forests become alpine tundra in just a few miles on the highest elevation road in the Northern Rockies, with access to Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>The Chief <a href=\"https://travelwyoming.com/listing/yellowstone-national-park/chief-joseph-scenic-byway\">Joseph Scenic Byway in northwest Wyoming</a> links the town of Cody with the Beartooth Highway and the Northeast Gate of Yellowstone National Park.

    "audioDescription": "Nez Perce National Historic Trail921 wordsThere are 4 sections in this description.Section 1 (314 words)You are standing in front of a large wayside exhibit located alongside Nez Perce Creek Pullout. The exhibit kiosk is trimmed with brown wood and shaded by a shingled gable roof; it stands atop a low stone base. There is one panel on each side of the exhibit. The panel on the north side of the kiosk is entitled \"\"Chance Encounter.\" A large painting features several Native American people-men, women, and children-either sitting or standing in a grassy meadow. In the center of the painting, one man sits atop a pale horse. A caption on the painting's right side tells us:\"On a summer night in 1877, hundreds of \"non-treaty\" Nez Perce-bands refusing confinement on a reservation-camped near here. They journeyed 1,170 miles (1,883 kilometers) in their quest for freedom.\"More text below the exhibit title reads: \"Across the meadow, a fire burned in the campsite of nine tourists on the night of August 23, 1877. The Cowan party had unknowingly camped near hundreds of Nez Perce men, women, and children who were under violent pursuit by the United States Army. Through the darkness, the Cowan's firelight flickered and was spotted by Hemene Moxmox (Yellow Wolf) and other Nez Perce scouts. With the heightened instincts of war-torn hearts, the scouts entered the camp at daybreak. They dared not risk the Army learning the whereabouts of their people. Instead of taking chances, they took the tourists with them.\"The coming hours revealed human emotions found in any war: fear, anger, and compassion. A Nez Perce leader, Wa-wook-ke-ya Was Sauw (Lean Elk), released the campers with a warning to stay hidden, but the small group was later overtaken. This time tempers flared. George Cowan was shot and left for dead, but eventually made a full recovery. Others sustained shots or escaped. Emma Cowan and her siblings were released unharmed the following day.\"Section 2 (236 words)The panel on the south side of the exhibit kiosk is entitled \"Nez Perce War: Journey through Yellowstone.\" Text below the exhibit title reads:\"On August 23, 1877, more than 600 men, women, and children camped in the woods near here. Sustained by courage, social structure, and knowledge of the land, they were midway from their homeland in Eastern Oregon to the hope of freedom in Canada. They carried with them the burden of grief from the loss of their homeland and the sharp pain of losing loved ones.\"With them were two thousand horses. Behind them were hundreds of soldiers. Within them were strength, endurance, and the ability to face enemies and atrocities. This was the Nez Perce War of 1877.\"Section 3 (228 words)More text highlights the history of the times leading up to the conflict and the war itself: \"Mounting Pressure. For more than two decades, the Nez Perce endured pressure to sign away their homeland and live on a reservation. In I 877, United States government representatives ordered \"non-treaty\" Nez Perce-bands standing firmly against confinement-onto the reservation.\"The War Begins. Conflict erupted, followed by battle in White Bird Canyon. The soldiers were quickly defeated. General Howard arrived with reinforcements, but the Nez Perce eluded them in rugged terrain.\"As the war continued, Chiefs Toohoolhoolzote, Five Wounds, Rainbow and others strategized tactics. Chief Heinmot Tooyalakeket (Chief Joseph, left) led the elderly men, women, and children.\"\"Tragedy at Dawn. The Nez Perce gained many miles on General Howard. But on August 9th, Colonel Gibbon's soldiers swooped into the sleeping Nez Perce camp, killing men, women, and children. Warriors leapt to defend their people.\"Like many others, Chief Joseph's wife was wounded severely at Big Hole. In combat, he protected their newborn in his arms.\"Hope and Heartache. The Nez Perce out-maneuvered and battled their foes repeatedly, upheld both young and old, and withstood unthinkable losses. Under unrelenting pursuit, they traveled 1,170 miles, eventually falling short on supplies. In the bitter cold of late September, just 40 miles from Canada, they were overtaken. With hearts heavy and torn, they surrendered.\"Section 4 (231 words)Also featured on this panel is a large map drawing detailing the route of the Nez Perce and the commands of General Howard, Colonel Gibbon, Colonel Sturgis, and Colonel Miles during the Nez Perce War of 1877. A half dozen army forts are also marked on the map.The route of the Nez Perce leads from the west in Oregon Territory, northeast through Idaho Territory toward Fort Missoula in western Montana Territory, then south and east again to Camas Meadows in eastern Idaho Territory. From here, the route heads further east and then north through Wyoming Territory to Canyon Creek in south central Montana Territory and finally through Bear Paw in the north central section of Montana Territory. Indicated by black \"x\" marks are battle sites at Clearwater and White Bird Canyo",

    "audioDescription": "Nez Perce Picnic Area921 wordsThere are 5 sections in this description.Section 1 (308 words)The Nez Perce Picnic Area offers several wood picnic tables scattered among the tall evergreens overlooking the Yellowstone River. There is also a small building with restrooms located on one side of the gravel drive leading from the parking lot to the picnic area. Take care as you approach the tables from the gravel drive as the ground is uneven. You will need to avoid several timbers and half-timbers separating this and other areas from the surrounding grass; there are also some large boulders dotting the site. A pole affixed with a wheelchair logo sign indicates parking near a flat area leading toward the tables.You will encounter two wayside exhibits as you approach the picnic area. The first, entitled \"A Bear's Picnic,\" features three color photos of a bear searching for food, first digging a hole beside a downed log, then by ducking its head into the hole. Bands of melting snow dot the green grass surrounding the bear. Text to the right of the title tells us:\"All in a Day's Work. Hunting, digging, uprooting boulders and scouring logs...bears spend a lot of time foraging for edibles. Guided by a keen sense of smell and using their claws as tools, they eat plants and animals, large and small. Curious and intelligent, bears have an excellent memory for food sources and work hard for nourishment.\"These traits serve bears well when they eat a natural diet, but if bears obtain human food, they may aggressively search for more--putting you, others and the bear in grave danger. Never feed a bear!\"To the left of the photos is a drawing of a tree with short branches. A caption to the right of the tree reads:\"The whitebark pine is a long-lived, slow-growing tree of high elevation forests. The pine seeds provide a high-fat, high-energy food for bears.\"Section 2 (162 words)Spanning across the bottom of the panel is a wide box with the subtitle \"What do bears eat?\" Text below the title reads: \"Spring:\"Winter-killed carcasses\"Elk calves\"Earthworms\"Tender grass shoots\"Clover\"Dandelions\"Ants\"Pocket gophers\"Summer:\"Elk and bison calves\"Spawning cutthroat trout\"Thistles\"Fireweed\"Mushrooms\"Moths\"Berries\"Clover\"Ants\"Fall:\"Buffaloberries\"Whortleberries\"Whitebark pine seeds\"Insect nests\"Starchy tubers and roots\"Rose hips\"Mushrooms\"Winter:\"Both black and grizzly bears hibernate during the winter. They generally do not eat or drink during this time; instead, they live off a layer of fat built up during the summer and fall.\"Also in this text box are small photos of a brown wolf, a brown and beige speckled moth, and a rose hip, which resembles a small red berry. Two captions tell us:\"Bears also depend on wolf-killed bison and elk in spring, summer, and fall.\"Grizzly bears may eat up to 40,000 army cutworm moths a day in late summer.\"Section 3 (211 words)The second wayside exhibit, entitled \"Bears Need Your Concern,\" features a large close-up color photo of a massive brown bear that appears to be looking straight at us. Text at the top of the wayside tells us: \"Enjoy your picnic and remember...\"Bears need your concern, not your food!\"Bears become dangerous when they obtain human food. Stay safe--and help protect Yellowstone bears!\"On the panel's right side are two subtitles, each followed by instructions highlighted with bullet points:\"If a bear approaches the picnic area:\"Make noise, bang pots, yell, or honk your car horn to alert the bear to your presence. \"If the bear continues toward the picnic area, take all of your food and trash, get into your car, and alert other people in the area of the bear's presence.\"If a bear enters the picnic area:\"Do not run!\"If the bear is not threatening you, take all of your food and trash and get into your car.\"If you do not have time to safely gather your food and garbage, get into your car without it.\"If the bear shows interest in the food on your table, honk your car horn. This may scare the bear away.\"If the bear approaches your car, drive away.\"Section 4 (136 words)Located at the bottom of the panel is a box with the subtitle \"Grizzly or Black Bear?\" Text below the title tells us:\"Color can range from black to brown to cinnamon to blond for both grizzly and black bears. Grizzly bears frequently sport white-tipped fur, giving a grizzled, silver-tipped appearance.\"To the left of this text is a drawing of a brown grizzly bear accompanied with the following labels: \"rump is usually lower than shoulders; hump at shoulder; dished-in face; long, straight claws.\"To the right of the text is a drawing of the smaller and darker black bear with these labels: \"Straight profile; rump is higher than shoulder; short, curved claws.\"One final message at the bottom of the panel instructs us: \"Report all bear encounters to the nearest Ranger Station or Visitor Center.\"Section 5 (74 words)Standing in a grassy clearing near the picnic area is a low white headstone marking a single grave.

    "audioDescription": "Norris Geyser Basin - Orientation at Parking Lot 1,117 words There are 5 sections in this description. Section 1 (212 words) A wide pathway leads to this one-story stone, log, and clapboard structure with an open entrance in its center and two building wings stretching left and right on either side. The building’s entrance façade is largely stone with a log-framed pitched roof forming a tall triangle above the entrance opening; there is also a small triangular hip roof that slopes outward toward the pathway. Suspended from chains attached to a massive rough-hewn timber, or roof truss above the entrance is \"Norris Museum,\" spelled out in wrought iron letters. The museum’s two wings have brown clapboard siding and gable roofs. The roofs of both the wings and the entrance are covered with green shingles. The museum’s entrance does not have doors, but rather leads to an open foyer which shelters the museum’s two entrances, one each to the building’s two wings. This foyer also provides a pedestrian pass-through to a flagstone terrace and stone wall overlooking the geyser basin. The building is staffed with a ranger each day in summer Please take care as you step through the foyer and past the entrance doors as there are two wide stone steps leading down to the terrace. There are three metal railings on these steps—one on each side and one in the center. Section 2 (245 words) You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit located alongside the trail leading to the Norris Geyser Basin Museum and Bookstore. The exhibit is entitled “The Norris Area: Orientation.” Arranged vertically below the title are five boxes, each filled with text regarding one of the features in the Norris area. This text reads: “Norris Geyser Basin. You are close to a world of heat and gases where microorganisms live in such massive numbers they add color to the landscape. This strange, beautiful place is on the edge of a giant volcano-the Yellowstone Volcano- one of the largest on Earth. “Norris Geyser Basin Museum. On your way to the geyser basin, you will arrive at the Norris Geyser Basin Museum. This historic stone structure opened in 1930 to help orient park visitors to Yellowstone's amazing geologic history. “Norris Bookstore. At Norris Bookstore (located just ahead on the trail), you can find books and other educational material about Yellowstone's abundant wildlife and rich geologic and cultural history. “Museum of the National Park Ranger. In the late 1800s, this rugged outpost was home to United States soldiers, caretakers of Yellowstone National Park. Situated beside Norris Campground, this log structure is now a museum honoring the history of national park rangers. “Norris Campground. From here, Norris Campground is located 1 1/2 miles (2.4 kilometers) north on the road to Mammoth Hot Springs. It can also be reached via the foot trail between Porcelain Basin and the campground.” Section 3 (139 words) Below this text is a map drawing with an arrow indicating that “North” is directed toward the right of the map. A red dot with the words “You Are Here” lies in the map’s center and indicates your position at the start of a trail leading upward, or west, toward the museum and bookstore, and then to Back and Porcelain Basins. Three parking lots and three restrooms are located directly to your east. The Museum of the National Park Ranger and Norris Campground lie to the northeast. All trails in the surrounding area are marked with either a solid black line for “dirt or paved trails,” a red line for “stairs or steep grades,” and a gray line for “boardwalk.” A small icon located beside the Museum of the National Park Ranger indicates that this building is “wheelchair accessible.” Section 4 (134 words) In the panel’s top right corner is a color photo of a largely open and pale landscape. The photo’s caption reads: “Norris Geyser Basin.” Below this photo is a small topographical map showing your location approximately midway between Old Faithful to the south and Mammoth Hot Springs to the north. Text below this map reads: “Norris Geyser Basin steams and simmers on the edge of a huge caldera. The Yellowstone Volcano-one of the largest volcanoes on Earth-erupted approximately 640,000 years ago. The eruption ripped open miles of mountainous terrain, leaving behind a massive caldera that stretches 45 miles (72 kilometers) from rim to rim! “Later, lava oozed and flowed. The lava obscured caldera boundaries and reshaped the landscape as it partially filled the caldera. The last flow occurred about 70,000 years ago.” Section 5 (167 words) Spanning across the bottom of the panel is a text box holding the following safety information: “Carry water with you. There is no drinking water ahead. “Restrooms are located in the parking area. There are no restrooms in the geyser basin. “Accessibility Information. Due to Norris Geyser Basin’s rough terrain and highly changeable conditions, please expect uneven ground and steep gr",

Cistern is known for the forest of dead trees surrounding its colorful water; the bottom portions of the trees’ spindly trunks have been cast whitish-gray by the sinter deposits built up around the pool. A wayside panel affixed to the platform railing overlooking the site is entitled “Cistern Spring: Living Color.” Text below the title reads: “Hot springs create different water temperature environments for living things. Cistern Spring's brown, orange, and green colors represent species of visible algae and bacteria, each requiring a different temperature environment. Only a handful of hard-to-see species of bacteria can live where spring water is near, at, or above boiling. As water gradually cools—by flowing away from its source—it creates lower temperature environments ideal for these colorful species of algae and bacteria. Remarkably, hardy communities of tiny hot-water-adapted organisms can thrive in temperatures too hot for humans to tolerate.” On the panel’s right side is a black-and-white drawing providing a microscopic view of bacteria shaped like round-tipped cylinders. A caption tells us: “Hot water bacteria have a value beyond beauty. Thermus aquaticus (shown above), found in some of the park's hot water runoff channels, produces an enzyme used in DNA \"fingerprinting\" and testing for the virus that causes AIDS.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Porcelain Springs Junction 598 words There are 4 sections in this description. Section 1 (146 words) You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit located alongside the trail leading to Porcelain Springs and Museum of the National Park Ranger. The exhibit is entitled “Norris Geyser Basin: Porcelain Basin.” Text below the title reads: “In this raw, acidic land where iron and arsenic abound, thermophiles and extremophiles-microorganisms that live in heat and other extremes-inhabit geysers and hot springs. “Many pools are opalescent, or cloudy. Look for murky waters, caused by silica in the water. Colloidal Pool is a perfect example-usually! Here at Norris Geyser Basin where changes are common, a ‘perfect example’ might change at any time.” Below this text is a small color photo showing a large pool with sections of cloudy blue and white water. A caption below the photo reads: “Colloidal Pool is named for the particles suspended in it, giving the water a cloudy appearance.” Section 2 (132 words) On the panel’s right side is a large map drawing with Back Basin in the map’s center and Porcelain Basin above Back Basin at the top of the map, or to the north. A red dot and the words “You Are Here” indicate your location at the head of the trail leading east from Porcelain Basin to Porcelain Springs, Norris Campground, and Museum of the National Park Ranger. Hurricane Vent and Colloidal Pool are located to your west and Congress Pool to the south. Also labeled on the map are other thermal features found in Porcelain Basin, including Whale’s Mouth, Pinwheel Geyser, Whirligig Geyser, Constant Geyser, Sunday Geyser, Ledge Geyser, and Black Growler Steam Vent. Note that there are three restrooms located near Norris Geyser Basin Museum, located southwest of your position. Section 3 (117 words) At the bottom of the panel is a box entitled “Geyser Basin Glossary.” The text that follows tells us: “Thermophile: A microorganism that inhabits a very hot place, such as a geyser or hot spring. “Extremophile: A microorganism that lives in extreme conditions such as heat and acid-and cannot survive without these extremes. “Colloid: Fine particles suspended in liquid that do not settle to the bottom or easily filter out.” One last color photo to the right of the glossary depicts a bright green geyser channel. The caption reads: “Thermophiles in Pinwheel Geyser’s runoff channel.” A notation in the exhibit’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.” Section 4 (177 words) Another wayside exhibit is entitled “Dangerous Ground.” At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder-who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the panel warns us: “In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred. “Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal. “Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.” This safety warning also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. END OF MESSAGE",

Sawtooth-textured geyserite surrounds part of the main pool, but also forms small, shallow pools in the overflow of the main pool. Oblong Geyser is unique in that while its eruptions aren't as dramatic as other features, the volume of water flowing into the Firehole River has been estimated to be at least 10,000 gallons! Eruptions occur every 2.5–11 hours. Some yellow and orange thermophile line the edge of the hillside where the overflow from Oblong reaches the river.</p> <p>Oblong Geyser has an average temperate of 185.1°F (85°C), an average pH of 7.6, and an average conductivity of 2025 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "bodyText": "<p>Old Faithful erupts more frequently than any of the other big geysers, although it is not the largest or most regular geyser in Yellowstone National Park. It is believed this regularity is in part due to no known connection with other hydrothermal features in the area.</p> <p>Its average interval between eruptions is about 90 minutes, varying from 50 to 127 minutes. An eruption lasts 1.5 to 5 minutes and expels 3,700–8,400 gallons (14,000–32,000 l) of boiling water, and reaches a height of 106–184 feet (30–55 m). Old Faithful Geyser has an average temperate of 169.7°F (76.5°C), an average pH of 9, and an average conductivity of 1972 uS/cm.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/geyser-activity.htm\">##View all geyser predictions</a></p> <p>Limited parking, especially 10 am-6 pm.</p> <h2>Name Origin</h2> <p>Members of the Washburn expedition of 1870 named this geyser for its consistent performance. Although its average interval has lengthened, Old Faithful is as spectacular as it was a century ago.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>The geyser is the centerpiece of the Old Faithful Historic District. The surrounding buildings are all set back from the geyser about the same distance: 1/8 mile (0.2 km). Only two buildings have been allowed to infringe upon this distance, established by Federal law: the Old Faithful Inn's east wing and the Old Faithful Lodge.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Wheelchair-accessible walkways lead from all parking areas to Old Faithful Geyser, and from the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center to other hydrothermal features.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A hydrothermal feature at the top of a low, barren hill that spouts water and steam at fairly regular intervals out of a wide, cone-shaped formation of rock. Pools of hot water surround the cone, and several runoff channels of hot water filled with colorful microscopic organisms generally called thermophiles run down the hillside. The hill is surrounded by a large viewing platform boardwalk with backless benches placed periodically along the boardwalk.",

    "bodyText": "<p>A national historic landmark, Old Faithful Inn is the most requested lodging facility in the park. Designed by Robert Reamer and built in 1903-1904 with local logs and stone, the inn is considered the largest log structure in the world. The towering lobby features a massive stone fireplace and a hand-crafted clock made of copper, wood and wrought iron serving as focal points. This reservable lodging facility is operated by a park partner.</p> <h2>2024 Season</h2> <ul> <li>May 3–October 14</li> </ul> <h2>History</h2> <p>After the only hotel in the Upper Geyser Basin burned down in 1894, park officials pressured the Yellowstone Park Association, which held the lease on the property, to replace it with something more substantial. In 1902, the president of the Yellowstone Park Association obtained financing from the Northern Pacific Railroad for a new hotel. The lobby, rising six stories beneath a steeply sloped roof, was flanked by a dining room and two three-story wings containing guest rooms.</p> <p>The Old Faithful Inn opened in 1904, and was equipped with electric lighting, but architect Robert Reamer designed the light fixtures to look like candlesticks. Both the electricity and the radiators were fueled by a steam generator. Evening meals were accompanied by a string quartet, and dancing was customary six nights a week. The east wing was added in 1919 and the west wing was added in 1927—both under Reamer's supervision.</p> <p>The Old Faithful Historic District, which includes the inn and many of the surrounding buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Like the inn, the district is historically significant because of its rustic architecture and its role in the development of concessions, including restaurants, to accommodate growing tourism in the early 1900s. The Old Faithful Inn was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. A major renovation program of the Old House was launched in 2004 to meet current building codes and restore the lobby so that it more closely replicates Reamer's original design.</p> <h2>Design</h2> <p>The Old Faithful Inn, named for the geyser, exemplifies the use of rustic architecture at a large scale to complement a natural landscape. The rhyolite that formed Yellowstone's caldera during volcanic upheavals provided the stone for the building's foundation, and local lodgepole pine the logs for its walls. Skilled craftsmen embellished the windows and stairways with gnarled wood selected for its inherent beauty. As designed by architect Robert Reamer, the inn combines rugged materials and organic motifs in a way that expresses both frontier sensibilities and elegance.</p> <h2>Dining</h2> <ul> <li>Dining Room: Breakfast and lunch as first-come, first-seated; dinner reservations recommended</li> <li>Lounge: Light food and beverages are available first-come, first-seated</li> <li>Bear Paw Deli: First-come, first-served snacks and ice cream</li> <li>Coffee Bar: Located on the second floor</li> <li>Bar: Located on the second floor</li> </ul> <h2>Suite</h2> <ul> <li>2 queen beds in bedroom</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower/tub combo, sink and toilet</li> <li>Well-appointed sitting room with refrigerator</li> </ul> <h2>Junior Suite</h2> <ul> <li>2 queen beds</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower/tub combo, sink and toilet</li> <li>Sitting area</li> </ul> <h2>Superior Hotel Room and Premium West-Wing Hotel Room</h2> <p>Face the geyser basin, but views can be interrupted by tree</p> <ul> <li>1 or 2 queen beds</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower or shower/tub combo, sink and toilet</li> </ul> <h2>Premium Hotel Room, Standard Hotel Room, & Old House Standard Room with Bath</h2> <ul> <li>1 or 2 queen beds</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower or shower/tub combo, sink, and toilet</li> <li>Modern furnishings</li> </ul> <h2>Old House Room without Bath</h2> <ul> <li>1, 2, or 3 queen beds</li> <li>Shared bathrooms with private showers located down the hall</li> <li>Vanity sink</li> </ul> <h2>Additional Details</h2> <ul> <li>No televisions, radios, and air conditioning available in any park lodging</li> <li>Gift shop and bike rental at entrance</li> </ul> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <ul> <li>8 ADA rooms available with bathroom grab bars, portable shower hose, and accessible toilet and sink</li> <li>Wheelchairs available for loan at the inn for guests or for rent at the Old Faithful Medical Clinic for $15 per day with a $300 deposit</li> <li>Wheelchair users may require assistance (no curb cut) to access lodge and cafeteria</li> <li>Designated accessible parking in front and rear of building</li> </ul> <h2>Reservations</h2> <ul> <li>307-344-7311</li> <li>307-344-5395 for TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) service</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.YellowstoneNationalParkLodges.com\">online</a></li> </ul>",

This reservable lodging facility is operated by a park partner.</p> <h2>National Historic District</h2> <p>The Old Faithful Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It includes the Old Faithful Inn and many of the surrounding buildings. The district is historically significant because of its rustic architecture and its role in the development of concessions to accommodate growing tourism in the early 1900s. The original Old Faithful Snow Lodge was built in 1958 and housed a dorm, restaurant, bar, and gift shop. It became winter lodging for visitors in 1971.

Before venturing into Yellowstone’s winter wonderland, make sure you have properly planned and are prepared for the challenges brought on by extreme cold and deep snow.</p> <ul> <li>Let friends or family know your itinerary.</li> <li>Do not travel alone.</li> <li>Evaluate your party’s and equipment's capabilities.</li> <li>Be prepared to make repairs.</li> <li>Carry and drink plenty of water, and bring high energy food.</li> <li>Be prepared to set up an emergency shelter.</li> <li>Bring a first-aid kit, space blanket, extra clothing, and headlamp.</li> <li>Carry and know how to use a map and compass.</li> <li>Use sunglasses or ski goggles and sunscreen.</li> </ul> <p><b>Clothing and Gear</b></p> <p>Even in severe winter temperatures, you can be comfortable and safe if you dress properly to prevent chilling and overheating. Wear clothes in several adjustable layers:</p> <ul> <li>Windproof, hooded outer layer</li> <li>Wool or other insulated garments underneath</li> <li>Wool or synthetic trousers</li> <li>Wool or synthetic long underwear</li> <li>Wind or rain pants for warmth on windy days</li> <li>Wool socks, gaiters, or overboots</li> <li>Wool gloves or mittens with waterproof shells.</li> </ul> <p>Avoid tight-fitting garments as they restrict circulation and increase the possibility of frostbite. Do <b>not</b> wear cotton clothes of any kind, including jeans, sweatshirts, underwear, socks. They retain moisture and put you at risk for hypothermia.</p> <p>Before you rent or borrow equipment, check for fit and suitability for wilderness use. Essential items for snowmobiling include a helmet, face mask, heavily insulated gloves or mittens, felt-lined boots, and a heavily insulated snowmobile suit. Choose skis and boots made for touring or mountaineering. Narrow racing skis may not give you enough surface area to break trail and low shoes may not have enough ankle support. On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</p> <h2>Winter Hazards</h2> <p>Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</p> <p>Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</p> <ul> <li>Check weather and avalanche forecasts. High winds and snow can create dangerous whiteout and high avalanche conditions where route finding may become difficult.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails in hydrothermal areas. Keep your distance from geysers, hot springs, or mudpots to avoid falling through overhanging snow ledges or thin crust.</li> <li>Know how to recognize avalanche terrain and avoid known avalanche paths. Avalanches are more likely to occur during or after heavy fresh snowfall, high winds, or extreme temperature changes.</li> <li>Take preventative measures to avoid the dangers of cold weather. Stay dry and learn how to recognize the signs of hypothermia and frostbite—they can set in quickly.</li> <li>Bears may be active at any time of year—be alert for signs of bear activity.</li> </ul> <h2>Winter Etiquette</h2> <ul> <li>Do not walk on snowshoe or ski trails.</li> <li>Snowshoe parallel to the ski track.</li> <li>Yield to faster skiers or those going downhill.</li> <li>Detour around wildlife—never approach.</li> <li>Stay on designated trails and boardwalks.</li> <li>Keep children close at hand.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings at all times.</li> <li>Keep your food secure—never feed wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Snowmobile Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>All snowmobilers must be led by a guide authorized by the National Park Service (NPS) to operate in Yellowstone National Park.</li> <li>All snowmobiles must meet NPS sound and emission requirements.</li> <li>Snowmobile operators must have a valid state motor vehicle driver’s license in possession. Learner permits are not sufficient.</li> <li>Roads are open only 7 am to 9 pm. Snowmobiles are not allowed to operate in the park between 9 pm and 7 am.</li> <li>Maximum speed limit is 35 mph for snowmobiles, 25 mph for snowcoaches, or less where posted or as conditions warrant.</li> <li>Use hand signals when turning or stopping.</li> <li>Allow enough distance between snowmobiles when traveling.</li> <li>Pass only when safe.</li> <li>If you turn around, stay within the road width.</li> <li>Drive in single file, on the right side of the road even if the road is rough.</li> <li>When stopping, pull to the far right and park in single file.</li> <li>Do not idle your machine more than three minutes.</li> <li>Stay on designated roads. Side-hilling, berm-riding, or any off-road travel is prohibited and carries a fine of up to $5,000.</li> <li>Report accidents to a ranger.</li> <li>Operating a snowmobile while intoxicated is illegal. Possession of open alcoholic beverage containers, including bota bags, is illegal.</li> </ul> <p><b>Wild animals have the right of way.</b> If bison or other wildlife are on the road, stop at least 25 yards away (100 yards for wolves or bears). Pull your machine as far as possible to the opposite side of the road and give them a chance to move off the road.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Orange Spring Mound 324 words The paved roadway overlooking Orange Spring Mound is edged with a timber, or log, border that separates you from this feature. A small sign affixed to one log reads: “Danger. Fragile Thermal Area. Keep Out.” A wayside panel at the site is entitled “Orange Spring Mound.” In the panel’s upper right corner is a small color photo of a wide round-topped mound of mineral deposits some 30 to 40 feet high, pale white and yellow with darker orange streaks running vertically throughout. Text below the photo tells us: “Heat-dwelling bacteria and algae grow abundantly in Orange Spring Mound's water, creating tapestries of ‘living color.’\" More text below the panel’s title reads: “Hot water flows over the mound after bubbling through several vents along the top.” Below this text is a large drawing of the mound, which is depicted as largely white and dotted with short squiggly gray lines. There are also three thin blue channels running upward to the mound’s top edge. Small white circles are scattered inside these channels. Below this drawing is a smaller drawing labeled “Deep Origins” that shows a cross-section of the mound’s internal structure. Three areas of this cross-section are numbered, starting with a thin dark-brown band at the bottom of the drawing. The accompanying text reads: “1. Yellowstone's volcano heats water deep underground.” The next labeled section is largely white and dotted with angular thin gray lines. This section lies in the middle of the cross-section, above a horizontal pool of water. There is a water channel running through it vertically. Text reads: “2. Under great pressure, the water percolates upward through buried limestone, dissolving a mineral called calcium carbonate.” The top-most section is the white mound itself. The accompanying text reads: “3. Above ground, the water begins to cool and evaporate. Gasses are released and water pressure decreases. Orange Spring Mound gradually grows as the water flows over it, depositing calcium carbonate, or travertine.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Otter Creek Picnic Area<br />745 words<br />There are 4 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (210 words)<br />You are standing in front of the first of two wayside exhibits located in Otter Creek Picnic Area. The first wayside, entitled \"A Bear's Picnic,\" features three color photos of a bear searching for food, first digging a hole beside a downed log, then by ducking its head into the hole. Bands of melting snow dot the green grass surrounding the bear. Text to the right of the title tells us:<br /> \"All in a Day's Work. Hunting, digging, uprooting boulders and scouring logs...bears spend a lot of time foraging for edibles. Guided by a keen sense of smell and using their claws as tools, they eat plants and animals, large and small. Curious and intelligent, bears have an excellent memory for food sources and work hard for nourishment.<br /><br />\"These traits serve bears well when they eat a natural diet, but if bears obtain human food, they may aggressively search for more--putting you, others and the bear in grave danger. Never feed a bear!\"<br /><br />To the left of the photos is a drawing of a tree with short branches. A caption to the right of the tree reads:<br /><br />\"The whitebark pine is a long-lived, slow-growing tree of high elevation forests. The pine seeds provide a high-fat, high-energy food for bears.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (162 words)<br />Spanning across the bottom of the panel is a wide box with the subtitle \"What do bears eat?\" Text below the title reads: <br /><br />\"Spring:<br /><br />\"Winter-killed carcasses<br />\"Elk calves<br />\"Earthworms<br />\"Tender grass shoots<br />\"Clover<br />\"Dandelions<br />\"Ants<br />\"Pocket gophers<br />\"Summer:<br /><br />\"Elk and bison calves<br />\"Spawning cutthroat trout<br />\"Thistles<br />\"Fireweed<br />\"Mushrooms<br />\"Moths<br />\"Berries<br />\"Clover<br />\"Ants<br /><br /><br />\"Fall:<br /><br />\"Buffaloberries<br />\"Whortleberries<br />\"Whitebark pine seeds<br />\"Insect nests<br />\"Starchy tubers and roots<br />\"Rose hips<br />\"Mushrooms<br /><br />\"Winter:<br /><br />\"Both black and grizzly bears hibernate during the winter. They generally do not eat or drink during this time; instead, they live off a layer of fat built up during the summer and fall.\"<br /><br />Also in this text box are small photos of a brown wolf, a brown and beige speckled moth, and a rose hip, which resembles a small red berry. Two captions tell us:<br /><br />\"Bears also depend on wolf-killed bison and elk in spring, summer, and fall.<br /><br />\"Grizzly bears may eat up to 40,000 army cutworm moths a day in late summer.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (211 words)<br />The second wayside exhibit, entitled \"Bears Need Your Concern,\" features a large close-up color photo of a massive brown bear that appears to be looking straight at us. Text at the top of the wayside tells us: <br />\"Enjoy your picnic and remember...<br /><br />\"Bears need your concern, not your food!<br /><br />\"Bears become dangerous when they obtain human food. Stay safe--and help protect Yellowstone bears!\"<br /><br />On the panel's right side are two subtitles, each followed by instructions highlighted with bullet points:<br /><br />\"If a bear approaches the picnic area:<br /><br />\"Make noise, bang pots, yell, or honk your car horn to alert the bear to your presence. <br /><br />\"If the bear continues toward the picnic area, take all of your food and trash, get into your car, and alert other people in the area of the bear's presence.<br /><br />\"If a bear enters the picnic area:<br /><br />\"Do not run!<br /><br />\"If the bear is not threatening you, take all of your food and trash and get into your car.<br /><br />\"If you do not have time to safely gather your food and garbage, get into your car without it.<br /><br />\"If the bear shows interest in the food on your table, honk your car horn. This may scare the bear away.<br /><br />\"If the bear approaches your car, drive away.\"<br /><br />Section 4 (136 words)<br /><br />Located at the bottom of the panel is a box with the subtitle \"Grizzly or Black Bear?\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"Color can range from black to brown to cinnamon to blond for both grizzly and black bears. Grizzly bears frequently sport white-tipped fur, giving a grizzled, silver-tipped appearance.\"<br />To the left of this text is a drawing of a brown grizzly bear accompanied with the following labels: \"rump is usually lower than shoulders; hump at shoulder; dished-in face; long, straight claws.\"<br /><br />To the right of the text is a drawing of the smaller and darker black bear with these labels: \"Straight profile; rump is higher than shoulder; short, curved claws.\"<br /><br />One final message at the bottom of the panel instructs us: \"Report all bear encounters to the nearest Ranger Station or Visitor Center.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>Water flows in crisscrossing patterns down a steep ridge where colorful thermophiles create a changing palette dominated by hues of orange and brown.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>The trail from the Lower to Upper terraces includes steep boardwalks and several hundred stairs. <b>This strenuous trail is not recommended for people with heart, lung, or other health conditions.</b> Consider driving to the Upper Terrace Drive for an alternate view of the area.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

After the Army endured five cold, harsh winters, Congress appropriated $50,000 for a permanent post.</p> <h2>Winter in Yellowstone</h2> <p>As soon as the first heavy snow fell, the entire community commuted on skis. Some sidewalks were shoveled, but skis were crucial to leaving the house. The porches of the officers' quarters were lined with skis—from long to short. The officers bought new skis regularly for their children, just as they did new shoes.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Riverside Station, December 3, 1898... Left here for the Post [Fort Yellowstone] the Sunday before Thanksgiving.... I made 26 miles the first day, staying all night at Norris Station. The next morning it was 22 degrees below zero, but I pulled out for the post, which I reached about two p.m. after a cold hard ride of 20 miles. It is not so much sport riding when the snow is so deep that your horse has to work all the time. Stayed at the Post for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a beaut. The cook more than threw himself. Turkey, roast pork, sweet spuds, cranberry sauce, oyster stew, chocolate, three kinds of cake, pie, pickles, nuts and apples--how's that for soldiers? ... There is something about this life in the wilderness that fascinates me. I saddle my beast, and go off on long rides through the forest where everything is so quiet that one can almost hear the solitude.... Love to all the family and Mable, and regards to friends, Edwin.</em><br /> –Private Edwin Kelsey, to his niece</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Parade Ground 255 words You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit at side of a wide lawn edged by sagebrush. The exhibit is entitled “The Parade Ground” and features a large black-and-white photo of this same lawn, where two rows of uniformed men stand at attention in the field. Text directly below the title tells us: “Gathering place, training ground, site of ceremonies and parades-the drill field was the focal point of daily life at Fort Yellowstone.” Most of the men hold rifles, and all but two wear thick white spats. One soldier standing apart and to the side holds a long saber in the air. It is captioned in handwriting, “2nd Lieutenant Johnathan M. Wainwright Officer of day. 1st U.S. Cavalry.” More text reads: “Each day began early with a bugler sounding reveille. Gradually, the fort came to life, and another bugle call brought horse-mounted soldiers trotting onto the field for the flag raising. Assignments were announced and troopers headed out to patrol Mammoth Hot Springs terraces. Those remaining behind assumed the never-ending task of caring for the post’s horses, guard duty, or a work detail. “At dusk, the bugler called all troopers back to the field for the lowering of the flag, and the day was concluded with a cannon firing from the top of Capitol Hill (to your left). Taps was played as lights winked out and quiet settled over the fort.” A notation in the exhibit’s bottom left corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

When in the 'Penta-Churn mode' of activity, Penta eruptions can be daily, but in years that the Sawmill Complex is in the more common 'Sawmill mode,' eruptions are rare. Penta Geyser has a main vent with a small, built up sinter cone, with several smaller vents in the surrounding solidified sinter. Water level changes with activity of other connected geysers in the complex.</p> <p>Penta Geyser has an average temperate of 185°F (85°C), an average pH of 8.7, and an average conductivity of 2176 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

The wayside is entitled \"Norris Geyser Basin: Porcelain Landscape.\" Text below the title reads:<br /><br />\"The sweeping view before you is named for its porcelain-like appearance-smooth sinter deposited by centuries of thermal activity, continually glazed by minerals, hot water, and living microorganisms called thermophiles.\"<br /><br />Below this text are two small color photos. The photo on top is captioned \"Porcelain Basin\" and shows a panoramic view of the area; the photo below is captioned \"Iron-rich hot spring\" and depicts several vents surrounded by rusty-red mineral deposits. <br /><br />Below the photos is the title \"Norris Notes\" followed by three sentences highlighted with bullet points:<br /><br />\"Like most geyser basins, Norris is lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain-located in a bowl or basin.<br /><br />\"Iron is common here-one cause of rust color in the basin.<br /><br /><br />\"Although many Yellowstone thermal features are alkaline, numerous geysers and hot springs at Norris Geyser Basin are acidic.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (188 words)<br /><br /><br />Also on the panel is a large map drawing with Back Basin in the map's center and Porcelain Basin above Back Basin at the top of the map, or to the north. A red dot and the words \"You Are Here\" indicate your location at the trail entrance to Porcelain Basin, just north of the Norris Geyser Basin Museum. <br /><br />Also labeled on the map are the various thermal features located in Porcelain Basin, moving north and clockwise from your location: Whale's Mouth, Pinwheel Geyser, Whirligig Geyser, Constant Geyser, Colloidal Pool, Sunday Geyser, Hurricane Vent, Congress Pool, Ledge Geyser, and Black Growler Steam Vent. To the east of Colloidal Pool is Porcelain Springs, located alongside the trail leading east and then northeast toward Norris Campground and Museum of the National Park Ranger. Note that three parking lots and three restrooms are located southeast of the museum.<br /><br />At the bottom of the panel is another color photo of the alternately pale yellow and rusty-red landscape in Norris Geyser Basin. <br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (177 words)<br /><br />Another wayside exhibit is entitled \"Dangerous Ground.\" At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder-who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the panel warns us: <br />\"In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred.<br />\"Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal.<br />\"Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build.

    "audioDescription": "Porcelain Springs<br />214 words<br />You are facing Porcelain Springs, located in the Porcelain Basin side of Norris Geyser Basin. A boardwalk loop with railings leads alongside the springs; there is a long wooden bench placed on the boardwalk overlooking this site. <br /><br />Also overlooking the site is a wayside exhibit entitled \"Porcelain Springs: Influencing a Landscape.\" Text below the title reads:<br /><br />\"The milky color of the mineral deposited here inspired the naming of Porcelain Basin and Porcelain Springs. The mineral, siliceous sinter, is brought to the surface by hot water and forms a sinter \"sheet\" over this flat area as the water flows across the ground and the mineral settles out. This is the fastest changing area in Norris Geyser Basin, and siliceous sinter is one of the agents of change. If the mineral seals off a hot spring or geyser by accumulating in its vent, the hot, pressurized water may flow underground to another weak area and blow through it.\"<br /><br />On the exhibit's right side is a photo of low, pale brown mounds surrounding a geyser basin. The caption below the photo tells us:<br /><br />\"Siliceous sinter is also called geyserite.

    "audioDescription": "Porkchop Geyser<br />340 words<br /><br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br /><br />Section 1 (184 words)<br /><br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit overlooking Porkchop Geyser, located in Norris Geyser Basin's Back Basin. The wayside is entitled \"Porkchop Geyser\" and features a large color photo depicting a tall column of water and steam erupting from a small geyser crater.<br /><br />On the panel's left side are three smaller color photos arranged one above the other. The topmost photo shows Porkchop Geyser's crater filled with water. The pool's wider end is round; the narrow section on its opposite end resembles a short handle or tail. The caption reads:<br /><br />\"Shaped like a porkchop, this quiet spring was named \"Dr. Morey's Porkchop\" in 1961. But this calm spring held many surprises, beginning with an eruption in 1971.\"<br /><br />The next photo shows a small opening in Porkchop's dry crater. The caption tells us:<br /><br />\"For the next 14 years, Porkchop occasionally erupted through its tiny vent, earning the name â€˜Porkchop Geyser.'\"<br /><br />The bottom photo shows a column of water and steam erupting from this same geyser vent. The caption reads:<br /><br />\"In 1985, Porkchop Geyser erupted and did not stop until exploding several years later!\"<br /><br />Section 2 (138 words)<br /><br />Another color photo in the panel's bottom right corner shows several jagged rocks standing nearly upright around the steaming geyser. Text accompanying the caption \"Blown Apart\" tells us:<br /><br />\"Imagine a geyser exploding and hurling rocks toward you. That happened to eight park visitors on September 5, 1989. Porkchop's narrow vent became constricted, throttling its flow of water and steam. Heat and pressure intensified until Porkchop blew up, throwing rocks more than 200 feet.<br />\"Fortunately, the astonished visitors were not hurt. The upended rocks you see today are a result of the small hydrothermal explosion they witnessed. Porkchop's eruptions are now rare-sometimes years apart. Nobody knows what other surprises Porkchop has in store-only time will tell.\"<br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom left corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Post Exchange 291 words An exhibit is situated beneath the branches of a large aspen tree growing adjacent to a clapboard-sided building with built-in lower story made of brick with windows. The building is divided into three sections as it extends to the rear, and has 14 large windows along the side of the building from front to back. The front of the building has an airy portico that is delineated by 12 columns. A small wooden sign hangs beside the front door with routed words: “Canteen” and “Credit Union.” The exhibit is titled “The Post Exchange.” This exhibit features a large black-and-white photo of a wood paneled room with two tables, three men seated at each table. The men are holding tall beverage bottles and drinking glasses. A man standing beside one table holds a drink in one hand and a fan of playing cards in the other; one of the men seated at the table is wearing a fur hat and also holds cards. Another man wearing a small bow tie and dark vest over his white shirt stands behind the tall wood bar stretching left and right behind the tables. On the wall above the bar is a large rectangular picture or a mirror with a reflection. In the foreground is a portion of a wood stove with “U.S” stamped in its side. Text to the right of the title reads: “At the Post Exchange, a soldier with free time could spend it in the gymnasium or bowling alley, or could play cards and drink beer. There may also have been a billiards table, and movies were shown once a week. The building was informally known (and still is) as the Canteen, probably due to the army-sanctioned beverages that were available.” END OF MESSAGE",

Early park accounts indicate Punch Bowl Spring may have been a geyser, but no exact dates are recorded and no mention of an eruption has occurred since the early 1900s. Punch Bowl Spring’s activity has remained relatively constant for the last 100 years.</p> <p>Punch Bowl Spring has an average temperate of 197.8°F (92.1°C), an average pH of 7.5, and an average conductivity of 2164 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Color & Heat Lovers</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features are also habitats in which microscopic organisms survive and thrive. They are called thermophiles: \"thermo\" for heat and \"phile\" for lover.</p> <p>Although they are too small to be seen with the naked eye, trillions are grouped together and appear as masses of color. They are nourished by energy and chemical building blocks.</p> <p><b>Colorless and yellow</b> thermophiles grow in the hottest water.</p> <p><b>Orange, brown, and green</b> thermophiles grow in cooler waters.</p> <p>Imagine living in near-boiling temperatures, in hydrothermal features with the alkalinity of baking soda, or in water so acidic that it can burn holes in clothing. Microorganisms in Yellowstone need these extremes to survive.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",
    "audioDescription": "Punch Bowl Spring 458 words There are 2 sections in this description. Section 1 (175 words) Punch Bowl Spring is located in the Daisy Group of Upper Geyser Basin. Standing alone in partly wooded terrain, this boiling spring is so named for the circular sinter rim--about 8 feet in diameter and 30 inches high--that both surrounds the blue spring and raises it above the basin floor as if in a bowl. You may reach Punch Bowl Spring via a wood boardwalk without handrails leading from the paved trail. A wayside exhibit features one color drawing and several color photos of not only Punch Bowl Spring but other thermal features in the area. The exhibit is entitled “Punch Bowl Spring.” Text below the title tells us: “Heat, water, and minerals have combined to create the delicately scalloped rim surrounding Punch Bowl Spring. Another important element is the behavior of the thermal feature. The circulation of water, amount of runoff or surging, and style of eruptions (if any) all determine where mineral is deposited and in what particular form. Punch Bowl's activity has remained relatively constant for the last 100 years.” Section 2 ( 264 words) A photo below this text depicts a bubbling spring surrounded by jagged gray, white, and yellowish-brown rock. The caption reads: “Punch Bowl Spring.” A block of text to the right of the photo is entitled “Active Sculpture.” The text explains: “Like all thermal features in Yellowstone, hot water circulating deep within the earth dissolves minerals from surrounding rock. As this water reaches the surface, it cools and the mineral resolidifies into sinter, a silica-rich rock of greyish-white color, or in the Mammoth area, into travertine, a calcium-rich rock. Sinter deposits build up very slowly. Rates vary wildly, but average around 1 to 2 inches every 100 years. Travertine, however, builds up much more quickly, at times up to 1 inch a week.” A large drawing at the panel’s top right depicts the jagged-edged sinter rim, grayish-white in color, surrounding what resembles a bubbling cauldron of pale gray water. The caption above the drawing reads: “The scalloped edges of Punch Bowl Spring.” A small photo below the drawing depicts a steaming geyser with a cone-shaped rock in its center. The caption reads: “Grotto Geyser, Upper Geyser Basin.” Another larger photo to the right shows a tall, pointed cone of jagged gray granite. The caption reads: “Liberty Cap, Mammoth Hot Springs.” Below are two more photos: on the left, a large gray cone of geyserite labeled “Giant Geyser, Upper Geyser Basin”; on the right, an orange-tinged photo of the splashing “Great Fountain Geyser, Lower Geyser Basin.” A notation in the bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>Red Spouter formed as a direct result of the 1959 Hebgen Lake Earthquake. A vent opened up in this spot, which then turned into a mudpot. This hydrothermal feature does change seasonally, depending on the height of the water table beneath the surface. When the water table is high, it bubbles as a mudpot. When the water table drops, it reverts back to its origins as a fumarole.</p> <h2>Mudpots</h2> <p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area’s smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas.</p> <p>Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

As of November 2015, its eruption interval was 6 hours 20 min (+/- 30 min), with an eruption length of 20 minutes and reaching 75 feet (24 m). high. Riverside Geyser has an average temperate of 96.1°F (35.6°C), an average pH of 9.1, and an average conductivity of 1993 uS/cm.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/geyser-activity.htm\">View all geyser predictions</a></p> <p>In summer, yellow-bellied marmots are frequently seen in the rocks behind near Riverside Geyser.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Cone or Fountain Geyser?</h2> <p><b>Cone geysers</b> erupt in a narrow jet of water, usually from a cone.</p> <p><b>Fountain geysers</b> shoot water in various directions, typically from a pool. A fountain geyser has a large opening at the surface that usually fills with water before or during an eruption. Steam bubbles rising through the pool during the eruption cause separate bursts of water that generally spray out in all directions.</p> <p>Fountain geysers are the most common type of geyser and can range from very small to very large.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",
    "audioDescription": "Riverside Geyser 339 words Also located within the Upper Geyser Basin is Riverside Geyser, a hot spring with a low semicircular cone situated on the bank of the Firehole River. A paved walkway with a series of benches leads to this site; a small sign overlooking the geyser itself tells us on what days and between which hours it is most likely to erupt. You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled “Riverside Geyser,” which features a large color photo showing a cloud of white steam billowing from the geyser. A rainbow of pale yellows and blues arcs from right to left in front of the geyser’s cone. In the photo’s background is a grassy riverbank dotted with spindly evergreen trees. Text below the title tells us: “Across the Firehole River is Riverside Geyser, one of the most predictable and consistent geysers in Yellowstone. Beginning an hour or two before an eruption, water pours over the cone's edge, and splashing and bubbling become more visible. Then, water and steam arch over the river to heights of 75 feet. The eruption will last about 22 minutes. As the water diminishes during the eruption, steam continues to billow out, and, when the light is right, rainbows often form in the misty air.” Two “Fast Facts” highlighted with bullet points tell us: “Riverside Geyser is a cone-type geyser. “Eruptions are very predictable, taking place every 5.5 to 7.5 hours.” A second title on the exhibit reads: “Why is Riverside Geyser so Predictable?” The text below tells us: “Unlike many other geysers and hot springs in the Upper Geyser Basin, Riverside may not be connected to nearby features and, thus, has a relatively constant source of heat and water. It is also uniquely unaffected by other forces such as earthquakes, which can shake up underground plumbing systems by closing old channels, creating new ones, and changing previous patterns of water circulation.” A notation in the exhibit’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.” END OF MESSAGE",

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the number, size, and power of the fumaroles was much greater than today.</p> <h3>Fumaroles (Steam Vents)</h3> <p>Fumaroles or steam vents, are the hottest hydrothermal features in the park. The limited amount of water flashes into steam before reaching the surface. The result is a loud hissing of steam and gases.</p> <h3>Norris Geyser Basin</h3> <p>Norris Geyser Basin is one of the hottest and most acidic of Yellowstone's hydrothermal areas.<br /> <br /> It is outside of the most recent Yellowstone caldera, but inside the first and largest caldera. It sits on the intersection of three major faults and is a very active earthquake area.<br /> <br /> Even small earthquakes can trigger changes in hydrothermal behavior. This sudden activity is known as a \"thermal disturbance\" and can last a few days, or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to \"normal.\"<br /> <br /> Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone's hydrothermal areas. The water chemistry changes as the water levels of underground hot water reservoirs fluctuates.<br /> <br /> Although Norris is known for its acid features, it also has alkaline hot springs and geysers.</p> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>Large parking pullout.

    "audioDescription": "Roaring Mountain<br />614 words<br />There are 3 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (330 words)<br /><br /><br />You are facing Roaring Mountain, a bare hillside with steam rising from vents across a flat, fragile thermal expanse with a few dead trees. In cooler weather, plumes of steam resembling smoke are visible wafting upward from the mountain, which has a whitish-gray cast. Rocks protrude from a paved walkway.<br /><br />Standing beside a low stone wall separating a paved area from the rugged landscape is a large wayside exhibit in a kiosk made of round logs shaded by a shingled gable roof. The exhibit, which sits atop a stone base, has two panels. The background image of both panels is steam rising from the hillside. <br /><br />Section 2 (246 words)<br /><br />The panel on the left is entitled \"Roaring Mountain.\" A large inset photo at the bottom depicts the mountain nearly obscured from view by several clouds of rising steam. <br /><br />Text below the title reads:<br />\"Living Landscape. Amid Roaring Mountain's steam and sulfur-rich gases, microscopic organisms are hard at work. This barren slope, inhospitable to humans, is the perfect home for Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. Billions upon billions of these thermophiles live here, wearing away the mountain.\"<br />A second title reads \"What's for Dinner?\" followed by:<br />\"Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, hardy residents of Roaring Mountain, live on hydrogen sulfide gas escaping from below. They consume the gas, helping to convert it into sulfuric acid. The acid breaks the mountain's volcanic rock into clay, accelerating erosion. Small, but mighty in numbers, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius help shape Roaring Mountain.\"<br />A small box to the right of this text provides more information: <br />\"The Name Says it All--Sulfolobus acidocaldarius\"<br />Each line of text progresses from yellow to orange.<br />\"Sulfo = Sulfur-eating<br />\"Lobus = Round or lobe-shaped<br />\"Acido = Adapted to living in an acidic place<br />\"Caldarius = A hot place, such as a cauldron\"<br />A small photograph below the box is entitled \"Mountain Residents.\" It has a dark gray background with small black dots labeled \"Sulfolobus acidocaldarius\" floating beside larger white circles labeled \"clay particles.\" The caption tells us: <br />\"As seen through a microscope, tiny, dark Sulfolobus acidocaldarius float in a sea of bright clay particles. These heat-loving microbes convert gases into acid, then the acid dissolves rock into clay.\" <br />Section 3 (252 words)<br />The panel on the exhibit's right side is entitled \"Fumaroles\" and features a drawing of a tall plume of gray steam rising out of a small opening, or vent, in the Earth's surface. The brown graphic represents the area underground. Text below the title reads:<br />\"Letting off Steam. Listen intently for the hiss of steam escaping the mountain. Fumaroles are sometimes barely audible, but sometimes roar as steam rushes upward through narrow vents. During the 1800s, Roaring Mountain was, at times, heard four miles away at Obsidian Cliff.\"<br />A small photo below this text shows the craggy gray ground around a fumarole. Text below the photo tells us:<br />\"As hydrogen sulfide and sulfur gases escape the underworld, yellow sulfur crystals are sometimes left where gases mix with air. Sulfur-eating thermophiles may reside at the vents, assisting with the formation of sulfur. <br />\"Scientists are discovering the amazing tenacity of life. Because organisms live and prosper in hot, gaseous conditions on Earth, perhaps even extreme environments of other worlds can support life.\" <br />More text in the panel's bottom left corner explains:<br />\"A fumarole or steam vent's underground plumbing system is nearly dry. The small amount of heated water in the vent bursts into steam, and is forcefully expelled with other gases.\"<br />A notation in the panel's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant to the Yellowstone Park Foundation from NASA Astrobiology Institute and Lockheed Martin Space Operations.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<h2>2024 Season</h2> <ul> <li>June 7–September 2</li> </ul> <p>Roosevelt Lodge Cabins, built in 1920 near Yellowstone’s Tower Falls area, is named after Yellowstone-enthusiast: President Theodore Roosevelt. The rustic cabins and family-style dining are a favorite of families and anglers alike, and the front porch rocking chairs give guests an opportunity to rock their stress to sleep and awaken their “Old West spirit.” A large corral operation offers horseback trail rides, stagecoach adventures, and a popular cookout. This reservable lodging facility is operated by a park partner.</p> <h2>Campsites to Lodges</h2> <p>Indians, fur trappers, and explorers on the Bannock Trail camped in this area where a sagebrush meadow was encircled by Douglas fir, quaking aspen, and a mountain stream tumbled toward the Yellowstone River. President Chester Arthur camped here in 1883. In 1906, the Wylie Permanent Camping Company built a tent camp that became known as \"Camp Roosevelt,\" though Theodore Roosevelt never camped there. The tents were replaced by a lodge and cabins in the 1920s. Park lodges and cabins were built to accommodate the increasing number of visitors arriving in their own automobiles who wanted something more than a tent, but less expensive and formal than the park's hotels. During the 1920s and 1930s, the old hotels often stood empty while the new lodges overflowed with visitors.</p> <h2>Dudes & Scientists</h2> <p>Camp Roosevelt provided the atmosphere of a dude ranch and was a base for fishing parties and saddle-horse trips. It also served as a field laboratory where teachers and their students could conduct research at minimum expense, a purpose that the first director of the National Park Service was promoting for the parks. In what was a forerunner to the educational programs found in the parks today, the National Park Service hired a naturalist at Grinnell College to present lectures and conduct daily field trips for Camp Roosevelt visitors and collect botanical specimens for the park museum. Scientists based near conducted studies on the park's wildlife. From 1921 to 1923, the lodge was the headquarters for a boy's summer camp run by Alvin Whitney of the New York State School of Forestry at Syracuse University.</p> <h2>National Historic District</h2> <p>The Roosevelt Lodge Historic District, which includes 130 buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, with a period of significance from 1906 to 1948. The lodge, constructed of un-peeled logs and completed in 1920, was originally surrounded by 43 small log cabins, the first of which were completed in 1922. Over the years, the Roosevelt Lodge area became a repository for guest cabins brought from areas in the park where they were no longer wanted. By 1982, the corral had been moved farther from the cabins, of which there were now 110 of four main types.</p> <p>The area has undergone intermittent expansion and changes as visitor use has changed and facilities have aged over the years. The architectural appearance of the original lodge is retained only in the interior and exterior of the front portion (the lounge and dining room); the other sections of the building have been modified. The accommodations are still rustic, with unpaved roads into and around the lodge and cabins. Although the Grand Loop Road can be seen from the corral, which is not part of the historic district, it is obscured from view of the lodge and most of the cabins by a stand of mature trees.</p> <h2>Dining</h2> <ul> <li>Dining Room: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner as first-come, first-seated</li> <li>Cookout: Ride to dinner and songs by horseback or in a wagon, with reservations required (June 7–September 2)</li> </ul> <h2>Frontier Cabins</h2> <ul> <li>2 double beds</li> <li>Private bathroom with shower, toilet and sink</li> </ul> <h2>Roughrider Cabins</h2> <ul> <li>Sparsely furnished rustic cabins</li> <li>1 or 2 double beds</li> <li>Heat with wood-burning stove (2 “presto” logs are provided for use)</li> <li>Communal showers and bathrooms are located nearby</li> </ul> <h2>Additional Details</h2> <ul> <li>No televisions, radios, and air conditioning available in any park lodging</li> <li>Trail rides available June 2–September 10</li> <li>Stagecoach rides available June 2–September 10</li> </ul> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <ul> <li>2 ADA cabins available</li> <li>Wheelchair-accessible services in lodge building</li> <li>Designated accessible parking in front</li> <li>Wheelchair-accessible entrance is on the west (left) side of the lodge</li> </ul> <h2>Reservations:</h2> <ul> <li>307-344-7311</li> <li>307-344-5395 for TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) service</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.YellowstoneNationalParkLodges.com\">online</a></li> </ul>",

The exhibit is entitled \"Seasons of the Range\" and features four color photos showing, from left to right, two bears foraging in green grass and foliage, a lone bison grazing in yellowish grass, a large bull elk standing in front of thick evergreen trees, and several wolves walking across snow. Below the title are four subtitles followed by text that tells us:<br />\"A Time of Renewal. Northern range wildlife grow strong in spring after a long, cold winter. Melting snow and rain turn the landscape green and lush. Bears emerge hungry from their winter dens, eager to feed on roots and grasses, winter-killed carcasses, and sometimes elk or bison calves.<br /><br />\"The Living is Easy. Summer is short-by August the grass is dry and brown. Bison and a few elk graze in the meadows, but most of the elk are higher in the mountains where the plants are still green. Coyotes are often seen hunting for small mammals. Birds are everywhere, singing and soaring high on thermal winds.<br /><br />\"Autumn Days. In the warm days and crisp, cool nights of fall, the aspens turn golden and snow falls on the mountain peaks. The bugling of bull elk is a common sound as the herds return to the valleys for their mating season. All the animals are busy eating and storing fat for the lean winter days ahead.<br /><br />\"A Long Winter. When temperatures drop, large herds of elk and bison make their winter home in these spacious valleys. The snow is not quite as deep here as in the rest of the park. For many months these hardy mammals dig through snow to eat hidden forage. Wolves hunt among these herds, moving easily on top of the snow because of their large paws.\"<br /><br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom right corner reads: \" This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from the Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

Avoid surprising a bear by calling out and clapping your hands at regular intervals to make your presence known. Carry Bear Spray. Carry bear spray and know how to use it. Keep it immediately available, not inside your pack. Hike in Groups. Travel in groups of 3 or more is recommended. Stay with your group at all times. What to do if you encounter a bear. Stay calm, do not run. Quietly detour or back away; stop if this seems to agitate the bear. Stay at least 100 yards (91 m) from bears. Do NOT feed bears or other animals. What to do if a bear charges you. Stand still, do not run. Stand your ground and use your bear spray. Spray when the bear is 60 feet (18 m) away or closer. If a bear charges, it may be a bluff charge. What to do if a bear makes contact. Drop to the ground; play dead. Lie face down and clasp your hands over the back of your neck; stay still and silent. Wait several minutes after the bear leaves before getting up and leaving the area.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Silex Spring is named for the large amount of silica found in and around this feature. Silex is Latin for silica. Silica comes from the underlying volcanic rocks, which the hot waters dissolve. This silica is then deposited as sinter, which lines the pool and forms terraces along the runoff channels.</p> <p>The large runoff channels the boardwalk followed from the parking lot are formed from Silex Spring. Thermophiles thrive in these hot waters, which in turn give the channels such a variety of textures and colors. Silex Spring has an average temperate of 174.7°F (79.3°C), an average pH of 8.4, and an average conductivity of 2000 uS/cm. It last erupted in 2006.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

The small pool is set in the solidified sinter ground area with geyserite texture along the vent area. Water from Crystal Spring runs into Slurp Geyser and continues to run down the slight hill of sinter.</p> <p>Slurp Geyser has an average temperate of 178°F (81.1°C), an average pH of 8.7, and an average conductivity of 2071 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

What to do if a bear charges you. Stand still, do not run. Stand your ground and use your bear spray. Spray when the bear is 60 feet (18 m) away or closer. If a bear charges, it may be a bluff charge. What to do if a bear makes contact. Drop to the ground; play dead. Lie face down and clasp your hands over the back of your neck; stay still and silent. Wait several minutes after the bear leaves before getting up and leaving the area.",

An active geyser since the early years of the park, Solitary Geyser is a clear, blue pool with a geyserite rim. Shallow sinter shelves around the main pool are filled with orange and yellow thermophiles that continue along the runoff channels. Rims of geyserite line the runoff channels as well. Eruption intervals are in the 4–8 minute range.</p> <p>Solitary Geyser has an average temperate of 182.8°F (83.8°C), an average pH of 6.7, and an average conductivity of 1790 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

Afterward, it will resume splashing water up to three feet (0.9 m) into the air. It has an average temperate of 191.5°F (88.6°C), an average pH of 7.4, and an average conductivity of 2000 uS/cm. The eruption interval for Spasm Geyser is in the range of hours.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts<p< p=\"\"> .</p<></p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Spasmodic Geyser, a fountain geyser, is a joy to experience due to its nearly-constant activity. While it never erupts very high—less than 10 feet (3 m)—it has over twenty vents, so it always seems to be bursting, bubbling, and splashing. Orange thermophile occur further away from the pool in the outflow channel. Spasmodic Geyser drains into the Firehole River. Eruption intervals are in the 1–3 hour range.</p> <p>Spasmodic Geyser has an average temperate of 191.8°F (88.8°C), an average pH of 8.6, and an average conductivity of 2117 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p>",

Days, months, or years pass between the major eruptions of Steamboat Geyser.</p> <p>Steamboat Geyser’s major eruptions (more than 300 feet high) are unpredictable and often many years apart. Its frequent “minor phase” eruptions eject water 10 to 40 feet high.</p> <p>For hours following its rare 3 to 40 minute major eruptions, Steamboat thunders with steam. Full eruptions are unpredictable.</p> <p>Steamboat Geyser and Cistern are linked underground, confirmed in 1983 when Cistern Spring began emptying after each major eruption of Steamboat.</p> <p>Only Waimangu Geyser in New Zealand has rocketed to greater heights—but not in more than one hundred years. In Yellowstone National Park's recorded history, only two other geysers have exceeded Steamboat in size: Excelsior Geyser in Midway Geyser Basin and Sapphire Pool in Biscuit Basin.</p> <h2>Eruption History Since 2000</h2> <ul> <li>10 in 2022 ( as of November 17)</li> <li>20 in 2021</li> <li>48 in 2020</li> <li>48 in 2019</li> <li>32 in 2018</li> <li>1 in 2014 (9/3)</li> <li>1 in 2013 (7/31)</li> <li>1 in 2007 (2/21)</li> <li>1 in 2005 (5/23)</li> <li>3 in 2003 (3/26, 4/27, and 10/22)</li> <li>2 in 2002 (4/26 and 9/13)</li> <li>1 in 2000 (5/22)</li> </ul> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Norris Geyser Basin</h2> <p>Norris Geyser Basin is one of the hottest and most acidic of Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. It is outside of the most recent Yellowstone caldera, but inside the first and largest caldera. It sits on the intersection of three major faults and is a very active earthquake area.</p> <p>Each year, new hot springs and geysers appear while others become dormant. Geologic events trigger many of these changes. Even small earthquakes can alter hydrothermal behavior. This sudden activity is known as a “thermal disturbance” and can last a few days, or more than a week. Gradually, most features return to “normal.”</p> <p>No one fully understands why this happens. Norris has the greatest water chemistry diversity among Yellowstone’s hydrothermal areas. The water chemistry changes as the water levels of underground hot water reservoirs fluctuates.</p> <p>Although Norris is known for its acid features, it also have alkaline hot springs and geysers. As underground water and chemistry shift suddenly, they could contribute to dramatic changes in minerals and pH.</p> <h2>Parking</h2> <p>Parking at Norris Geyser Basin is extremely limited, especially with the recent activity of Steamboat Geyser. Please follow all posted signs or ranger directions. Be prepared to have to come back at a different time of day. Park at your our risk. When Steamboat Geyser erupts, dissolved minerals in the spray can damage glass and paint on your vehicle.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "audioDescription": "Steamboat Geyser<br />419 words<br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br /><br />Section 1 (137 words)<br /><br />Steamboat Geyser is a cone-type geyser located in Norris Geyser Basin. A wood boardwalk without railings on either side leads to the rocky area surrounding this feature; there are, however, waist-high railings on the wide boardwalk platform overlooking the geyser itself. There is also a long wood bench placed to the left of a wayside panel located on the platform. A sign standing alongside the boardwalk leading to the geyser site tells us:<br /><br />\"Steamboat Geyser: World's Tallest Active Geyser. Unpredictable, Infrequent Major Eruptions of More than 300 Feet (91 meters). Frequent Minor Eruptions 10 to 40 feet (3 to 12 meters).\"<br /><br />Also noted on the sign is Steamboat's \"Last Major Eruption: September 3, 2014.\"<br />The date is written on a separate board affixed to the sign and may have been updated before the time of your visit.<br /><br />Section 2 (264 words)<br /><br />The wayside panel located in front of the boardwalk railing overlooking the geyser is entitled \"Steamboat Geyser: Learning to Love the Unpredictable.\" On the panel's right side is a large color photo of the geyser as viewed from a distance. The massive column of water and steam erupting from the geyser nearly fills the sky, dwarfing the thick evergreen forest standing to the geyser's right side. Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"When Steamboat Geyser erupts, it can rocket a column of scalding water 90 to 120 meters into the air-two to three times the average height of Old Faithful. Steam roars for twenty-four hours after. Odds are against your witnessing this drama, however, since Steamboat's major eruptions occur 4 days to 50 years apart. <br /><br />\"In Yellowstone's geyser basins, unpredictability is the pattern. Old Faithful's relatively predictable intervals are the exception. An earthquake could disrupt Old Faithful's timetable, or a shift in subterranean plumbing could allow Steamboat more frequent eruptions.\"<br /><br />A subtitle \"Eruption Indicators\" is followed by more text that reads:<br /><br />\"Though order and symmetry in nature can be reassuring, true geyser gazers appreciate surprise and suspense. Watch the larger, upslope vent for massive, frequent bursts to heights of at least 5-10 meters, accompanied by heavy runoff-Steamboat's only known eruption indicators.\"<br /><br />Below this text is another color photo showing an empty deep, round pool surrounded by ash-colored ground. The caption tells us: <br /><br />\"When Steamboat Geyser has a major eruption, the deep pool of nearby Cistern Spring drains almost completely. Gradually, within a day or two after Steamboat's eruption, Cistern begins to refill.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>Sulphur Caldron is one of the most acidic hot springs in Yellowstone. Sulphur Caldron's turbulent waters have a pH of approximately 1-2, which is similar to car battery acid or stomach fluids. <br /><br />Its name comes from the large amounts of free sulfur in its waters.</p><h3>Hot Springs</h3><p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions. <br /><br />Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below. <br /><br />This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p><h3>The Smell</h3><p>Mudpots are acidic features with a limited water supply. Some microorganisms use hydrogen sulfide, which rises from deep within the earth, as an energy source. They help convert the gas to sulfuric acid, which breaks down rock to wet clay mud and creates the area's smell. The pungent odor of rotten eggs is caused by the hydrogen sulfide gas. <br /><br />Various gases escape through the wet clay mud, causing it to bubble. Mudpot consistency and activity vary with the seasons and precipitation.</p><h3>Mud Volcano Area</h3><p>The Mud Volcano area has many mudpots and hillsides strewn with trees cooked by steam. The hydrothermal features here are some of the most acidic in the park.<br /><br />Mud Volcano is near the greatest uplift and sinking of the Yellowstone Caldera floor. Many faults converge here and earthquakes are common.<br /><br />The areas surrounding the Mud Volcano vent and the other major vent near Old Faithful are called resurgent domes. Resurgent domes are active ground deformation, where the land moves up or down with the fluctuation of the magma chamber below. Scientists monitor these domes closely for information about ongoing volcanic activity.</p><h3>Use Caution in Thermal Areas</h3><p>- Stay on boardwalks and trails.<br />- Thermal water can severely burn you.<br />- Never run, push, or shove.<br />- Supervise children at all times.<br /><br />**You are responsible for your safety.**<br /><br />**Think Safety, Act Safely. Yellowstone is a Dangerous Place.**</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Sulphur Caldron<br />898 words<br />There are 5 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (256 words) <br />Sulphur Caldron, located near the Mud Volcano area, is an acidic hot spring bubbling with turbulent yellow water. Overlooking Sulphur Caldron are two wayside exhibits, mounted side by side on a low log structure. The first wayside exhibit, located on the left, is entitled \"Volcanic Landscape.\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"You are inside the caldera of one of the largest volcanoes in the world! The volcano has erupted at least three times, and Yellowstone is full of signs that volcanic activity is still very much alive below ground.\"<br /><br />On the panel's left side is a large color photo of the landscape here at Sulphur Caldron--a bubbling pool of yellow water with dark hills towering beyond a stand of evergreen trees in the distance. A caption accompanied with an arrow pointing to one of the rounded hills at the photo's top right corner reads:<br /><br />\"On the Rise. Magma is moving and pushing underground, forcing the hill in front of you to rise! Two of these bulges or \"resurgent domes\" have been found in the caldera. From here, you can see part of the Sour Creek dome--an oval-shaped hill about ten miles long and six miles wide.\"<br /><br />More text tells us:<br /><br />\"A Big Cooking Pot. Bubbling, steaming, and churning within Yellowstone's caldera--a Spanish word for a large cooking pot--are thousands of mudpots, fumaroles, hot springs, and geysers.<br /><br />\"By comparing new surveys with benchmark elevations, geologists have determined that the Yellowstone caldera is rising and falling as magma and hydrothermal fluids move below.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (135 words) <br />A small map to the right of the text includes a black dot marked \"You are Here\" in the center of Yellowstone's caldera. Sour Creek resurgent dome is located slightly above and to the right of this dot, and Mallard Lake resurgent dome is located below and to the left. The locations of three eruptions occurring 2.1 million years ago, 1.3 million years ago, and the most recent Yellowstone caldera, 640,000 years old, are also marked on the map. Additional text below the map reads:<br /><br />\"Where's the Rim? Yellowstone's caldera--30 miles wide and 45 miles long--is so huge, it is difficult to imagine the massive eruption that created it! After the volcano exploded, lava continued to flow, filling in much of the caldera and making the crater and its rim hard to see.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (145 words)<br /><br />The wayside exhibit on the right is entitled \"Sulphur Caldron.\" Text tells us: <br /><br />\"Ten times more acidic than lemon juice, Sulphur Caldron sits on the edge of one of the most active areas of Yellowstone's buried volcano. Sulphur-rich gases rise furiously here, filling Sulphur Caldron with sulfuric acid. Incredibly, this muddy pool is teeming with life!\"<br /><br />Below this text is a close-up photo of Sulphur Caldron's yellow water. Text superimposed over the photo reads: <br /><br />\"Home Sweet Home. Billions of thermoacidophiles thrive in Sulphur Caldron. They convert the pool's hydrogen sulfide gas into sulfuric acid.<br /><br />\"The sulfuric acid breaks soil and rock into mud, making this spring a very muddy home.\"<br /><br />Text in a box below the photo reads:<br /><br />\"What is a Thermoacidophile?<br /><br /><br />\"Thermo = Heat<br /><br /><br />\"Acid = Acidic<br /><br /><br />\"Phile = Love<br /><br /><br />\"Microorganisms that \"love\" to live in an extremely hot, acidic environment are called â€˜thermoacidophiles.'\"<br /><br />Section 4 (130 words)<br /><br />Another box to the right is entitled \"pH Scale Basics.\" Below the title is a narrow horizontal band, or scale, blocked into 15 colors, from shades of red and orange on the left to shades of yellow and green in the center to finally shades of blue and violet on the right. Text below this scale tells us:<br /><br />\"If you have ever had \"heart burn\" from eating acidic foods and used an antacid to relieve the pain, you can easily understand pH basics.<br /><br />\"\"pH\" means \"power of hydrogen.\" Acids release hydrogen ions, and alkaline solutions remove them. Acids and bases neutralize each other.<br /><br />\"Thermoacidophiles thrive in an acidic environment that would be deadly to humans. Sulphur Caldron's microbes live in a pool that is almost as acidic as battery acid!\"<br /><br />Section 5 (202 words)<br /><br />To the right of this text is another multi-colored pH scale, this one arranged vertically with red pH 0 at the top and deep violet pH 14 at the bottom. The scale is labeled on the right side as follows: pH 0--Battery Acid; pH 1--Sulphur Caldron; pH 2--Lemon Juice; pH 3--Vinegar; pH 4--Orange Juice; pH 5--Black Coffee; pH 6 is unlabeled; pH 7-Milk labeled at the top, Pure Water toward the middle; pH 8--Baking Soda; pH 9 and<br />pH 10---Antacids; the line between pH 11 and pH 12--Household Ammonia; pH 13--Bleach; and finally, the line between pH 13 and pH 14--Lye. <br /> <br />To the left of the scale, a black vertical line with arrows on both ends shows the green box representing pH 7--milk and pure water--as \"neutral\" with pHs 6 through 0 above as \"more acidic\" and pHs 8 through 14 as \"more alkaline.\"<br /><br />To the right of the pH scale is a color photo of pale yellow Sulphur Caldron. The landscape surrounding the caldron is largely barren but for a few evergreen trees standing in the foreground. A thin cloud of steam rises from the water's surface.<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>Super Frying Pan Geyser is not a frying pan (a term used to describe a type of acidic hot spring). Instead, it is a geyser that has formed since the 1959 Hebgen Lake Earthquake. It erupts every three to six hours with a jet of water reaching up to 15 feet (4.6 m) in height and lasting up to 20 minutes.</p> <h2>Geysers</h2> <p>Geysers have constrictions in their plumbing systems that prevent water from moving freely to the surface where heat would escape. Water beneath the constrictions creates a buildup of steam. Eventually the steam pushes water past the constrictions and the geyser erupts.</p> <h2>Fountain Paint Pot Area</h2> <p>Hydrothermal features can be grouped into two general categories: those with a great deal of water (hot springs and geysers) and those with limited water (mudpots and fumaroles). Despite their structural similarities, no two features are exactly alike. All of these features occur in the Fountain Paint Pot area.</p> <p><i>Thermus aquaticus</i>, the thermophile that revolutionized DNA replication processes, was discovered in this area.</p> <h2>Lower Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The Lower Geyser Basin sits on unstable glacial gravel on top of solid rock. The jarring energy of an earthquake can make the gravel vibrate and shift position, and compact or fracture.</p> <p>All these changes affect water supplies to hot springs. They might force muddy water to the surface, clouding existing pools or creating new ones. They might divert water from a pool, causing it to dry up. Water temperatures might also increase or decrease due to these subsurface changes.</p> <p>In the days after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, all of these changes were observed in various springs of the Firehole River geyser basins. The epicenter (point of origin) of the quake was determined to be about 31 air miles (50 km) northwest of the Fountain Paint Pots area.</p> <p>Great Fountain Geyser, on the Firehole Lake Drive, is the only geyser outside of the Old Faithful area with eruption forecasts.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

    "audioDescription": "The Forest That Needs Fire<br />428 words<br /><br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br /><br />Section 1 (254 words)<br /><br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit located alongside a boardwalk trail. The exhibit is entitled \"The Forest That Needs Fire\" and features a large color photo of tall dark tree trunks rising above a forest of much shorter green-branched evergreens. Text below the title reads:<br /><br />\"Yellowstone's most common tree is the lodgepole pine. Miles and miles of these tall, straight trees grow close together.<br /><br />\"Lodgepole pine forests need fire to survive. It helps control disease and insects, and fire is essential for a new generation of lodgepole pines to grow. When the forest canopy burns, the ask fertilizes the soil. Sunlight can reach the ground. Seeds quickly germinate and begin to grow.\"<br /><br />Superimposed over the large photo is a box holding more text and a small color photo of two pinecones lying on ground scattered with pale yellow pine needles. The scales of one cone are more open than those of the second cone, which appear to overlap more tightly. Text following the subtitle \"Too Dark to Grow\" tells us:<br /><br />\"Lodgepole pines reproduce with two kinds of cones. One type matures in two years, then opens to scatter seeds. If the forest floor is shaded by older trees, the seeds seldom germinate.\"<br /><br />Text following a second subtitle \"The Magic of Fire\" reads:<br /><br />\"The other type of lodgepole pine cone is \"serotinous.\" Its seeds are tightly sealed inside the cone until heat from a fire melts the resin that glues the cone shut. Then the cones bursts open to spread its seeds.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (156 words)<br /><br />On the panel's right side are two color photos arranged one above the other, entitled \"Regeneration of a Forest.\" The photo on top shows a charred landscape with several tall tree trunks still standing. The caption below the photo reads \"November 1, 1988-<br />a few weeks after fire\" and is followed by four sentences highlighted with bullet points:<br /><br />\"Soil is charred, but fertile.<br /><br /><br />\"Lodgepole pine cones release their seeds.<br /><br /><br />\"Roots, bulbs, and rhizomes survive underground.<br /><br /><br />\"Burned snags will fall, decompose, and add more nutrients to the soil.\"<br /><br />The bottom photo shows the same landscape, now dotted with thriving green evergreens. The caption reads: \"September 30, 1998-ten years after fire\" and is followed by three bullet points:<br /><br />\"Young trees are several feet high.<br /><br /><br />\"Fertile soil sustains a new forest.<br /><br /><br />\"Remaining snags will fall and decompose.\"<br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

The exhibit is entitled \"The Land Tells the Story\" and features a large color photo of this same landscape. The photo is labeled \"Huckleberry Ridge Tuff.\" Text below the photo reads:<br /><br />\"The rocky outcropping in front of you tells part of a violent story of Yellowstone's volcano-one of the largest volcanoes on Earth.<br /><br />\"About two million years ago Yellowstone's volcano-so enormous that it is called a â€˜super volcano'-exploded violently, coating the earth with ash for thousands of miles! Near the eruption, ashfall buried the ground in deep layers. Then the ash became compressed or â€˜welded,' creating a layer of rock now called â€˜Huckleberry Ridge Tuff.'\"<br /><br />\"Yellowstone's super volcano erupted two more times. The most recent eruption left a gigantic crater, or caldera, in the heart of Yellowstone. This massive caldera, about 30 miles wide and 45 miles long, was first verified with the use of satellite photography.\"<br /><br />To the right of this text is a small color photo showing a massive gray cloud erupting from a volcano. The caption reads:<br /><br />\"Yellowstone's immense eruptions were many times larger than the catastrophic Mount St. Helens, Washington, explosion in 1980.\"<br /><br /><br />Section 2 (193 words)<br /><br />On the panel's right side are two map drawings entitled \"Yellowstone's Big Blasts.\"<br /><br /><br />The first map shows the areas impacted by Yellowstone's first, second, and third volcanic eruptions. Text below the map tells us:<br /><br />\"Yellowstone's volcano is still alive today. Two dome-like areas rise and fall as magma moves beneath the park. Although geologists cannot predict when it will erupt again, these \"resurgent domes\" give clues about the future.\"<br /><br />The second map shows the areas that were covered with ashfall from Yellowstone's volcanic eruptions as well as ashfall from the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980. Much of the map-beyond California to the west, south into northern Mexico, southeast to Texas, and further east into western areas of Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa-are colored pale blue to show the spread of ash. A black dot labeled \"Yellowstone\" is located toward the northernmost area of this ashfall range, which spans upward to the middle of Montana.

Due to the constant, highly active boiling, the spikes in activity that shoot a large amount of water out of the pool are not considered eruptions and the feature remains a hot spring.</p> <p>Tortoise Shell Spring has an average temperate of 195.4°F (90.8°C), an average pH of 8.7, and an average conductivity of 2195 uS/cm.</p> <h2>Hot Springs</h2> <p>Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. Their plumbing has no constrictions.</p> <p>Superheated water cools as it reaches the surface, sinks, and is replaced by hotter water from below.</p> <p>This circulation prevents water from reaching the temperature needed to set off an eruption.</p> <h2>Upper Geyser Basin</h2> <p>The majority of world’s active geysers are in the Upper Geyser Basin, including Old Faithful. Only four other places in the world have large concentrations of hydrothermal features: Russia (Kamchatka), Chile, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p> <p>The heat for the hydrothermal features comes from Yellowstone’s volcano. Molten rock or magma may be as close as 3-8 miles (5-13 km) underground. Rain and snow supply water that seeps down several thousand feet (more than a kilometer) below the surface where it is heated.</p> <p>Underground cracks form a natural plumbing system. Hot water rises through the plumbing to produce hot springs and geysers.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely.

The east fork traverses around Garnet Hill and back to Tower. <b>CAUTION:</b> Grizzly bears frequent this area.</p> <p><b>Lost Lake Trail</b></p> <p>This moderate 2.8-mile (4.5-km) loop trail begins behind Roosevelt Lodge and traverses through forest to the lake then descends through sagebrush meadows and loops by the Petrified Tree Parking Lot and returns to the Roosevelt Lodge.

Most of what are called the “boundary lands” was purchased from willing owners; the rest was taken by eminent domain. But the town of Cinnabar had been abandoned long before. Construction of the branch line from Livingston in 1883 made Cinnabar a hub for passengers and freight until the last three miles to the park entrance were built 20 years later.</p> <p>Nothing remains of the town today except archeological evidence through which we can learn about the lives of its residents in the late 1800s.</p> <p>To prevent impacts to archeological resources during a native plant restoration project planned for the boundary lands area, it was necessary to document where such resources were located. The Montana-Yellowstone Archeological Project (MYAP), a collaboration between the University of Montana and the National Park Service, surveyed about 3,000 acres and confirmed the location of the Cinnabar depot, excavated the blacksmith shop, and a likely foundation of a hotel. Historical artifacts on site included a railroad sign and revolver bullets.</p> <p>The MYAP team also documented sites with prehistoric components, including a tipi ring cluster approximately 5,000 years old—one of the oldest known in the Northern Plains. They identified a total of 18 stone circles and salvaged five prehistoric fire pits that were eroding out of the banks of the Yellowstone River downstream from Cinnabar. These were probably last used by the Pelican Lake culture that lived there 2,000 years ago.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Trembling Aspens<br />330 words<br /><br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit overlooking a grove of tall thin trees with whitish-gray trunks. The exhibit is entitled \"Trembling Aspens\" and features a large color photo of a sunlit aspen grove superimposed over an even larger photo providing a close-up view of an aspen's rounded yellow leaves. <br />On the exhibit's left side is a tactile panel containing two thin branches, several similarly colored leaves, and three small pointed cones. The rough background of this tactile portion is gray, resembling dry earth. Text below the exhibit title on the right reads:<br />\"Roots of Survival. The secret of an aspen grove lies hidden beneath the ground. Aspens rarely grow from seeds but spring up abundantly from the roots of their parent. These young shoots are connected to each other underground by an extensive root system and are genetically identical! This method of reproduction is called \"cloning.\"<br /><br />\"Aspens are masters of cloning. Their clones can cover several acres and sometimes live for thousands of years.<br /><br />\"Why Do Aspens Tremble? Trembling. Quaking. Quivering. These words have all been used to describe Populus tremuloides. Aspen leaves flutter in the slightest breeze because of how they are built. Their slender petioles-the stems on each leaf-are flat and at a right angle to the leaf surface. Consequently, the leaves quiver as they catch the wind.<br /><br /><br />\"When aspens tremble, light reflects from each shiny leaf, causing the entire grove to shimmer.\"<br /><br />On the panel's far right side are three smaller color photos. The top photo, captioned \"Aspen leaves,\" shows the thin green stems that attach the leaves to branches. The other photos, placed side by side below, provide a close-up view of two aspen trunks with dark gouges and scratches. The caption below these photos tells us: \"Elk and deer browse on aspen bark, scarring the trunks.\"<br /><br />A notation in the exhibit's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Upper Geyser Basin - Orientation West of Old Faithful<br />1,447 words<br /><br />There are 5 sections in this description. <br /><br />Section 1 (305 words) <br /><br />You are standing in front of a row of 4 wayside exhibits located directly behind a hip-high timber fence.<br />The first panel on the far left is entitled \"Looks Can Be Deceiving.\" It features a large close-up color photo of one shaggy-furred bison standing in yellow grass. Text below the title reads:<br />\"Bison seem lazy and docile grazing in the sun. They are massive and look as if they can hardly move. Do not be fooled. They are wild animals. They can spring to their feet in an instant if they feel threatened. They can leap over fences and run 35 miles per hour. They can hurl you high in the air with one toss of a horn. The bison know where you are, so be aware of their personal space at all times. Do not frighten them or give them a reason to be angry. They are dangerous and unpredictable. People have been killed by bison in Yellowstone. Please respect them.\"<br />On the sign's right side is a narrow box outlined in red. At the top of the box, the words \"Be Safe\" appear in red letters, followed by a list of seven instructions, each beginning with a red checkmark. These instructions tell us:<br />\"ALWAYS be alert.<br /><br /><br />\"NEVER approach bison.<br /><br /><br />\"ALWAYS stay at least 25+ yards (23 meters) away. More space is better.<br /><br /><br />\"Make sure there is an escape route for you AND the bison.<br /><br /><br />\"Get a closer look with a spotting scope, telephoto lens, or binoculars.<br /><br /><br />\"Remain in your vehicle if you encounter bison on the road.<br /><br /><br />\"Keep an eye on the tail. If a bison watches you and its tail goes up, it is a sign for you to pay attention. Don't wait. Get away.\"<br /><br />Below this text is a small sepia-toned drawing of a single bison with its short tail raised. <br /><br />Section 2 (210 words) <br /><br />The next wayside, entitled \"Developed Area,\" features a large map drawing of the various amenities and thermal features surrounding Old Faithful Geyser. The geyser itself is indicated with a red dot located just right of the map's center; several buildings stand alongside the parking areas surrounding Old Faithful to all but the north, where the Firehole River flows past Geyser Hill. <br /><br />These buildings include Old Faithful Inn to the west, Old Faithful Visitor Education Center and Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Cabins to the south, and Old Faithful Lodge and Cabins to the east. A post office and joint ranger station and medical clinic lie west of Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Cabins; various stores, gas stations, a picnic area and other dining options are scattered throughout the site.<br /><br />Also labeled on the map are the boardwalks looping past Old Faithful Geyser and Geyser Hill, Grand Geyser, and Castle Geyser to the north and west. These boardwalks are indicated with dotted black lines. \"Stairs, Steep Grade, or Uneven Ground\" is indicated with wider tan lines, and solid black lines indicate \"Paved Trail, most of it accessible with assistance.\"<br /><br />One wheelchair logo located along the boardwalk passing directly south of Old Faithful Geyser indicates that this area is an \"Accessible Trail.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (178 words)<br /><br />The third wayside exhibit is entitled \"Dangerous Ground.\" At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder-who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the panel warns us: <br />\"In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred.<br />\"Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal.<br />\"Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.\"<br />This safety warning also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese.<br /><br />Section 4 (432 words)<br /><br />The last wayside exhibit is entitled \"Yellowstone's Hydrothermal Features.\" Text directly below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"Remnants of an ancient volcano--boiling hot springs, geysers, mud pots, and steam vents--are evidence of Yellowstone's violent geologic history. The world's highest concentration of hydro (water) thermal (heat) features is found here.\"<br /><br />Below this text and arranged from left to right are five small color photos of various hydrothermal features. The first photo shows a steaming ground vent; the caption reads: \"Fumarole, Norris Geyser Basin (30 miles North).\" Text below the photo tells us:<br /><br />\"Fumaroles or steam vents are hot springs without enough water to erupt or flow. The small amount of available water quickly boils away, leaving only steam and gases to escape. Steam vents usually occur on higher ground.\"<br /><br />The second photo shows a large pool of water surrounded by crackled ground. The caption is \"Grand Prismatic Spring, Midway Geyser Basin (6 miles North).\" Text below the caption reads: <br /><br />\"Hot Springs are pools of heated water with temperatures ranging from tepid to boiling. Their plumbing system varies from narrow to wide. Water circulation is continuous; cooler surface water sinks while hotter water rises.\"<br /><br />The third photo features the erupting \"Castle Geyser, Upper Geyser Basin.\" Text reads:<br /><br />\"Cone geysers function similarly to a nozzle spouting water. Deep within the earth, heated water dissolves and then transports silica, the same mineral found in sand and glass, to the surface. During geyser eruptions, silica is deposited around narrow \"vents\" or openings. Over time this mineral, called geyserite or sinter, forms mounds of varying sizes and shapes.\"<br /><br />The next photo shows a wide plume of water erupting from \"Grand Geyser, Upper Geyser Basin.\" Text below the photo tells us:<br /><br />\"Fountain geysers have larger surface openings that fill with water before or during an eruption. When not erupting, they can be mistaken for hot springs. To tell the difference, look carefully at the feature. Hot spring water levels remain relatively constant while those in fountain geysers fluctuate. Geyser runoff channels contain little or no water and are often dry and whitish grey. Active hot spring channels are wet and generally quite colorful.\"<br /><br />The last photo features two bubbling gray mud pools. The caption is \"Bubbling Mud, Fountain Paint Pots (8 miles North).\" The text tells us:<br /><br />\"Mud pots are pools of scalding mud lying over steam vents. Mud pots form when gases interact with surface water and organic matter to create acid. The acid breaks down mineral-laden rock into clay creating a viscous and often colorful bubbly mix. Mud consistency depends on the amount of water present.\"<br /><br />Section 5 (292 words)<br /><br />Filling nearly the panel's entire bottom half is a color geologic drawing depicting the many forces at work underground the five hydrothermal features pictured above. Indicated with black arrows at ground level, moving from left to right across the drawing, are fumaroles, hot springs, cone geysers, fountain geysers, and mud pots. The ground layers below the surface are various shades of brown; the topmost layer, labeled \"surface deposits,\" is reddish brown. <br /><br />Several blue downward-pointing arrows spanning the drawing's full depth on both sides are labeled \"surface water recharge: \"rain or snow.\" At the bottom of the drawing, the words \"heated water\" appear under all features other than the cone geyser in the center, which is labeled \"volcanic rhyolite (silica).\" <br /><br />More blue arrows appearing to float above these last labels point upward to several blue lines resembling branching tree roots. These in turn lead above to four blue pools of varying sizes labeled \"boiling water.\" A thin blue line leads upward from one small pool on the drawing's bottom left then branches in two toward fumaroles and hot springs respectively; a blue line leaving the second small pool, located at bottom center, leads upward to two larger and wider pools representing horizontal chambers below the cone geyser. Two white arrows accompanied with the words \"open cavity or porous rock\" point to both chambers.<br /><br />A thin blue line leads from the bottom cone geyser chamber to two mud pots at the drawing's top right; two thicker and separate blue lines labeled \"constriction\" lead from the cone geyser's top chamber to the cone geyser itself and the fountain geyser on its immediate right. <br /><br />To the right of this last exhibit is a bulletin board case holding various notices and other information that is updated seasonally.<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

    "audioDescription": "Upper Terrace Overlook 712 words There are 3 sections in this description. Section 1 (252 words) You are standing at a wayside exhibit featuring a pictorial map of a winding gray roadway. This long road loops through a sparsely vegetated landscape in the map’s center; small white arrows placed alongside two legs of the road running off the left and bottom edges of the map show that it also leads toward Norris and Mammoth respectively. The wayside is entitled “Mammoth Hot Springs: Upper Terrace Drive.” Text in a green box below this title reads: “The Upper Terrace Drive will lead you through a travertine landscape. For thousands of years, hot springs have been building stone terraces here, reshaping the terrain. “Water, heated deep underground, rises to the surface. As it rises, the water percolates through buried limestone, dissolving calcium carbonate. Above ground, the hot water deposits the calcium carbonate, building travertine terraces. “If you were here in the past, you may notice many changes. The terrain will likely look different in the future. In this changing landscape, you can glimpse a moment in time.” More text in a green box in the exhibit’s bottom left corner reads: “Stay Safe and Protect Resources. Upper Terrace Drive is a 1.5 mile (2.4 kilometer) one-way loop. “Expect steep grades and sharp curves. “Stay on the road, boardwalks or paved trails at all times. The ground is fragile, and hot water may be hidden below. “Hot springs can burn you! Please do not touch the water. “Hot spring vents can easily become clogged. To protect them, never throw anything into the springs.” Section 2 (260 words) A “Map Key” to the right of this text lists icons for “parking, restroom, self-guiding trail, visitor center,” and “wheelchair accessible.” A “boardwalk or trail with steep grades or stairs” is indicated with a yellow line; a “wheelchair accessible boardwalk or trail” is indicated with a rust-colored line. An arrow marked with an uppercase “N” for north points right. “You Are Here” is written in red letters on the map itself just below and right of center; this indicates your current position alongside Upper Terrace Drive and the entrance to the boardwalk or trail. Here the trail line is rust-colored until it reaches “Canary Spring,” located toward the bottom of Main Terrace, an area which fills much of the map’s right side. The trail line winding through the rest of Main Terrace is yellow. Labeled alongside a parking area near the top of Main Terrace is “Overlook, 6,565 feet, or 2001 meters.” Most of the wood boardwalk and viewing platforms overlooking this area have railings on both sides, as well as wood benches placed in various spots. Take care, however, as you will encounter stairs and some places without railings. Also labeled on the map, moving counter-clockwise from your current position, are New Highland Terrace, Orange Spring Mound, Bath Lake, White Elephant Back Terrace, and Angel Terrace. These can be viewed while driving along Upper Terrace Drive, but there are no walking trails or boardwalks passing through these areas. A notation in the map’s bottom right corner reads: “This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.” Section 3 (178 words) There is another wayside exhibit entitled “Dangerous Ground.” At the bottom of the panel there is a black-and-white drawing of a boy--a camera strap slung over one shoulder--who is falling into a hot spring to the right of the boardwalk. Clouds of white steam rise around his sneaker-clad feet, and his ball cap appears to float above his head. Text at the top of the panel warns us: “In thermal areas the ground may be only a thin crust above boiling hot springs or scalding mud. There is no way to guess a safe path: new hazards can bubble up overnight, and some pools are acidic enough to burn through boots. More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred. “Leaving the boardwalk or trail, or taking pets beyond this point, is unlawful and potentially fatal. “Throwing objects into thermal features, collecting specimens, or defacing formations destroys what nature took centuries to build. Violators will be prosecuted.” The exhibit text also appears below in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>This trailhead leads out to the top of Mammoth Hot Springs, with close-up views of Dryad Spring, Canary Spring, Grassy Spring, and Cupid Spring along boardwalks. The boardwalks near Cupid Spring begin descending down through the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces, connecting to the Lower Terraces.</p> <h2>Mammoth Hot Springs</h2> <p>A network of fractures and fissures form the plumbing system that allows hot water from underground to reach the surface at Mammoth Hot Springs. Small earthquakes may keep the plumbing open. The water comes from rain and snow falling on surrounding mountains and seeping deep into the earth where it is heated.</p> <p>The volcanic heat source for Mammoth Hot Springs remains somewhat of a mystery. Scientists have proposed two sources: the large magma chamber underlying the Yellowstone Caldera or a smaller heat source closer to Mammoth.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, Shoshone and Bannock people collected minerals from the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces for white paint.</p> <h2>Travertine Terraces</h2> <p>Travertine terraces are formed from limestone (calcium carbonate). Water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. Due to the rapid rate of deposition, these features constantly and quickly change.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Transitions from asphalt walkways to boardwalks may require assistance. Some sections of boardwalk are wheelchair-accessible. The rest of the area has stairs or steep grades due to terrain. Distance from parking in front of Liberty Cap to the end of the boardwalk at Palette Spring is approximately 135 yards.</p> <h2>Use Caution in Hydrothermal Areas</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on boardwalks and designated trails.</li> <li>Hydrothermal water can severely burn you.</li> <li>Never run, push, or shove.</li> <li>Supervise children at all times.</li> <li>Do not scratch hydrothermal mats.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think safety, act safely. Yellowstone is a dangerous place.</b></p> <h2>Upper Terrace Loop Ski and Snowshoe Trail</h2> <p>The Upper Terrace Loop Ski Trail is a groomed 1.5-mile (2.4-km) loop that ranges from easy to more difficult due to a steep downhill section if traveled to the right (counter-clockwise) from the trailhead.</p> <p>This loop begins at the Upper Terrace parking area. It is easiest if skied beginning to the left (clockwise). A moderate climb leads to views of hot springs, terraces, the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District, and the surrounding mountains. At the top of the climb, a trail veers off to the southwest, which connects with the Snow Pass Trail. The Terrace Loop Trail descends past more hot springs before completing the circuit. Since snow depths here are less than in the mountains above, wintering elk and deer are occasionally sighted.</p> <p><b>Notes:</b></p> <ul> <li>Bison and elk frequent this trail. Federal regulations require you to stay at least 100 yards (91 m) away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards (23 m) away from bison and all other wild animals.</li> <li>There are thermal areas along this trail and some areas do not hold snow. Stay on boardwalks and designated ski trails. The ground is unstable in hydrothermal areas.</li> </ul>",

    "audioDescription": "Warm Creek Picnic Area<br />745 words<br />There are 4 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (210 words)<br />You are standing in front of the first of two wayside exhibits located in Warm Creek Picnic Area. The first wayside, entitled \"A Bear's Picnic,\" features three color photos of a bear searching for food, first digging a hole beside a downed log, then by ducking its head into the hole. Bands of melting snow dot the green grass surrounding the bear. Text to the right of the title tells us:<br /> \"All in a Day's Work. Hunting, digging, uprooting boulders and scouring logs...bears spend a lot of time foraging for edibles. Guided by a keen sense of smell and using their claws as tools, they eat plants and animals, large and small. Curious and intelligent, bears have an excellent memory for food sources and work hard for nourishment.<br /><br />\"These traits serve bears well when they eat a natural diet, but if bears obtain human food, they may aggressively search for more--putting you, others and the bear in grave danger. Never feed a bear!\"<br /><br />To the left of the photos is a drawing of a tree with short branches. A caption to the right of the tree reads:<br /><br />\"The whitebark pine is a long-lived, slow-growing tree of high elevation forests. The pine seeds provide a high-fat, high-energy food for bears.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (162 words)<br />Spanning across the bottom of the panel is a wide box with the subtitle \"What do bears eat?\" Text below the title reads: <br /><br />\"Spring:<br /><br />\"Winter-killed carcasses<br />\"Elk calves<br />\"Earthworms<br />\"Tender grass shoots<br />\"Clover<br />\"Dandelions<br />\"Ants<br />\"Pocket gophers<br />\"Summer:<br /><br />\"Elk and bison calves<br />\"Spawning cutthroat trout<br />\"Thistles<br />\"Fireweed<br />\"Mushrooms<br />\"Moths<br />\"Berries<br />\"Clover<br />\"Ants<br /><br /><br />\"Fall:<br /><br />\"Buffaloberries<br />\"Whortleberries<br />\"Whitebark pine seeds<br />\"Insect nests<br />\"Starchy tubers and roots<br />\"Rose hips<br />\"Mushrooms<br /><br />\"Winter:<br /><br />\"Both black and grizzly bears hibernate during the winter. They generally do not eat or drink during this time; instead, they live off a layer of fat built up during the summer and fall.\"<br /><br />Also in this text box are small photos of a brown wolf, a brown and beige speckled moth, and a rose hip, which resembles a small red berry. Two captions tell us:<br /><br />\"Bears also depend on wolf-killed bison and elk in spring, summer, and fall.<br /><br />\"Grizzly bears may eat up to 40,000 army cutworm moths a day in late summer.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (211 words)<br />The second wayside exhibit, entitled \"Bears Need Your Concern,\" features a large close-up color photo of a massive brown bear that appears to be looking straight at us. Text at the top of the wayside tells us: <br />\"Enjoy your picnic and remember...<br /><br />\"Bears need your concern, not your food!<br /><br />\"Bears become dangerous when they obtain human food. Stay safe--and help protect Yellowstone bears!\"<br /><br />On the panel's right side are two subtitles, each followed by instructions highlighted with bullet points:<br /><br />\"If a bear approaches the picnic area:<br /><br />\"Make noise, bang pots, yell, or honk your car horn to alert the bear to your presence. <br /><br />\"If the bear continues toward the picnic area, take all of your food and trash, get into your car, and alert other people in the area of the bear's presence.<br /><br />\"If a bear enters the picnic area:<br /><br />\"Do not run!<br /><br />\"If the bear is not threatening you, take all of your food and trash and get into your car.<br /><br />\"If you do not have time to safely gather your food and garbage, get into your car without it.<br /><br />\"If the bear shows interest in the food on your table, honk your car horn. This may scare the bear away.<br /><br />\"If the bear approaches your car, drive away.\"<br /><br />Section 4 (136 words)<br /><br />Located at the bottom of the panel is a box with the subtitle \"Grizzly or Black Bear?\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"Color can range from black to brown to cinnamon to blond for both grizzly and black bears. Grizzly bears frequently sport white-tipped fur, giving a grizzled, silver-tipped appearance.\"<br />To the left of this text is a drawing of a brown grizzly bear accompanied with the following labels: \"rump is usually lower than shoulders; hump at shoulder; dished-in face; long, straight claws.\"<br /><br />To the right of the text is a drawing of the smaller and darker black bear with these labels: \"Straight profile; rump is higher than shoulder; short, curved claws.\"<br /><br />One final message at the bottom of the panel instructs us: \"Report all bear encounters to the nearest Ranger Station or Visitor Center.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

On day trips, consider taking extra clothing, water, and food; matches or a lighter; a map and compass; and a ski repair kit. If you are planning an overnight ski trip, you must obtain a backcountry permit. In addition to the items you would include for a day trip, or an overnight trip in mild weather, you may also want to pack repair parts and tools, a shovel, a winter tent or bivouac bag, and a probe pole and transceiver.</span></p> <h2><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winter Hazards</span></h2> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Winter provides some different challenges to safely experiencing the wonders of Yellowstone, such as poor weather conditions, avalanches, dangers hidden beneath the snow, and hypothermia.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Here are some ways to mitigate those hazards and stay safe.</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Check weather and avalanche forecasts.

    "audioDescription": "West Yellowstone Visitor Information Center 238 words A large concrete plaza fills the area in front of this L-shaped one-story building with brown clapboard siding and multiple gable roofs. The glass double doors at the building’s entrance lie beyond a covered breezeway with its two partial side walls supported by concrete and wood pillars on each end. The exterior breezeway wall to the right of the entrance is edged in pale wood which also frames a large map labeled “West Yellowstone Historic Walking Tour.” Painted on the concrete plaza and leading toward the entrance from the right is a single line of green bear tracks; each large footprint has five toes. Hanging on the building façade between two sets of double windows located to the right of the entrance doors are two long horizontal signs that read: “Visitor Information: West Yellowstone Montana.” Affixed to the wall below these signs are three smaller emblem signs representing the “National Park Service,” “Forest Service Department of Agriculture,” and “Montana Big Sky Country.” Public restrooms are located in a separate entrance in front of and slightly to the right of the center. The restroom entrances are located on the side facing away from the center, with the women’s room on the far left and the men’s room on the far right. Wheelchair logos indicate that both restrooms are wheelchair-accessible. A small sign on each door warns us: “Caution! Watch your step. Inside floor may be slippery.” END OF MESSAGE",

    "bodyText": "<p>Wolves have abundant prey in the northern range. For example, the carcasses of elk, bison, and other large mammals each become ecosystems of their own.</p> <p>Researchers have identified at least 57 species of beetle associated with these ungulate carcasses on the northern range. Only one of those species eats ungulate meat. The rest prey on other small scavengers, especially the larvae of flies and beetles. Others consume carcass by-products such as microscopic fungal spores.</p> <p>In this very busy neighborhood, thousands of appetites interact until the carcass melts away and everybody moves on.</p> <h2>Wolves and the Food Web</h2> <p>Accumulated studies show that the loss of wolves from the food web on the northern range in the 1930s led to a loss of willows and other woody plants by allowing excessive grazing by elk. Most researchers agree that reintroduced wolves have caused elk to change their behavior and many studies have shown a correlation between the presence of wolves and increased growth in willows.</p> <p>It is too soon to know for sure if this trophic cascade is actually happening, and how extensive it might be--or if it is just one of many factors at work.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Wolf Tracks<br />418 words<br />There are 2 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (235 words)<br />You are standing in front of a wayside exhibit entitled \"Wolf Tracks.\" On the exhibit's left side is a panel containing the imprint of two wolf paws, one above the other. This tactile portion is rusty-red in color, resembling iron-rich earth. Text below the exhibit title on the right tells us:<br /> <br />\"Gray wolves (Canis lupus) are the largest member of the canine family. They are well-suited to Yellowstone where winters are long and severe. Wolves move easily over the snow on their large paws, their thick fur keeping them warm.\"<br /><br />Below the text is a large color aerial photo of seven wolves walking across a vast snowy landscape. Zigzagging around them are several lines of paw tracks. Superimposed over the bottom of this photo are three smaller color photos arranged from left to right. The photo on the far left shows a single white and gray wolf running over snow. The caption reads: \"Wolves have bushy tails and short, rounded ears. They can run 43 miles per hour on their long legs!\"<br /><br />The middle photo shows two wolves, heads tilted skyward and with their mouths open. The caption tells us: \"Howling is a form of communication that is often heard on a calm Yellowstone night.\"<br /><br />The rightmost photo shows a wolf peering out from a sheltered den. This caption reads: \"Pups are born in April or May. The entire pack helps take care of them.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (165 words)<br /><br />On the panel's right side are three subtitles followed by text: <br /><br />\"Social Life. Most wolves are social animals that live in packs of five or more members. They hunt, eat, and rest together. The alpha pair, one male and one female, are the leaders of the pack.<br /><br />\"Pups. Pups are born in spring in their den. While their parents are hunting, other pack members take turns \"babysitting.\" Like other mammals, young wolves learn important skills while playing with each other.<br /><br /><br />\"Hunting. Wolves' long legs allow them to race across the landscape for great distances. Their speed, stamina, and \"teamwork\" are extremely beneficial while hunting.<br /><br />\"In Yellowstone, wolves' primary food is elk. Because they hunt cooperatively with other members of their pack, wolves are able to hunt large mammals such as elk, moose, or bison. They also eat small mammals, birds, eggs, berries, and carrion.\"<br /><br />A notation in the panel's bottom right corner reads: \"This exhibit made possible by a generous grant from The Yellowstone Association.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

Its deepest spot is about 410 feet; its average depth is 140 feet. The lake’s basin has an estimated capacity of 12,095,264 acre-feet of water. Because its annual outflow is about 1,100,000 acre-feet, the lake’s water is completely replaced only about every eight to ten years. Since 1952, the annual water level fluctuation has been less than six feet.</p> <h2>Swimming and Soaking</h2> <p>Swimming is not recommended in Yellowstone, and is occasionally prohibited, because most lakes and streams are dangerously cold. Firehole Canyon, near Madison Junction, has a swimming area popular in summer.</p> <p>During late summer, Yellowstone Lake becomes thermally stratified with several water layers having different temperatures. The topmost layer rarely exceeds 66°F, and the lower layers are much colder.</p> <p>Because of the extremely cold water, survival time for anyone in the lake is estimated to be only 20 to 30 minutes. In winter, ice thickness on Yellowstone Lake varies from a few inches to more than two feet with many feet of snow on top of the ice.</p> <h2>Anticipate Potential Hazards</h2> <ul> <li>Observe safe distances and settings for selfies.</li> <li>Stay behind fencing, guard rails, and ledges.</li> <li>Use caution; park waters are cold and fast.</li> <li>Show patience and courtesy to other people.</li> </ul> <p><b>You are responsible for your safety.</b></p> <p><b>Think Safety, Act Safely.

    "audioDescription": "Yellowstone River Picnic Area<br />745 words<br />There are 4 sections in this description.<br />Section 1 (210 words)<br />You are standing in front of the first of two wayside exhibits located in Yellowstone River Picnic Area. The first wayside, entitled \"A Bear's Picnic,\" features three color photos of a bear searching for food, first digging a hole beside a downed log, then by ducking its head into the hole. Bands of melting snow dot the green grass surrounding the bear. Text to the right of the title tells us:<br /> \"All in a Day's Work. Hunting, digging, uprooting boulders and scouring logs...bears spend a lot of time foraging for edibles. Guided by a keen sense of smell and using their claws as tools, they eat plants and animals, large and small. Curious and intelligent, bears have an excellent memory for food sources and work hard for nourishment.<br /><br />\"These traits serve bears well when they eat a natural diet, but if bears obtain human food, they may aggressively search for more--putting you, others and the bear in grave danger. Never feed a bear!\"<br /><br />To the left of the photos is a drawing of a tree with short branches. A caption to the right of the tree reads:<br /><br />\"The whitebark pine is a long-lived, slow-growing tree of high elevation forests. The pine seeds provide a high-fat, high-energy food for bears.\"<br /><br />Section 2 (162 words)<br />Spanning across the bottom of the panel is a wide box with the subtitle \"What do bears eat?\" Text below the title reads: <br /><br />\"Spring:<br /><br />\"Winter-killed carcasses<br />\"Elk calves<br />\"Earthworms<br />\"Tender grass shoots<br />\"Clover<br />\"Dandelions<br />\"Ants<br />\"Pocket gophers<br />\"Summer:<br /><br />\"Elk and bison calves<br />\"Spawning cutthroat trout<br />\"Thistles<br />\"Fireweed<br />\"Mushrooms<br />\"Moths<br />\"Berries<br />\"Clover<br />\"Ants<br /><br /><br />\"Fall:<br /><br />\"Buffaloberries<br />\"Whortleberries<br />\"Whitebark pine seeds<br />\"Insect nests<br />\"Starchy tubers and roots<br />\"Rose hips<br />\"Mushrooms<br /><br />\"Winter:<br /><br />\"Both black and grizzly bears hibernate during the winter. They generally do not eat or drink during this time; instead, they live off a layer of fat built up during the summer and fall.\"<br /><br />Also in this text box are small photos of a brown wolf, a brown and beige speckled moth, and a rose hip, which resembles a small red berry. Two captions tell us:<br /><br />\"Bears also depend on wolf-killed bison and elk in spring, summer, and fall.<br /><br />\"Grizzly bears may eat up to 40,000 army cutworm moths a day in late summer.\"<br /><br />Section 3 (211 words)<br />The second wayside exhibit, entitled \"Bears Need Your Concern,\" features a large close-up color photo of a massive brown bear that appears to be looking straight at us. Text at the top of the wayside tells us: <br />\"Enjoy your picnic and remember...<br /><br />\"Bears need your concern, not your food!<br /><br />\"Bears become dangerous when they obtain human food. Stay safe--and help protect Yellowstone bears!\"<br /><br />On the panel's right side are two subtitles, each followed by instructions highlighted with bullet points:<br /><br />\"If a bear approaches the picnic area:<br /><br />\"Make noise, bang pots, yell, or honk your car horn to alert the bear to your presence. <br /><br />\"If the bear continues toward the picnic area, take all of your food and trash, get into your car, and alert other people in the area of the bear's presence.<br /><br />\"If a bear enters the picnic area:<br /><br />\"Do not run!<br /><br />\"If the bear is not threatening you, take all of your food and trash and get into your car.<br /><br />\"If you do not have time to safely gather your food and garbage, get into your car without it.<br /><br />\"If the bear shows interest in the food on your table, honk your car horn. This may scare the bear away.<br /><br />\"If the bear approaches your car, drive away.\"<br /><br />Section 4 (136 words)<br /><br />Located at the bottom of the panel is a box with the subtitle \"Grizzly or Black Bear?\" Text below the title tells us:<br /><br />\"Color can range from black to brown to cinnamon to blond for both grizzly and black bears. Grizzly bears frequently sport white-tipped fur, giving a grizzled, silver-tipped appearance.\"<br />To the left of this text is a drawing of a brown grizzly bear accompanied with the following labels: \"rump is usually lower than shoulders; hump at shoulder; dished-in face; long, straight claws.\"<br /><br />To the right of the text is a drawing of the smaller and darker black bear with these labels: \"Straight profile; rump is higher than shoulder; short, curved claws.\"<br /><br />One final message at the bottom of the panel instructs us: \"Report all bear encounters to the nearest Ranger Station or Visitor Center.\"<br /><br />END OF MESSAGE",

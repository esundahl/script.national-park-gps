Side about 800 feet high & 400 yds round…”  His estimates were exceptionally close. Today, the site is on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail’s list of High Potential Historic Sites. <br /> <br /> As the area was settled in the 19th century, the basalt feature was given a variety of names. By 1915, river developments threatened to destroy the rock. Henry J. Biddle, a prominent Washingtonian and descendant of Nicholas Biddle, the original editor of Lewis and Clark's journals, bought it and eventually gave it to the state for a park, restoring the original name assigned by Clark. <br /> <br /> To get to the top, hike the mile-long switchback trail.  Or for the more adventurous, you’ll enjoy rock climbing or hiking to waterfalls. Cyclists and horseback riders will find trails to outstanding vistas, and boaters will delight in the majesty of the area from the waters of the Columbia.  The park includes 9,500 feet of freshwater shoreline and more than 26 miles of roads and trails. Picnicking and camping are also found at the park. <br /> <br /> The park is open daily from 8 a.m. to dusk. A Washington State Park Discover Pass is required and may be purchased at an automated station.  The park is just two miles from Skamania on state highway 14.

Side about 800 feet high and 400 paces around, we call the Beaten rock.” Significantly, Clark also noted the first evidence of tidewater: “I could not See any rapids below in the extent of my view which was for a long distance down the river, which from the last rapids widened and had everry appearance of being effected by the tide.” The expedition revisited Beacon Rock returning upriver on April 6, 1806. Lewis wrote, “from the appearance of a rock […] I could judge bet­ter of the rise of the water than I could at any point below. I think the flood of this spring has been about 12 feet higher than it was [the previous fall]; the river is here about 1½ miles wide; it’s general width from the beacon rock which may be esteemed the head of tide water, to the marshey islands is from one to 2 miles tho’ in many places it is still wider. it is only in the fall of the year when the river is low that the tides are persceptable as high as the beacon rock. this remarkable rock which stands on the North shore of the river is unconnected with the hills and rises to the hight of seven hundred feet; […] it rises to a very sharp point and is visible for 20 miles below on the river.”</span></span></span><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/474/Beacon-Rock\">Beacon Rock</a><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"> is an eroded basalt volcanic plug that stands at approximately 848 feet. In the 1800s, it became known as Castle Rock. Purchased by Henry Biddle (a descendant of Nicholas Biddle) in 1915, he restored the Beacon Rock name, constructed a trail to the top, and donated it to the state of Washington. The landmark was designated a state park in 1935.</span></span></span><br />  ",

To answer these questions we must know what types of rock make up this area. The dark rocks here are Columbia River Basalt (CRB) lava flows. These rocks are part of the Grande Ronde Basalt, one of the most voluminous of the CRB eruptions.</p> <p _ngcontent-fdf-c55=\"\">Sandwiched between the layers of lava is the Latah Formation, a sedimentary unit made of clay, silt, and sand. Unlike the sedimentary formations of western Washington, which are almost all marine in origin, the Latah rocks were deposited in a huge lake. This lake formed when the CRB lava flows descended on eastern Washington and blocked off rivers that already flowed through the area. Large amounts of sediment were deposited into this lake. When new lava flows arrived, they cooled quickly on contact with the water. We see this in the steep cliffs at the Bowl and Pitcher area, on the western side of the Spokane River. The cliffs expose rounded pillow lavas surrounded by palagonite, which is altered volcanic glass. Both pillow lavas and palagonite are types of rock that form when hot lava is exposed to cold water.<br /> When the ice age floods surged over the Columbia Basin, they eroded away the rocks in the Bowl and Pitcher area. The Latah Formation was much easier to erode than the Grande Ronde lavas, so it was broken down and removed first. With their support gone, the basalt rocks on top of the Latah layer became unstable and tumbled down into the river channel. The basalt rocks tend to weather into rounded, bulbous masses like those seen at the Bowl and Pitcher. These shapes result from the curved joints that form in the lava as it cools.</p>",

Ice moving south from Canada filled the valley below Cabinet Gorge Dam in western Montana creating a wall of ice over 3000 feet deep. The ice dams blocked the flow of water down the Clark Fork River and created a gigantic natural glacial Lake Missoula that stretched eastward for more than 200 miles and was over 2000 feet deep. Glacial Lake Missoula filled the valleys of western Montana with more water that Lake Erie and Lake Ontario combined. Pressure from this massive amount of water and changing climates helped this massive lake fill and drain over a 100 times creating the cataclysmic Missoula Floods.",

As you enjoy the 3.6 mile (5.8 km) roundtrip hike, you will pass markers that explain the impact of the ice age floods on area geography. The summit offers sweeping 360-degree views and a sign that identifies the areas of the Hanford Site involved in plutonium production.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{fcd1c547-4bf5-4f20-b80a-72e08e702809}{207}\" paraid=\"1489239130\">The mountain itself was once an island in the massive glacial Lake Lewis during the last ice age 15,000 years ago. Interpretive signs along the trail tell the story of the ice age floods. A rock monument on the trail at elevation 1,250 feet (381 meters) marks the highest shoreline of ancient Lake Lewis. Remnants of the ice age floods visible along the trail include large boulders called “erratics,” transported hundreds of miles in icebergs that melted and dropped their heavy cargo in the ancient lake. Other signs along the trail point out native plants and animals.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{ef818f3e-1512-4f65-abd6-34fcefea064a}{8}\" paraid=\"1117404287\">The summit offers one of the best views of the Hanford Site, allowing you to understand the vastness of the area the government appropriated for the Manhattan Project, the American effort to develop an atomic bomb. In 1942, General Leslie R. Groves, military leader of the Manhattan Project, directed Lieutenant Colonel Franklin T. Matthias to search the United States for a place to produce plutonium. After viewing several locations, Matthias visited Hanford on December 22 and knew he found an ideal place to produce plutonium. Groves wanted a large, sparsely populated area with ready access to water and electricity. The towns of Hanford, White Bluffs, and Richland were near the site, but all were small farming communities. The Columbia River could supply the water needed to cool the nuclear reactors. The project could get the massive amounts of electric power required for plutonium production from Grand Coulee Dam, which began operating in 1942. On January 16, 1943, Groves approved the Hanford Site as the center for plutonium production.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ef818f3e-1512-4f65-abd6-34fcefea064a}{58}\" paraid=\"465420822\">From the summit, you can see the 300 Area north of Richland. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/300-area-fuel-fabrication-site.htm\">300 Area Fuel Fabrication Site</a> turned hundreds of thousands of tons of uranium into fuel slugs that the Hanford nuclear reactors irradiated to produce plutonium for the war effort. In the west along the river, the 100 Area contained the nuclear reactors, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/b-reactor.htm\">B Reactor</a>, the world's first full-scale nuclear reactor. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/t-plant.htm\">T Plant</a> and the other plutonium separation facilities were in the 200 Area on the central plateau. The complicated chemical reactions that extracted plutonium from the uranium left vast quantities of chemical and radiological waste held in solid waste burial grounds and leak-prone underground storage tanks. Much of the Department of Energy’s cleanup effort at Hanford today addresses safe disposal of that waste. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ef818f3e-1512-4f65-abd6-34fcefea064a}{141}\" paraid=\"1851129442\"> </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{3f168227-ca77-4d3d-a94b-999aaf405487}{77}\" paraid=\"975299362\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <p paraeid=\"{3f168227-ca77-4d3d-a94b-999aaf405487}{77}\" paraid=\"975299362\">There are many places in the Tri-Cities to enjoy the outdoors. Bike or walk the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hanford-bike-and-walk-the-sacagawea-trail.htm\">Sacagawea Heritage Trail</a> to see the Columbia River waterfront up close. Hike the White Bluffs <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hanford-hike-the-white-bluffs-north-trail.htm\">North Trail</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hanford-hike-the-white-bluffs-south-slope-trail.htm\">South Slope Trail</a> to picture what the landscape looked like before settlement and to view Hanford Site.

    "bodyText": "English fur trader John Meares was mistaken as he stood on the northern shore of the mouth of the Columbia River in July 1788.  He was in search of the great river, but what appeared before him seemed to be a large bay, so he named the high bluff above the Columbia’s mouth, “Cape Disappointment.” <br /> <br /> When you visit Cape Disappointment State Park today, you certainly won’t be disappointed in what you find.  It’s an amazing park that’s home to the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center. <br /> <br /> Perched on a cliff 200 feet above the pounding Pacific surf, the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center shares the story of the Corps of Discovery’s journey, focusing particularly on their Pacific Coast stay during the winter of 1805-1806.  A series of mural-size timeline panels guide visitors through the westward journey of the Expedition using sketches, paintings, photographs, and the words of the journal writers.  <br /> <br /> It’s a wonderful stop for families with numerous interactive exhibits. Children can try to pack a canoe without tipping it, follow a treasure hunt, and check out what the Corps ate on their journey.  The center features a short film presentation, a nicely outfitted gift shop, and a glassed-in observation deck with fabulous views of the river, headlands, and ocean.  Additional displays focus on local maritime and military history. <br /> <br /> During winter and spring, trained volunteers come to the center to help visitors spot migrating Gray Whales.  You can also learn about the nearby North Head and Cape Disappointment Lighthouses.  The lighthouses both function to protect mariners from the rough and ever-changing Columbia River Bar in the treacherous area known as the “Graveyard of the Pacific.”  The Cape Disappointment Lighthouse is the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast.<br /> <br /> Cape Disappointment was armed with smoothbore cannons to protect the mouth of the Columbia during the Civil War.  In 1875, the area was expanded to become Fort Canby which remained in use through the end of World War II.  Today, near the visitor center, you can explore the remains of the military bunkers and defense batteries.<br /> <br /> Be sure to set aside time to hike through old-growth forest or around fresh-water ponds, saltwater marshes, and ocean tidelands.  The beaches are perfect for kite-flying, sand-castle building, or simply walking and exploring.  Camping, picnicking, clamming, boating, fishing, crabbing, and bird watching are also fun activities within the park. <br /> <br /> Cape Disappointment State Park is open year-round for camping and day use, 8 a.m. to dusk.  A Washington State Park Discover Pass is required.  The hours of the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center vary by season.  Be sure to check their website for current rates, hours, and information:  <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment\">https://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment</a>.<br />  ",

At the end of the last ice age this ice dam failed, releasing more water than is held in modern day Lake Ontario and Lake Erie combined. 600 cubic miles of water rushed through this area and down Lake Pend Oreille destined for the Pacific Ocrean.<br /> <br /> One of the most intriguing questions about the catastrophic flooding is how the ice dam failed. Various mechanisms for glacial outburst floods have been proposed: Ice erosion by overflow water, subglacial failure by flotation, deformation of ice by water pressure, and erosion of subglacial tunnels by flowing water.<br /> <br /> One model suggests a self-dumping phenomenon. In this mechanism, floodwaters are released when the lake level reaches nine-tenths the height of the ice. At this depth the ice becomes buoyant, subglacial tunnels form and enlarge, and drainage occurs until hydrostatic pressure is decreased and the ice again seals the lake. The self-emptying model is used to explain the numerous cycles in the rhythmite deposits and to interpret each cycle as a separate flood.<br /> <br /> Even so, only the total collapse of the ice dam can explain the largest of the catastrophic foods. Sub-glacial tunneling and enlargement due to thermal erosion progressing to collapse have also been proposed, as well as catastrophic failure due to water pressure. All are dependent on the configuration of the ice dam and structure of the ice.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

Further to the right of the museum, a paved walk winds through the grounds past historic structures and a wagon.<br /><br />On the left side of the entrance walk is a stone wall. Triangular in cross section, it is about 5 feet tall near the parking area, reducing to half that as the walk slopes up to the front doors. The wall forms a fountain, water pouring out from a slot running the length of the wall at the top and cascading down the rough sides into a trough at the bottom.<br /><br />The entrance leads into the long, high lobby area extending the length of the building, with rough stone walls on either side topped by a row of clerestory windows under the roofline.

    "bodyText": "<p>Columbia Hills State Park is a Washington State Park located 6 miles east of Dallesport on SR 14 in Klickitat County. The park occupies 3,338 acres on Horsethief Lake, an impoundment of the Columbia River, and was created in 2003 with the merger of Horsethief Lake State Park and Dalles Mountain Ranch. It also includes Horsethief Butte and Crawford Oaks, both popular hiking areas. Horsethief Lake section of the Columbia Hills Historical State Park is a National Historic Site.</p> <p>Located on the site of a former Native American village, Columbia Hills State Park is along the rolling hills of the Columbia River Gorge, with nearly two miles of freshwater shoreline on the Columbia River. This made it the perfect stopping point for the Lewis and Clark expedition on their way to the coast. A group of significant Native American pictographs and petroglyphs are located in this area of the park. The Temani Pesh-Wa exhibit is open daily for self-guided viewing. The world-famous Tsagaglalal, (She Who Watches) and other pictographs and petroglyphs can be viewed by making a reservation to participate in a regularly scheduled ranger-led tour (see Interpretive Opportunities on website for registration instructions).</p> <p>Across Highway 14 from the main part of Columbia Hills State Park, Horsethief Butte dominates the skyline, standing over Horsethief lake like an ancient castle. The lake itself is enormous, flooded into existence by the construction of The Dalles Dam. Lupine and balsamroot bloom in mid-April, making spectacular fields of purple and gold. Songbirds flit about, while larger birds of prey — like eagles and falcons — soar on air currents high above your head.</p> <p>The commission combined the park with Dalles Mountain Ranch and renamed the area Columbia Hills State Park in 2003. Now, in addition to the more than 12 miles of hiking trails in the area, visitors can enjoy swimming, freshwater fishing, bird watching and wildlife viewing, sailboarding, and playing horseshoes. Rock climbers also frequent this park. Dalles Mountain is known for the spectacular wildflower displays in the spring.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "There are many different sights in this state park sprawling over 3,338 acres. Set within rolling hills and plentiful green and tan bushy prairies, Columbia Hills has a rich history to discover. Mostly red pictographs and petroglyphs were drawn by native Americans who inhabited the area are scattered throughout the rocks and stones along the Columbia River. Across the way, Horsethief Butte, a tall, flat-topped, and steep hill, dominates the skyline being approximately 500 feet tall. The butte overlooks the enormous Horsethief Lake, encompassing over 90 acres.",

The Columbia River Gorge at Crown Point passes from the steeper, more rugged terrain of the western slopes of the Cascade Range to rolling cultivated plains. Here the Miocene lavas are overlain with conglomerates and sandstones. The Crown Point promontory provides a strategic vantage point for observing this classic illustration of riverine processes.<br />   <p>This viewpoint along Highway 30 was the site of the 1916 dedication of the <a href=\"https://www.oregon.gov/odot/regions/pages/historic-columbia-river-highway.aspx\">Columbia River Highway</a>, the innovative European-style road that traced a winding path through the perilous Columbia River Gorge, linking Portland and The Dalles.</p> <p>Vista House opened in 1918 as a glamorous rest stop and observatory for those traveling the new highway. This “comfort station” was a rest stop like no other, featuring marble floors, stained glass windows — and, of course, a stunning view. In the words of <em>The Oregonian</em>, it was “the finishing achievement for the greatest highway in America.”</p> <p>Architect Edgar M. Lazarus designed the building to be functional, beautiful and commemorative: the rest stop served as a memorial to the settlers who had traveled the final stretch of the Oregon Trail along the Columbia River. Inside, stone panels are carved with the names of settler families. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, the building fulfills Lazarus’s vision as a “temple to the natural beauty of the Gorge.”<br /> <br /> The octagonal building houses a museum, gift shop and interpretive display of historic and geologic points of interest in the Gorge. Additional information about the site's history can be found in our <a href=\"https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=main.loadFile&load=_siteFiles%2Fpublications%2F%2FVistaHouse_Brochure_web095533.pdf\">Vista House brochure</a>.</p> <p>The landmark is open daily, weather permitting.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Drumheller Channels are unique because no single channele or major cataract where formed. The Drumheller Channels are the most spectacular example in the Columbia Plateau of basalt \"butte-and-basin\" channeled scablands. This is an erosional landscape characterized by hundreds of isolated, steep-sided hills surrounded by a braided network of (usually) dry stream channels. The landscape is the result of dramatic modification of the Columbia Plateau volcanic terrain by late Pleistocene catastrophic glacial outburst floods—the Missoula Floods. These floods occurred at a scale remaining unparalleled on earth, either in the geologic record or in historical account.<br /> <br /> During the last glaciation the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced southward at various times to impinge upon the northern margin of the Columbia Plateau. Occasionally, the Pend Oreille Lobe of the ice sheet plugged the Clark Fork River valley near the point where it now enters Pend Oreille Lake, Idaho. The resulting glacier-dammed lake (Glacial Lake Missoula) covered at its highest level an area of about 7,800 square kilometers (3,000 square miles) in western Montana and contained an estimated 2,100 cubic kilometers (500 cubic miles) of water with a depth of nearly 600 meters (2,000 feet) at the ice dam. At least two times, a violent collapse of the ice dam caused the waters of Glacial Lake Missoula to discharge rapidly downstream as catastrophic floods that spread across the flat basaltic terrain of the Columbia Plateau within a period of two or three weeks each time. Although the precise number of floods remains in question (i.e. as many as forty have been proposed), the incredible proportions of flood-related landforms on the plateau bear witness to the largest and most catastrophic of such events known to have occurred on the face of the earth, both in the geologic record and in historical account.<br /> <br /> Upon reaching the Columbia valley, and blocked by the Okanogan Lobe of the ice sheet, the flood waters backed up and spread across the Columbia Plateau, spilling through the Grand Coulee and several other channel ways to the east in the upper Crab Creek drainage. Flowing south and westward, the water ponded in the Quincy Basin and then spilled partly into the Columbia valley to the west in three channel ways. In addition a slight down warp in the volcanic flows of the plateau in the southeast corner of the basin funneled the majority of flood water southward into Drumheller Channels, a structural saddle between the plunging Frenchman Hills anticline on the west and the upward tilting plateau to the east.<br /> <br /> During the first floods through the channels the waters plunged ten meters/kilometer (50 feet/mile) for thirteen kilometers (8 miles), which provided the torrent with sufficient energy to tear away great masses of sedimentary and volcanic basement rocks: as much as 120 meters (400 feet) in some areas. Thick layers of the Plio-Pleistocene Ringold Formation (sandstones, siltstones, and clays representing stream deposits of an earlier Columbia River) were removed.In one spillway at least one flood spread over a 15 kilometer (9 miles) wide area and was more than 30 kilometers (100 feet) deep, carrying more than 400 cubic kilometers (100 cubic miles) of water at velocities up to 80 kilometers/hour (50 miles/hour).<br /> <br /> The unusual landscape carved by the floods is characterized by hundreds of buttes separated from one another by a labyrinth of small, anastomosing dry channels and basins and so is termed “basin-and-butte scabland”. Total relief in this tract of about 13 kilometers (8 miles) by 13 kilometers is 180 meters (600 feet). Six main channels compose the Drumheller Channels; a dramatically underfit Crab Creek flows through the relatively wide, shallow center channel, while the others are pock-marked with rock basins and potholes. All wind southward toward the Othello Channels to the southeast and the Lower Crab Creek valley to the southwest. Other related scabland systems on the Columbia Plateau include the central Grand Coulee, the Sprague Channeled Scabland, the Rattlesnake Springs scablands of Moses Coulee, and other areas south of Cheney, Washington.<br /> <br /> Prior to the development of the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project, the rock depressions of the Drumheller Channels was largely dry and supported sage-bunchgrass vegetation. Over one hundred lakes now occur within the site as a result of the impoundment of Lower Crab Creek in 1950, the consequent creation of the Potholes Reservoir to the north, and a concomitant rise in the ambient water table. As a result, more diverse flora and fauna now occur within the region. Eight habitat types have been identified within Columbia National Wildlife Refuge, including sagebrush, grassland, greasewood, cliff, willow woodland, sedge meadow, marsh, and lake.Drumheller Channels has become a resting, feeding, and wintering ground for twenty-three species of ducks and geese; occurrences of other water birds have increased as well.</p> <p>So striking and extreme is this landscape that in 1986, the National Park Service designated the Drumheller Channels National Natural Landmark. National Natural Landmarks recognize sites that contain outstanding biological and/or geological resources, regardless of landownership. They are selected for their outstanding condition, illustrative value, rarity, diversity and value to science and education. In fact, so important and unique are the Missoula Floods and the resulting landscapes that Congress has designated the <a href=\"http://www.iafi.org/trail.html\">Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail</a>.<br /> <br /> More Information can be found at:<br /> <a href=\"https://wa100.dnr.wa.gov/columbia-basin/drumheller-channels\">Washington Department of Natural Resources - Washington Geologic Survey (WA 100)</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nnlandmarks/site.htm?Site=DRCH-WA\">National Natural Landmarks - National Natural Landmarks (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/columbia/\">Columbia National Wildlife Refuge - Columbia - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (fws.gov)</a></p>",

Pardee was able to calculate maximum speeds approaching 80 mph, emptying Glacial Lake Missoula in as little as three days.

Velocity reduction at the coulee mouth and debris momentum carried large boulders a mile or more before they began to settle out of the slowing water stream. The largest of these, “Monster Rock”, is estimated to be about 8m (25 feet) in diameter and contains over 500 cubic yards of rock that weighs over 1,500 tons!</b></p> <p>\"The Ephrata fan is an immense accumulation of gravel and sand that resulted when megaflood waters from Crab Creek, Dry Coulee, the lower Grand Coulee (ending at Soap Lake), and smaller scabland channels entered the Quincy Basin. The deposit probably formed more in the manner of an immense expansion bar (Baker, 1973a), rather than a fluvial fan in which relatively small alluvial channels shift across the fan surface without ever inundating the entire surface at once. Local areas of surface scour occurred on the fan, the most prominent of which is Rocky Ford Creek. The scour probably developed during waning flood stages, when draining of the inundated Quincy Basin caused relatively steep water-surface gradients to occur over the depositional surfaces that had been constructional during the high stages of megaflooding (Baker, 1973a). The scour processes produced the lag concentration of boulders on the fan surface, many of which can be seen from this viewpoint. An alternative explanation for the morphology of the Ephrata fan is that it was progressively incised by a sequence of multiple floods of successively decreasing magnitudes (Waitt, 1994; Waitt et al., 2009). It may also be that a more complex combination of these mechanisms occurred.\" </p> <p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c8e01f21-7fff-f3d4-71c7-b2392c042806\">Due to sudden expansion, the floodwaters decelerated and deposited about 130 feet of sediment onto the fan. Sediment sizes in the fan decrease with distance south from the mouth of the Grand Coulee. Large boulders that cover the fan were ripped out of Grand Coulee and other scabland channels just upstream. At the head of the bar, east of Ephrata, are house-size boulders up to 60 feet in diameter. </b></p>",

A short uphill hike leads visitors to the Erratic Rock State Natural Site, where they can look out across the vast landscape and imagine the huge amount of water that filled the Willamette Valley during the Ice Age Floods.<br /> <br /> The Bellevue erratic rests upon a gentle hill 150 ft above the floor of Oregon's bucolic Willamette Valley. The erratic floated in on an iceberg during a Missoula megaflood when floodwaters backed up to 400 ft elevation behind the Kalama Gap chokepoint - forming temporary Lake Allison.This is akin to Wallula Gap forming terminal Lake Lewis and Lake Condon on the southern/downstrea side of the Gap, and the erratics found at ~1200ft asl there.<br /> <br /> The erratic Bellevue boulder consists of banded argillite, which can be traced back 400 miles or more to the 1.5 BILLION-year-old Belt Supergroup that lay beneath the ice dam for glacial Lake Missoula in northern Idaho! This is the source of pinkish Missoula flood sediments, as well.<br /> <br /> The discovery that erratic rocks were found at or below the 400 foot elevation in the Willamette Valley indicated that the water inundated this region from Portland down to Eugene up to 400 feet above present day sea level!<br /> <br /> The Portland region owes its rich agriculture, beautiful geography, and many handsome erratics to a series of massive Ice Age Floods that burst from an ice dam, the last of them about 15,000 years ago with a few smaller Glacial Lake Columbia megaflood pulses finishing off around 14kya.",

    "bodyText": "Farragut State Park is located at the “breakout” of Glacial Lake Missoula floods, where the ice dam in the Clark Fork valley and the 20-mile-long tongue of ice occupying the Lake Pend Oreille basin failed. From there, a torrent of water and ice burst from the south end of the lake.<br /> <br /> Farragut State Park is located at the “breakout” of Glacial Lake Missoula floods. Failure of the ice dam in the Clark Fork valley fractured and broke apart the 20-mile-long tongue of ice occupying the Lake Pend Oreille basin, and a torrent of water and ice burst from the south end of the lake. That churning slurry of flood waters, ice, boulders and other debris erupted from the south end of Lake Pend Oreille, flowing 2000 ft deep across Farragut State Park.<br /> <br /> Nearly all of the water escaping from Glacial Lake Missoula passed through this area. Discharge estimates range from 14 to 21 million cubic meters per second! Vic Baker's definition of a megaflood is one which has a discharge of at least 1mil cubic m/s, so we are possibly looking at ground zero for the worst Pleistocene flood in the world.<br /> <br /> Farragut State Park includes many geologic features left by glaciation and megafoods.<br /> Hoodoo channel, an abandoned outlet of Lake Pend Oreille provided a pathway for late-glacial meltwater and for the last outbursts from Glacial Lake Missoula. The channel is marked with a number of closed depressions, probably the result of melting icebergs.<br /> <br /> One of the largest of these features have been proposed, including kettles, potholes, and sub-glacial meltwater. Some of that debris was deposited to form the Rathdrum Prairie Outburst Plain, an extensive, heterogeneous mix of flood deposits.<br /> <br /> Farragut State Park offers unique scenery, history and an abundance of recreational opportunities.<br />  ",

Frenchman Coulee is actually two parallel coulees–old US 10 follows the northern coulee while roadless“Echo Basin” is the southern branch.<br /> <br /> Frenchman Coulee formed when Ice Age floodwaters flowed down the Grand Coulee and across the Quincy Basin. It is one of four main outlets for floodwaters in the Quincy Basin–Crater Coulee and Potholes Coulee lie to the north while the Drumheller Channels lie to the southeast.<br /> <br /> Floodwaters exiting the basin through Frenchman Coulee dropped over 600 feet to the Columbia River Valley, creating a significant waterfall. The coulee formed as floodwaters spilled over, and eroded, the Columbia River Valley wall. Over time, this waterfall receded headwardly approximately 2 miles to its present position. “Plunge pools” lie at the foot of each of the falls at each coulee head marking the final positions of the waterfalls.<br /> <br /> A linear mesa separates the two coulees while flood bars and dunes cover the coulee floors.  ",

    "bodyText": "Glacial Lake Missoula was the largest of several lakes impounded by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in the Northern Rocky Mountains during the Quaternary period. The lake was approximately 2,900 square miles in size and contained more than 500 cubic miles of water. It occupied the Mission, Jocko and Little Bitterroot valleys, drained by the Flathead River; and the Missoula, Ninemile and Bitterroot valleys, drained by the Clark Fork River. The lake was formed by an ice dam across the mouth of the Clark Fork River at Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, a result of successive advances of a lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The site is located 12 miles north of Perma, Montana. At least three separate collapses of the ice dam, probably coincident with periods of ice retreat, caused the lake to drain, producing catastrophic floods across the Columbia Plateau and down the Columbia River Basin. It is estimated that the waters of Glacial Lake Missoula, 1,000 feet deep at Eddy Narrows, were withdrawn at a peak discharge rate of 10 cubic miles per hour. Approximately 380 cubic miles of water passed through those narrows during withdrawal. Evidence of this catastrophic withdrawal can be found in scourings, high eddy deposits of flood debris, flood bars of boulders and course gravel, and successions of giant arcuate ripples or ridges of gravel resting on bedrock surfaces. Ripples appear as ridges 15 to 50 feet high, 100 to 250 feet wide, and from 300 feet to a half-mile long. While the form, structure and arrangement of these features are similar to that of ordinary current ripple marks, they are termed giant flood ripples, due to their large size. The giant flood ripples at this site are unusual due to their being on the down-current side of notches in a ridge separating two basins that were both subsidiary to the main course of Lake Missoula in the Clark Fork Valley. The best examples of giant flood ripples are found in Camas Prairie.",

Some speculate that as the ice-age waned each successive ice dam that reformed was smaller and failed under less pressure from a lower lake level than the one before, leaving behind its bench as a record of the successively lower ancient lake shorelines. Most agree they record winter still-stands in rising lake levels over time. ",

It was designed by architect Marcel Breuer to resemble a generator rotor. An evening <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/pn/grandcoulee/visit/laser.html\">laser light show</a> was added in 1989. The center was retrofitted in 2004 for seismic, life-safety, and accessibility standards. The original laser equipment was replaced in 2013, and a new laser light show, “One River, Many Voices,” premiered in 2014.</p> <p>In 2006, new exhibits and displays were installed. The exhibits highlight Grand Coulee’s role as one of the main irrigation, flood control, and hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. They also describe the effects the dam has had on various groups of people, including Native Americans and early settlers. The new exhibits were designed, manufactured, and installed by Formations, Inc., of Portland, Oregon. </p> <p>This visitor center is fully accessible and features hands-on exhibits and an auditorium. Service animals are allowed inside the visitor center.</p>",

Within the Coulee there are illustrations of a series of geological events beginning with a low range of granite mountains through which the ancestral Columbia River flowed. Outpourings of lava built up the Columbia Plateau, diverting the course of the river. There followed deformation of the lava beds, advance and recession of glacial ice, the cutting of a new river course, the formation and retreat of waterfalls, and the return of the Columbia River to its present channel, leaving the Coulee high and dry until man turned part of it into a huge reservoir by artificial damming. Much of the evidence from which this geological story is reconstructed may be seen from Dry Falls State Park; the park is located about 8 kilometers (5 miles) southwest of Coulee City.",

    "bodyText": "THIS IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN! The Green Monarch Ridge viewpoint, just south of the Hope Fault, is positioned along the edge of the Purcell Trench Ice Lobe. Here it was responsible for damming the mouth of the Clark Fork drainage basin. This damming effect resulted in the formation of Glacial Lake Missoula, the source of the waters for much of  the PNW Pleistocene Ice Age Floods. The Purcell Trench Ice Lobe originated in Canada and flowed south into Idaho, guided by the structural control of the Purcell Trench. Following the path of least resistance into the basin now occupied by Lake Pend Oreille, it was impeded by the Green Monarch Ridge, located approximately 10 miles south of this viewpoint. Grinding and scraping, the Purcell Trench Ice Lobe backed up behind the Green Monarch Ridge, eventually building an ice plug up to 4,000 feet thick, and scouring out the deepest parts of Lake Pend Oreille. The Purcell Trench Ice Lobe divided into four sub-lobes: one went approximately west (US Highway 2), two went south (US Highway 95 and Lake Pend Oreille) and one went east (SR 200). All four sub-lobes contributed to blocking the Clark Fork drainage",

Lake Lewis was a temporary lake that formed over the present day Tri-Cities areas as floodwaters backed up behind Wallula Gap. These evenly spaced deposits are called rhythmites. They capture relatively calm water, or slackwater, laying down sediment in regular intervals. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{8fa043b2-b04a-4781-b29e-a6a385e98ea3}{24}\" paraid=\"620741590\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">These rhythmites sit within another geological formation, called the Ringold Formation. While the White Bluffs were laid down during the Ice Age floods around 17,000-12,000 years ago, the Ringold Formation captures an older landscape, dating from around 8 to 3 million years ago. The Ringold tells a tale of stream and river systems transitioning into lakes, as well as one of ancient life. The Ringold Formation is fossil rich, containing finds such as Pliocene era horses and camels.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{2df49b02-3fc5-483c-91cc-251793b26ccc}{6}\" paraid=\"754838268\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">To explore this area, hike the White Bluffs Rhythmites Trail (1.7 to 3.0 miles one way, moderate difficulty) starting from the White Bluffs Ferry Landing, or visit the White Bluffs Overlook. </p>",

The lake level is 2062 ft above sea level, with the surrounding terrain as high as 6002 ft. With a maximum depth of 1150 ft, this lake is the 5th deepest in the US.

The hills of the Palouse, on a landscape carved by powerful Ice Age Floods, lie beyond the water.</p> <p>This day-use park also may awaken your inner historian: In addition to its interesting geology, the park was long home to Native people, including the Palouse Indian Tribe. Its history includes a visit by the 34-member Corps of Discovery that included Lewis and Clark, on their westward journey in October 1805. Later in the 19th century, the park became the site of a ferry crossing that served the area for more than 100 years.</p> <p>For those who want to relax and enjoy, the wide spot on the rivers is a lure for picnickers, boaters, swimmers and water sports fans, as well as anglers casting out for the catch of the day.</p> <p>Nearby Palouse Falls State Park offers spectacular views of Washington's state waterfall. For more land-based activities in the area, bring bikes and ride the Columbia Plateau State Park Trail from Ice Harbor Dam to the Snake River Junction. Camping is available at Lewis and Clark Trail State Park 45 minutes away.</p> <h3>PARK FEATURES</h3> <p>Lyons Ferry is a 168-acre day-use park with more than 52,000 feet of shoreline at the confluence of the Snake and Palouse rivers. Lyons Ferry was named after the Lyons family, who for many years operated the ferry across the Snake River. The ferry service ran from 1860 to 1968, when it was replaced by a bridge.</p> <p><strong>Discover Pass:</strong> A Discover Pass is required for vehicle access to state parks for day use.

Founded in 1991, MNHC was the brainchild of a group of educators who were involved in various efforts to educate both kids and adults about the natural history of western Montana, and who decided to unite those efforts into one environmental education organization. MNHC provides nature education programming for people of all ages through summer camps, kids’ activities, Visiting Naturalist in the Schools, Master Naturalist certification courses and Field Days, evening programs, <em>Field Notes </em>on Montana Public Radio, museum tours, and more. We have a variety of exhibits that focus on the flora, fauna, geology, and ecology of our beautiful state. Please stop by and visit!<br /> <br /> Montana Natural History Center often partners with the Ice Age Floods Institute to share fields trips and lectures about the Ice Age Floods. Montana Natural History Cetner has exhibits that help visitors explore the Glacial Lake Missoula and Ice Age Floods.<br /> <br /> Learm more at:<br /> <a href=\"https://www.montananaturalist.org/exhibits/explore-glacial-lake-missoula/\">Explore Glacial Lake Missoula | Montana Natural History Center (montananaturalist.org)</a><br /> <br /> The Glacial Lake Missoula Chapeter of the Ice Age Floods Institue also produced a short movie about Glacial Lake Missoula.

The bison herd there descends from a free-ranging Reservation herd started by Tribal members in the 1800’s when plains bison were near extinction.</p> <p>Through Public Law 116-260, Congress has now restored the Bison Range to federal trust ownership for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) so that our award-winning natural resource managers can take over as stewards of the Range’s buffalo, wildlife and land.</p> <p>The Tribal Council has adopted, as its interim Bison Range management plan, the current Comprehensive Conservation Plan that was developed and adopted by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service in 2019 (for which CSKT was a cooperating agency).<br /> <br /> The range is also part of Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail. Flood features including strandlines are clearly visiable across the range.</p> <p>See the plan <strong><a href=\"https://bisonrange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CCP-NBR_Final_12-2019_accessible-1.pdf\">here</a></strong> and see the Tribes’ resolution adopting it as the interim Bison Range management plan <strong><a href=\"https://bisonrange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Resolution-Bison-Range-interim-mgmt-plan.pdf\">here</a></strong>.</p>",

The recreation site provides three quiet picnic and/or camping sites (each with picnic table and fire ring) in a shrub-steppe ecosystem, and with views to columnar basalt formations rising up along the opposite lake edge. Due to a declining aquifer, Pacific Lake was completely dry from 2004 – 2016, and is again currently dry, as of 2022.</p> <p>Recreational activities in this area include picnicking, camping, horseback riding, hunting, hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, wildlife watching, wildflower viewing, photography, and natural history appreciation. Nearby is a seven-mile motorized recreation route restricted to on-trail riding only. Several hiking trails are also available.</p> <p>The 12.5-mile Odessa to Pacific Lake Trail links the town of Odessa, Washington and Pacific Lake Recreation Site. It crosses shrub-steppe uplands, and Lake Creek Canyon.</p> <p>The Odessa Craters Loop Trail trailhead/parking lot is alongside WA-21 just 6.6 miles north of Odessa, WA. Hikers of the 1.5-mile loop trail experience views to multiple geologic feature craters.</p> <p>The Cache Crater Accessible Trail trailhead/parking lot is alongside WA-21 just 7.1 miles north of Odessa, WA. The 1/6-mile graveled wheelchair accessible trail leads to an overlook of this geologic feature.</p> <h2>Know Before You Go:</h2> <ul> <li>Beware of likely daily big temperature swings, as well as rattlesnakes, especially from May through October in this arid, hot-in-summer landscape.</li> <li>Sources of ground water are not always present along the 12.5-mile Odessa to Pacific Lake Trail, and when available might not be suited for human consumption, even filtered, due to agricultural run-off. Staging water jugs in advance, brought in via the motorized route segment of the trail, is an option when planning to hike, ride, or bike the entire trail.</li> <li>Well water for horses or other uses is no longer available at this site as the well ran dry. Please bring all your needed water with you to the site. In case of immediate/urgent need for water: the Odessa City Clerk’s Office offers large-volume metered water fills for sale, during normal working hours. The City Clerk’s Office is located at 21 E 1st Avenue Odessa, WA, 99159 and can be reached at (509) 982-2401.</li> <li>When recreating on public lands, please practice Leave-No-Trace Principles.</li> </ul> <h2>Point of Interest:</h2> <p>Plentiful columnar basalt formations and other scenic views can be found within Lake Creek Canyon. Some hikers and horseback riders access and explore the canyon via trail connecting the canyon north of Bob’s Lake to Lakeview Ranch Loop Road.<br /> <br /> External Map <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/orwa-lakeview-rec-area-map.pdf\">Lakeview Recreation Area (blm.gov)</a></p>",

This natural wonder was named Washington’s state waterfall in 2014, when the state Legislature passed a bill written by local schoolchildren, who advocated for the designation.</p> <p>Palouse Falls is an artist’s dream, and many a painter or shutterbug has set up an easel or camera and tripod to capture the falls in the changing light. Others make the trip in all four seasons, when the water is high, low or frozen, because they understand that once is not enough when it comes to seeing Washington’s own state waterfall.</p> <h3>PARK FEATURES</h3> <p>This 94-acre park has limited, first-come, first-served tent camping and is known as an ideal picnic and birding spot.</p> <p>The park offers three distinct views of the falls. The lower viewpoint provides a direct view; it is reached by a set of steps from the main day-use area adjacent to the parking lot. The second, at the end of a paved interpretive path, tells the story of the secluded canyon. Both the interpretive path and gravel secondary parking area lead to the third and highest viewpoint, the Fryxell Overlook, offering panoramic views of the falls and Palouse River Canyon.</p> <p>Visitors should be prepared for a remote recreational experience. There is no phone service at the park, and staff and volunteer hosts are not always available.</p> <p>Please follow Leave No Trace principles, and experience this viewshed from the designated, developed areas. Your positive stewardship protects cultural and natural resources.</p> <p><strong>Automated pay station:</strong> This park is equipped with an automated pay station for visitors to purchase a one-day or annual Discover Pass and boat launch permit.<br /> <br /> Parking at Palouse Falls State Park is limited. Expect long waits on weekends and holidays. Trailer and RV parking is not possible during these times; turnarounds do not exist, and RVs or trailers will not be permitted entrance into the park. Nearby Lyons Ferry State Park offers swimming and picnicking.</p> <p>Tips for your visit to Palouse Falls:</p> <ul> <li>Take along plenty of water</li> <li>Be prepared for extreme heat</li> <li>Plan ahead for potential wait times</li> <li>Camping is very limited; have a second option</li> </ul>",

His insights and dedicated research eventually led to the incredible Ice Age Floods (aka, Bretz or Missoula Floods) story we recognize today.<br /> <br /> Irrigation water from the Bureau of Reclamation’s Columbia Basin Project collects in the upper portions of Potholes Coulee above the cataract, forming Burke, Stan Coffin, Quincy, and Evergreen Lakes, which are managed by the State of Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Within BLM’s Rock Creek Management Area, Rock Creek flows through Channeled Scablands, formed approximately 12,000 years ago by massive Glacial Lake Missoula floods. Striking landscapes and geologic features including buttes, mesas, and columnar basalt outcrops enhance the beauty of perennial Rock Creek.</p> <p>The area’s developed Rock Creek Recreation Site is located within view of Rock Creek. It is the area’s primary parking and excursion starting point, via its multiple trailheads, as well as for overland hiking and horseback riding trips.</p> <p>Especially popular activities are hiking, horseback riding, trout fishing, hunting, mountain biking, picnicking, camping, wildlife and wildflower viewing, photography, and natural and cultural history appreciation.</p> <p>Although mostly unmaintained, more than 20 miles of non-motorized trails are available. Motorized use is allowed on the recreation site access road, Breeden Road, and Towell Falls Road when/if seasonally open.</p> <h2>Know Before You Go:</h2> <ul> <li>The east side of the recreation site is for vehicle parking, picnicking, and camping. It has 3 developed campsites each with a fire ring and a picnic table. You’ll also find 2 additional picnic tables within a picnic shelter and a vault toilet.</li> <li>The west side of the recreation site is separated from the east side by a wood fence. It is an equestrian/RV loop parking and camping area with six RV parking slots. It has two small corrals (one with a perennial spring-fed stock water trough), high line poles (rope not provided), and a manure bin with wheelbarrow. Additional equestrian amenities (more corrals + 2 campsites with picnic table and fire ring) will be added in spring 2021.</li> <li>The Towell Falls Road is seasonally open for vehicle travel. Its seasonal opening to vehicles is dependent on road, ground, and vegetation conditions, and fire danger. When open to vehicles, it is a short window of opportunity, typically mid-June to early July. When and if vehicle travel is allowed, high clearance 4-wheel drive is highly recommended. From its trailhead at Rock Creek Recreation Site, scenic Towell Falls (on Rock Creek) is a 3-miles-each-way hike or bike along marked 2-track road/trail.</li> <li>When recreating on public lands, please practice Leave-No-Trace Principles.</li> <li>Beware of rattlesnakes, especially from May through October.</li> </ul> <h2>Point of Interest:</h2> <p>From the recreation site, visitors can mosey across the bridge over Rock Creek and explore the historic Escure Ranch, operated for sheep and cattle from the 1930s to the 1980s.<br /> <br /> <strong>EXTERNAL MAP:</strong><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/docs/2021-02/orwa-rock-creek-map.pdf\">https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/docs/2021-02/orwa-rock-creek-map.pdf</a></p>",

This vantage point provides a sense the vastness of the area the government appropriated for the Manhattan Project, the American effort to develop an atomic bomb.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{fb75bc61-2658-4f67-897c-fba201d218ae}{214}\" paraid=\"326202942\">In 1942, General Leslie R. Groves, military leader of the Manhattan Project, directed Lieutenant Colonel Franklin T. Matthias to search the United States for a place to produce plutonium. After viewing several locations, Matthias visited Hanford on December 22 and knew he found an ideal place to produce plutonium. Groves wanted a large, sparsely populated area with ready access to water and electricity. The towns of Hanford, White Bluffs, and Richland were near the site, but all were small farming communities. The Columbia River could supply the water needed to cool the nuclear reactors. The project could get the massive amounts of electric power required for plutonium production from Grand Coulee Dam, which began operating in 1942. Upon seeing this area, Matthias believed he “found the only place in the country that could match the requirements for a desirable site.” On January 16, 1943, Groves approved the Hanford Site as the center for plutonium production.  <br />  <br /> Still, the Hanford Site presented challenges as well as opportunities. Heavy windstorms inundated workers’ homes with sand. These storms were known as “termination winds” because they drove workers to resign. The site’s isolation enabled the Manhattan Project to maintain secrecy while limiting the health and safety impact of plutonium production on nearby residents. The Hanford Site’s rocky soil protected large industrial facilities safe from earthquake damage. These favorable conditions led the Atomic Energy Commission, which assumed management of the nation’s nuclear weapons program from the Army Corps of Engineers at the end of the World War II, to greatly expand Hanford’s plutonium production capacity during the Cold War. Plutonium production at the Hanford Site ended in 1987. Since then, the area has been the focus of extensive environmental cleanup work. <br />  <br /> Today, Saddle Mountain lies within the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/hanford_reach/\">Hanford Reach National Monument</a>, administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The Hanford Reach preserves the last free-flowing (not dammed) section of the Columbia River. From the top of Saddle Mountain, you can see the foundations of the military barracks where soldiers guarded the Hanford Site from potential aerial attack. These barracks were later abandoned when three Nike missile sites were built on the valley floor. Though no maintained trails exist to the summit of Saddle Mountain, hiking on informal trails and cross-country travel is permitted. Hiking, watersports, and other outdoor activities are available at numerous other locations within the national monument. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{df85ef5e-f04b-41f1-b7a9-bfc227362966}{148}\" paraid=\"326202942\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{df85ef5e-f04b-41f1-b7a9-bfc227362966}{148}\" paraid=\"326202942\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{7d11dbda-b945-4fd8-8cf9-7bba561c7b5e}{54}\" paraid=\"1350751819\">The Department of Energy offers tours of the <a href=\"https://manhattanprojectbreactor.hanford.gov/\">B Reactor</a> and the  <a href=\"https://tours.hanford.gov/HistoricTours/\">Pre-War Historic Sites Tour</a>  that visit sites such as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/bruggemann-ranch.htm\">Bruggemann Ranch,</a> the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-bluffs-bank.htm\">White Bluffs Bank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school.htm\">Hanford High School</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/allard-pumphouse.htm\">Allard Pumphouse</a> where local people lived, worked, and came together as a tight-knit community prior to the arrival of the Manhattan Project. </p> <p paraeid=\"{7d11dbda-b945-4fd8-8cf9-7bba561c7b5e}{96}\" paraid=\"1731835376\">If you are unable to attend one of these tours you, can see the former White Bluffs community from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-bluffs-overlook.htm\">White Bluffs Overlook</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school-overlook.htm\">Hanford High School Overlook </a>from the White Bluffs trail on the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/hanfordreach/\">Hanford Reach National Monument. </a>  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Rising 800 feet and spanning 600 acres, Steamboat Rock will impress the most seasoned of travelers.</p> <p>Carved by Ice Age Floods into a dramatic, lake-dotted canyon, Steamboat Rock State Park’s landscape dates back at least 13,000 years. Known as \"scabland,\" the area appears barren, but it is teeming with shy (and not-so-shy) wildlife, spring flowers and sagebrush.</p> <p>The hike up the columnar basalt butte (a 650-foot vertical gain) is a must for anyone who is able. Atop Steamboat Rock, the trail meanders over flat ground to viewpoints of the Grand Coulee and the craggy peaks of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Below the rock, the lake reflects big desert skies.</p> <p>Do you prefer water to trail? The park features 320 feet of dock and seven watercraft launches on Banks Lake. Anglers, swimmers, paddlers and water sports fans will find respite on a hot summer day. Mountain bikers and equestrians can take off on the trails of Northrup Canyon, and the Grand Coulee Dam makes an interesting side trip.</p> <p>After a day of discovery, your tent, RV or cabin site will be a welcoming place to watch the evening glow. By the end of your stay, you will not only be impressed, but will likely be so sun-warmed and rested, you won’t want to leave.</p> <p><strong>PARK FEATURES</strong> Steamboat Rock State Park is a 5,043-acre camping park with 50,000 feet of freshwater shoreline at the north end of Banks Lake and a columnar, basaltic rock with a surface area of 600 acres. Three campground areas and a large day-use area are protected from winds by tall poplars.</p> <p><strong>Discover Pass:</strong> A Discover Pass is required for vehicle access to state parks for day use. For more information about the Discover Pass and exemptions, please visit the <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/167/Discover-Pass-Fees\">Discover Pass web page.</a></p> <p><strong>Automated pay stations:</strong> This park is equipped with automated pay stations for visitors to purchase a one-day or annual Discover Pass and boat launch permit.</p>",

Nothing beats the boat launch and social atmosphere of Park Lake, and shimmering Deep Lake presents a remote paddling and kayaking experience. The lure of Dry Falls Lake entices anglers to cast out for trout. Hiking trails wind through the scented, sage-dotted hills to table-top cliffs with panoramic views. The park even offers nine-hole and miniature golf for visitors who equate a desert vacation with a good game on the green.<br /> <br /> Hours of operation can be found at the <a href=\"https://parks.wa.gov/dry-falls-visitor-center\">Dry Falls Visitor Center webpage</a>.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>At the time of one of the first floods to be released from Glacial Lake Missoula, the Okanogan Lobe of the continental ice sheet had spread across the Columbia Valley and onto the Columbia Plateau to a position about 24 kilometers (14 miles) north of the site and so had caused the diversion of the glacial Columbia River into the former channel of Moses Coulee. When the outburst flood occurred, violently erosive torrents rushing down the Columbia River drainage were diverted into the Moses Coulee channel, causing in a single flood event the formation of a long, deep coulee second only to the Grand Coulee in size (see Grand Coulee NNL). Powerful eddies in the turbulent waters formed behind protrusions in the coulee walls along the inside of channel meanders (i.e. especially Armour Draw and the draw 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) north of Armour) and further enlarged the embayments behind those protrusions. As the sediment-laden flood currents waned, a 61 meter (200 feet) sheet of gravel was deposited along the coulee floor and a giant teardrop-shaped gravel bar, the so-called “Great Gravel Bar”, formed where flow velocities were lower behind one such prominent bedrock protrusion in the coulee wall.<br /> <br /> Although many other flood-related bars occur throughout the Channeled Scabland, the Great Gravel Bar is 5.2 kilometers (3.2 miles) long and as much as 74 meters (240 feet) high and so is <span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">perhaps the largest of all. It is known as a “pendant” bar because of its teardrop shape and sheltered position in the coulee which is about 180 meters (590 feet) deep and 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) wide at that location. The bar is composed mainly of pebble-cobble gravel and many large boulders occur on its surface. Most boulders are basaltic, derived from erosion of the coulee walls farther upstream, but a few granitic and other non-basaltic boulders probably were ice- rafted from afar on giant bergs caught in the flood before deposition in the coulee. One feature providing convincing evidence for the bar’s constructional formation is an elongate depression about I kilometer (0.6 mile) long on the bar’s west side, caused by eddy circulation in the water- filled coulee during deposition of the bar.<br /> <br /> After the flood the ice sheet advanced another 17 kilometers (10 miles) to its southern-most limit at the head of Moses Coulee. Meltwater streams coursing across the flood gravels in the coulee superimposed an outwash channel network still visible along the valley floor. Since retreat of the glacier, the site has been little modified even by the intermittent stream now occupying the coulee. Alluvial fans built by tributary streams and talus derived from extensive rockfall now lie along the base of the coulee walls. In addition, patchy deposits of wind-deposited silt and volcanic ash (i.e. primarily from the Glacier Peak and Mazama eruptions 12,000 and 6,600 years ago respectively) cover portion of the bar and coulee floor.</span></p>",

The museum takes its name from Hanford Reach, the longest free flowing (undammed), non-tidal section of the Columbia River.

Manhattan Project officials removed pre-war agricultural operations and prohibited further development. This formed a large security buffer surrounding the project and inadvertently preserved the shrub steppe ecosystem.

The Park is at the core of a campsite used by the Corps of Discovery from September 9 - 11, 1805 and again from June 30 - July 3, 1806. In the summer of 2002, archaeologists uncovered evidence of the Corps of Discovery's visit to the area, including a trench latrine tainted with mercury, fire hearths, and lead used in the repair and manufacture of firearms. The discovery makes Travelers' Rest the only campsite on the Lewis and Clark Trail with physical evidence of the expedition. For centuries Native Americans also used the area as a campsite and trail junction. Salish, Pend d'Oreille and Nez Perce peoples were among those who traditionally occupied the area. Native American storytellers bring their history, culture and society to life as part of the programming at Travelers' Rest State Park.With Lolo Creek running through the park, Travelers' Rest is an idyllic spot for strolling the park's trails, and offers a rich bird habitat, with more than 115 species recorded within the park boundaries. Be sure to stop at the Visitor's Center and Museum for a fascinating look at Lewis & Clark Expedition replicas, Salish culture, Native American hand crafts, a frontier Main Street, and more. The park also has a pavilion available for rent. Contact the park to make a reservation.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Tualatin Public Library, located just off Interstate 5 in Tualatin, Oregon, is home to a display of Ice Age megafauna. The Library features a striking display of an articulated partial mastodon skeleton, which was discovered in Tualatin less than a mile away. In partnership with the Tualatin Historical Society, the Library also has a display of Ice Age fossils including the sacrum of a giant ground sloth, mammoth bones, and bones from other animals; small erratics; and replicas of an ancient bison skull, mastodon tooth, and mastodon tusk. Located adjacent to the Library is Tualatin River Greenway Trail, which features a geologic timeline incorporating the Ice Age Floods, plus erratics, fossil replicas, and interpretive signage.   <br /> <br /> A unique highlight of the Tualatin Public Library is its striking display of an articulated mastodon skeleton, which is mounted in front of an etched-glass image of a mastodon.</p> <p>The mastodon skeleton was unearthed in Tualatin near the Library in 1962 by two Portland State University students. John George grew up in Tualatin and remembered the town marshal telling about some enormous bones that he had seen in the swamp near Nyberg Creek (just south of the current Fred Meyer store parking lot). Along with Ron and George Sund, George spent a a month excavating the bones, recovering nearly half of a skeleton. </p> <p>The bones were originally displayed at Portland State University before being given to then Tualatin City Manager Yvonne Addington in the 1970s. After several years in storage (first in Tualatin, then at the Portland Zoo), the <a href=\"http://www.tualatinhistoricalsociety.org/\">Tualatin Historical Society</a> and community members raised funds to have the bones cleaned and restored, and the skeleton was put on display within the Library. The current display was created as part of the Library's renovation and expansion in 2008.  </p> <p>The skeleton was carbon-dated and determined to have died about 14,000 years ago. Scientists estimate this mastodon was a female who died in her 20s.</p> <p>Tualatin has been named as a partner on the <a href=\"https://www.tualatinoregon.gov/community/tualatin-named-ice-age-floods-trail-partner\">Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail</a>. In partnership with the Tualatin Historical Society, the Library also currently displays several other Ice Age relics. An interactive display in the Children's Room offers the Library's young visitors a hands-on opportunity to learn more about these massive creatures that once roamed in Tualatin. </p>",

    "bodyText": "The Horse Heaven Hills are the southern border of the Central Basin area of the Columbia Basin and the Wallula Gap is the opening through which all of the Columbia and Snake River waters escape the basin. Wallula Gap is the largest, the most spectacular, and the most significant of the several large water gaps through basalt anticlines in the Columbia Basin. During the Pliocene and early Pleistocene the thick basalt flows of what is now southern Washington were wrinkled and uplifted into a long northeast-southwest trending anticlinal ridge which we call the Horse Heaven Hills. The uplift of this structure was more rapid than the ability of the ancestral Columbia River to downcut, thus a great lake, Lake Lewis, was impounded in the Pasco Basin area. The remains of the lake beds formed in this lake are the Ringold Formation. Once Lake Lewis was filled to overflowing, it established an outlet over the lowest saddle in the ridge at the location of Wallula Gap. The Columbia then poured down the steep south flank of the Horse Heaven Hills anticline in cascades and waterfalls which eroded slowly downward and headward until the ridge was completely breached. Wallula Gap was formed and the waters of Lake Lewis, along with considerable quantities of the Ringold sediments, drained down the Columbia Gorge into the sea. During the late Pleistocene the greatly increased meltwaters from the ice sheets and Cascade glaciers caused floods, perhaps annually; this encountered the constriction of Wallula Gap. Also, the gap was possibly dammed by jammed icebergs and ice cakes, causing the temporary and intermittent rebirth of Lake Lewis. This ephemeral lake left bottom deposits called the Touchet Beds. These giant floods filled the basin with a great temporary lake, which rapidly drained out through Wallula Gap. At the height of the Ice Age Floods the water flow through Wallula Gap has been estimated at 166 cubic kilometers (40 cubic miles) per day, a rate nearly twice the combined flow of all the present rivers on earth.",

The trading and fishing spot for Native Americans, the end of the Oregon Trail for the pioneers, and in 1889 the first long distance transmission of electrical power.<br /> <br /> The 42-foot-high and 1,500-foot-wide falls occurs 26 river miles upstream from the Willamette's confluence with the Columbia River.<br /> <br /> High on the bluffs above Willamette Falls are scablands eroded by the Ice Age Floods: Camassia Nature Preserve on the West Linn side and Canemah Bluff Nature Park on the Oregon City side. These scablands offer nature walks where you can enjoy the unique ecology of the area.<br /> <br /> Imagine Ice Age Floodwaters several dozen feet above head, carving out and receding the falls!<br /> <br /> Viewpoints for the Willamette Falls are located along Highway 99E just south of downtown Oregon City and Interstate 205 (milepost 7.5), again south of the city. The 99E viewpoint offers closer looks at the falls, but the 205 viewpoint is higher up, so you can see more of the surrounding bluffs and scenery.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Willamette Floodplain represents the mix of bottomland grasslands once common throughout the interior valleys of western Oregon and Washington. It is a large remnant example of largely unplowed native grassland and ash woodland. The bottomland grasslands include the largest remnants in the North Pacific Border Region. These grasslands include both the full range of bottomland communities and the large diversity of endemic species primarily restricted to these habitats. The grassland communities include a fairly complex matrix of tufted-hairgrass bottomland prairie (Deschampsia caespitosa valley prairie), sedge-meadow barley bottomland grassland (Carex unilateralis – Hordeum branchyantherum bottomland grassland), and hawthorn- rose bottomland shrubland (Crataegus douglasii – Rosa nutkana bottomland shrubland), all of which are well represented at the site in areas with pluvial clay or silty clay soils. In the better drained areas, where alluvial silt loams occur, a matrix of tufted-hairgrass valley prairie and red fescue valley prairie (Danthonia californica – Festuca rubra valley grassland) is found. In the very wet area along Muddy Creek are large and significant examples of Oregon ash bottomland forests (Fraxinus latifolia/Carex obnupta and Fraxinus latifolia/Symphoricarpos albus). All of these grassland and shrubland communities have become increasingly rare as most of the bottomland areas in the interior valleys have been converted to farmland and to pasture.<br /> <br /> In the bottomland grassland are found five vascular plant species listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as candidate threatened or endangered species. The site also has populations of some threatened and endangered animal species. The area has occurrences of two threatened animals of concern to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Muddy Creek has populations of the Oregon chub (Hybopsis crameri), a candidate species endemic to the Willamette and Umpqua River systems. The site has wintering populations of Lewis’ woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis) and breeding western pond turtles (Clemmys marmorata), both of which are considered threatened in Oregon but more common elsewhere.<br /> The site is located on essentially flat topography typical of the floor of the Willamette Valley. It is on the Calapooyia geomorphic surface, characterized by the absence of appreciable local relief. Elevation ranges from about 270 to 290 feet (82 to 88 meters). Gentle swales and ridges, which are most easily distinguished on aerial photographs, provide the only variation. Muddy Creek, a small, turbid, meandering, valley-bottom stream with associated ash forests, flows along the eastern edge of the area.</p>",

During the summer this launch can be very crowded with tubers coming off the river and trailered boats. Please be considerate of other users by moving your equipment off the launch area as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Water Quality</h4> <p>Be sure to check the <a href=\"https://www2.usgs.gov/water/southatlantic/ga/bacteria/\">Current Estimated E. coli count</a> before starting your trip. If the count at Medlock Bridge is greater than 235 you have an increased risk of getting sick. Contact with the river is NOT recommended.</p> <h4>Water Release Schedule</h4> <p>Water conditions on the Chattahoochee River are influenced on a daily basis by water releases from Buford Dam. The water release schedule can be obtained by calling <strong>(770) 945-1466</strong>, or toll free <strong>1-855-DAM-FLOW (1-855-326-3569)</strong>, or visit their <a href=\"http://spatialdata.sam.usace.army.mil/hydropower/default.aspx\"><strong>Hydropower Generating Schedule</strong></a> website. Besides showing the time for scheduled releases it also shows how many turbines will be operating and the current flow in cubic feet per second (cfs). It takes approximately 3 hours and 15 minutes to 4 hours and 30 minutes for water released from Buford Dam to begin rising at Abbotts Bridge.</p> <h4>River Flow Rates</h4> <p>Water conditions on the Chattahoochee River are also influenced by the weather upstream of Abbotts Bridge. Regardless of whether the water is coming from a dam release or inclement weather upstream check the <a href=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/02334653/#parameterCode=00060\">discharge/flow rate</a> at the gaging station 0.76 miles upstream of McGinnis Ferry, Suwanee, GA. </p> <ul> <li>If Canoeing, Kayaking, or Stand Up Paddleboarding and the flow rate is over 4,000 cfs, <strong>cancel your trip</strong>. </li> <li>If Rafting and the flow rate is over 5,000 cfs, <strong>cancel your trip</strong>.</li> <li>If Tubing and the flow is over 2,500 cfs, <strong>cancel your trip</strong>.</li> </ul> <h4>Try These Floating Options</h4> <ul> <li>Lower Pool Park to <strong>Abbotts Bridge</strong>: 12.8 miles</li> <li>Settles Bridge (<i>no trailer access</i>) to <strong>Abbotts Bridge</strong>: 8.63 miles</li> <li>McGinnis Ferry to <strong>Abbotts Bridge</strong>: 4.5 miles</li> <li>Rogers Bridge Park <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>(Temporarily Closed)</strong></span> to <strong>Abbotts Bridge</strong>: 2.6 miles</li> <li><strong>Abbotts Bridge</strong> to Medlock Bridge: 4.5 miles</li> <li><strong>Abbotts Bridge</strong> to Jones Bridge Canoe & Raft (<i>no trailer access</i>): 6.6 miles</li> <li><strong>Abbotts Bridge</strong> to Jones Bridge Boat: 6.9 miles</li> <li><strong>Abbotts Bridge</strong> to Garrard Landing Park (<i>no trailer access</i>): 9.9 miles</li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Located on the northwest bank of the Chattahoochee River and near Johnson Ferry lies Hyde Farm. Originally known as Cherokee Indian territory, Hyde Farm was settled by James Cooper Power in the 1830s. Other American Indian villages were located just upstream from the farm, but those villagers were forced to leave as well during the Trail of Tears. The original log cabin still exists within the Hyde farmhouse. This is the land that eventually became Hyde Farm. However, farmers borrowed American Indian farming traditions to grow their crops which included such things as sweet potatoes, pumpkins, squash, and beans.</p> <p>James Cooper Power was the son of Joseph and Isabella Power. Joseph and Isabella had four children: Mary Elizabeth, James Cooper, George Abner, and Pinkney Joesph. The Power children all got married and decided to establish farms near their parents along what is now Hyde Road. During this time small family farms predominated the piedmont areas; nuclear families worked the land; housing ranged from crude log cabins to substantial frame, brick, or stone houses; farm families manufactured many necessities. The Power family, including children, worked on the farm tirelessly until 1874.</p> <p>Beginning in 1874 during cotton-picking time, James Cooper Power sharecropped with James Alexander Hyde, a Civil War Confederate veteran moving from South Carolina to Alabama. (During this time many people travelled by foot and stayed in various cities contracted to sharecrop along their journey.) Hyde and his family moved to the Mt. Bethel community east of Cobb County where they had four children, one of which was Jesse Clifford Hyde (who was born just 2 miles from the Power cabin in 1881). James Hyde and Jim” Power’s relationship, though based on work but founded on friendship, was a unique and wholesome commitment to each other. It was a connection and collaboration that grew and flourished over the next 25 years.</p> <p>The South had been devastated by the Civil War; planters had ample land but little money for wages or taxes. The solution was to use the sharecropping system that focused on families working together to farm, which generated cash for the croppers, landowners, merchants and the tax collector. Poor white farmers, who previously had done little farming, needed cash as well and became sharecroppers. In essence, the sharecropper “rented” the land that he/she farmed and gave a portion of his crop back to the landowner as payment.</p> <p>James Power died in 1901 and the Hyde’s continued to work on the farm thereafter. James Hyde’s son, Jesse, was one of the farmers and a construction worker as well. After the bank foreclosed on the property, Jesse was able to obtain the title of the Powers homestead (Hyde Farm) in 1920, which encompassed 135 acres of land. Jesse and his family then moved to the farm from Paulding County. Jesse and his wife, Lela, raised six children; Buck, J.C., Maglee, Gladys, and Rosalee at the farm. Up until his death in 1972, Jesse Hyde continued his father’s work tending to the farm. Leaving the farm to his bachelor sons, J.C. and Buck sustained the up-keep of the farm with traditional methods; using tools like the mule-drawn plows for power, crude wooden plows, all sowing by hand, cultivating by hoe. As east Cobb County developed and suburbanized in the mid-1960, the Hyde brothers began selling fresh vegetables and other produce items off the back of their truck, in the parking lot of Bethel Methodist Church at the intersection of Power’s Ferry and Lower Roswell Roads. Overtime Buck and J.C. Hyde became very famous for their fresh vegetables.</p> <p>Buck Hyde died in 1991. Inheritance taxes forced J.C. Hyde to sell 40 acres of the farm’s bottom land the next year, but he negotiated with the Trust for Public Land to insure that 95 acres of the property would be become part of the Chattahoochee River National Service Area. Currently, Hyde Farm is a total of 135 acres; 95 acres is jointly owned and managed by the National Park Service and Cobb County, the other 40 acres continues to be property of the Trust for Public Land. The 135 acres of land consists of forest, fields, and several streams. The buildings of the farm were built from circa 1830 to 1950. Hyde Farm is in an important area of the Chattahoochee watershed (Mulberry Creek) which provides drinking water for the City of Atlanta and surrounding areas. Developing this land could seriously affect the quality of the water in the Chattahoochee. Hyde Farm has acres of and provides wildlife habitat to fox, coyote, deer, songbirds, beaver, and other species whose habitat has been destroyed by development.</p> <p>Hyde Farm landscape is characterized by sloping terrain with cultivated fields along the plateau southwest and north of the house. There are nine outbuildings connected with the house; the barn, corncrib, machine shop/garage, gear house, shuck shed, two chicken houses, and the well house. Hyde Farm is potentially eligible to the National Register because it is a well preserved foundational display of small farms established in the late 19th and early 20th century.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Nestled in the woods, on the banks of Sope Creek, are stone walls that serve as a reminder of a not to distant past. Once the largest paper mill in the state, if its ruins could speak they would tell us about life in the second half of the 19th. Century.</p> <h2>Early Years</h2> <p>Construction on the Marietta Paper Mill began in 1853 and production began two years later in 1855. The Paper Mill included a mill, oil room, mill sluice (raceway), storeroom, dam, machine shop, pulp-grinding mill and two shelters. The Marietta Paper Mill was known as a “rag mill.” This was due to the paper being made from linen rags and old cotton. The abundance of water from Sope Creek and a dam upstream made the paper making process successful at the mill. The job of the mill was to make and provide paper to most of the south from 1855 to 1902. Initially the mill produced writing paper, printing paper, tissue paper, and wrapping paper.</p> <h2>Civil War Years</h2> <p>At the time of the Civil War, the Marietta Paper Mill was the largest in the state. During the war years the mill manufactured cartridge paper used in Confederate guns. The mill was even rumored to have printed Confederate money and bonds therefore nicknaming it the “Confederate Mint.” However, those claims have never been substantiated. This made it a target of destruction during Sherman’s Atlanta Campaign. General William Tecumseh Sherman devised a plan to burn everything that would help the South and prolong its fighting in the Civil War. Union soldiers, led by General Gerrard, burned the mill. There are conflicting reports whether the mill was burned on July 5 or July 6, 1864 by the Union Army.</p> <h2>Post War Years</h2> <p>After the Civil War, the paper mill was rebuilt and back in operation by September 1868. However, on the morning of November 7, 1870, a mill worker accidentally caused a fire which partially destroyed the factory. They rebuilt the damaged part of the mill and four months later they were once again producing paper. The mill struggled financially for a while and then went bankrupt.</p> <p>The mill was sold at public auction and renamed the Marietta Paper Manufacturing Company. The Marietta Paper Manufacturing Company was successful due to two new innovations:</p> <ul> <li>using the abundant pine trees for pulp</li> <li>converting to the production of twine.</li> </ul> <p>These innovations, implemented by Jefferson Land, helped the mill financially for many years. But due to another fire at the mill, increased competition, being in a remote location and not being close enough to a railroad, the mill was losing money. The mill was finally closed in 1902.</p> <h2>Today</h2> <p>The ruins, although deteriorating are not forgotten, remain a tourist attraction due to their beauty and and as a reminder of the past. They are listed on the National Register and it is now the responsibility of the National Parks Service to balance the preservation of the ruins while sharing their beauty.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "While standing on the the bridge over Sope Creek and looking down stream the mill ruins of two foot thick stone walls with large window openings is visible to your right. Between the mill ruins and the creek is the stone lined raceway where the water flowed to turn the water wheel that would have provided power to the mill. To your left is the beginning of the old roadway to the main mill complex. As you walk down the road as you look over the edge of the road you will see remnants of the stone retaining wall. After walking 200 feet you will come to the ruins of the oil house which consist of 3 walls, 20 feet in height. Continuing down the roadway stone piers that held the flume providing the water to the mill become apparent.",

    "bodyText": "<p>By 1900, Atlanta had emerged as a prominent “New South” city. A post-Civil War period economic revival, which included the rebuilding of prosperous railroad lines, led to significant population growth. Important businessmen of Atlanta began to consider hydroelectric power to provide electricity to the growing population and to promote Georgia’s reputation as an economically viable state. The newly-formed Atlanta Water and Electric Power Company began construction on a massive hydroelectric dam in 1902 with Morgan Smith as the primary investor.</p> <p>The dam, which provided the city’s first source of water-generated electricity, was built on a section of the Chattahoochee River now a reservoir known as Bull Sluice Lake in Sandy Springs, Georgia.  Bull Sluice Lake can be viewed from the Gold Branch unit of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. Completed in 1904, the dam was 1,031 feet long and 56 feet high. Morgan Smith did not live to see the project he had funded completed, but the board of directors of the Atlanta Water and Electric Company named the Morgan Falls Dam facility in his honor. Eventually Morgan Falls Dam became part of the Georgia Power Company. The original generators, though refurbished, are still being used to power metro Atlanta today.</p> <p>The 1957 construction of Buford Dam greatly altered Morgan Falls Dam. In 1959, sixteen spillway gates were added to the Morgan Falls dam to raise the level of Bull Sluice Lake another six feet and increase the reservoir’s capacity. Other work at Morgan Falls included reinforcing the concrete walls of the dam and overhauling or replacing the old turbines. In 1964 and 1965, the powerhouse was upgraded. When Morgan Falls Dam was first built, its production capacity was 10,500 kilowatts of power.  At present, the dam produces 16,800 kilowatts of power.</p> <p>Although Morgan Falls Dam provides a small portion of power for the residents of Georgia today, it provides numerous benefits to the surrounding area. Flood control, wildlife habitats, and recreational opportunities are among the benefits provided by the reservoir at Bull Sluice Lake. The Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area manages the waters of Bull Sluice Lake and its surrounding trail system (Gold Branch Unit). City parks run by Roswell and Sandy Springs also provide river access points for kayakers and canoeists to enjoy on-river views of Morgan Falls Dam and Bull Sluice Lake.</p>",

In the late 19th century, steel truss bridges began replacing fords and ferries as a means to cross the Chattahoochee. The wooden deck that once spanned the bridge is now completely gone, but the steel frame remains as an impressive testament to the history of the river.</p> <p>After admiring the bridge, feel free to hike along the forested river trails, or hop in a boat for a quiet day fishing or floating.</p> <p><b>NOTE: The bridge is unsafe to climb so please enjoy with your eyes and camera only.</b></p>",

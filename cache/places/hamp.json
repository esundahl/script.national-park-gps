Ashes would be collected from fireplaces and smoke houses and stored in the Ash House to be gathered, placed in water and soaked, usually for three days, and then turned into lye. Lye, mixed with animal fats, was used to make soap, candles, and lime for fertilizer. The soap might be used to wash people or clothing.<br /> <br /> A second Ash House can be seen in late 19th century photos behind the Lower House, just south of the Slave Quarters.

    "bodyText": "<p>The cluster of white buildings next to the house served as support structures for the mansion. Their roles were as follows:</p>   <h3>Pump House</h3> <p>The Pump House was built between 1890 and 1898 about halfway between the privies and the Mansion. It was a single-story structure with fish-scale wooden shingled walls. It housed the gravity-fed pump and associated equipment needed to move water from the east side springs to Hampton Mansion.</p> <h3>Garage</h3> <p>Constructed for Helen West Stewart Ridgely’s use in 1910 to the east of Hampton Mansion, this building forms the northern side of the Domestic Service Cluster and was likely the first building at Hampton designed to accommodate an automobile.</p> <h3>Coal Gas Storage ruin</h3> <p>The Ridgelys constructed the Coal Gas Storage structure in 1856–57 to store coal gas used to illuminate the Mansion. Prior to its current location, the Coal Gas Storage structure stood in the historic location of the Octagon Building. Oral history suggests that it was moved further from the Mansion because Eliza Ridgely was concerned about the potential of explosion so close to the house. The structure remained in use until 1929 and subsequently collapsed in 1949.</p> <h3>Smoke House</h3> <p>Smoke houses were an essential support structure in the domestic landscape during Hampton’s historic period. They were used to cure fish or meats, and sometimes to store food. The Ridgelys built the Hampton Smoke House east of the Mansion, in the Domestic Service Cluster, in the first half of the nineteenth century. The single-story structure included weatherboard siding and a single room inside. By the twentieth century, the Smoke House functioned as a residence for servants at Hampton.</p> <h3>Paint House</h3> <p>The Paint House, located east of the Mansion in the Domestic Service Cluster, was built around 1800. The structure served a variety of uses during the historic period, presumably including paint storage. In the early twentieth century, it was used to store carriages.</p> <h3>Privies</h3> <p>Privy #1 was built before 1843 as a single-story wooden structure with four holes in the interior, and a vertical partition separating the two middle holes. Privy #2 was built after 1843, likely between 1879 and 1899, and was originally a single-story, four-hole privy built of wood. The privies were likely used until the installation of the Mansion’s bathrooms in the 1850s.</p>",

These stone structures are sturdier and larger than quarters on most other plantations of the time. They were built as duplex units with a central interior wall, so it is likely that a family lived in the two rooms on each side.<br /> <br /> Family life for many of the enslaved centered around the Enslavement Quarters. It was here that families ate meals of salted pork, beef, corn meal and fish. These meals may have been supplemented by fresh vegetables grown in small gardens behind the quarters. Stories, told by the fireside, might recall ancient African traditions. In these buildings, enslaved families could enjoy a limited amount of privacy and could speak freely, away from the watchful eyes of the overseer or the Ridgely family.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In 1859, noted horticulturist Henry Winthrop Sargent wrote that “it has been truly said of Hampton that it expresses more grandeur than any other place in America.” Having visited Hampton gardens at their most extensive and with their greatest variety, Sargent expressed a truly unique landscape in its day. Hampton’s gardens today are a living collection that tells several stories. Though intended for the enjoyment of the Ridgely family, Hampton’s garden landscape was originally designed by Daniel Healy, an Irish-born gardener and indentured servant whose indenture was transferred to Captain Charles Ridgely in November 1784. Familiar with European landscape practices of the period such as those outlined in John James’s The Theory and Practice of Gardening (1712), Healy supervised the creation of the 240-foot by 480-foot Great Terrace and the 80- by 50-foot rectangular parterres of the Falling Gardens of Hampton. The dimensions of Healy’s gardens echo the dimensions of the main block of Hampton Hall, and with its clean lines and balanced use of space, the gardens reflect the same aesthetic qualities of the mansion architecture. Creating the dramatic overlook from the terrace required laborers to carve out of the hillside an 18-foot drop off with turf ramps connecting the six parterres with the terrace. The backbreaking work of crafting the landscape fell to enslaved African Americans and indentured servants.<br /> <br /> Over time and generations, Hampton’s landscape evolved from a traditional English garden to a new American landscape featuring a variety of specimen trees and a combination of exotic and native species. In 1810, designer William Booth laid out an early version of the geometric gardens called parterres. By the mid-nineteenth century Eliza Ridgely—an avid horticulturist—introduced the Victorian “carpet bedding” including exotic varieties and fashionable marble urns. Each generation left its imprint on the landscape and the changing nature of the gardens reflected changes in landscape management styles and the resources available to the Ridgely family to maintain such lavish gardens.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Set atop the hill at the center of the park is Hampton Hall. As Captain Charles Ridgely&#’;s expanded, he chose to establish a new seasonal retreat on the property. Construction of the five-part Georgian style mansion began in 1783 under the oversight of builder and master carpenter Northampton Howell (died 1787). Local craftsmen, enslaved African-Americans, and indentured servants labored to complete the massive undertaking. At its completion in 1790, with 24,000 square feet and 31 rooms, Hampton Hall was believed to be the largest private home in country, and currently the mansion stands as one of the best surviving examples of Georgian architecture in the United States.<br /> <br /> The architecture of the mansion and landscape design are characterized by proportion, balance, and symmetry, and were intended to recreate a traditional European villa with an English aesthetic. Hampton Hall’s relationship to the space and structures around it illustrates a sharp contrast in the history and culture of the surrounding landscape. Domestic service buildings surround the mansion to support the Jehu family's lifestyle. Formal gardens, designed for leisure and recreation adorned the south side of the estate, while fields of hay, corn, and other crops were planted for profit and tended and harvested through the work of enslaved African Americans and indentured servants on the north side. By design, all these activities fall within site of the cupola of Hampton Hall and its owners, and the siting of the mansion clearly illustrates social hierarchy and relative status of those occupying the highlands and lowlands of Hampton.<br /> <br /> The interior of the mansion is accessible by guided tour only, or virtually on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hamp/learn/photosmultimedia/virtualtour.htm\">park website</a>.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Most people today know Hampton as a sedate Georgian mansion, elegantly furnished and settled amid gardens and shade trees. Built as a country seat just after the Revolutionary War by the prominent Ridgely family of Maryland, the house and its immediate surroundings are just a remnant of the Hampton estate of the early 1800s.<br /> <br /> In its heyday, Ridgely property equaled half the area of present-day Baltimore, land that made its owners rich through iron production, agriculture, and investments. Hampton is the story of a family business, early American industry, and commerce, the cultural tastes of the times, the deprivations of war, and the economic and moral changes that finally made this kind of life obsolete.<br /> <br /> Needing labor in abundance, the Ridgely family employed many types of workers. In just the last fifty years of the eighteenth century they bought over 300 indentured servants. They also employed free workers, British prisoners of war, and enslaved African Americans. Slavery was part of the Hampton estate for over 100 years, ending only when Maryland State law ended the institution in 1864. Its presence predated the construction of the mansion and over its history over 700 enslaved people would come through the Hampton plantation. Enslaved people were instrumental in building the mansion, and their work supported the gracious lifestyle of the Ridgelys in the mansion.<br /> <br /> Slavery at Hampton was unusual for two reasons. First, the Ridgelys main product from this labor was the harvesting and production of iron from their Northampton ironworks, unlike most of the agricultural South. Second, Hampton is very close to the free state of Pennsylvania and the city of Baltimore with its huge population of free African Americans. Refuges for freedom seekers were close by. Hampton is the site of one of the largest manumissions in history when the second owner of Hampton died with nearly 350 enslaved people on the Hampton plantation. In his will he manumitted females between the ages of 25 and 45 and males between the ages 28 and 45. This is one of the largest manumissions in the history of Maryland, but it did not end slavery at Hampton. His son, John Ridgely, purchased some sixty or so more slaves and manumitted only one.</p> <h4>War of 1812 History</h4> <p>Hampton’s Northampton Iron Furnace, approximately a mile north of the current park location, played a significant role in the War of 1812. Enslaved African Americans, the foundry's primary workforce, produced iron, cannons, shot and camp equipment for the war effort. Charles Carnan Ridgely, ironmaster and owner of the estate, also contributed funds and other supplies for Baltimore’s defense in 1814.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded work to restore and stabilize farm buildings at Hampton in 1999. </em></p>",
    "audioDescription": "The 64-acre property features a mansion, farmhouse, quarters for the enslaved, dairy, and ash house. The mansion is a large three-story stone mansion with two wings on either side of it, porches on the front and back, and a cupola on top. The front of the house faces down towards the farm side of the park with a large gravel driveway in front of it. The back of the house faces large decorative gardens that go down to the edge of the property. A two story white wooden house. The house has a front porch and multiple additions on it. On top of the house is a wooden bell cupola. A white wooden picket fence surrounds the yard around the house. The two standing slave quarter buildings are made of stone with wooden roofs. The buildings at two stories tall. They sit perpendicular to one another and each building has two units that families would live in. The first slave quarters building has exhibits about the enslaved people of Hampton, the second contains information on tenant farmers that worked the farms after slavery was over. The dairy is a one story white structure that is built below ground level. A set of stone stairs lead down to the base of the structure which is made of bricks. behind the structure a small opening where spring water comes from underground can be seen. Entering the structure the water runs around the edges of the building with a large elevated floor above the water line in the center. The ash house is a small stone structure located between the log house and the stone slave quarters. The structure is hollowed out and the area where a small door would be shows what the inside of the structure looks like.",

    "bodyText": "<p>This subterranean ice house was built between 1783 and 1790 to the northwest of the Mansion. Constructed with rubble stone with a brick dome roof covered with earth, the Hampton Ice House was designed and built to last for generations. It was larger and deeper than typical commercial ice pits during the historic period. The underground space was cylindrical and tapered towards the bottom. On the north side of the structure, a short passage opened up to the space below for loading ice. On the south side of the structure, a wider, tunneled passage with steps provided access for ice retrieval.<br /> <br /> For years, every winter enslaved people would go out to ponds to cut up large cubes of ice and stack inside this structure seperating each piece with hay. With the storage being below ground and covered by both stone and earth, the ice created a natural refrigeration that would allow ice to be stored far into the summer. When entering the icehouse, visitors should use caution due to narrow steps and low visibility. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Built in the eighteenth century, the Lower House is the oldest extant building on the Hampton property. During the second half of the eighteenth century, the house served as a temporary residence while the Ridgelys were visiting their iron works and later during construction of the Mansion. Around 1745, the original one-story structure was built. Later, it was expanded to include a three-bay-long addition to the north. Later in the eighteenth century, the older portion of the house was moved approximately 10’ south, and a single-story link was built between the two portions. Renovations to the interior of the house were made in the second half of the eighteenth century (circa 1780), possibly to prepare the residence for Captain Charles Ridgely while the Mansion was under construction.<br /> <br /> In 1840, the Lower House was expanded to include a three-bay east wing, and porches were built on the east and south façades of the wing. Other alterations to the Lower House during the 1800s include the addition of the west porch, expansion of the kitchen in the 1800s, and replacement of the link by 1900. Alterations in the twentieth century include installation of electricity and plumbing, and the removal of the west porch.<br /> <br /> The Lower House housed the farm overseer throughout the majority of the nineteenth century, and the farm manager after the abolition of slavery in Maryland in 1864. During the 1900s, the Lower House was known as the Huntsman’s Lodge, and served house guests who attended foxhunting events at Hampton. From 1948 until 1980 when the farm property was acquired by the National Park Service, the Lower House was the residence of John Ridgely, Jr and Jane Rodney.<br /> <br /> The Farm House yard was fenced by 1745, likely to keep livestock at bay from the Farm House, which was, until 1783, the primary Ridgely residence at Hampton. The outlying farm landscape was once lined with fences and hedgerows that defined ‘quarters’ and fields. A portion of the West Farm Field remains and is planted annually by park staff with ryegrass, oats, or corn to evoke its historic agricultural character.</p>",

Each generation of Hampton’s owners, many of their children and spouses, as well as two close family friends, were buried in the Ridgely family cemetery. The headstones marking their graves were usually granite, and varied in architectural styles from Gothic to Celtic and provide insight into the people who lived at Hampton. Only two non-family members are buried in the Ridgely family cemetery: Nancy Davis, formerly enslaved by the Ridgelys and later a paid servant, and Selena Devlin, a paid servant of the Ridgelys.</p> <h2>Ridgely Family Vault</h2> <p>The Ridgelys built their Family Vault in the Egyptian Revival or Greek Revival style, likely between 1810 and 1820. Designed by Baltimore architect Robert Cary Long, Sr., it is believed to have been constructed near or over the graves of Captain Charles (d. 1790) and Rebecca Ridgely (d. 1812). Located at the southeast corner of the property, the vault consisted of three marble walls and one brick wall. A brick walkway surrounded the structure and another walkway, which led to the entrance on the north façade, is evident in historic photographs from the 1930s. Ornamental plantings flanked the walkway and entrance to the Vault. Inside, the structure opened up to a vaulted space holding thirty-two graves, with burials dating from 1814 to the twentieth century.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Hampton was famous for horses. For almost two hundred years, horses and equestrian activities played a major role on the Hampton estate. In the 1740s, Colonel Charles Ridgely served as a member of the newly founded Maryland Jockey Club and passed on his love of horses to his son. The Ridgely family began to breed and racehorses in the late 1700s, before the mansion was built.<br /> <br /> Later, as owners of some of the finest Thoroughbreds in America, the Ridgelys were in part responsible for Maryland’s reputation as the center of American racing in the early 19th century.The racing and breeding of Thoroughbred horses reached its height at Hampton under Governor Charles Carnan Ridgely, and stables began to be constructed to support this purpose.<br /> <br /> Stable #1 was a two-story, stone-walled building built in 1805 on the west side of Stable Drive. The exterior was finished with scored stucco to match the Mansion. The stable housed prized racing horses as well as stable hands and jockeys who worked with them. Stable #1 was remodeled in the mid-1800s to reorient the central hall from north/south to east/west. During this remodel, the tack room was converted to stalls, increasing the original five stalls to thirteen. Modeled after Stable #1, Stable #2 was constructed in 1857 but finished with exposed stone. The stable had pyramidal roofs topped with wooden cupolas. The interior of Stable #2 was divided into one open stall and several box stalls. Historically, both Stable #1 and Stable #2 housed horses on the first floor, and the second floor was used for hay storage.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The two stone stables buildings sit next to each other just off the gravel path. Both buildings are two stories tall with cupolas on top. The stables on the left are regularly open for visitors to step into. behind glass are various saddles and carriages used by the Ridgely's horse industry through out the years.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Dairy was built between 1780 and 1800, renovated between 1830 and 1840, and was in use until 1942. Built into a hill and low to the ground, with a roof that extends over the edge of the building to maintain cooler temperatures inside, it was designed to store milk and process butter. At the bottom of the stairs of the Dairy is a grotto built over a natural spring. Water from this spring runs inside the building and into a basin. Milk stored in tall stoneware jars sat in the basin to be cooled. Although a cool place during hot months, working the crank of a barrel churn was a monotonous task. Milking dozens of cows in the huge cattle barn once located past the Long House took workers most of the day.<br /> <br /> Ms. Croner describes her father's tasks as a dairyman in the early 20th century:<br />  </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>\"He took care of the cows...milked the cows and got milk ready in the morning to take out to this lady, Miss Pink German. He'd get up at four in the morning. He had to get the cows milked.\"</em></p> <p>While it was common during the days of tenant farming for the Dairy to be run by a dairyman, through over a century of slavery, enslaved women and paid female employees held the role of dairymaid, where their labor provided additional income for the Ridgelys. In 1822, for instance, the Hampton dairy produced 4,296 lbs of butter commercially sold, netting a profit of close to $1,800. The dairymaid in this period was Milly Sheridan, who worked as a paid employee at Hampton after being granted her freedom in Governor Ridgely's will in 1829.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The dairy is a one story white structure that is built below ground level. A set of stone stairs lead down to the base of the structure which is made of bricks. behind the structure a small opening where spring water comes from underground can be seen. Entering the structure the water runs around the edges of the building with a large elevated floor above the water line in the center.",
